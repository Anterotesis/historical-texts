            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Mission of the Holy Ghost
(which we this day commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate)
was the Final Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Completion of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
which perfected the Mystery of
the Redemption of Mankind; and at the

Our Saviour had indeed long before ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

to have founded a Church, till he poured
out the Holy Ghost upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:34506:5"/>
Till then their Notions of the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ's coming into the World
were dark and obscure, their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Nature and Constitution of
the Kingdom, to be founded by him, false
and frivolous; and as they certainly knew
not what form of Faith to profess; so
they dared not profess it openly. Their
religious Meetings were yet in secret;
and no Attempts yet made to form
a Church, by Conversion of Jews and
Gentiles. Their thoughts were not so
much fixed upon the remembrance of
what their Master had done and suffered,
as upon the Expectation of somewhat
more to be done by him; that is, upon
the hopes of the Comforter, which he
promised to them. They wanted yet
those Perfections of mind, which might
qualifie them for the Execution of their
designed Office; that Zeal and Charity
which might animate and direct all the
Members of the Church; that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Understanding, which might
fit them for Pastors and Teachers, in the
absence of their Master.</p>
            <p>All these Advantages were abundantly
conferr'd, these Necessities supplied by
the sending of the Holy Ghost, as upon
this day. Then they received internal
light, a full understanding of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34506:5"/>
of the Messias, a clear Knowledge
of all that had been delivered to them;
then they obtained Abilities to execute
the Office of Preaching, to which they
were designed; and Courage to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it. Then they began, as to possess
an assured and rational Belief of Christ,
so to profess and declare their Belief in
him. So that the Reception of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost was to them, what Baptism is
to us, an entrance into the Church of
Christ; according to what our Saviour
had foretold to them after his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
<hi>Ye shall be baptized with the Holy
Ghost not many days hence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These were the Advantages conferred
upon the Faithful, by the coming of the
Holy Ghost; but these were not all. The
chief design of his coming was to lay
the Foundations of propagating the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of Christ through the whole World,
and to offer the benefits of his Death and
Passion to all the Members of Mankind;
to assert the Divinity of Christ, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
the truth of his Doctrine, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the Honour of God, to convince
the World of their Obligation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in him, and to confound the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of his Adversaries. To this grand
Design, the aforementioned Gifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon the Apostles were subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient,


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34506:6"/>
being such as enabled them to
Preach the Word, and confirm the Truth
of it to all Nations under Heaven.</p>
            <p>The Publication of the Gospel had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been reserved, shut up in dark
Speeches and Parabolical Expressions;
confined to an Hundred and twenty Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which we read to have been the
number of them in the <hi>First</hi> of the <hi>Acts.</hi>
But from this day it was to be set in a
clear Light, communicated to all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
obscurity or reserve, and propagated
to all parts of the habitable World. The
Person of our Saviour Christ had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
appeared mean and contemptible;
no Signs or Tokens of his glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
were yet to be found; but now he
was to be rescued from that Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by visible and undeniable Effects of
Divine Power; his Kingdom was to
commence in the hearts of Men; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Glorious both from the Number
and Piety of his Followers.</p>
            <p>The Jews had without controul dared
to reject his Doctrine, vilifie his Person,
and put him to an ignominious Death;
but now they were to be convinced by
uncontestable Proofs from Heaven, that
his Person was more than Humane, his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
Divine, and themselves guilty of the
most Enormous wickedness <hi>in crucifying


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34506:6"/>
the Lord of Life.</hi> The Justice of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had suffered Aspersions, in not reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sufferings and rewarding the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of his Son: But now this was to
be cleared, and the Jews convinced; that
neither their Wickedness should pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished,
nor his Merits unrewarded.
The Devil had triumphed in his supposed
Conquest over Christ, and his imagination
of having baffled the Design of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of Mankind, by procuring the
Author of it to be put to Death; but his
arrogant Pretensions were henceforth to
be checked, his Hopes to be defeated, his
Empire to be dissolved. All these Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
were to flow from the Mission
of the Holy Ghost; and all these our
Lord sums up and Promises in the words
of my Text: <hi>And when he is come; he will
reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness,
and of judgment.</hi> In which words we
may enquire,
<list>
                  <item>I. In what Sense all these Effects and
Advantages, are to be ascribed to the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Holy Ghost.</item>
                  <item>II. How far these promised Effects
and Advantages of his Mission were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As to the First, the word reproving,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, which is used in the Text, in the
Original is taken from judicial Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34506:7"/>
and signifieth a Confutation of the
adverse Party, by such Proofs and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies,
as by an impartial Judge
should be allowed to be valid. The
Office therefore of the Holy Ghost was
to be the Paraclet, the Advocate of our
Saviour upon Earth, to plead his Cause,
to produce these Proofs, to urge and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them to the World. There were
indeed abundant Proofs before in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing; but Proofs are not
convictive, till laid open, declared and
proposed.</p>
            <p>This was the Office of the Holy Ghost,
in this he was to be the Advocate of our
Saviour; and this he performed by pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extraordinary Gifts upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
as on this day; which might enable
them with Power and Eloquence, with
Courage and Success, to propose those
Proofs, and <hi>convince the world of sin, of
righteousness, and of judgment.</hi> They
were to be the Instruments of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
this Conviction; not only by their
Gifts received, and Labours performed
as upon this day; but by all their Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
Sermons, and Preaching performed
in the whole Course of their Ministry.
All these Actions were equally directed
to the same end, the conviction of the
World; yet <hi>all</hi> in vertue of those Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34506:7"/>
which they received upon this
day.</p>
            <p>All their Gifts and Labours were sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
owing to his power, and derived from
his Grant; their Knowledge to <hi>his</hi> Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
their Courage and Constancy to <hi>his</hi>
Support, their Speaking to <hi>his</hi> Impulse,
their Miracles to <hi>his</hi> Power, their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to <hi>his</hi> Blessing. So that all which
they performed ought truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be ascribed to <hi>him.</hi> All the Miracles,
Actions, and Prophesies of their Lord
before the Mission of the Holy Ghost; all
the Miracles and Labours of themselves
after it, were to contribute to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the World; but all the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
the Application of this Conviction
was to proceed solely from the Abilities
conferred on them, at the time of <hi>his</hi>
Mission.</p>
            <p>And thus the Holy Ghost continueth
his Office of Advocate, not only during
the Apostles times, but in all Ages of
the Church; since those Gifts which he
then began to dispense to the Apostles, he
still continueth to diffuse to the Faithful;
and by the Efficacy of these Gifts it is,
that the Church is maintained, the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
enlivened, the Conviction continued.
He then convinced the World by the
Preaching of the Apostles; and he now


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34506:8"/>
convinceth it, by the Preaching of their
Successors acted with the same Spirit, and
by the reading of the Holy Scriptures,
written by them through his assistance
and direction. His Gifts indeed confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on them were far more eminent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
more necessary; his Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church in their time more
remarkable, because manifesting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion
of many particular Prophesies of
our Saviour. Upon which account the
Promises of this Text were then more
eminently fulfilled. And that they were
so, I come next in Order to consider.</p>
            <p>First then, the Holy Ghost by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
reproved or convinced the World <hi>of
Sin; because they believed not on Christ,</hi> as it
follows in the 9. Verse. By the World
we are here primarily to understand the
Jews; who notwithstanding all the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Signs and Miracles performed by
Christ, denied Assent to his Doctrine.
This disbelief of theirs before the Mission
of the Holy Ghost, our Saviour in many
places seems to excuse and pardon; and St.
<hi>Pet.</hi> in the III. of the <hi>Acts V.</hi> 17. extenuates
their crucifying <hi>the Lord of Life</hi> by their
Ignorance: Which Plea would have been
but trifling, had not their Ignorance in
some measure been excusable; but after
the Mission of the Holy Spirit to stand


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34506:8"/>
out against those manifold Convictions
that were then offer'd, could be no other
than an inexcusable Perverseness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity.
Of this we may assign two
several Reasons.</p>
            <p>First, that although our Lord had in his
own Person performed many, and those
stupendious Miracles; yet these affected
no other than the Spectators of them.
For while alive, he never blazoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
his Miracles, nor employed his
Disciples in spreading the Report, and
testifying the Truth of them. So that
however many particular Persons, who
were Eye-witnesses of his Miracles, could
not but be abundantly convinced of his
Divinity; yet the universal Conviction
of the whole Nation of the Jews was
to be reserved to the Mission of the Holy
Ghost: When the Apostles were to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with Courage, and Power from on
high, to proclaim his Actions, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
to all Men, and if need were, to
assert the Truth of them, by other no
less extraordinary Miracles.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the chief Note affixed by
God, whereby to judge of the Truth of
any Prophet, and particularly of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,
was the Completion of his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.
Thus in <hi>Deut.</hi> XVIII. when <hi>Moses</hi>
assureth the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> That <hi>God


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34506:9"/>
should raise them up in the latter days a
Prophet like unto himself, whom they should</hi>
be obliged to <hi>hear in all things;</hi> he gives
them this Token, whereby to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>true</hi> and any <hi>false</hi> Messias: If
the Predictions of him, who took upon
him the Name and Character of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,
did really come to pass; then they
should acknowledge him to be the true
Messias. The most eminent, and almost
only Predictions of our Lord, which could
serve as Signs of this nature to the Jews
of that Age, were the Mission of the
Holy Ghost, the Resurrection of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
after three days Imprisonment in
the Grave, and the Final destruction of
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> before that Generation should
pass away.</p>
            <p>The first was happily accomplished
upon this day; when the Gifts of the
Holy Ghost were poured out upon the
Apostles, in so illustrious a manner; as
the Jews could not but take notice of the
exact Completion of his Promise, of send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Comforter not many days after
his Ascension; in <hi>such</hi> a manner as drew
the eyes of all the Inhabitants of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
both Jews and Strangers upon them,
and tended no less to demonstrate the
Power, than the Truth of Christ. The
second Prediction indeed, that of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34506:9"/>
was fulfilled fifty days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but became not an Argument of
Conviction to the Jews till now; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not till now publickly attested by the
Apostles, who were the Witnesses of it.
The Report of his Resurrection, had been
indeed rumoured in <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> which put
the Sanhedrim upon that shameful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of corrupting the Soldiers, who
guarded his Sepulchre; but the certain
and publick Knowledge of it was not
delivered, till the Apostles were enabled
and enboldened to proclaim and testifie
it to the whole World by those Gifts
which they received upon this day.</p>
            <p>After the exact Completion of these
Prophesies and the authentick attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, no excuse remained to the
Jews, whereby to extenuate their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
according to the Rules laid down
by <hi>Moses,</hi> they were now obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
Christ to have been a true
Prophet, and the true Messias; and were
convinced of their hainous Sin before
commited by them, in the Rejection of
his Doctrine, and Crucifixion of his
Person; the horror of which Sin might
induce them the more readily to believe
in Christ, and lay hold of his Merits;
that so they might obtain Remission of it.
Otherwise they were to expect the most


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34506:10"/>
severe Execution of Divine Vengeance
for their wilful obstinacy and disbelief;
as <hi>Moses</hi> had assured them in the same
place, <hi>Deut.</hi> XVIII. 19. <hi>And it shall
come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken
unto my words, which he shall speak in my
name; I will require it of him.</hi> This Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and therein the Prophesie of
Christ, was in a most eminent manner,
executed and fulfilled, in the Destruction,
and intire Desolation of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jews, about forty years after
the Ascension of our Lord; whereby
the Apostles and Disciples of our Lord
then alive, acted by the Holy Ghost,
were farther enabled invincibly to plead
his Cause, against the opposition of the
unbelieving World, both Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</p>
            <p>For however the Mission of the Holy
Ghost, and the Consequences of it, did
more especially convince <hi>of Sin</hi> the Jews,
who were then alive, and had been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
either of rejecting the Preaching, or
contriving the Death of our Lord; yet
it contributed no less effectually to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
the Unreasonableness of all both Jews
and Gentiles, who either in that, or in
all Ages to come, should reject the Faith
of Christ, when proposed to them. For
the Belief of him was to be proposed to


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34506:10"/>
all Creatures under Heaven, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by Arguments drawn from hence;
which were so rational and convictive,
so clear and demonstrative, that they
could not be rejected without the most
extream Perverseness; and if rejected,
the Holy Ghost should hereby plead the
cause of Christ against them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the whole World, and their own
Consciences also, if rightly judging, that
in rejecting the Gospel they had sinned
against their own Souls; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
remained to them, <hi>but a certain fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Expectation of the fiery Judgment,</hi> to be
most justly inflicted on them.</p>
            <p>The second point of which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
was to reprove or convince the
World, was <hi>of Righteousness;</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of which is assigned in the 10th Verse;
<hi>Because I go to my Father; and ye see me no
more.</hi> The Justice of God had to the
eyes of Men been clouded; when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
his only begotten Son to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up, and crucified by wicked Men;
when he abandoned him to the Rage of
his Enemies, and rescued him not from
the Insults of the Jews by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Interposition from Heaven. The
Majesty of the Deity seemed then to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed,
and suffer diminution; when sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to the Contradiction and Affronts


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34506:11"/>
of unreasonable Men. Men naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that God should even in this World
declare in behalf of oppressed Innocence;
either by rescuing it from the Malice of
its Enemies, or taking a severe Revenge
upon the Oppressors of it. And even
Christians, who have a better and more
certain Knowledge of the Methods of
Providence, cannot but expect, and are
allowed so to do; that if no Discrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be made between the Good and the
Bad in this life, yet at least that it shall be
in the next; when Innocence shall be
crowned with Rewards, which shall be
enhanced by Patience in Sufferings; and
Violence chastised with Punishments,
which shall be so much the sharper, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
intire to another World; if no
part of them be inflicted in this. This a
faithful Christian expects from the Justice
of God; and this the Scripture assureth
them, <hi>Seeing it is a righteous thing with
God to recompense tribulation to them that
trouble you; and to you who are troubled,
rest;</hi> 2 Thess. I. 6. <hi>And God is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
to forget your work and labour;</hi>
Heb. VI. 10. If then this Justice may be
securely hoped for from God by all the
Members of Mankind; how much more
by the Son of God, whose Person was of
infinite Dignity, his Sufferings fraught


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34506:11"/>
with the highest Aggravations of Misery,
and his Persecutors guilty of the most
enormous Wickedness? That the Justice
of God might be therefore vindicated
herein; that Sin might no longer tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and Innocence pass unregarded;
<hi>God exalted</hi> his Son <hi>to his own right hand,</hi>
seated him in the Heavens, <hi>gave him Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over all things, crowned him with
glory and worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The knowledge of this was published
to the World by the Mission of the Holy
Ghost; by whose Direction and Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
the Apostles openly testified the
Ascension of their Lord; and by which
all might be convinced what Place and
Power Christ now obtained in Heaven,
who could showre down such glorious
Gifts and Priviledges upon his Followers
on Earth. These were so many undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Testimonies that the Malice of his
Enemies was defeated, that our Lord was
yet alive, set above their reach and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults;
and not only so, but invested with
supreme Majesty and Dominion, able to
protect his Church, and punish his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
that his former Sufferings had not
been then more calamitous, than his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
State was now glorious; that if God
had for a time withdrawn in appearance
his Favour and Protection from his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34506:12"/>
Nature, he had now in recompence
exalted it to an eternal Throne in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>The last thing, of which the Comforter
was to reprove or convince the World,
was <hi>of Judgment;</hi> and that for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Ver. 11. <hi>Because the prince of this
world is judged.</hi> It is a Principle even of
Natural Religion, that God is the supreme
Judge of the World, and that of invisible
as well as visible Beings. The Devil,
who is frequently in Scripture called <hi>the
prince of this world,</hi> had now for many
Ages exercised an uncontrouled Tyranny
in the World: He had withdrawn the
far greatest part of Mankind from the
worship of the true God; and caused the
worship of himself to become the publick
Religion of all Nations, except the Jews.
Even the Jews he had often seduced to
Idolatry, and Disobedience to the Divine
Commands; and had newly instigated
them to imbrue their hands in the Blood
of their Messias. All these enormous
Crimes, this continued Rebellion against
God, and particularly the last and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
the Death of Christ, did require
from the Judge of all the World a severe
Punishment; which is therefore called
<hi>Judgment</hi> in the Text, because a Sentence
proceeding from the Rules of Justice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:34506:12"/>
This Sentence was to be executed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel of Christ, as we are told
above in the XII. 31. <hi>Now is the judgment
of this world; now shall the prince of this
world be cast out.</hi> The Execution of it
was to be performed by the Preaching of
the Gospel, which should destroy the
Powers of Hell, free Men from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of Sin, and withdraw the World
from the Worship of Devils. This to
those proud Spirits was the sharpest Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
which could possibly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted;
and this was begun by the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Holy Ghost, and carried on
and compleated by the Gifts, and Graces
derived down, and continued to the
Church from his blessed Influence.</p>
            <p>From the Blessings of this day it was,
that the Apostles received Abilities and
Courage to preach the Gospel to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
parts of the Earth, to beat down
the strong holds of Sin, to ruin the power
of Satan, to turn Men to the Knowledge
and Obedience of God. From the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of these Blessings the Church
hath been always defended from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and open Assaults of these infernal
Spirits; the Governors and Ministers of
the Church have been enabled to preach
the Truth, and discharge their Office suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully;


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34506:13"/>
and all the Members of the
Church have been established in the Faith,
and supported against all the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of wicked Spirits. So eminently did
God upon this day exercise Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Prince of this World, that thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
his Kingdom continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
his Oracles were silenced, his
Altars abandoned, his Worship relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished,
his Disciples diminished, until
a glorious Church was founded in all
parts of the Earth; which by a solemn
Engagement, (her Vow in Baptism)
professeth Enmity unto him.</p>
            <p>Upon all these accounts did the Holy
Ghost, as a most faithful Advocate, at his
first Mission, plead the Cause of Christ
against his Adversaries, whether the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
or the Jews his Persecutors: and upon
the same accounts doth that blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
who was promised to remain with
the Church till the end of the World, and
execute the Office of Advocate till the
Consummation of all things, still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to plead the Cause of Christ against
all his Enemies; and that he should do
so, is highly requisite.</p>
            <p>The Devil still assaults the Church by
open Force, or secret Temptations; and
to these the Holy Spirit opposeth his


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34506:13"/>
Gifts and Graces: Infidels and Hereticks
still profess Unbelief to the Doctrines of
it; and to these he opposeth the same
Arguments of Conviction, which were
before manifested to have proceeded from
his Mission. <hi>All these</hi> remain yet in their
full force. Lastly, even in the bosom of
the Church, among the Professors of
Christianity, are many to be found, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom it is necessary that the
Holy Spirit should still plead the Cause of
Christ, which they discredit by their
Sins, and blaspheme by their Lives, <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
afresh the Lord of life, and putting him
to an open shame:</hi> In that, no less guilty,
than all those Enemies of Christ, which
the Holy Ghost at his first Mission was to
convince.</p>
            <p>For did the Jews disbelieve the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christ, before the undeniable
Confirmation added to it in the Mysteries
of this day? These Men by their Actions
proclaim their Unbelief even after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of this Confirmation. Did the
Spirit of God take so much pains to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
the unerring Justice of God in the
distribution of Rewards and Punishments?
After all these, Men live insensible of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
slighting his Rewards, and defying
his Punishments. Did Christ come into


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34506:14"/>
the World, and die a painful Death?
Did God exert his Power in so many
Miracles? Did the Holy Spirit des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
as upon this day, to put an end
to the Empire of the Devil? These
Men by Perseverance in Sin endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to re-establish it in the World,
and do effectually restore it in their
own Souls.</p>
            <p>Justly therefore may this Eternal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
implead these Men before the last
Tribunal. I have conveyed the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the true God even to these Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
I have convinced them of the Truth
of the Christian Faith; at least they will
pretend themselves to have been convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
I have nourished this Knowledge
by causing the Holy Scriptures to be writ
for their Edification; I have endeavoured
the Improvement of it by the constant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
of those my Officers which I
have settled in the Church; I have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
it by the grant of all necessary Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as often as desired: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all this, they have lived as if
they knew not of it, much less as if they
were convinced of it. All my Graces and
Sollicitations of them have produced no
other effect, than to render their Sin the
more hainous; in that they have wilfully


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34506:14"/>
disobeyed my Commands, slighted my
Directions, contemned my Exhortations,
and stifled my Motions. All false Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
which might betray them to
Sin and Disobedience, I have long since
corrected. If they imagine the Disbelief,
or which is all one, the Neglect of my
Doctrines, to be no hainous Crime; I
have long since convinced the World <hi>of
Sin.</hi> If they fancy God not to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
and infallible Judge in the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of Rewards and Punishments; I
have long ago reproved the World <hi>of
Righteousness.</hi> If they pretend the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the World, the Flesh, and the
Devil to be irresistable, I have long since
<hi>judged the prince of this world,</hi> taken away
his Kingdom, and limited his Power.
These then are the most criminal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Name of Christ, who being by
me convinced of their Duty to obey his
Laws, refused to perform them; who
serving under his banner, and kindly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
by him, deserted his Service, and
delivered up themselves to his and their
own Enemy, from whose Tyranny I
had before freed them. What then shall
we plead in behalf of our selves at that
dreadful day? Shall we alledge want of
Conviction? That we pretend not to; or


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34506:15"/>
if we should, the Holy Ghost hath by the
Wonders and Benefits of this day effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
confuted that pretence. Shall we say
that we believed not God to have been in
earnest, when he allured us with Rewards,
or threatened us with Punishments? That
Plea is removed by the Assertion of the
Righteousness of God made upon this day.
Or shall we excuse our selves with want
of extraordinary Assistances and Graces of
the Holy Spirit, enabling us to perform
our Duty, and overcome all Temptations?
That Excuse is overthrown by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Continuation of the kind Influences
of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>We receive not now indeed those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Gifts, with which the Apostles
were once endued. Nor is it necessary
that we should receive them. Those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
not directly to the securing of our
Salvation, which may be equally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
without them, and lost with them.
All that is necessary, all that is convenient
for us, is yet continued to us. The Holy
Ghost still diffuseth his inestimable Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
to the Souls of Men, excites them
by inward Motions, confirms them by
his Assistance, perfects them by his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
which least we should doubt that he
still plentifully bestoweth on us for want


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34506:15"/>
of some external Assurance, he hath insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
the Holy Sacraments, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the Eucharist, as visible Pledges of
his Distribution of Grace to all faithful
Believers; herein bestowing no less a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to the Members of the Church, than
he did when he formerly descended, as
upon this day, attended with mighty
Signs and Miracles, with the Gift of
Tongues, and Cure of Diseases.</p>
            <p>We are assured, that altho' any one
<hi>speak with the tongues of Men and Angels;
altho' he be able to remove Mountains;</hi> yet
it is possible for him to miscarry, and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a cast-away.</hi> But to him that receiveth
this Holy Sacrament worthily; to him
that bewails his former Sins, and seriously
endeavours to reform them; to him that
enters a new into Covenant with God, and
lays hold of the Merits of his Crucified
Saviour in the Participation of these sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Mysteries; to him that herein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles
himself to Christ his head, by a
lively Faith and Repentance, and to all the
Members of the Church by unfeigned
Charity; it is not possible to miss his desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
end, <hi>the Salvation of his Soul;</hi> because
God, <hi>who cannot lie,</hi> hath promised it by his
Word and Spirit; the Son hath sealed it by
his Blood; and the Holy Ghost confirmed


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34506:16"/>
it; as at first by his Descent upon this
day, so now also by the sensible effects of
his Grace, which he diffuseth to all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Communicants. <hi>To these three Persons,
but one God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be
ascribed all Honour, Power, and Glory, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
and for evermore.</hi>

            <p>THE Doctrine of the Holy and
Ever-blessed Trinity (in Honour
of which this Day hath, for some Ages,
been Instituted and Celebrated in the
Church) is that alone, among all the
Principles of Christianity, which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
an undeniable difficulty along with


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34506:17"/>
it, and hath been always made use of
by the Enemies of the Cross, to oppose
the Revelation of Christ.</p>
            <p>Other Doctrines, such as the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Body, Incarnation of the
Son of God, and such like, may appear
Incredible; but at the same time it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied, that they are possible:
And when the Motives of Faith are
added to them, must by all men, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Judging, be allowed to be credible.
But it is pretended, that the Existence
of a Trinity of Persons, in the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, is even contradictory, and
therefore impossible; that it overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Primary Notions of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and allowed Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Even many Professors of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
who acknowledge all the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of Christ to be true, and believe
him to have acted by a Divine Mission,
yet <hi>Stumble at this Stone of Offence;</hi> and
therefore to avoid it, have taken up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
Opinions, plainly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the whole Tenour of the Gospel,
as the <hi>Arrians</hi> of old, and <hi>Socinians</hi> in
later Days.</p>
            <p>That we therefore may not be scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized
with the same Difficulties, that
we may be able to resist the Delusions,


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34506:17"/>
and even overcome the Prejudices of
these Men, it will not be amiss to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as far as we may with Safety and
Modesty, that Doctrine which is the
peculiar business of this Day. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
it becomes us not too narrowly to
pry into the Secrets of Heaven, and
rashly determine Matters, the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of which belongeth not to us;
yet since it hath pleased God to reveal
this Mystery to Mankind, and make it
an Article of Faith, it now ceaseth to
be a Secret of Heaven, and it is both
our Duty and Concern to enquire into
the Credibility of it.</p>
            <p>For the Christian Religion debars us
not from a scrupulous search into the
Truth of her Doctrines, and placeth no
Merit in a blind belief of her Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
It is accepted indeed by God,
as an act of Obedience and Merit (I mean
Merit in a large sence) to believe his
Promises of a Resurrection and eternal
Life after Death; as it was imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteousness, that trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Promises of God, of giving
him a better Inheritance in another
Land, he forsook his own Country,
and his Father's House; although nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we nor he have received the Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34506:18"/>
of those Promises, by the Evidence
of Sence: He had not yet seen the
Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and we do not yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the Possession of those Glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
Notwithstanding all this, God
neither requires nor accepts an irrational
Belief in Man; but as He at first endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with reasonable Faculties, so He
expects he should make use of them to
his Glory; which is by no other thing
so much diminish'd, as by affixing to
him Revelations repugnant to Reason,
and including Contradictions; and that
the Doctrine of the Trinity is not such,
I will endeavour to manifest, as plainly
as the obscurity of the Subject will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
            <p>The Foundations of my intended Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
are laid down by the Apostle in
the Text, and in the Context of it;
which therefore it will be necessary to
explain; and therein I desire you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
me, by looking upon the place.
The Apostle had, in the first eight Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of this Chapter, declared the nature
and simplicity of his Preaching and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
that it was not recommended
by pompous and affected Ornaments of
Rhetorick; that it depended not upon
Sillogisms and nice Speculations, as did


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34506:18"/>
that of the Gentile Philosophers, who
were esteemed the only knowing Men
of the Age; that the Matters declared
by him, were not such as might be
found out by the natural Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
or when found out, were such as
would be applauded by the World as
extraordinary flights of Speculation.
[<hi>They were not the Wisdom of Men, nor
the Wisdom of this World,</hi>] Ver. 5, and 6.
[<hi>But the Wisdom of God;</hi>] Matters not
to be found out by the sole Guidance of
Reason, but deliver'd by the infallible
Revelation of God, who had attested
the Truth of them, by the wonderful
effects of his Power and Spirit, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
in the Miracles and successful
Preaching of Christ and his Apostles.</p>
            <p>And least it should seem incredible to
any, that the Matters of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
should be inconceivable to Human
Reason, acting by its own Power, he
sheweth us in the ninth Verse: That
this was no more than was foretold by
the ancient Prophets, whose Veracity
was allowed by the far greater part of
those to whom he writ. For it was
written in the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, [Eye hath
not seen, nor Ear heard, neither have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Heart of Man, the things


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34506:19"/>
which God hath prepared for them that love
him.</hi>] So that it is undeniable, that the
Will of God, and the Mysteries of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
may be unknown to Men, acting
by the sole Light of Reason; but to
Men acquainted with the Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
concerning them may be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known: Now this is the case of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
For as it followeth in the
tenth Verse, [<hi>God hath revealed them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us by his Spirit,</hi>] that is, by his Son
acting by the Spirit and Commission of
God, and by his Holy Spirit instructing
the Apostles in the knowledge of them,
and confirming them by Signs following.
And that such Revelation is infallible,
none can deny; for that it proceedeth
from one who infallibly knew the Truth
of what he taught, even the Spirit of
God, [<hi>For the Spirit searcheth all things,
even the deep things of God.</hi>]</p>
            <p>And least any one should except to
these Revelations, and deny assent to
them, because they are things which he
never thought of before; and which,
even when revealed to him, he cannot
well conceive; The Apostle shews us,
that we have no reason to wonder or
stumble at this, from the obvious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Soul of Man, in the 11th.


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34506:19"/>
Verse: The Nature of which cannot be
conceived by any Being inferiour to it,
nor the <hi>Secrets,</hi> or the secret Thoughts
of it found out by any Being equal to it.
[<hi>For what Man knoweth the things of a
Man, save the Spirit of Man which is in
him?</hi>] Yet would it be unreasonable for
an inferiour Being (if it could speak and
argue) to deny that the Soul of Man is
endued with noble Faculties, because it
cannot conceive the Nature of them; or
for one Man to deny that there are any
secret Thoughts in the Soul of another,
because he cannot attain to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of them. And if things be so,
then we must allow the Conclusion drawn
in the Text, [<hi>Even so the things of God
knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God;</hi>]
and not unreasonably doubt of the truth
of them, because we cannot conceive
the manner and nature of them.</p>
            <p>So then all Objections drawn from
the difficulty of the Conception cease;
and it remains only to consider, whether
the alledged Revelation be truly Divine.
This therefore the Apostle asserts in the
12th. Verse; declaring his Preaching of
it to be founded not upon bare Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
and nice Conclusions, as were the
Systems of Philosophy then received and


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34506:20"/>
applauded in the World; from which he
distinguisheth the Christian Faith by
these two Characters, that this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Revelation of God, that
from the Invention of Men, [<hi>Now we
have received not the Spirit of the World,
but the Spirit which is of God.</hi>] And
that whereas the Gentile Philosophy, <hi>the
Wisdom of this World,</hi> contributed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to promote the Happiness of Man,
and secure to him the Favour of God,
The other effected both, the end of it
being no other, than [<hi>that we might know
the things that are freely given to us of
God.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Further, these Matters when once
Revealed, and come to our Knowledge,
as we propose not to others with Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Sophistry and Rhetorick, so we
judge not of the truth of them by pure
Arguments of Natural Reason and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Inferences, [<hi>Which things also we
speak not in the Words, which Man's Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
teacheth,</hi> Ver. 13.] But as we teach
them with that plainness and simplicity
which God directeth, and confirm the
truth of them with those Miracles which
he effecteth; so we judge of the truth
of them, no otherwise than by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Nature of the Things revealed,


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34506:20"/>
with the general Motives of Christian
Faith, as it followeth, [<hi>But with the
Wisdom which the Holy Ghost teacheth,
comparing Spiritual things with Spiritual.</hi>]
Now the necessity of this Method in
our Enquiry herein, the Apostle demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
in the 14th. Ver. [<hi>But the natural
Man.</hi>] He who judgeth these Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
only according to his Preconceived
Notions taken up from natural Reason,
and refuseth to believe any thing which
he receiveth not from them, who weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the external Motives of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
reinforcing these Revelations, [<hi>He
receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
God,</hi>] believeth not these revealed
Truths, which surmount the reach of
naked reason. For which reason also,
[<hi>They are foolishness unto him</hi>] because he
considers only the difficulty of them,
and regardeth not the external Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Revelation, by which they are
recommended. So that while he acteth
in this irrational Method [<hi>he cannot know
them;</hi>] it is impossible to be convinced
of them [<hi>because they are spiritually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,</hi>]
not to be found out by the sole
Light of Reason, but to be received on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the account of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Whereas he who understandeth


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34506:21"/>
well the Motives of Christian Faith, and
compareth the weight of them with the
difficulty of the things Revealed, [<hi>He
that is Spiritual,</hi> Ver. 15. <hi>judgeth all
things,</hi>] may safely, and without Error,
pronounce of this Matter. And in doing
so, he is not justly to be over-ruled with
the Objections of those, who consider the
thing absolutely in it self, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with its Motives of Credibility,
[<hi>Yet he himself is judged of no Man.</hi>]
Since plain Reason directeth, that if the
Motives be found weightier than the
Difficulties, he should declare in favour
of the thing Revealed, and not be start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at the Difficulties, as <hi>concerning</hi> a
subject exceeding the natural Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of Man, and to be known no
otherwise than by the Revelation of
God, who best knew the truth of it;
which Revelation we have, as it follows
in the last Verse. [<hi>For who hath known
the Mind of the Lord, that he may Instruct
him? But we have the Mind of Christ.</hi>]</p>
            <p>From all that hath been laid down by
the Apostle in the Context thus explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we may form these two Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereby to determine the Truth of
this Matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:34506:21"/>
I. That we ought not to reject any
Articles of Revelation, nor be offended
at them, meerly because we cannot fully
conceive the manner of them.</p>
            <p>II. That in judging of the Truth of
these Matters, we must not consider their
internal Probability, so much as their
external Motives of Credibility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then, we ought not to reject
any Articles of Faith, nor be scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at them, because we cannot fully
conceive the Nature or manner of them.
For this we cannot rationally do, unless
we were assured, that we fully knew
all things, and were able to conceive
the nature of all Objects. Which that
we are not, we may be convinced, if
we consider either the Imperfection of
our own Understanding, or the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of many Objects exceeding the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of it.</p>
            <p>1. The Imperfection of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
appears, both from the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of our Nature, and from mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Experience. The nature of the
Soul of Man is finite, and so must the
Faculties of it also be. One of these is
the Understanding, which if it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
could be no part of a finite Soul.
It hath its bounds and sphere of Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34506:22"/>
fixed to it, which if it exceeds, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
judge without danger of Error and
Illusion. If we desire to extend our
Knowledge to all Things and Objects,
the desire is unreasonable; if we pretend
to it, the pretence is foolish. The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
of our Nature hath excluded all
such Hopes, which can be obtained no
otherwise, than by altering our Nature,
and raising us from the condition of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
to Infinite Beings. It becomes us
to receive with grateful Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
those Perfections which God hath
bestowed on us; not to repine, that he
gave us not better, much less be angry
that they are not infinite; since it is
impossible, that any Creature should have
an infinite Understanding.</p>
            <p>Further, the Imperfection of our
Knowledge is manifest from Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The greatest part of Mankind
are detained in miserable Ignorance, even
of plain and sensible Matters. A bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
<hi>Indian</hi> could never be perswaded
of the Truth of many things, which
by their frequency are not in the least
admir'd by us. The fabrick of a Watch,
or the mutual Communication of
Thoughts by Writing, is no less incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
to him, than the Mysteries of the


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34506:22"/>
Trinity are to us. And yet we shou'd
by no means allow his Conclusion, if he
should peremptorily deny the Existence
of such things, because he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them.</p>
            <p>Among us, Men, who have not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
their Reason by Thought and
Study, are far more unable to conceive
those things which are certainly known
by more Learned Men, than the latter
are to conceive the greatest Mysteries of
the Deity. And even in these the same
Imperfection of Understanding may be
discovered. For however they may
flatter themselves with knowing the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Finite Beings and Causes of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Effects, which indeed are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and suitable Objects of Human Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
yet they must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their Ignorance in many other
things of the same kind; and what they
do pretend to know in Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
others oft-times no less Learned
will deny; and if themselves now fancy
that they know the Truth; yet they
must confess, that they once knew it not,
or perhaps had different Conceptions of
it. And then that very improvement of
their Knowledge is an undeniable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Imperfection of it. So that


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34506:23"/>
if Men should always deny the truth of
what they cannot conceive, even all natural
knowledge would be destroy'd, and things
most certain would be denied to exist. And
then surely we cannot but allow a greater
distance to be between the infinite Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, and that of the most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Man, which how far soever improved,
yet still continueth to be finite, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the most perfect, and most imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Understandings of any two Men liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Excellency of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
may be such, that it can never be
fully conceived by the understanding of
any created Being. And such is God;
of whose Existence altho' we be most
certain, yet we have no other than an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Idea of his Essence. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him indeed to be a most perfect
Being, but his Perfections we cannot
comprehend in one single Idea; we are
forced to consider them apart; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
then obtain the knowledge of them
rather by removing all Imperfections
from him, then by conceiving the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Perfections themselves. And
after all, many Attributes of God, which
none deny to be his Attributes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the Divine Nature cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34506:23"/>
include no less Difficulties, than the
Doctrine of the Trinity. I will instance
only in two, his independent Existence,
and his Omnipresence.</p>
            <p>For the first, nothing can exist without
a cause; and since there can be no external
cause to God, the cause of his Existence
must be sought for in himself; and that is
the infinity of his Nature. Now altho' all
Men firmly believe that God never recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his Existence from any external Cause,
nor needed to do it; since the infinity of
his own Nature was a necessary Cause of
independent Existence: Yet cannot the
Soul of Man conceive how any thing
should be the cause of it self, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
involved in inextricable darkness.</p>
            <p>Again no Man can deny God to be
Omnipresent, who grants his Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence;
yet can we not conceive the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God in all places, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
at the same time an Extension of
parts; altho' we be assured that God is
an immaterial Being, and as such, can have
no Extention of parts.</p>
            <p>Further not only the infinity of the
Subject may exceed our Apprehension,
but the Spirituality of it, altho' finite,
may confound us in this Life, wherein we
are so much inured to judge by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34506:24"/>
of our Senses, that few or none can
form a distinct Conception of an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Being. All allow the Soul of Man
to be such; yet the greatest part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
are not able to form any Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an immaterial Being; and even
those who can, yet have no other than
a very confused Idea of it; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
rather in a Negative Conception of
it, to wit, that it is not material, than
in any positive Notion of its Immateriali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
If then things which are on all
sides allowed, continue to be inconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
if we cannot solve the Difficulties
arising from many Attributes in God,
which yet we cannot deny to be in him,
without denying his Existence at the
same time; if we be so much at a loss
in the Conception of any immaterial Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
we ought not to be astonished or
scandalized, that the Doctrine of the
Trinity cannot be fully conceived by us.</p>
            <p>So then since humane Reason cannot
by its own Conceptions alone find out
and determine all which may relate to
the Nature of God; the Second Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
proposed will take place, namely,
That in judging the truth of these Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
we must not consider their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Probability, so much as their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34506:24"/>
Motives of Credibility. For since
we cannot perfectly comprehend the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, many Properties may be in
it, which we could never discover by the
light of Reason, nor yet when discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us, fully conceive them. But what
we cannot conceive, we cannot judge of
from internal Arguments, which are to
be drawn from the Nature and Essence
of the subject; the perfect knowledge of
which being denied to us we cannot form
any Arguments from thence. It remains
therefore that we respect only the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Arguments of its truth; and those
can be no other than external Revelation.
We cannot doubt, that God fully know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his own Nature; and that as he is
most wise, he is most veracious; that
as he cannot be deceived himself, so he
cannot deceive us. If then we be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
assured that God hath revealed
this, all scruples ought to cease, which
is the Apostles Argument in this Case.</p>
            <p>It must be indeed acknowledged, that
we may be deceived in our belief of a
Divine Revelation; and that since God
cannot affirm any thing which is false,
it is an invincible Argument against any
pretended Revelation; this Matter is
false, therefore it cannot be revealed by


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34506:25"/>
God. We must have therefore some
rule, whereby to direct our Assent and
Judgment in this Case; and that is very
obvious. For the understanding necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
(at least reasonably) inclining to
that part, which carrieth the greatest
evidence along with it; if the Evidence
of the Revelation of any Proposition
be greater than the Evidence of its
falsity, we must in obedience to the
Laws of reason embrace and believe it.
But if the Evidence of its falsity exceeds
the Evidence of its Revelation, we may
safely reject it. Let us therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the Evidence of both sides.</p>
            <p>Matters of Revelation may concern
either finite or infinite Nature. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the first sort in the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
are all such Propositions, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the natural Body of Christ: Of
the second, all such as respect the Divine
Nature. In the first Case, which exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the natural Capacity of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
nothing can be true, which
may not be fully conceived by us. For
altho' many Properties and Qualities of
finite Beings, may lie for ever undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the natural light of Reason, yet
when discovered to us, they may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
conceived by us, if they carry any


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34506:25"/>
truth with them. So that whatsoever
in finite Natures is inconceivable to us,
can be no part of Divine Revelation.
For we cannot imagine any Revelation
to be made without an intended Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Assent; now since God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
us to judge according to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Evidence, he could never require us
to believe a Proposition, the Evidence of
whose falsity exceeds the Evidence of its
Revelation. And since we are proper
Judges of the Nature of finite Beings,
when discovered to us; not to be able to
conceive any Proposition relating to
them, is an unanswerable Argument of
the falsity of it; since if it were true,
we should be easily able to conceive it,
and reconcile it to all other truths, and
the received Laws of Reason. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account the Doctrine of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,
can never be any part of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
Religion. But in Matters relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to infinite Beings it is far otherwise.
In those it is no Objection against the
truth of them, that we are not able to
conceive them; as we before shewed.</p>
            <p>The only internal Argument, which
can be used in this Case against the truth
of any Revelation, must be founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Contradiction included in it; to wit,


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34506:26"/>
if the Revelation proposeth any thing
which destroyeth the Idea of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
or which is all one, introduceth a
Conception, which cannot consist with
it. Such would be to affirm there are
two or more God's, or that he is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Being, and such like. For the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Notion of God being no other than
that of an infinite and most perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Primary cause and Author of all
other Beings; to suppose any other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
independent from him, or himself
to be capable of Division and Limitation,
the inseparable Property of all corporeal
Beings, would destroy the Notion of
him. In this Case we should affirm and
deny the same thing; or which is all
one, Contraries of the same thing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
consists the absurdity of a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
So that the only internal rule
which is left us to judge of any Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
concerning the Divine Nature, is,
whether or no it includeth a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
either in Terms, or by Self-evident
consequence; For no other consequence
can be allowed in this Case; since the
consequences, upon which a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to be founded, must be of equal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with a Contradiction in Terms,
which is always Self-evident.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:34506:26"/>
If we apply these Rules to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of the Trinity, it will be no hard
Matter to determine it. For God being
confessedly an infinite Being; and the
Doctrine of the Trinity a Matter relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Nature and Properties; we
may from hence perceive, that we are
not to require a distinct Knowledge of
it, but only whether it be Contradictory.
And first, it is manifest, that it includeth
no Contradiction in terms. For we do
not say, That there is one God, and three
Gods; (which would be all one as to say,
there is one God, and not one God.) Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do we say, There is one Person in
the Deity, and three Persons; (which
would be all one as to say, There is one
Person, and not one Person.) Nor do we
say that the Father is the Son, at the
same time that we say he is not the Son.
These are the only imaginable Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
in terms; and these are no part
of the Doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
            <p>The consequential Contradictions chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insisted on by the Adversaries of the
Trinity, are these Two. 1. If there be three
Persons, and each Person be God, then
there are three Gods: which is Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to an allowed Proposition:
(there is but one God.) 2. If these three


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34506:27"/>
Persons agree in a third, <hi>viz.</hi> in the
Nature of God, they must agree among
themselves, and so there will be but one
Person, which is contradictory to the
Proposition laid down, <hi>viz.</hi> [There are
three Persons.] The first Consequence is
founded upon this Proposition; There
cannot be a plurality of Persons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a plurality of Natures. The second
upon this, there cannot be a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Natures, without an Identity
of Persons. Now, who will say, that
either of these Propositions is self-evident,
nay, that they carry the least evidence
with them; since nothing can be evident
to us, of which we cannot judge; and
we cannot judge of these two Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
unless we fully understood the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Nature of God? It is generally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
indeed, that it cannot be so in
finite Beings, but that is no Argument
that it cannot be so in infinite Beings:
nor are we yet sure that it cannot be so
in Finite Beings. For even in the Soul
of Man there is no small resemblance of
it, where are several Faculties which can
operate independently from each other;
and yet all singly possess all the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Qualities of the Soul consider'd
as such, as its Immateriality, Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34506:27"/>
and such like. So in the Deity,
there are several Persons obtaining di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Operations, but partaking in all
the commune Attributes of the Deity;
such as Eternity, Omnipotency, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>After all, it must be acknowledged by
all sober Men, that the Difficulties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Adversaries of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
proceed, are far less evident than
are the general Motives of Credibility of
the Christian Faith; as that Christ died
and rose again; performed many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which were attested and confirmed
by his Disciples, who were Eye-witnesses
of them, wrought other Miracles in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of them, and at last laid down
their Lives for the same Cause; having
first consigned the memory of them to
Writing, which hath been invariably
handed down to us in all Ages. These
Arguments are plain, obvious, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
whereas the forementioned Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
are obscure and inconceivable to
many, and to all uncertain.</p>
            <p>There are indeed many Erronious
Christians, and have formerly been more,
who pretend that Christ and his Apostles
revealed no such thing. But these Men
proceeded chiefly upon those Objections,


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34506:28"/>
which we have already Refuted; and
upon unreasonable and forced Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Scripture, which they wrested
to their sense, while they endeavour to
solve the Difficulties of this Doctrine, by
removing it wholly. But while they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
this, they involved themselves
in far greater Difficulties, and even in
flat Contradictions. For God having
commanded, that <hi>all should Worship the
Son, even as they do the Father,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
never daring to deny that divine
Adoration was to be paid to Christ;
hereby they have been forced to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that divine Adoration is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to a Being which is not God; which
is a most palpable Contradiction, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
greater than all the Difficulties of
the Trinity, which they so much dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For an act of Divine Adoration
consists chiefly in an awful conception of
the Infinity of that Nature which is to
be adored; and therefore cannot be paid
to any Object, but under the Notion of
God. So that in adoring Christ with
Divine Honour, the Mind must consider
him as God, while at the same time it
denieth him to be God, which is a plain
Repugnance of Conception, and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
Contradiction. So that all the


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34506:28"/>
Arguments of Christianity remain in full
force, in favour of the Doctrine of the
Trinity, and those Difficulties which
may attend it; being, as we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
far less evident than are those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
it remains, that if we act ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
we assent unto it.</p>
            <p>I am sensible, that what I have said
in this matter, is more obscure, than Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
from this place are wont to be.
But that could not be avoided in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of this Nature. I hope it may be
of some use to you, not only in confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the steadiness of your Faith in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
in manifesting the excellency of the
Christian Religion, which requireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be believed repugnant to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and in giving you some Rules for
the conduct of your Understanding in
matters of Religion; but also in arming
you against the Snares and Delusions of
a Pestilent Sect, which hath very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken advantage from our Divisions
to revive their Objections, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to propose them.</p>
            <p>May what hath been said, conduce
to the confirmation of your Faith, to
the clearing of your Thoughts, to the
removing of your Doubts, if any such

            <p>AMONG all the Errors and false
Perswasions to which Man in this
mortal State is subject, none are more
dangerous, and at the same time more
common, than those relating to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of his Nature. All the rational
parts of the Creation propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and the irrational part are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by their Creator to, some supreme
end. The more ignoble part fail not
to obtain their end, being directed by


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34506:30"/>
an infallible hand; while Man, the most
noble part of the visible Creation, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrieth
in the acquisition of it. It is a
rational Soul, capacious Faculties, and
the uncontrouled use of a Free-Will,
which bestow on Man a possibility of
being truly happy: Yet such is the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
of Mankind, that even these are
the occasion of his Fall and Miscarriage.
He sets the Faculties of his Soul on
work to invent new Methods of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
he runs through all the Pleasures,
whether of Sense or Reason, of which
his Nature is capable; he fixeth his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
upon those which most of all strike
his Imagination, or gratifie his Senses;
he applieth himself to obtain them by
the use of his Free-Will: When he hath
discovered the Vanity and Unsatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness
of one End, he invents another;
he grows wanton in his Desires, and the
more he indulgeth his roving Thoughts,
the farther he is removed from the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his true End.</p>
            <p>A miserable Calamity indeed, that
Man alone should miscarry in his supreme
End; yet a Calamity which cannot be
denied; a Calamity which hath invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the far greater part of Mankind, who
know no other End than what is termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34506:30"/>
in this Life; seek no other Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
than what ariseth from the report
of their Senses, and expireth with them.
Many have indeed, by the excellency of
their Thoughts, rescued themselves from
this common Calamity, and all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are by the benefit of Revelation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from it: They know a better
and more lasting Happiness; they are
not unacquainted with the supreme End
of their Nature; yet by a miserable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Judgment they are betrayed
to neglect this End, to stifle their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and over-rule the Convictions of
their own Minds.</p>
            <p>This ariseth from an unjust esteem of
Corporeal and Temporal Happiness,
which recommending it self to the Soul
of Man by the impression of Sense, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth
it from the consideration of
a better and more noble End, taketh root
in his Imagination, raiseth his Passions,
and by their assistance continueth its Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.
Nothing therefore will conduce
more to the retrieving a just conception
of real Happiness, to rectifie the Thoughts,
and secure the End of Man, than to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
the deceitfulness, to defeat the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions
of sensual and temporal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
by manifesting how unsatisfactory


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34506:31"/>
it is in its own Nature, how unable to
fill the capacious Faculties of our Souls,
how vain and trifling, how unworthy
our study and desire. This will effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
perswade us to raise our Thoughts,
and apply our utmost diligence to the
acquisition of a more noble End: When
we shall be convinced of the insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of that End, which withdraws us
from the pursuit of the other, when we
shall perceive that no real Happiness will
arise from thence; that however it may
flatter the Sense, and please the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
it will fill no one Faculty of the
Soul.</p>
            <p>To effect this Conviction therefore,
the Scripture makes use of various Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments;
the uncertainty of Life, the
mutability of Fortune, the loss of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Reward, forfeited by a blind pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of worldly Happiness; the Vanity
of it when obtained; the miserable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of it when expired; but above
all, the Examples of worldly Men, who
after they had obtained all which they
could desire in this Life, rested unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
or became unhappy; were divest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their Felicity, and reduced to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery;
or amidst all their Enjoyments, by
a conviction of Judgment, which they


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34506:31"/>
could not resist, declared and confessed
the emptiness and vanity of that Felicity,
which themselves had so much courted,
and others so much admir'd.</p>
            <p>An eminent Instance of this, is that
of <hi>Haman</hi> in my Text, who, amidst all
his Honours and Titles, his Wealth, and
the Favours of his Prince; amidst all the
Pleasures which this Life can receive,
convinced by undeniable experience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd,
that <hi>all this availed him nothing.</hi>
That both these Considerations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
both the nature of the Thing, and
the evidence of Experience confirming it,
may be useful to us, I will proceed upon
these two Heads.
<list>
                  <item>I. The Example of <hi>Haman,</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
that all the Satisfactions of this Life
<hi>availed him nothing.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. The Reasons, why they did not
avail him, nor will avail any others,
who, with <hi>Haman,</hi> placeth his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the fruition of them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. The Example of <hi>Haman</hi> is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
and instructive, a most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Argument of that Truth for which
we now contend; which will appear,
if we view the several Circumstances
of his Life and Greatness. He enjoyed
all those Advantages which could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34506:32"/>
the Opinion of his own Happiness.
Among these, none of the least is, that
he rose to this Grandeur from a mean E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
which set a better relish upon his
Happiness, and made it the more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him.</p>
            <p>To one who had all his Life long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
the uninterrupted course of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
these Honours might appear of
lesser value. A Satiety of Pleasures
might in such have extinguished an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of them. He might not know
how to prize them, because he never
knew the want of them. To be brought
up in a constant Plenty of all that Sense
can desire, will oft-times produce a
Greatness of Mind, surmounting at last
those petty Objects. For the desire of
Man in this Life is restless; so that what
he hath always possest he will scarce
think desirable. 'Tis Novelty which
recommendeth Temporal Enjoyments:
The want of them first raised a desire of
them; and their absence ministers an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of their Greatness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Haman</hi> had, no doubt, while yet in
a mean Condition, before he was taken
notice of or advanced by his Prince, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
the Honour and Riches of other
Men, envied their Happiness, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34506:32"/>
his Hopes in the Acquisition of a like
Fortune. He had often imagined he
should be truly Happy when he should
have obtained what he so much desired.
The opinion of this Happiness had taken
deep root in his Mind, had filled his
thoughts and possest his Soul. And now
after his Desires were accomplished, his
Hopes fulfilled; when he was raised to a
greater Dignity, than himself before had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
dared to hope; when he was far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
above all those, whose Happiness he had
so long both envied and admired; when
he was newly entred upon the Possession
of his Hopes, and had not so long enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Pleasures of them, as to be glutted
by them, yet notwithstanding all these
Advantages, he declares, <hi>this availed him
nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, if such a Confession should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the mouth of a Philosopher, it
might possibly be attributed to somewhat
else than Conviction of Judgment. It might
arise from Vain-glory, and the Desire of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reputed Superior to all the Satisfactions
of sense, and the vanity of this Life. It might
be thought to be spoken with design of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
an Opinion of his own extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Wisdom or Mortification. As it was
usually objected to the Heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34506:33"/>
that they secretly entertained the
love of those Vices, against which they
so furiously declaimed, and directed their
Discourse rather for applause than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.
Or if such a saying should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a firm Perswasion in them, it
still deserved not to be admired: because
they knew, or pretended to know, a more
real and desirable Happiness; so that to
depress the Pleasures of Sense, and exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerate
those of the Mind, was no more
than their Profession did require of them.
Or if a Christian should make such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
after a serious Meditation of the
vanity of this Life, and the Rewards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to him in another, we should much
less be moved at it. In <hi>him,</hi> that would
be but natural: <hi>He professeth himself a
Citizen of another world, a Pilgrim and
Stranger upon the Earth,</hi> whose Hopes
and Expectations are placed in Heaven.
But when a professed Worlding, who
knows no Happiness, but what is to be
received in this Life, who never consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
or conceived a spiritual Felicity,
who greedily seeks after secular Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
and makes those the only Objects
of his desire: If such an one, in the
midst of his Fruition, declares his unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;
<hi>this</hi> is an unanswerable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34506:33"/>
which nothing but the force of
truth can extort, which cannot be denied.
And such was <hi>Haman,</hi> a stranger to the
Promises of God, an Enemy to Religion,
a Slave to his Passions, a Votary to
Lust and Pleasure; and yet even he in
the Fruition of all which he had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
so ardently desired, confest, that <hi>it
availed him nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, this Speech of <hi>Haman</hi> was not
the effect of any sudden Motion, but of
mature Deliberation. A worldly Man
perhaps may be driven by some Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
or unwelcome Accident, to
blaspheme his Mammon, and in a hasty
Concession to declare the Vanity of all
sublunary Enjoyments; to renounce his
part in them, and pretend that he doth
not value them: yet would be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be taken at his word, and stript
of all. Such Sallies of Passion declare
not the fixed Judgment of a Man, and not
proceeding from Deliberation, carry no
Authority with them. But the resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Haman</hi> in my Text was far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
He pronounced this in a sedate
Disposition, after long Consultation. He
sent for his Friends to acquaint them with
it; and when they were met, did not
immediately break out into a transport


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34506:34"/>
of Passion, and bewail his misfortune.
He recounted and amplified the Benefits
of fortune to him, took a full Prospect of all
his imaginary Happiness, as it is in the 11.
Verse, <hi>And Haman told them of the glory
of his riches, and the multitude of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and all the things, wherein the King
had promoted him; and how he had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him above the Princes and Servants of
the King.</hi> He gave its due weight to
every Circumstance of his present For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
insisted upon all the Topicks which
might amplifie the greatness of it, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
it in a set harangue, and yet after
all at last concluded, that <hi>all this availed
him nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A strange Conclusion for an <hi>Haman</hi> to
make; which yet will carry greater
weight along with it, if we consider,
that this proceeded not from any Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
made to him by his Friends,
whom he had called together, of the
vanity of his riches, the mutability of
his Fortune, or the mortality of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Such Suggestions might possibly
have diverted his Vain-glorious humour
for a while to a melancholy Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, and in that Disposition have
forced him to make this Concession. As
<hi>Solon</hi> did to <hi>Craesus,</hi> making a pompous


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34506:34"/>
shew of his Treasur<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s and Magnificence:
and the Prophet reduced King <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
to more humble thoughts, after he had in
Ostentation exposed his riches to the view
of the Embassadours of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, that they should be carried away
to <hi>Babylon.</hi> In that case, to restrain the
love of worldly Pleasure, and for a while
seem weary of it, may easily be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable.
But here the Friends of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
far from performing such an Office,
sought rather to congratulate his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
to flatter his Passions, to foment
his Pride and Ambition, by concurring
in an Opinion of his extraordinary
Happiness. Himself in order recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Dignities; and they admired
them. He reported the Favours of his
Prince; and they extolled them. He
boasted of his Grandeur and Riches; and
they proclaim'd him Happy. Yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who best knew what Happiness he
received from thence, declared himself
unhappy, and <hi>all this to avail him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, this was spoken by <hi>Haman,</hi>
whilst yet in full Favour with his Prince,
and expecting to receive greater Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of it. He suffered no Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of losing his present Enjoyment.


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34506:35"/>
Such thoughts indeed distract a worldly
Man, imbitter all his Pleasures, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him not to rest contented. It would be
impossible to him to relish any delight,
while afflicted with Fears and Doubts,
while despairing to retain his present
Happiness. He would grow Pale at the
Prospect of an approaching Storm, and
instead of receiving any Complacency
from his present Prosperity, distract his
thoughts with the fear of future Misery.
In such Circumstances an Epicure might
well Confess, that all the outward Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of his Life profited him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
while he suffered inward Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from the Apprehension of his Fall,
which would render him so much more
miserable, by how much it deprived him
of a greater Prosperity. <hi>Haman</hi> at this
time had no such Fears, he had yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no repulse at Court, his Favour
daily increased, he had that very day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
eminent Marks of his Princes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and was the day after to receive
yet more. All this he was sensible of,
and all this he acknowledged in the close
of his Speech, <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. For he said more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<hi>Yea Esther the Queen did let no man
come in with the King unto the banquet that
she had prepared, but my self; and to morrow


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34506:35"/>
am I invited unto her also with the King.</hi>
Far from fearing the loss of his present
Greatness, he probably hoped the increase
of it, and yet concluded, that <hi>all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
him nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then <hi>Haman</hi> under all these Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
missed of his desired end, of being
made Happy by worldly Enjoyments,
we may reasonably suspect some defect
to be in the Nature of them, upon the
account of which neither <hi>Haman</hi> could,
nor any other can, receive any real Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
from thence. And this I proceed
in the Second place to treat of in some
few Considerations.</p>
            <p>First then, nothing on this side Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is able to satiate the Soul of Man;
and however temporal Benefits may at a
distance ravish the Imagination, and
create extraordinary Conceptions of their
own Excellency; yet when obtained, they
are found to be empty and trifling, unable
to satisfie the Desires of the Soul, and
fill its Capacity. They are like the Fruit
of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which by their external Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
attract the Eye, but when touched,
crumble into Ashes. While they are yet
only Objects of Desire, Men frame to
themselves as it were Systems of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to be enjoyed in them. No sooner


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34506:36"/>
do they become Objects of Fruition, but
the meanness of them is discovered; and
after a full Enjoyment of them, Man is
forced to Confess, this is <hi>not</hi> that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
that which he proposed to himself.
He is never enabled by the Possession of
them to say, I am now completely Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
I here terminate my Desires. He is
forced to carry his Desires yet farther,
and seek true Felicity somewhere else;
which, while constant to his Principle,
he can place no where else, than in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Degree of the same Happiness. This
therefore he earnestly pursues, yet never
attains that Degree. If he fixeth the
measure of the Degree, he may indeed
arrive at that; but when arrived, finds
himself, as far as ever<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> removed from true
Happiness. He turmoils and distracts
himself, experienceth the Vanity of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Projects, invents new Methods of
Happiness; until Death puts an end to
his Life and Designs together.</p>
            <p>The greatest of these worldly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are generally supposed to be Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and sensual Pleasures. The latter
are common even to Beasts, who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with Senses no less strong and
lively, than Men. And then surely none
will so far debase his Nature, as to level


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34506:36"/>
himself with Beasts by proposing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Felicity, of which they are no less
capable. It cannot be denied indeed, that
as we consist of Soul and Body, God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Happiness to each part; that he
put us into this World, to make our selves
Happy, even in this Life; but then, as
Soul and Body together constitute but
one Person, the Pleasures of either must
be such as consist with the Nature of
both. As the Soul ought not to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
over the Body, by imposing on it
unnecessary Rigours and Mortifications;
so the Excellency of the Soul ought not
to be debased for the satisfaction of the
Body. A limitted use of Pleasures is not to
be denied to the Body; but then that very
Limitation supposeth a better and more
noble end of Man, for the sake of which
they are limited. And after all, the
real Happiness of such limited Pleasures
consists not so much in the report of the
Senses enjoying them, as in the reflex
thoughts of the Soul forming to its self an
Act of Complacency, for having limited
them according to the Laws of God.
The unlimited use of these Pleasures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of conferring a real Benefit, involves
Men in Troubles and Anxieties; in Cares
and Dangers; and when enjoyed, endures


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34506:37"/>
but for a Moment, no longer than the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Sense continueth; when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
leaves only a Weariness and Nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
behind them. So then sensual
Pleasures conduce little to the Supreme
end of Man; unless we should be so
foolish as to imagine <hi>that</hi> to be the utmost
Happiness of Man, which renders him
happy but for a few moments.</p>
            <p>And then as to Riches, the natural
use of them is subordinated to sensual
Pleasures, and the Conveniencies of Life,
and therefore can bestow nothing beyond
them. If any imagine, as it cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that too many do, that the very satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of possessing Riches, without any
respect to the use of them, bears any
part in the Happiness of Man; this is so
gross and unmanly a Conception, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can exceed the wickedness of it,
nothing can equal the Folly of it. This
is a greater Depravation of Nature, than
all the Villanies of Sense, or Sins of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
and if no Punishment attended it
hereafter, would rather deserve our Scorn
than Envy. The Acquisition of Riches
is generally indeed, at least indirectly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the Enjoyment of sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
to be procured by them; and as
such, can carry the Happiness of them no


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34506:37"/>
farther, than the Nature of them will
permit, which we before considered.
Not to say, that it is an invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the unsatisfactoriness of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
that those who seek after them, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or never set bounds to their Desires;
and although in the acquiring of them,
they generally please themselves with the
thoughts of commanding all sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
when they shall have obtain'd them;
yet they seldom begin in earnest a Fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them; ever proposing an end to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and never taking possession of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by the Fruition of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Pleasures no provision is made for the
Happiness of the Soul, the far nobler
part of Man, which ought therefore to
be satisfied in the first place. The want
of real Happiness in the Soul may for a
time be stifled by powerful impressions of
Sense, but when those Motions cease, the
Soul cannot but be conscious of, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
the want of true Happiness. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>this,</hi> a Happiness agreeable to her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is spiritual; and to her Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is immortal, must befound
out. This can never be placed in sensual
Enjoyments, which expire with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of Sense; and while continuing,
affect not the Soul, unless with weariness


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34506:38"/>
in attending the violent motions of Sense.</p>
            <p>It is the reflex thoughts of the Soul alone,
which render it Happy: when it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon its own State without Remorse
or Sorrow; when it can view all its past A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and present Condition with a sweet
Complacency; when it considers it self u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
to God by executing his Commands,
and by a similitude of Holiness. None of
all these Conditions can be found in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Enjoyments. For what satisfaction is
it to a Man, after the Enjoyment is passed,
to have gratified this or that Sense? Do
we applaud our good Fortune for having
once enjoyed a Pleasure, the Sense of
which is long since expired? Or shall we
receive any Comfort after Death in the
remembrance of having possessed Riches
and Pleasures when alive? And all this,
although our use of those Pleasures and
Riches were moderate and lawful, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if it was immoderate, the stings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
of Conscience will perpetually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
the Soul, when reflecting on it. And
in that State it cannot but reflect continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
when it shall not be diverted by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
Motions of the Body, drowned by
Sleep, or stupified by Sense; when the sole
Object of her thoughts will be her past Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
and the consequences of it her
present Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:34506:38"/>
From this Consideration it will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
appear, how much more condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Piety and Vertue are to solid Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
than temporal Prosperity; even
altho no Rewards or Punishments should
attend the Soul in another Life. For
altho' Heaven and Earth should conspire
together to render any Man externally
Happy in this World; let an uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Possession of Riches and Pleasure, of
Health and Vigour, of Honour and Power
be bestowed on him: No one Act of
Pleasure, none of all these Blessings, will
be of advantage to him after the Cessation
of the actual Enjoyment of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Satisfaction and Happiness arising
from the Exercise of Piety, Justice and
Charity will continue to all Ages. The
same Complacency, which the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
when it first exerted any one of
these Actions, the same it shall receive
for ever, as often as Reflection shall be
made upon it; nay much greater after
Death, when all the Faculties of the Soul
will be enlarged, and that which is now
a simple Act of Complacency, will then
be advanced into an Extasie of Joy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Altho' <hi>Haman,</hi> when he spoke
these words, had no Apprehension of
being actually deprived of his Riches and


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34506:39"/>
Greatness, yet could not he, nor any other
in the like condition deny, but that the
Deprivation and loss of all their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Advantages is at least possible. The
knowledge of this possibility alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats
all the Pleasure which may arise
from the Fruition of temporal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
at least suffers it not to become such
as may satisfie the Soul of Man. For
all must acknowledge, in the midst of
their Enjoyments, that they want at least
this satisfaction to compleat their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
the assurance of the continuance
of it. The Possessors of it are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distracted with Fears of losing it, with
Cares of preserving it; and that very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude
proclaims the imperfection of
their Happiness.</p>
            <p>This Consideration might abundantly
convince Mankind, that true Felicity
consists not in the Pleasures of Sense or
secular Enjoyments. For can we believe
that God hath proposed such a supreme
end to Man, as the greatest part of Men
shall never be able to obtain; such as is
placed beyond their Power, not possible
to be attained by them? All other parts
of the Creation infallibly fulfil their end;
and shall Man alone be rendred incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to arrive at that end, which God and


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34506:39"/>
Nature proposed to him? Or shall such
an Happiness be assigned to him, which
a Sickness may defeat, the Malice of an
Enemy may ruin, a petty Accident may
overthrow? Let us not entertain such
mean Conceptions of our own Nature.
If worldly Men will pretend to know no
other Happiness, than what ariseth from
Sense, they must at least Confess the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of their Happiness, from the
possibility of Deprivation. And what
is possible in this, cannot but be always
feared by them, since they have no hope
left beyond it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Let the continuance of their
present Happiness be assured to them, yet
can it never be hoped, but little Crosses
will intervene; that all their Passions will
not always be gratified; and then, even
the least Cross, or the Disappointment of
any single Passion, will be sufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
their whole satisfaction and spoil
their Pleasure <hi>Haman</hi> enjoyed all which
his Sense, or most extravagant Lusts, could
crave, and had reason to hope the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of it; yet a petty Affront put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him by <hi>Mordecai</hi> afflicted him beyond
measure; took away the satisfaction of
his Riches and Honour; and forced him
amidst them all to conclude himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:34506:40"/>
Temporal Felicity depends upon a
complication of so many Causes, that it
never can arrive at Perfection, since it is
impossible that some of those Causes
should not miscarry; and the miscarriage
of any one will render the Operation of all
the rest ineffectual. It will not in that case
be sufficient to compensate for the loss of
one, by the possession of all other temporal
Advantages; rather Man will conclude
himself more unhappy in the absence of
that, than in the Presence of all these. Nay
the greater share he obtains of other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of fortune, the more he will afflict
himself for the want of what he in vain
Desires; since the concurrence of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Gifts of fortune most frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a Haughtiness of mind, which flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
it self with a fond Opinion of its
own worth and Greatness, and cannot
bear the least Disappointment.</p>
            <p>If then, Men devoted to the Pleasures
of this World have concluded themselves
unhappy amidst the affluence of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Enjoyments; if temporal Felicity be
unable to satisfie the Desires of the Soul,
to fill its Capacities, or perfect its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
if it be attended with perpetual
Cares and Distractions; if often impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be obtained by us; and always


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34506:40"/>
possible to be taken from us; if it may be
defeated by petty Accidents and Crosses,
and that such should happen, cannot be
avoided: If for these Reasons, and many
others which we cannot now insist upon,
they are unable to render any Man truly
happy; what remains, but that we
seek for true Happiness somewhere else.
If the former cannot be the Supreme end
of Man, and if it be natural to us to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
all our Actions to some end; it will
be necessary for us to find out some other
end, and when found out, to apply our
utmost Diligence to obtain it.</p>
            <p>And here perhaps humane Reason, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus far proceeded, might continue
to grope in the dark, and after a tedious
disquisition be unable to discover either
the end or the means of obtaining it.
God hath therefore, in Compassion to our
Infirmities, marked out both the Nature
and the means of Supreme Happiness.
The Nature of it is Peace of Conscience
here, and therein the hopes of the Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God hereafter, which Hopes shall
then be turned into Possession: the means
of it obedience to his Laws, and Faith in
Christ. By these we shall obtain an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
which shall fill the utmost Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
of the Soul, which shall be co-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34506:41"/>
with the duration of it; which
shall satisfie us but never weary us;
which shall affect all the Faculties both
of Soul and Body; which shall be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by no Crosses and Disasters;
which will never expire, but be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
every moment; which no adversity
of Fortune, nor infirmity of Body, which
neither the Malice of Men or Devils shall
be able to take from us.</p>
            <p>To a serious Application of your selves
to obtain this blessed State, I hope what
has been said will be no small Motive
to you. You all desire Happiness; and
if the Soul be once fully convinced, what
is the only true Happiness, it cannot but
move towards it, and exert all its Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the Acquisition of it. After a firm
perswasion, that this is indeed the end
of Man, there needs no Exhortation to
pursue it. The pursuit of it will then be
no less natural, than the satisfying of
Hunger, or any other reasonable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</p>
            <p>The misfortune is, that we suffer our
selves to be deluded by the impressions
of Sense and unruly Passions, represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and amplifying to us the Happiness
arising from the Fruition of carnal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and secular Delights; we are not


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34506:41"/>
unwilling these Passions should arise; we
permit these false Judgments to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
we are pleased at first with the
Delusion, altho' conscious of it; and at
last become so far stupified, that we do
not perceive it; until at last a terrible
Affliction or the approaches of Death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
the Soul, and revive its better No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
What those dreadful remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
may then do, Reason may <hi>now</hi> much
more easily and more certainly effect;
to reflect upon the Nature of worldly
Enjoyments, to consider their Vanity, and
discover their Emptiness. When this
Conviction is throughly formed, we
shall be even necessitated to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and fix our hopes in Heaven, and
then we are assured, that our Labours
directed thither shall not miscary; that
they shall be assisted by God, promoted
by his Spirit, and Crowned with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
Success which will give us satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Mind here, and fulness of Joy
hereafter. <hi>To this Joy, may God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <bibl>Job XXXVII. 23, 24.</bibl>
               <q>Touching the Almighty, we cannot find

he will not afflict. Men do therefore

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE ground of all Religion, whether
Natural or Revealed, consists in the
knowledge of the Nature of God, and
of his Conduct in the Government of the
World. The first representeth him to
Man, as a fit object of Adoration; the
latter perswadeth Man to adore him.


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34506:42"/>
Without the first there would be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to adore him; without the latter no
Obligation. The perfection therefore of
any Religion consists in an accurate Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of these Matters; in giving right
Notions of the Nature of God, and in
teaching with certainty the method of
his external Actions. The former is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the same, and admits no Variation;
the latter may receive Improvements in
relation to Man, and lay greater Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on him under one Dispensation than
under another.</p>
            <p>So much of both may be known by
the light of Reason, as may direct Men
aright to the Worship of God, if they
imploy their reason in a due manner; and
convince them at the same time of their
Obligation to worship him; but both
may be mistaken in the natural use of the
understanding; and when mistaken, will
equally defeat the Worship of God; a
mistake of the first Nature leading Men
into Idolatry, of the second into Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and Impiety. It is not so easie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to mistake concerning the first, the
Nature of God, which may easily be
discerned by the weakest understanding,
I mean so much of it, as serves to beget
Notions of Religion in Men. All Men,


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34506:43"/>
whether true Believers or Idolaters, agree
in this common Notion of God, that he
is a most perfect Being; and then surely
it is no hard matter to determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Omnipotence, Omniscience, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence,
and such like, be necessary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
without which a most perfect
Being cannot subsist. Yet Mankind hath
most miserably mistaken in this plain and
easie matter; hath deified Creatures,
which have none of all these Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
hath quitted sometimes even the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God, but oft-times corrupted it.
And these mistakes Revealed Religion
doth rectifie; and restore to Men, what
they had willfully lost, the knowledge of
the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>But this is not our present Design,
which concerns the external Actions of
God, and his Government of the World,
wherein it is no hard matter for Man to
mistake, deriving his knowledge from
the light of Reason only. It is possible
for such a one to form such right Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the external Conduct of God,
from the Consideration of his Attributes,
as may incite him to the Worship of God,
and direct him in it. But this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
will fall infinitely short of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
and this Direction of that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34506:43"/>
which is to be had in Revealed
Religions; and even in Revelations ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of greater or lesser Degrees, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the greater or lesser manifestation
of the Will of God therein, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Benefits to the followers of that
Revelation. So that however the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Reasons of worshipping God continue
the same in both Cases, being drawn from
the Attributes of God, which are always
the same, yet in Revealed Religions they
are both improved and enhanced, and
also secured from the danger of Error.</p>
            <p>And how great that Danger is, the
Scripture fully declareth to us, by the
Example of <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends. That
whole Book being employed in discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Laws and method of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Government in relation to Man, as
far as the light of Reason could discover.
For none of them had yet received the
benefit of Revelation, which was not
made to them till after the Conclusion of
their discourse, in the end of the Book.
All of them both knew and worshipped
the true God, were eminent for Wisdom
in their Generations, and one of them
approved by an extraordinary Testimony
of God himself; yet all of them proposed
so many different Opinions concerning the


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34506:44"/>
external Government of God; and all of
them were mistaken. All of them agreed
in the common Reasons of the worship of
God, yet all of them mistook in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of those Attributes from whence
they were formed. The Reasons are well
summed up in the words of my Text;
and in them also sufficient matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
the several Errors proposed by these
Men. <hi>Touching the Almighty we cannot find
him out: He is excellent in power, and in
judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will
not afflict. Therefore do men fear him.</hi> The
words therefore will naturally give me
an occasion to Discourse.
<list>
                  <item>I. Of the Reason of the Worship of God,
founded in the Attributes of the Text.</item>
                  <item>II. Of the Errors committed by <hi>Job</hi>
and his Friends, which they drew indeed
from these Attributes, but may more
truly be confuted by them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Reason of the worship or fear
of God among Men, is declared by Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration
of those Attributes, which are
chiefly to be considered by us in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
and worship of God. Our first
Notion of him, and on which all the rest
are founded, is, that he enjoyeth all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
which can meet in one and the
same Being. And this is designed by the


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34506:44"/>
first part of the Text; where the word <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi>
in our Translation, signifieth <hi>All-sufficient</hi>
or <hi>supremely perfect,</hi> in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
We admire single Perfections in
other Objects; in one Power, in another
Wisdom, in a third Vertue; and these not
only possessed by so many several Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
but also in a limited manner. Yet
we revere and admire these single and
limited Perfections, wheresoever we find
them, and acknowledge it to be unjust to
deny that Deference which is due to them.
When therefore all imaginable Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are conjoyned in God, it is but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to conclude that all the Fear, the Awe,
the Regard, the Love we pay to other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
upon account of those single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
we discover in them, ought to
be conjoyned, when we reflect on God,
and be paid as a just Debt to him. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
considers them, may perhaps thro'
a stupid or depraved Mind omit or even
reject the Worship of God; but at the
same time he cannot deny him to be most
worthy to be Worshipped.</p>
            <p>In the next place, as the Nature of
God is infinite, so his Actions are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable;
or, as it is in the Text, <hi>We
cannot find him out.</hi> Which may respect
either the incomprehensible Essence of


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34506:45"/>
the Deity, or the unsearchableness of his
Judgments in the Government of the
World. As to the first, it is no small
Argument of our Obligation to render
the most profound Adoration to him, that
he is of infinite Dignity, so great that
we cannot comprehend it or measure the
extent of it. Here below, we propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
our Esteem and Devotion to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and Dignity of Persons; and should
confess our selves unjust, if we made not
a distinction therein. The same Rules of
Justice therefore, will require us to form
of God the most noble Conception, to
render to him the most humble Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
which are possible to the Faculties
of the Soul.</p>
            <p>Again, if the Methods of the Divine
Conduct be unknown and unsearchable
to Man, this will yet farther raise our
Opinion of the Infinity of his Nature;
since if his external Effects exceed our
Conception, much more will his Nature,
the Cause and Fountain of them. This
will also teach us not to enquire too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
into the Secrets of his Providence,
not to determine any thing rashly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, which is not revealed to us.
Indeed when the Knowledge of the Rules
of his Government is bestowed on us by


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34506:45"/>
Revelation, we are firmly to believe it,
and may without danger of Error and
Presumption apply those Rules to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Cases. But as we ought not to
have fixed any Rules to him, before we
received the light of Revelation; so after
the Reception of it, we are not to carry
our Conjectures of Assertions beyond
what is revealed to us. We might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
indeed without it, that God could
do nothing unjust, nothing which is not
Holy: But this would not have warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us to determine the way, wherein
his Justice and Holiness should exert
themselves by external Effects.</p>
            <p>Upon account of these Attributes God
is most worthy of Adoration; but there
wants yet somewhat to perswade Men to
pay that Tribute to God. If neither Hope
nor Fear interposed, Men would esteem
themselves unconcerned in the Worship
of God, the Obligation of it weak, the
Trouble of it unnecessary. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is abundantly supplyed by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Attributes; whereof the first is
his Omnipotence; <hi>He is excellent in power,</hi>
God is able to vindicate the Honour of
his Name, by inflicting exemplary Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
upon those who neglect to
worship him; or worship him in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34506:46"/>
unbecoming his Nature, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the light of Reason or Revelation.
So then it is a most effectual Motive of
Divine Worship to consider, that as it is
the Duty of Man to worship God, so it
is most just; and if most just, must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be required by God; that if this
Duty be neglected, we are in the hands
of him to whom the Injury is offered,
may be annihilated by a single Nod, may
be chastifed with severe Punishments,
may be rendred miserable for ever.</p>
            <p>This Attribute of Power, in Affairs of
the World, produceth Fear and the Signs
of external Respect, beyond all other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
This secures the Authority of
Laws, and Majesty of Princes; that the
one cannot be violated, the other cannot
be contemned without Danger. This is
generally supposed to have at first begat
Idolatry; when Men following the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of their Senses more than the light
of Reason, fondly imagined, that their
Princes, their Leaders or Conquerors,
were the most powerful of all Beings;
and upon that account rendred that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to them which is due to Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
I mean Adoration. They found
themselves to be at their disposal, their
Lives at their Mercy; or extraordinary


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34506:46"/>
Actions effected by them; and believing
these to be the most illustrious Marks of
Power, deifyed the Possessors of them.
If then the Prospect of that little Power,
which is vested in Men, could procure
Adoration from those who followed the
Dictates of their Senses only; much more
will the <hi>excellence</hi> of the Divine Power, as it
is here called, induce Men to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, being manifested both from
Sense and Reason.</p>
            <p>In mortal Men, Power, far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
adorable, may oftimes become exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable,
may occasion the unhappiness of
others, may administer Assistance to sins
and violence; and notwithstanding such
wicked Power may awe and terrifie Men
(as both ancient and modern Idolaters
have worshipped Devils, lest they should
hurt them) this will never create an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Reverence in Men, in which chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Adoration consists. The most exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Power of finite Beings cannot rescue
them from their own Imperfections; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
Limits, and is capable of Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
If yet such a Power can strike
thy Mind, can affright thee from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
what is displeasing to it; if thou
darest not resist its Commands, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
submitest to it; how much more art


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34506:47"/>
thou obliged to revere the Omnipotence
of God, where Power and Goodness are
sweetly joyned together, where no Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
can be found, nothing excluded
from the reach of it, no Cessation to be
expected? If thou pretendest not to know
this Power, consider the Nature of God,
and judge whether Omnipotence be not
a necessary Attribute of a most perfect
Being. If thou appealest to Sense, view
the Fabrick of the World, pass through
Heaven and Earth; thou shalt discover
the Footsteps of Omnipotence in every
part of it. If thou pretendest yet not to
see what is most evident, reflect upon the
Faculties of thy own Soul, and say, who
gave them to thee? consider the Fabrick
of thy Body, who formed it for thee. These
are undeniable Marks of thy Subjection
to an Almighty Power, which even if
thou dost deny, it is by Faculties of Soul
and Body created by <hi>him,</hi> that thou canst
deny it.</p>
            <p>Thus we perceive, that the Power
of God is uncontroulable and infinite;
that he is able to inflict whatsoever Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
he pleaseth on his disobedient
Creatures. And then lest we should
vainly imagine this Power to be useless
in respect of us, and like antiquated Laws,


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34506:47"/>
never put in execution, we are told in the
next place; that God is excellent in <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
also; that he will most certainly
judge Manking, and punish them for the
Omission of their Duty. For so <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
doth almost every where signifie in
Scripture, the infliction of Punishment
upon Delinquents. This is the chief
Mark of the Divine Government of the
World, to take a Survey of the Actions
of Men, and punish them for the Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those publick Laws, which are
fixed to Mankind and prescribed for their
direction. Nothing but the most extreme
stupidity can defeat the Success of this
Argument of Divine Worship; since this
equally affects both the Wife and Foolish,
by striking their Imaginations with the
fear of Misery. A Fear which will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the Mind of Man, when no other
Argument can prevail. The Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God may be slighted; the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his Nature may be neglected;
his Power may be derided, when not
put in execution; but the belief of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be inflicted upon Sinners will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
the Consciences, and affright the
Thoughts of Men; And that even altho'
the manner of the Execution of this
Judgment should be unknown to them;


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34506:48"/>
as in natural Religion. For let the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
be uncertain as to their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
let the time of their Execution
be hid from Sinners; yet this they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but know, that God is the Supreme
Governour of the World; that as such he
will exercise Judgment; and that as his
Power exceeds that of the most formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Judicature on Earth, so his Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
will be correspondent, exceeding
what Man can inflict.</p>
            <p>And herein appears the <hi>excellence</hi> of this
Judgment, mentioned in the Text. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Judicatures can take hold only of the
external Actions of Men, and even these
may sometimes be hid from them; the
Power of the Offender may set him above
the reach of Punishments; they may be
evaded by crafty Defences, may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by the Interposition of some greater
Power, may be avoided by Death, and
will certainly be finished by it. But in
the Execution of the Divine Judgment it
is far otherwise: There the most secret
Actions of Men are call'd in question, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
their Thoughts cannot escape disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
The Judge cannot be blinded by
crafty Insinuations, nor diverted from his
Resolution by extraneous Causes. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can rescue us out of his hands, not


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34506:48"/>
even Death it self; his Dominion extends
beyond the Grave, reaches the Soul of
Man, and surmounts the resistance of all
created Beings. If then Fear can affect
Men; if Punishments can deter them;
if Power can awe them; if the certainty
of all these can convince them; they do
all combine to secure the Worship of
God, and continue Religion in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>But then, lest we should seem Slaves
to God, and Servants, through Fear only,
he dispenseth Rewards as well as Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Men. <hi>He is excellent in plenty
of Justice,</hi> in the words of the Text. He
rewards the Obedience of Men to his
Precepts, not because any Reward was
due to them, but because he delighteth
in dispensing his Benefits; and then his
Justice will require, that he dispense them
to the most worthy, We are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
how powerful an Argument Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
is in moving the Hearts of Men.
What draweth Attendants to Princes, or
Servants to Great Men, but the Power
of rewarding them, and the prospect of
Preferment to be attain'd by their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours?
This seldom fails to secure to
them those Duties, which are due from
Dependants, Honour and Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:34506:49"/>
And if we would but raise our Souls
from the Earth, and carry them beyond
the Objects of Sense, it would no less ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
secure what is due to God from
us; Adoration of his Majesty, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his Laws. The Rewards to
be attained are far greater, such as the
Donor will not, and such as all the other
Powers of the World cannot take away
from us; such as shall not be determined
by Time, nor restrained by any Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The assurance also of obtaining
them is far more certain, being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Promise of him, who can give
what he pleaseth, and will give what he
Promiseth; whereas the Favours expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from Men may be defeated by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness,
by Unfaithfulness; may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted
by others, may become impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be bestowed. If then God by
his Infinite and most certain Rewards
cannot procure what Men obtain by their
Petty and uncertain Favours, Fear and
Reverence; we must deplore the Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and obstinate Perverseness of Men,
who, refusing to hearken to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of obedience propos'd by God, yield
to those proposed by Men<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the same Passion (that of Desire) but
in a much lower Degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:34506:49"/>
Lastly, to secure in our Minds such
Thoughts of God, as are befitting his
Majesty and Holiness, lest our Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of him should be corrupted with any
Suspicions of Injustice entertained at the
same time, it is added in the end of the
Verse, <hi>He will not afflict.</hi> In this Life,
the Rules and Method, whereby God
dispenseth his Rewards and Punishments,
may be very obscure to us. He may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the righteous to be afflicted; he may
permit the wicked to Prosper; he may
in appearance cut off the Hopes of good
Men by present Miseries, and encourage
the Disobedience of bad Men by tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Felicity; <hi>His ways may be unsearchable,
and his judgments past finding out.</hi> But
from hence we must not conceive any
Opinion of Injustice in God, or Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the Administration of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Although the Secrets of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
be unknown to us, this we are
assured of, that he is infinitely Just and
Holy, and that being such, <hi>he will not
afflict.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Mysterious Obscurity of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
herein, was the occasion of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
of <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends, which I
proposed, and come now to consider, in
the second place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:34506:50"/>
To Solve this Difficulty, every one of
them formed a different Opinion; yet all
came short of Truth. <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> who
spake first, asserted that God inflicted
temporal Misfortunes on no Man, but by
way of Punishment for some enormous
Sins; and therefore urged <hi>Job,</hi> to confess
his secret Sins, and give Glory to God,
as it is XXII. 5. <hi>Is not thy wickedness
great, and thine iniquities infinite?</hi> And so
on: Where he affirmeth <hi>Job</hi> to be the
greatest of Sinners, only because God had
heaped extraordinary Calamities upon
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bildad</hi> maintaind, that God might,
as the supreme and absolute Governour
of the World, afflict Man without any
respect to antecedent Sins; but then
that he was bound in Justice to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
it to him by subsequent Prosperity.
For thus he expresseth himself, VIII. 6, 7.
<hi>If thou wert pure and upright; surely now
he would awake for thee, and make the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of thy Righteousness prosperous.
Though thy beginning was small; yet thy
latter end should greatly increase.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zophar</hi> delivereth his Opinion through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole XI. <hi>Chap.</hi> that God might in
right of his supreme Power, lay the heaviest
Afflictions upon Men, without any respect


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34506:50"/>
either to Antecedent Sin, or subsequent
Recompence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elihu</hi> thought that God might afflict
good and bad Men indifferently; but that
if good Men received the Affliction hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and with submission, and addressed
themselves to God by Prayer for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of it; and if bad Men were moved
to repent through it, God would remove
the Affliction, and restore prosperity to
them, especially if an Angel interceded
for them, as he expresseth himself at large
in the XXXIII. <hi>Chap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly <hi>Job.</hi> whatever his Opinion might
be, while his Calamity was yet fresh, and
any hopes remained of the speedy removal
of it; or however he might alter his
Judgment after the Revelation of God,
in the end of the Book; yet in the midst
of his Troubles, when the Disease grew
inveterate, and no hope of Delivery yet
appeared; he seems to have thought, that
God inter-medled not in the proceedings
of the World, and reserved neither Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for the good, nor Punishments
for the bad. Which Opinion he proposeth
chiefly in the XXI. <hi>Chap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these Opinions were alike errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and yet all founded upon the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of God; those of <hi>Eliphaz, Bildad</hi>


               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:34506:51"/>
and <hi>Elihu,</hi> upon his Justice; those of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar</hi>
and <hi>Job,</hi> upon his Power. The Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the Three first, plainly arose from
hence, that they pretending to determine
Matters above their knowledge, confined
the Exercise of the Divine Judgment, and
consequently the Dispensation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishments, to this Life on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
Had this, which they all supposed,
been indeed true, one at least of their
Opinions must necessarily have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
otherwise the Justice of God
could not be cleared.</p>
            <p>But what ground had they to conclude,
that God exercised his Judgments in this
Life only? Might not the Nature of Man,
the quality of the Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be inflicted on an immaterial
and immortal Soul, teach them that
another World was a far more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Tribunal for this Judicature? Or
if they knew not the Nature of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for want of Revelation, yet at
least the example of the Patriarchs, with
which they were not unacquainted, and
wherewith our Saviour afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
the Jews; might not, I say, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of their Afflictions and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
have taught them, that God did not
ultimately bestow his Rewards, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34506:51"/>
not his Punishments, in this
Life? They had received glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of some extraordinary Benefits to
be received from God, Promises, which
might justly make them expect some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Advantages beyond the rest of
Mankind<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> yet none of all these just Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
were satisfied in this World,
wherein they were Strangers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims,
exposed to Injuries, and troubled
with frequent Afflictions, and that till
Death; an invincible Argument, that
God reserved the Consummation of their
Hopes and his Promises to another Life.</p>
            <p>As to the Opinion of <hi>Zophar,</hi> that God
might bring Afflictions on Men for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end, than to demonstrate his abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and arbitrary Power over Mankind,
that overthroweth both the Wisdom and
Justice of God: It would render his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
Tyrannical, and even like to that
of Hell, which Sports in the Misery of
Mankind. God is a most wise Being, and
cannot do such a vain Act; he is a most
just Being, and cannot execute such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
Sentence. He never afflicts, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers
Men by extraordinary Power in this
Life, but either for their Reward, their
Punishment, or their Correction. As for
the Prosperity or Affliction, which may


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34506:52"/>
befall Men in the ordinary Course of
the Government of the World, they may
respect indeed none of all those Ends,
nor do they concern our present Case.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The Opinion of <hi>Job,</hi> that God
interpofeth not extraordinarily in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Mankind, might be confuted
from the same Attributes and Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
For we must not suppose that
God allowed and ratified whatsoever he
had said, when he gave such an illustrious
Testimony of Integrity to him in the close
of the Book. That was only to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
him from the Aspersions of his
Friends, more particularly <hi>Eliphas</hi> and
<hi>Elihu,</hi> maintaining that his Afflictions had
befallen him for the Enormity of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
Sins. God confirmed not his
Speeches made in answer to them by
this Suffrage; and therefore <hi>Job</hi> himself
deploreth the rashness of his Opinion in
XLII. 6. <hi>Wherefore I abhor my self, and
repent in dust and ashes.</hi> And indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be more false, or derogatory
to the Majesty of God, and the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of his Honour among Men. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Job</hi> asserted not pertinaciously, as his
Friends did their Opinions; he conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not peremptorily, but only confessed,
that he could not discover any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34506:52"/>
interposition of God, by visible Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in this Life.</p>
            <p>An Opinion indeed, which too many
have taken up; and some do yet maintain;
but which cannot be allowed without the
utter ruin of Religion, and Reason also.
For do we not believe that God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
good and just; that he is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Governour of the World both in
this Life, and after Death? But can we
conceive <hi>him</hi> to be infinitely good, who
after having created Man and settled him
in the World, takes no farther care of
him, abandons him to Chance, and there
stops the Emanations of his Goodness? Can
he be perfectly just, who makes no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for the universal Calamities, or Opres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Mankind, which cannot but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
happen notwithstanding the ordinary
Laws of his Government, which consist on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in maintaining the Course of Nature?
Do we not destroy his Government, when
we confine it only to another Life, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
allow it no place in either? Since
God hath created the World, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of it hath become necessary
to him; and then not to derive at any
time, any extraordinary influences up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, will be no more commendable,
than for a temporal Prince to sit still and


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34506:53"/>
be unconcerned for the Affairs of his
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thus far Reason will direct us; but then
Revelation giveth us greater assurance
of the constant and immediate Protection
of God even in this Life. <hi>We have the
Promises of this Life, and of that which is
to come;</hi> we are told, That <hi>all things shall
work together for good to us;</hi> That <hi>whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we shall ask of God with Faith,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
doubt, <hi>he will do it;</hi> and that <hi>he
will never leave us, nor forsake us.</hi> All these
and many more such Arguments, include
an extraordinary influence of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he Administers the Government of the
World, satisfies his Justice, and declares
his Goodness.</p>
            <p>Thus all the Attributes of God natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
lead us to the Worship of him; thus
we cannot conceive his Nature without
adoring it; cannot consider his Judgments
and Justice without fearing his Displeasure,
and obeying his Commands; thus are we on
every side surrounded with Arguments of
our Duty. <hi>May God by his Grace improve
the Efficacy of these Arguments to every one of
us, for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi>

            <p>AMONG all the miscarriages of
Mankind, none are more fatal,
and at the same time more ordinary,
than those which proceed from a mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Opinion of their own Nature or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
It is a deplorable misfortune in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that Man should be subject to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
in a Matter so nearly concerning


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34506:54"/>
himself; that he, who pretends to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
Heaven and Earth, to discover the
Properties of invisible Beings, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his Knowledge both to precedent
and future Times, should remain in the
dark as to his own Condition, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
erroneous Opinions of his own, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
natural or acquired Merits.</p>
            <p>Not to comprehend perfectly the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, is no wonder; the infinity
of his Essence surpasseth the Capacity of
our finite Understandings. Not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
accurately the Properties of imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Beings, whether Angels or separate
Souls, may be excusable; immateriality
may easily confound an Apprehension inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
only to sensible Objects: but to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in the Nature, the Dignity, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
of our selves, might be justly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
if the frequency of such Mistakes
did not take off the Admiration of them.
If they extended no farther than Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they might perhaps be pardoned, and
befit the Consideration of Philosophers
only and thinking Men; but when they
reach to almost all the Actions of the
Soul, introduce false Principles of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
which at last become fatal to the
real Interest of Mankind, it will concern
all Men to take notice of them, and to
acquire more just Conceptions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:34506:54"/>
To this purpose Reason invites
us, the Scripture directs us, to enter into
the serious Consideration of our selves, to
contract our Thoughts, and not carry
them beyond our Merits, to form a just
Esteem of our Perfections, and not in an
over-weening Confidence of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
our Pretensions beyond the Rules
of Justice and Sobriety. Which is the
sum of the Exhortation delivered by
the Apostle in the words of the Text; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
directed indeed more particularly to
those Christians of his time, who upon
pretence of extraordinary Gifts, whether
of Knowledge, Miracles or other Graces,
despised their Fellow Christians, who
were less gifted; became proud and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant;
invaded the Offices of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
and violated the publick Order
of the Church; but delivered in such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Terms, as equally oppose all other
Errors of Men concerning the Dignity of
their Nature, or the Greatness of their
Merits; recommended by a peculiar Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of Divine Authority. <hi>For I say unto
you, through the Grace given unto me,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to all Christians, <hi>To every Man
that is among you;</hi> altho' all cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to have been guilty of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Exorbitance; and proposed in


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34506:55"/>
such a general Precept, as will obviate
all the aforementioned Mistakes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies:
<hi>Not to think of himself
more highly than he ought to think.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall consider it then as such a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Precept; and shew
<list>
                  <item>I. The Reasonableness of it.</item>
                  <item>II. The Usefulness of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. The Reasonableness of it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by comparing the fond and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Pretensions of Men, with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
of their Nature. Man is apt
fal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ly to perswade himself that he is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more noble sort of Being, than he
really is. He pleaseth himself with vast
Conceptions of his own Dignity, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Confidence of them raiseth his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
to Matters beyond his Capacity,
at least beyond his Merit.</p>
            <p>This was the Original of all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of Mankind; from hence was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
the Fall of our first Parents; to this
we are to ascribe our present and future
Misery. The wicked Angels had led
the way, who were no sooner created,
but reflecting on the Excellency of their
Nature, the Dignity of their Order, and
the Capacity of their Understandings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Proud and Insolent, rebelled against
God, and attempted an Independency on


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34506:55"/>
the Crown of Heaven. Man soon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Example of those wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
who reflecting on the Faculties of
his own Soul, which were then intire and
vigorous, exalted with the Happiness of
his present Condition, which was then
free from Cares and Crosses, entertained
a foolish Ambition of improving his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to somewhat yet greater, even of
making himself like to God himself; and
so being falsely perswaded by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
that the way to Compass his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
was to eat of the forbidden Fruit,
he fell from his former Happiness, and
entailed Misery upon all his Posterity;
whose Happiness was from thence abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
their Faculties enervated, and their
Perfections lessened.</p>
            <p>Yet could not the dreadful Example of
their first Parents, nor the Conscience of
their much greater Imperfections divert
succeeding Mankind from engaging
themselves in the same Mistakes. They
lost the Dignity, but retained the Pride
of their Forefathers, keep up their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions,
and flatter themselves with an
over-great Opinion of their own Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
For not to mention the Impiety
of Atheists, who pretend to be wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
from God, and deny to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34506:56"/>
their Existence from him; to omit
the Profaness of ancient Epicureans, and
many modern Deists, who disown his
Government of the World, and imagine
themselves to be freed absolutely from
his Dominion; even those who own the
Existence of God, his Government of the
World, and their own Dependance on
him, still continue extravagant Pretences
to greater Perfections, than were design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for them. We commonly imagine
our selves to be the top of the Creation;
and that all other Beings, Heaven and
Earth, Angels and Animals, were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
merely for our Service. Hence we
form a lofty Conceit of our own Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and look down upon other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
with disdain; we grow angry, if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth do not continually conspire
to advance our Interests; we think our
selves injured, if the general Laws of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
be not violated for the Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Concerns; we project extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Schemes of Happiness, and then
are apt to murmur against God, if they
are not effected. We scorn <hi>that</hi> imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Happiness, which his Providence
hath assigned us in the World; we esteem
it inferiour to the supposed Dignity of our
Nature, and think it impossible, that so


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34506:56"/>
noble a Being should not enjoy some
greater Happiness, than what we find be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to us in this Life.</p>
            <p>This Happiness most Men place in the
satisfaction of their Senses; but then
quickly perceiving that even more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Beings enjoy the same satisfaction,
they turmoil themselves about enhancing
the Pleasures of Sense. To this Purpose
they either seek after Riches, or let loose
the Reins to Luxury; but after all, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves disappointed they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
discontented, because not obtaining
a Happiness correspondent to the Esteem
of their own Merits. Or if any of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Education and more noble Thoughts,
seek this Felicity in the Perfection of their
Souls, yet are not they free from the like
Mistake, but aim at greater Perfections
than their Nature will bear; carry their
Enquiries into Matters too hard for them,
and then become disquieted, because the
Knowledge of such things is denied to
them; because they find their Souls to be
oft-times dull and devoid of Vigour, and
cannot hinder the Perturbation of them
by Commotions from the Body; and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Experience the decay of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
With these Thoughts they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
themselves; and imagining their


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34506:57"/>
Nature to be somewhat greater, than it
really is, vainly endeavour to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from all these Imperfections.</p>
            <p>Such are the common mistakes of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
mistakes which few escape. But
then there are other particular, yet fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Mistakes derived from the same
Fountain, which are no less gross, and
far more prejudicial to the Interests of
another Life. From this irrational Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of their own Excellency many Men
are tempted to believe, that they lay an
Obligation upon God, when they execute
his Commands and perform his Will.
They imagine the Benefit redoundeth to
God, and that it is no small kindness to
him to hearken to his Proposals of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and thence are often drawn into a
false Perswasion, that God will wink at
their Impenitence, rather than forfeit the
satisfaction of saving them.</p>
            <p>This Error hath prevailed so far, that
among many Christians it is believed, that
God may in a strict Sense be made a
Debtor to Man by works of Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and others perswade themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a belief of particular Decrees of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Predestination made in Favour
of them. They may pretend indeed for
the ground of their Perswasion the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34506:57"/>
Will of God, but the true Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it will be discovered to be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a proud Opinion of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
beyond their fellow Christians;
which makes them arrogant and morose,
and so possesseth their Brains, that they
imagine God to be in Love with them,
and ready to relax the general Terms of
Salvation, and forego his Commands of
a strict Obedience, for their sakes. This
false perswasion sometimes advanceth so
far, as to believe themselves placed by
their extraordinary, and at the same time
unaccountable, Excellency beyond the
Obligation of the common Laws and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of the Church, and thence bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
invade those Offices which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
entrusted to them, and disturb the
publick Order of the Church, as not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to perform those Duties which
are owing to the whole Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and to all the Members of it in
particular; which Offence the Apostle
more particularly complains of in this
place.</p>
            <p>These are the most notorious Errors
which proceed from the unreasonable
Conceit of Men concerning their own
worth. If we enquire into the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all these Pretences, we shall find


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34506:58"/>
them very frivolous. Man is far from
such an excellent Being, as these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
suppose him to be. His Original
is mean and common to him with the
most ignoble Animals. While yet an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
nothing can be discovered in him,
which distinguishes him from brute Beasts,
except a greater Inability of helping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Nothing of Reason can be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in him, which must afterwards be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled
by Degrees, by the Care and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of others; or if born with him,
yet exerts it self but slowly, and would
never become considerable without the
direction of others. So that it is no ill
Conceit of the Philosopher, that Man
at first is born an Animal, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
becomes rational. Were it not for
this Education, it is not improbable, that
Man would creep upon all four, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Beasts as well in the posture of his
Body, as in the brutishness of his Life.
When after a thousand Chances, which
might have destroyed him, he is grown
up to be a Man, he still leads a more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
Life, than any other part of the
Creation. If any one of the Elements
perform not their Office; if the Earth
should deny her Fruits, or the Air its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign
Influences; if any one of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34506:58"/>
possible Accidents should light upon
him, his Life is ended; which whilst it
continueth, is perplexed with continual
Cares, turmoiled with constant Labours,
exposed to infinite Adversities, and after
all supported with inconsiderable Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
            <p>For what greater Matter do we enjoy
here below, than more ignoble Creatures
do? Length of Life, Agility, Accuracy of
Sense, satisfaction of it, and all carnal
Pleasures are even common to them. We
can employ indeed the Thoughts of a
rational Soul, which is more than they
can do; but alas this Priviledge would
have been scarce desireable, had not God
promoted Arts and Sciences among Men,
by raising their Apprehensions at first
with extraordinary Revelations. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
God did not at first reveal these
Arts and Sciences, yet would Man never
have obtained that Sagacity, which was
necessary to the Invention of them, if
God had not raised them from the present
Objects of Sense, and excited them to the
Improvement of Knowledge, by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
to them supernatural Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
That part, and that the greatest
part of Mankind, which have not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
those Advantages, do so little


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34506:59"/>
exercise these Faculties of the Soul; that
it would be no great increase of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of an unthinking Beast, to be put
into their Condition. Or if all Men could
naturally obtain clear and noble Thoughts
of things; yet would this but add little
to their Happiness; while uncertain of
its future State, for want of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>To a Soul which graspeth Eternity, it
cannot but be a continual Affliction to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the certainty of Death, and
the uncertainty of what will succeed it.
If he endeavours to remove these melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
Thoughts by sensual Pleasures, he
will find little satisfaction in them; if he
gives himself up wholly to them, he will
soon grow weary of them. When he
hath run through all the Scenes of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and looks back upon his Enjoyments,
he will confess the Emptiness of them,
and scarce desire to retrieve them. Such
a Man when he comes to die, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
wish to live over his Life again, but
then 'tis only in Hopes of obtaining grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Happiness therein than he did before.
Scarce any Man, however having plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
enjoyed all the satisfactions of this
Life; if his Life could be renewed to him
upon Condition of living again in the


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34506:59"/>
same and in no other manner than he did
before, would esteem it any great Benefit.
He might perhaps accept it through fear
of Death; because he knows not what
it is to die: but for the intrinsick Merit
of it, he would hardly judge it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable.
Such is the Condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Life considered in a natural State,
and what great Excellency can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in all this, which may nourish
our Pride, or enlarge our Pretences? So
inconsiderable a part of the Universe is
Mankind.</p>
            <p>And then, shall so mean a Being vie
with God, require the general Laws of
Providence to be over-ruled for his sake,
become swoln with Pride, think himself
more worthy than all the rest of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and continually aspire to greater
Priviledges, than were at first assigned
to him? Alas poor Mortal, however thou
mayst advance thy Pretences, and flatter
thy self with a fond Opinion of thy own
Greatness; that Body which thou carriest
about with thee, and canst not shake off;
that very Body upon which, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances
of it, thou so much valuest thy
self, proclaim thy Imperfection. If I
should call thee Dust and Ashes; thy
end will manifest thee to be no more; but


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34506:60"/>
this will only express thy Infirmity: I
want a word to express the Vanity of
thy mind. If I should call thee nothing;
thy self hast often confessed thy self to
be worse than nothing; when amidst
the Crosses of fortune, or torments of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
thou hast often wished to become
nothing, for to avoid them; and wilt
once again wish it after Death, if thou
dost not correct thy foolish Arrogance.
So little Reason hath Man in general to
value himself upon the Excellency of his
Nature; and as to the divers Pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before-mentioned, hath yet much
less.</p>
            <p>If Atheists pretend an independent
Existence from God, let them demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
it by continuing their Existence for
ever. If they could at first bestow Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
upon themselves, they may by the
same Power always continue it: if this
exceeds their Ability, much more will
the other. If Deists assert the Actions of
Man to be uncontrouled by God, and the
Government of the World to be wholly
neglected by him; let them reconcile to
such stupid Negligence the eternal Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of Justice, Wisdom, and Goodness,
which they allow to be in God; let them
stifle, if they can, the Checks of their


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34506:60"/>
Conscience for Sins committed in secret;
and solve the undeniable Characters of
extraordinary Providence interposing in
the World.</p>
            <p>These impious Opinions indeed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be received by the followers of any
revealed Religion; but the others
may.</p>
            <p>As first, That all other parts of the
Creation were made for the sake, and
the service of Man alone. An Opinion,
which however generally taken up by
Men, and in some measure Useful to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
their Gratitude to their Creator,
yet seems to have proceeded from too
great an esteem of humane Nature,
and tendeth directly to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>oment its Pride.
It is certain indeed, that almost all parts
of the visible World are subservient to the
use of Man; that God hath not denied to
us the use of any one of them; in which
sense it may indeed be said, that all
things were created for the use of Man;
as it is said in Scripture, <hi>Man was created
for the Woman, and the Woman for the
Man,</hi> that is, not for that end alone,
but for that among other Reasons. And
thus even the Angels are subservient to
Man, being sent forth as <hi>Ministring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
to such, as <hi>are heirs of Salvation.</hi>


               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:34506:61"/>
But to imagine that all things were Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
only for the use and the sake of
Man, hath no appearance of Truth.
To affirm that of the blessed Angels,
who are so far superiour to us in Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
would be an intolerable Arrogance;
and to assert it even of other created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
would be a vain Presumption.
Perhaps not the thousandth part of the
Universe is visible to us; And then what
are we concerned in so many vast Orbs
as are beyond our Heavens? I know
many have imagined them to have been
created for the Seat of God, and the
Reception of our glorified Bodies after
the Resurrection; but that is too gross a
Conceit to need any Refutation. Even
in the visible World no small part of the
Creation lays undiscovered, and not a
little of what we know is wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>useful
to us. It becomes us rather with
Reverence to reflect upon our Subjection
to God our common Creatour, than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to set our selves before the rest of
the Creation, and flatter our selves into
an ambitious Opinion of an Universal
Monarchy.</p>
            <p>In the next place to ascribe so much
Excellency to our Nature, as to imagine
that the general Laws of Providence


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34506:61"/>
ought to be violated for the Convenience
of it, is a Pride exceeding all Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
as if the petty Interests of Man in
this Life were of greater moment, than
the Preservation of the publick Order,
and therein the Harmony of the World.
Is it not sufficient to have received from
God the benefit of Existence, to enjoy
all the Blessings of Earth and Heaven,
which the ordinary course of Nature, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the Author of it, bestoweth on
us; but the Fabrick of the World must
be overturned, and the general Laws of
its Government be reversed for us? Yet
this unreasonable Expectation generally
seizeth Men in Afflictions; when all the
hard Words which they heap upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Fortune, are directed against the
Divine Government of the World; the
impartial Execution of which, without
respect to the little Interests of private
Men, produceth that diversity of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
which is generally called For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>Farther, to murmur at the Divine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of the World, because no
more excellent or more certain Happiness
is assigned to Men in this Life, is an effect
of the same unreasonable Ambition of
being more noble Creatures than we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34506:62"/>
are. For while we are a compound
of Soul and Body, endued with gross
Organs of Sense, and subject to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Order of the World, it is impossible
that our Pleasures should be other than
gross, and adapted to the Organ of their
Reception, that is, our Sense. We may
tire our selves in hunting after new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Happiness, and afflict our selves
in the Disappointment of them; but
while our Natures continue to be what
they are, and the same Order is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the World, it is impossible that
the Pleasures of Life should be any other
than what they are, that is, mean in
their own Nature, and uncertain in their
Duration. To propose the acquisition of
a compleat Knowledge of all things in
this Life, of an absolute imperturbation
of Mind, and constant Infallibility, is
no less Vain; and to boast of such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
as some have done, little less
than Madness. Our present Nature ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
no such Improvements, which
while we are content to own, we must
also own those Imperfections which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
do attend it.</p>
            <p>Errors of this nature in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
are yet much more Dangerous, and
at the same time more unreasonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34506:62"/>
not founded in internal Perfections
of our Nature; but in extraneous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
such as the extraordinary and
unaccountable Favour of God, whereby
he prefers some Men before others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any respect to the Merits or Demerits
of either. An easie way indeed of gaining
Heaven; and, as what flatters the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of Men, is commonly acceptable
to them, a pleasing Delusion. But such
Men are to know, that altho' themselves
proceed herein without any other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
than a strong Imagination prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a vehement Pride; yet that the
most wise God never Acts without suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Reason, is not to be swayed by any
Partiality, and Dispenseth his Favours
with the most exact Justice. If they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
God will oversee Faults in them,
which he will not pass by in others; they
prefer themselves to the inestimable Blood
of the Son of God, which being shed to
purchase a particular Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Sins, they fondly imagine that
the Conditions of it shall be Dispensed
with for their sake.</p>
            <p>Lastly, If any imagine themselves to
lay an Obligation upon God by their own
Acts of Piety and Obedience, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
will be a strong Perswasion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34506:63"/>
Dignity, since it implies an
absolute Independency from God. But
as this is Blasphemous, so the Belief of
that is highly Criminal. If we perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an exact and unsining Obedience, we
should still do no more than our Duty;
it is what we owed to God in Right of
our Creation and Dependence on him.
And then surely even in Affairs of this
Life, we do not believe our selves to have
obliged any Person, when we pay a just
Debt to him. But if we reflect upon our
many Sins, more numerous than our Acts
of Obedience; and consider that the first
is the sole Act of our own Will, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the effect of the Grace of God enabling
us and working with us; that the first is
always perfect; the latter, even when
best, still imperfect; we shall find abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
Arguments of Humility, but none
of Arrogance.</p>
            <p>II. The usefulness of this Exhortation
of the Apostle, and what hath been Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
by me in the Prosecution of it,
appears not only in preventing these fatal
Errors, which have been markt out, and
opposed by us; but also extends to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Actions of Life and Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:34506:63"/>
As first, This will secure to us constant
Peace and Satisfaction of Mind, amidst
all the inconveniences of Life. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is wont to render the Mind of Man
uneasie, may be reduced either to the
want of some desired Good, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of some vexarious Evil. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Men put no Bounds to their Desires
or Resentments, They passionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the acquisition of some Good, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of some Evil, which is sometimes
impossible in Nature, and ofttimes denied
them by the ordinary Providence of God.
Hereupon they grow Discontented, many
times repine against God, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
injured<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and all upon a mistaken
supposal of their deserving whatsoever
they shall desire. Whereas if they would
contract their ambitious Desires and
think Soberly, as the Apostle adviseth;
they would soon be convinced, that Man
is no such excellent Creature, for whose
sake the ordinary course of the World
should be changed, or God work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to please his Fancy. That if Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and Diseases attend his Body, it is
no more than the natural Consequence of
the Constitution of it. If adverse For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
doth afflict him, it is an effect of the
steady Continuation of the same general


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34506:64"/>
Laws of Providence in the Universe,
whereof himself is but an inconsiderable
Member. If the grant of his Desires be
denied to him, it is no Wonder; his
Merits are too small to require the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of all his Wishes. If all these
together trouble him; he hath no injury
done unto him, he cannot accuse Heaven
of Injustice. All these Inconveniences
are the necessary Consequences of his
Nature, and then if he be willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his Existence, it is no less than ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
to desire to change the Properties of
it. If he murmurs against God, because
his Nature is not more Excellent, he
shews himself yet more Unreasonable;
since all proceeds from the free Gift of
our Creator, to whom we ought rather
to be thankful, that we are raised above
the Order of Beasts, than repine because
we are set beneath the Dignity of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this will teach us Humility;
which is nothing else but a sobriety of
Thought, or just esteem of our own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
And that first with our fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
which was the peculiar design of
the Apostle, when he laid down this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Precept, directing it against those,
who upon supposal of their extraordinary


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34506:64"/>
Merits above other Men, boasted of a
particular Favour with God, despised
their Brethren as Carnal and perhaps Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,
made Ostentation of those Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which were the free Gift of God, or
pretended to those which really they did
not possess: And in Confidence of either
invaded those Offices in the Church,
which were not committed to them, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated
the Rules of Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and presumed to exempt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the Obligation of it. Such
Spiritual Pride hath in all Ages conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to infest the Church, and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to molest it. But since I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
waved the Prosecution of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Design of the Apostle, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the more general Use of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
and observe in the last place,
That</p>
            <p>3. This will teach us Humility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and give us a just Idea of our
relation to him. It is almost impossible
to form any rational Act of Adoration to
him, without obtaining a true Notion of
the infinite Distance betwixt him and us:
That there is nothing in our Nature
which could attract his Love; that our
most perfect Obedience can confer no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
upon him; that neither our cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34506:65"/>
him on Earth, nor our Society
in Heaven will add to the infinity of his
present Happiness. It will demonstrate
the inconceivable Greatness of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Mercy towards us, in sending his
Son to dye for us, in proclaiming Pardon
to our Sins, in offering terms of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to us, when nothing could be found
in us, which could deserve so great a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor.
It will add to the Love of Christ,
that he was content to lay down his Life
for such inconsiderable Creatures; and
thereby not only bestow upon us one full
Pardon of all precedent Sins, but renew
his Pardons, as often as Men should sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
renew their Repentance; in giving
assurances to us of all this by the Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of his own precious Body and
Blood, which for that purpose should be
for ever continued and often celebrated
in the Church.</p>
            <p>To this whosoever approacheth with
Humility, Faith, and Repentance, will
assuredly receive Remission of his Sins
past, and Grace to avoid them for the
future. But without these preparative
Dispositions of Mind, it is vain to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the Benefit, upon a presumptuous
Opinion of a peculiar unaccountable Love
of God, dispensing with the Necessities


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34506:65"/>
of these Conditions in any one; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging
to him more than to another.
Such are the Presumptions indeed, and
such is the ordinary Success of Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
on Earth, where Favour is often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
not according to the Merits,
but the Fancies of Men. But with God
it is otherwise; the Reasons of whose
Favour are certain, fixed, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal:
Equally distributed to all who shall
perform the Conditions of it; bestowed
on none, who shall not qualifie himself
by performance of these Conditions.
May we all therefore upon a full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the impartiality of God in the
distribution of his Favours, seriously apply
our selves to the acquisition of 'em, by the
ordinary and certain Means. Then shall
we not doubt to obtain our Desires, the
assurance of which our Lord giveth to us
in this blessed Sacrament; that as surely
as we here eat his Flesh and drink his
Blood, so surely will he compleat his
Promises to us of Happiness hereafter.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is not the least Benefit of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, that it makes known
to Men the Causes and Occasions of that
depravity of Nature and proneness to
Sin, that aversion to their Duty and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
of complying with unlawful Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions,
which all discover in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
All cannot but take notice, that


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34506:66"/>
it is not without Labour and Difficulty,
without assiduous Care and Vigilancy,
that any habits of Piety or Vertue can be
formed, that it cannot be without strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
against the natural Desires, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
the Propensity of the Soul; when
negligence alone, or letting loose the
Reins to the natural Appetite will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an habit of Vice: Whereas if we
consider the nature and the end of Man,
we might rather hope the contrary;
since the performance of his Duty is no
more than the end of his Creation, and
all things naturally tend to the acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their end: And Vice being a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation
from that end, doth thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unnatural.</p>
            <p>Yet the Experience of that Deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Will of Man, which we
complain of, is so undeniable, that it
hath put Men in all Ages upon enquiring
into the Causes of it. Some resolved it
into Fate; others into the contexture of the
Body; some into the malign Influences of
the heavenly Bodies; and not a few into
the innate Principles of the Soul. But as
all these Conceptions were gross in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they could give no satisfaction to
the Mind of Man, and the matter would
have still continued to have been Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34506:67"/>
without the assistance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>
            <p>Nor doth all Revelation clear this
Doubt: In the Jewish Religion little light
was added to it; it is Christianity alone
which fully manifests the Causes and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of this Unhappiness; and as the
discovery of Diseases facilitates the Cure
of them, thereby enables us to avoid, or
at least overcome the Contagion of it.</p>
            <p>The Occasions, manifested by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
only, are two, the Corruption of our
Nature succeeding the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> or
Original Sin, and the temptation of evil
Spirits or Devils. The knowledge of
both is of great concernment to us, that
so we may be able to apply fit Remedies
to them; yet the nature of both is little
known by the ordinary Sort, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
mistaken by the more knowing
Sort of Christians. I intend at this time
to discourse of the latter, taking occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the words of the Apostle, who
enforceth his Exhortation of Sobriety and
Vigilance, from the consideration of the
constant Danger whereto Christians are
exposed by the perpetual Snares and
Temptations of the Devil, who as their
<hi>Adversary, walketh about seeking</hi> their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
from the violence of Rage and


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34506:67"/>
Force wherewith he assaults the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
denoted by comparing him to the
most terrible of Wild Beasts, when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
<hi>as a roaring Lion;</hi> and from the
miserable Consequence of being seduced
by him, which is, to <hi>be devoured</hi> by him;
as utterly deprived of spiritual Life and
Happiness, as that Man is of natural Life,
who is devoured by a Wild Beast: For
<hi>Your Adversary the Devil, as a roaring Lion,
walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.
Whom resist stedfast in the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Words will oblige me to
treat of,
<list>
                  <item>I. The manner and method of the
Temptations of the Devil.</item>
                  <item>II. Our Duty, Ability, and Means of
resisting him.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First then, Altho' the manner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Devil tempteth us, be very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
as are all the Actions of immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Beings; and altho' it becomes us not
to determine rashly, what we do not
certainly know; yet our enquiries herein
will be Lawful, while guided by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and useful, because teaching us a
Matter which doth so nearly concern us<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
rectifying our Mistakes, which may be
fatal to us; and convincing the opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of unbelieving Men, who mock at


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34506:68"/>
this Article of our Belief. And here it
is not my present purpose to prove the
Existence of such evil Spirits. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
the common and constant Opinion of
Mankind herein, produced by their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Effects, doth render it highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;
altho' the nature of Things, and
the Existence of other immaterial Beings,
differing only in accidental Qualities,
prove it to be possible; and altho' Divine
Revelation added to all these, hath put it
beyond all Doubt; yet it is not my design
to improve and urge these Arguments;
since we enquire not after the Existence
of Devils, but the Manner of their Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
It will however be necessary to
speak somewhat of their Nature, and the
Motives which induce them to busie
themselves in tempting Men.</p>
            <p>Their Nature is the same with that of
the blessed Angels, from whom they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
no otherwise, than as bad from good
Men; save that as the Purity of Angels
exceedeth that of the best Men: So the
Wickedness of Devils exceedeth that of
the worst Men<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> They were once, at
their first Creation, of the same Order
with Angels, endued with the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and enjoyed the same Happiness;
but when through Pride and Ambition


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34506:68"/>
they rebelled against God, disobeyed his
Commands, forsook that Station where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he had placed them, and aimed at
higher Dignities, they were deprived of
their former Happiness, and thrown
down from Heaven. That whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were infinitely happy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
upon the Purity of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Favour of God, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Communication of Light and Joy,
which the Angels may be supposed to
receive from God in extraordinary Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
they having now debased their
Nature, by violating the end of their
Creation, drew upon themselves the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of God, and being deprived of the
Fruition of any Divine Illuminations,
were reduced into that State of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which the Scripture describeth.</p>
            <p>The thoughts of this Loss could not
but infinitely disquiet them, as soon as
they perceived the Disappointment of
their ambitious Designs; and as they are
quick and knowing Spirits, they could
not but immediately perceive their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness,
and make a just Estimate of
the Greatness of it. The Sense of this
indeed could not but make them lament
their Folly, and repent also, if a violent
Sorrow only for past miscarriages could


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34506:69"/>
be called Repentance. For that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
have such sorrow, cannot be denied;
since in this consists their Torment; but an
unsuccessful Sorrow, a Sorrow without
submission to the just hand of God, a
Sorrow which God will not accept, and
which therefore will continue for ever,
heightened by the greatest Aggravations,
as being the result of an unspeakable,
and which is more, irrecoverable Loss;
not to be ended by Death, nor diverted
by a stupid inconsideration; but placed in
a knowing, active, always thinking, and
immortal Spirit.</p>
            <p>Such a Spirit endued with such active
Faculties, and tormented with such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Thoughts of Unhappiness, may well
be supposed to conceive the utmost De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Rage and Malice. The Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of Pride naturally produceth
those Effects in Men; which Effects
could not but be so much the stronger in
the fallen Angels, by how much their
Faculties were more lively and capacious.
In Men indeed there are many sins,
which they are not capable of, as all those
which arise from the inordinate Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
of the Body, as Lust, Intemperance,
and Covetousness; but there are others,
which are purely immaterial, and take


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34506:69"/>
place only in the Soul, as Malice, Hatred,
Envy, and Revenge. These, those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Spirits possess in their full Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which they continually exert either
aganist God, who inflicted that Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as a Punishment upon them, and altho'
he might have annihilated them in their
first Attempt, yet continues their Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
to them, and therein their Misery;
or against Man, who by the Favour of
God is made capable of attaining that
Happiness which they lost; and placed
in Dignity above them, who had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to set themselves above their
fellow Angels, and even equal to God
himself.</p>
            <p>Inspired with these wicked Thoughts,
they employ themselves continually in
opposition to the Will of God; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this Opposition can take place, only
in hindring the Happiness of Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
and desired by God, use their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Endeavours to effect it. The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of all inanimate Bodies, and the
Course of the material World, God hath
determined by fixed and certain Laws
of Motion, which it exceeds their Power
to reverse or change; but Man, being
left to the use of his own Free-will, and
not determined by the Power of God to


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34506:70"/>
any certain Actions, admits the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of evil Spirits. It is true, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate
not their own Torments, nor gain
any real Advantage hereby; yet ought
not this to make us believe, that they do
not busie themselves in tempting of us;
since it cannot be denied, that Man
reaps no real Profit by his sins, and yet
it is too sad a Truth, that Men do often
sin: and that false satisfaction, which
Men receive from gratifying their Lusts,
the Devils obtain by serving their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
and Envy.</p>
            <p>So then, that the Devils should desire to
draw us into the same Unhappiness with
themselves, is no wonder. It is only some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
difficult to conceive, how they
should effect their Desires, and have any
influence upon our Wills. To satisfie
this Difficulty many have entertained
false Notions of things, which it will be
adviseable to remove, before I enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the direct Consideration of the manner,
whereby evil Spirits tempt us.</p>
            <p>And first, It were needless to refute
the Errour of the Manichees or Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
who gave to the Devil an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Existence from God and uncontrola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by him; nay all the Attributes of God,
save that of Goodness: allowed him an


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34506:70"/>
infinite Power, whereby he could force
the Wills of Men, and bind them to the
Observation of his wicked Counsels. It
is not much to be feared, that any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
would at this time be guilty of
such an absurd Heresie. Yet many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
from the frequent Experience of
their own yielding to the Temptations
of the Devil, may be so far corrupted in
Judgment, as to believe them irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or at least plead this in excuse of their
Impenitence. To such it may not be
amiss to observe, that it exceeds the Power
of any finite Being to force the Will of
Man; for that were to overthrow the
very Essence of Man, and thereby change
the ordinary Laws of Nature, to which
all Creatures, and amongst them Devils
also, are subjected. Add to this the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Exhortations in Scripture to resist their
Temptations, which would have been
vain, if these had been irresistible; the
Promise of God also, that we shall <hi>not be
tempted above what we are able</hi> to bear;
which would not have taken place, if
we could not overcome all Temptations;
and the Experience of good Christians,
who daily resist and surmount them. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the worst of Men might baffle them,
if they would use the natural Power of


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34506:71"/>
their Souls, assisted with that common
Grace, which is denied to none. So that
what the Aposte saith of some Men,
2 Tim. II. 26. <hi>That they are taken captive
by him at his Will;</hi> is not to be understood
without their own Consent, yielding up
themselves to his Conduct, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
following his Suggestions; which also
appears from the Apostles command to
<hi>Timothy</hi> in the precedent words of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
them, <hi>That they may recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of the snare of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second Errour in this Matter is, that
God giveth to the Devil an extraordinary
Power of tempting Men; a Mistake,
which may be observed in many of the
ancient and even modern Writers, who
hence take occasion to magnifie the Grace
of God, and the Merits of Mans obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
the First, in that God hath graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
contrived this impediment of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Man, that so his obedience
might become the more meritorious;
and the latter, in that Man performs his
Duty, notwithstanding so great Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
This opinion, altho' received,
would not in the least clear our doubt,
since it would still remain to be enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in what manner the Devils exercise
this delegated Power; but that it should


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34506:71"/>
not be admitted, it is enough to say, That
it is injurious to the Honour of God. If it
were <hi>is,</hi> God might justly be said to tempt
us, contrary to what the Apostle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
<hi>Let no man, when he is tempted, say,
that he is tempted of God. For God tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impossible that so excellent a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
should be guilty of such double Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as to command the Observation of
his Laws, and at the same time tempt us
to the Violation of them; to allure and
enable us to obey him by Promises, by
Threats, and by the assistance of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, and to divert us from it by the
interposition of evil Spirits employed by
him. This were to ascribe no less In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
to him, than to the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Nay to blacken <hi>Him,</hi> and to clear
<hi>them,</hi> in the matter of Temptation. For
if the Devils herein act by the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Power of God, they act in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to him, and then Temptation in
them will be so far from being a Crime,
that it will be an Act of Duty. On the
other side, God could not be excused from
the Imputation of all those ill Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as might attend such Temptation.
For whatsoever is performed by a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Power derived from him, is to


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34506:72"/>
be ascribed to him only. Whatsoever
happens in the ordinary Course of things,
or is effected by the natural Power of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Creature, is only permitted by him,
he is not to answer for it; but what is
caused by his extraordinary Power dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
to any Creature, may truly be said
to be done by his direct Will and special
Commission.</p>
            <p>So that to avoid the charging of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
upon God, we ought not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
any such Opinion of him. He
permits indeed the Devil to exert his
Malice in the continual Temptation of
Men; and hinders not his Operations by
a perpetual interposition of his Almighty
Power, nor would it be reasonable for us
to expect it, much less to conceive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Thoughts of the Divine Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World, which hath so set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
the Frame of things, that, as if the
Pleasures of the World, the violent crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a sensual Appetite, and the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of Vertue were not sufficient to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
Men from their Duty, the restless
Sollicitation of evil Spirits is added to all
these Arguments and Incentives to sin.
That it should be so, was not a primary
institution, but a depravation of Nature,
accidental to the order of the World at


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34506:72"/>
first settled by the Author of it; which
when once happened, God was no more
obliged to remove or suspend by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Miracle, than he is to hinder
the bad example, Suggestions or Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of one Man to another.</p>
            <p>And this is no small Encouragement to
us to oppose the assaults of evil Spirits
with Constancy and Resolution, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that they act not against us by any
extraordinary Communication of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Power; but by their own natural
force only, which must be finite and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited.
We read indeed in Scripture,
that the Devils are sometimes extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
employed by God to execute his
Will, and that in relation to Mankind,
in which case they act by a supernatural
Power derived from him; but this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
not to Temptation. They were
at their first Creation, intended for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
Spirits, an Office which the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Angels still enjoy; and although
those wicked Spirits endeavoured to free
themselves from Subjection to God,
which endeavour occasioned their fall,
yet, what is none of their least Torments,
they are forced to acknowledge their
subjection, by executing his Commands.</p>
            <p>An eminent example of this we find to


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34506:73"/>
have been frequent in the Apostles times,
when Persons who were Excommunicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Church with the highest cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or formally delivered up to Satan,
were seized on by him in a conspicuous
manner, and either wholly possessed by
him and deprived of the use of their reason,
or immediately afflicted with violent
Diseases. Thus in the case of the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous
<hi>Corinthian,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth
the Governours of that Church solemnly
to excommunicate him, <hi>to deliver such an
one unto Satan, for the destruction of the
Flesh, that the Spirit may be saved in the
day of the Lord Jesus,</hi> 1 Cor. V. An em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
surely very ungrateful to the
Devils, since nothing could tend more
to the confirmation of the Christian
Faith, the Glory of God, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of Men, than such visible punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which conduced also to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
even of those, who were affected
with them; striking them with a due awe
of the Almighty Power of God, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them to enter into a serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of their unhappy State, and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of those sins, which occasioned it.
If such exemplary punishments do not at
this day attend the solemn Censures of
the Church, it is for the same reason for


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34506:73"/>
which the Gift of Miracles is denied to
it; although it is to be believed, that the
Devil acquires still no small power over
such Persons, when the Sentence is
rightly and justly pronounced, by their
loss of that supernatural Grace, which
all true Christians receive in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Church, and in vertue
of which they are chiefly enabled to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the wiles of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another example of this extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
power given to the Devils, may be
that of Demoniacks, whose number seems
to have been considerable at the time of
our Saviour; and perhaps somewhat of
a like, if not the same kind, may still be
found. That the Devils possessed these
unhappy Persons, not by their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
power, but by extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
derived from God, seems un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable.
For it cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that any finite Being could by its
ordinary power, alter the course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
If so, Miracles would be no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of Divinity, and the foundation
of all revealed Religion would fall. One
of the most eminent and frequent Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of our Saviour, was the cure of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacks.
Now if the Devils could
take possession of Men by their own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34506:74"/>
they might also quit that possession
at their will, and by quitting it oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely,
perform the same Miracle as to
the Eyes of Men, which Christ himself
did. They acted therefore herein as the
Executioners of God, who might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and impower them to seize on the
Bodies of Men, to alter their natural
Constitutions, bereave them of the use
of their Reason, and afflict them with
continual Torments, in punishment of
their Sins. For which reason also we
may well believe these Demoniacks to
have been more numerous among the
Jews, than they ever were among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
For the Covenant of the Jews
included chiefly Temporal Rewards and
Punishments; in vertue whereof the
Honour of God was concerned to inflict
dreadful Punishments upon Notorious
Sinners, even in this Life; while he had
not yet made fully known to the World
his Resolution of punishing Men in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Life.</p>
            <p>But neither of these Cases doth infer a
Command or Commission to the Devil
to tempt Men; yet there is one instance
in Scripture, which if not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
may seem to infer it: And that is
the case of <hi>Job,</hi> whose Patience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34506:74"/>
God tried by the Ministry of the
Devil. It were enough to say, that such
extraordinary Examples are no more to be
brought in proof and illustration of
the ordinary conduct of God in relation
to us, than was his Command to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
of offering up his Son <hi>Isaac.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
neither here did the Devil receive
any extraordinary Power of tempting
<hi>Job,</hi> in a strict Sense. He was impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered
indeed to raise that Tempest where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Sons of <hi>Job</hi> were buried in the
ruins of their House. But this is very
agreeable with what I laid down before,
and may well be supposed to have been
in punishment of their Sins; of the
greatness of which <hi>Job</hi> was so sensible,
that he daily offered Sacrifice to God in
expiation of them. The Devil was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enabled to destroy his Possessions, and
torment his Body with a loathsome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease.
But all this directly affected not
his Mind, which still remained untouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
exposed indeed to the ordinary as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
of the Devil, which assaults as
they were not suspended by God, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were they assisted by him. Which
assaults how they are affected by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
power of the Devil, I come next
to enquire, having first observed to you,


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34506:75"/>
that although we could not conceive or
explain the manner of it, we should have
no reasonable cause to doubt of it. Our
own experience will not suffer us to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
such doubts, and that the Faculties
and Operations of immaterial Beings are
imperceptible to us, we have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of our Soul, which although it be
so nearly related to us, we know but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
imperfectly the manner and spring of
all her Actions.</p>
            <p>The Devil is said to tempt us two
ways, properly and improperly. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Examples of each may be
brought from Scripture. The latter is
not hard to be conceived, and is no more
than this; that as the Devil was the first
Apostate and Rebel against God, and
still continueth his opposition to him, so
he is the Captain and Head of all which
opposeth God; as are the Lusts, the
Passions, and the Sins of Men: Which
being excited by sublunary Objects, by
worldly Pleasures, whatsoever is done by
these in opposition to God, is ascribed to
him, as done after his Example, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Banner. Since his Fall, the
World is in a manner divided between
God and him; whatsoever is good and
excellent proceeds from God, and is


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:34506:75"/>
done by his Influence, Command, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and Perswasion: Whatsoever is
bad and repugnant to the Laws of God
is done by the example of the Devil, by
imitating him, following his Conduct,
and entring into his Government. For
thus, all Beings disobedient to God, may
be said to constitute one Society, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Devil is the Head. And because
this Society busie themselves wholly in
the things of this World, and are delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by gross Pleasures; he is called <hi>the
Prince of this World,</hi> and <hi>the Prince of
the Air;</hi> not that he hath, or ever had,
the disposition of things here below, the
disposal of Kingdoms, or distribution of
temporal conveniencies or inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
which hath been the mistake of
some. Such Power never belonged to
him. He told our Saviour indeed in
tempting of him, that <hi>all the Kingdoms
of the World and the Glory of them were his;</hi>
and that <hi>he would give them to him, if he
would fall down and Worship him.</hi> But he
was a <hi>Liar from the Beginning;</hi> it was
more than he could perform.</p>
            <p>The Devil is said properly to tempt
Men, by acting immediately upon their
Souls, by suggesting wicked thoughts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, by instigating them to Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34506:76"/>
and Disobedience: And this is that
temptation, by which we so much suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
which we so much fear, and by
which he executes his Malice and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
upon Mankind. There are but two
possible ways by which this can easily
be supposed to be performed, since an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Derivation of Power from
God is rejected.</p>
            <p>The first is, by moving the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Men, and producing whatsoever
Thoughts and Ideas he thinks fit, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their Animal Spirits, which in Man
have so near a Connexion with the
thoughts of the Soul, that such motions
in them will infallibly and unavoidably
produce such thoughts in the Soul. Now
it is not impossible to conceive, that the
Devils, as they are most sagacious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and of long experience, may have
observed and found, to which motions of
the Spirits such and such thoughts of the
Soul are annexed, and accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
those motions, as often as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to introduce such thoughts. For it
is highly probable, that all immaterial
Beings have a natural power of moving
matter. We find that in our own Soul,
which is the lowest of all such Beings,
that moveth our Spirits, and by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34506:76"/>
of those our whole Body: It
no sooner formeth an Idea, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
attend the Formation of it, and are
moved according to its Diversity. There
is no more necessary Connexion between
the Thoughts of the Soul and the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Body, than between the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the Thoughts of any other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
Being. So that the Devil may
well be supposed to be able to make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
on our Imagination, by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these Spirits. Yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from hence, that he is able to move
or disorder our whole Bodies; since to
the former is required the consent of our
Will, which is in our own Power, and
doth not necessarily follow any Motion
of the Spirits: To the latter is required
a Power transcending the ordinary Laws
of Nature, whereby the Causes and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Health and Strength are settled
and preserved, which are not in the least
violated by such Motions in the Brain, as
produce a bare Idea or naked Conception
of any thing.</p>
            <p>This way of impressing Thoughts in
our Mind is possible: But it is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that all immaterial Beings can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
Thoughts, and make impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
on each other. Without this it


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34506:77"/>
not be imagined how a Society of Angels
or Devils can consist; and yet that there
are a Society of each, the Scripture as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
us. If one Man cannot immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
impress a Thought in the Soul of
another; it is no wonder. We are here
inchained in a Body, in which state no
approaches can be made to us but by the
Organs of the Body. Nature hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
another way for Men to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
their Thoughts, which when it shall
cease by putting off the Body, we have
just ground to believe, that we shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Priviledge common to other
imaterial Beings, of communicating our
Thoughts to each other by immediate
influence. At least it is most certain, that
Angels and Devils have that Priviledge,
because they have formed Societies,
which they could not have done without
it. And if they can impress any Thoughts
upon each other, that is, upon Beings of
equal Dignity; they are surely much
more able to do it upon those of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Rank and Capacity; such as are
the Souls of Men.</p>
            <p>Both these ways are possible; but that
the Devils do tempt us by either of these
Methods, I dare not determine. It is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to shew that what we believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34506:77"/>
the Temptation of evil Spirits,
is possible and agreeable to Reason. And
this I have spoken to you as Persons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
satisfaction in the Truth of this
Article of Christianity; I will now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
and speak to you as Christians firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswaded of this Truth, that the
Devils do tempt us.</p>
            <p>From what hath been said, you may take
a just Estimate of the efficacy of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's
Temptations, and our Ability to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him. He can proceed indeed no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to suggest the first Cogitations
of any Object; and if Man also stopped
here, he would never forfeit his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
the Devil would never obtain his
desired End. He can do no more indeed,
yet this he improves to great advantage,
and with that success which we all lament.
He knoweth the Constitutions of all Men,
and can cunningly suggest those Sins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, to which they are most prone.
He is unwearied in his Nature as well as
Malice, and so can continually renew his
Suggestions. He can improve them
with the introducing of all those false
Arguments, which can recommend any
Sin. He can propose the Pleasures of the
World under the most specious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
is not discouraged by any repulse;


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34506:78"/>
renews his Sollicitations with the most
constant Diligence. If Man considers,
what Pleasures the World can give him;
he amplifieth to him the Greatness of
them. If the Commands of God be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
on; he suggesteth their Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.
If past Sins be recalled to Mind;
he exaggerates their Enormity, and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
them to be Unpardonable. If good
Christians through long strugling and
Constancy baffle him in all these At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
by stifling his wicked Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in their first rise, by withholding
their assent, and refusing to embrace his
Motions<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> he employeth other Methods,
and exciles wicked Men, who seldom
resist his Suggestions, because always
recommended with the apparent shew
of Profit or Pleasure, or some other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
to assist him in his Design, by
bad Examples, or Counsels; and if these
be not sufficient, by Injuries and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions;
which was the very case
St. <hi>Peter</hi> particularly speaks of in this
place. Thus we see, what a vigilant
and powerful Adversary we have to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter;
the Conviction of which will
oblige us to reflect seriously upon our
ability and means of resisting him; to
enquire the most secure Methods of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34506:78"/>
him, and seriously apply our
selves to the Acquisition and Successful
use of them. This I proposed in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place to treat of; which, God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
shall be the Subject of another

            <p>HAVING represented to you in
my former Discourse upon these
words the powerful and constant Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
made to Mankind, in the Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Duty, by the Temptations
of evil Spirits; it is but necessary to lay
open the Means of resistance, which are
afforded to Men against these violent and


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34506:79"/>
continual Assaults; lest the Consideration
of that Vigour, and for the most part
Success, wherewith the Devil carrieth on
his Assaults should discourage you from a
resolute resistance.</p>
            <p>What in other Combats is wont to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
Men, may be reduced either to
the Concern of some great Interest, as
Life and Liberty, lying then at stake, to
be recovered or even improved by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and forfeited by a defeat; or to
the apparent Hopes of Success. These
Arguments we find by daily Experience
want not their Effect to move Men to
venture their Lives and Fortunes; even
singly and without the Conjunction of
each other. The fear of the Loss of all
worldly Happiness will induce Men to
fight, even when there is little probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Success; and the assured Hopes
of Success will produce the same Effect,
altho' no great Interest be decided by it.</p>
            <p>It may be wondred indeed, that what
is so ordinary in temporal Matters should
seldom be discovered in spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
where both these Motives are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
joyned together, and yet both sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
obtain their Effect. Here a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Interest lieth at stake, than is ever the
occasion of temporal Quarrels: Here


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34506:80"/>
greater certainty of Success appears; since
here to obtain a Victory depends not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Faithfulness of Allies, the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of other Men, or the lucky Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of Fortune, but upon the single
Power of every private Man, for which
every one can become answerable. If
after all this, the resistance made by Men
to the Assaults of evil Spirits be feeble
and oft-times unsuccessful, we must ascribe
it not to the want of Evidence in these
Arguments, or Conviction of it in the
minds of Men, but to want of Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
that Men blindly pursue the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Sense, raise not their Souls from
the Earth, and seldom enter into the
Consideration of their spiritual Interests,
enquire not what opposition they are like
to meet with in the Prosecution of them,
or what Abilities are conferred on them,
whereby they may defeat this Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>Men indeed are always ready to ascribe
this want of Success to any thing else ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than their own default, and so they
may excuse themselves, care not either to
vilifie the Divine Justice, or depress their
own Natures. Thus the Marcionites,
and other Hereticks of old pretended that
the Devil was an Almighty Being, whose


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34506:80"/>
Will could not be resisted. And which
is much to the same Purpose in relation to
Man, some others fear not to maintain,
that God giveth not sufficient Grace to
all, whereby he may be resisted with
Success. If things were so, in vain would
Men endeavour to resist him; nay, it
would be even irrational to undertake a
resistance, which we were before assured
would be unsuccessful. We should then
have no more to do than to resign up
our Wills to the Suggestion of those evil
Spirits, and submit our selves quietly to
that Tyranny, which we foresaw could
never be shaken off. But far from advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
this Submission, St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts us
<hi>to resist stedfast in the faith,</hi> that is, with
assured Hopes of Success and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and that, after he had described
the fierceness and violence of the Assaults
made upon us by our Adversary the
Devil, by comparing him to <hi>a roaring
Lion;</hi> and amplified the dreadful Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
which he performs upon conquer'd
Men, by saying that he doth <hi>devour</hi>
them: Notwithstanding all this, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
us to resistance, and in resisting him
assureth us of Success.</p>
            <p>In pursuing the Design and improving
the Exhortation of the Apostle, I will


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34506:81"/>
consider the Means of resisting the Devil,
which are possible to Men; and these are
either Internal; the result of their own
natural Power or Faculties of their Soul;
or External; the supernatural, yet ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Gift of God. Of these in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>First then, Man is enabled to resist
the Temptations of the Devil by his
own natural Power; and by the due Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of the internal Faculties of his
Soul. To understand this fully, it will
be necessary to take a View of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
whereby evil Spirits obtain their
influence upon the Minds of Men and
effect their Temptations. This I treated
largely of in my former Discourse,
and shall only repeat the Summ of it unto
you. The Devil then operates herein as
a natural Agent only, whose Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
finite, his Operations must be of a
limited Power also. He cannot violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
over-rule the Minds of Men, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
restrain the Exercise of their Free-wills.
For this were to change the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man; whereas himself as well
as all other Creatures cannot exceed the
ordinary Laws of Nature fixed by the
great Author of it in the first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World. That therefore Men


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34506:81"/>
by their natural Power may resist and
surmount his Temptations, especially
since they are not enforced by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Assistance of God; who as he
giveth no Commission to the Devil to
tempt Men, so neither doth he give him
any Assistance in the tempting of them.
That only natural Means therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unto him; and that this natural
Means can be no other than by working
upon the Imaginations of Men; that
this he effects by imprinting Ideas and
Conceptions of several Objects therein,
either by producing such Motions in the
Brain, which create such Conceptions in
the Soul; or by immediately Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
such Conceptions to it; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
by some other unknown way; but
whatsoever the manner of his Operation
may be, that the effect is and can be no
other than the Production of bare Ideas
or first Cogitations in the mind of Man.
For as for his tempting one Man by the
Sollicitation or Persecution of another,
that must be reduced to the same Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
since he could induce one Man to
tempt another no otherwise than by
tempting that first Man in a proper and
strict Sense.</p>
            <p>From this short view of the manner


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34506:82"/>
of the Devils effecting his Temptations,
and the Power which attends them, we
may easily conceive our own Abilities to
resist them. For the same Power which
we have either to approve or reject the
first Thoughts of any Object arising in
our Minds, the same Power we have to
repel the Insinuations of evil Spirits;
since these extend no farther, without
our own Concurrence. The first
Thoughts of the Mind are the bare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of any Objects, before any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be formed of them, or the Will
be yet inclined on either side in relation
to them. As if the Mind should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the material Act of any sin, and
even with all the Circumstances of it,
and run over all the apparent Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which may arise from the Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, and yet hath not determined
whether it shall admit or reject it. Such
a bare Conception precedes every Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Will. The Imagination
or Understanding first represents the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Will, and then the Will form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a Judgment of it; either consenting
to, or disapproving the thing proposed.
The latter, the use of the Will, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in our Power, and cannot beforced
by any Power whether of Men or Devils;


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34506:82"/>
nay, with Reverence be it spoken, cannot
be over-ruled by God himself. For the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his Power is his Will; and this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be supposed to alter the Nature of
things which himself hath fixed; and if he
should by an extraordinary Act of Power
constrain the Will of Man, the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would be neither good nor bad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
not free, and so capable neither of
Reward nor Punishment. So that Man
is secure on this side, his Will always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
untouched; the only Approaches,
which can be made to him, are by his
Imagination or Faculty of Conception.
And this is not always in his Power.
Evil Spirits may impress Ideas in it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his own Concurrence; the Presence
of Objects will naturally produce them,
and the secret workings of Memory will
recal them. In all this the Will is not
concerned; such Thoughts will enter
into the Soul not only without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
but even against the Desire of Man.
He cannot avoid the Conception of those
Objects, which are presented to him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by evil Spirits, or external Objects,
or the Suggestion of his own Memory.</p>
            <p>But then as Man cannot avoid them,
so neither is he to answer for them, no
more than when he hears the Relation of


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34506:83"/>
a Sin committed by another, or seeth it
with his own Eyes; in which Case he
cannot avoid the Conception of it, and
yet is not rendred Guilty thereby. Which
sufficiently confutes the Opinion of some
Men, who maintain these first Cogitations
to be in our own Power; and that as such
we are answerable for them. For whether
the Conception be imprinted in the
Mindby the Suggestion of evil Spirits,
or by the Fruitfulness of our own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is of the same Nature, and hath
no more necessary Effect, than that which
is produced by the Report of the Senses,
whether seeing or hearing. In which
last Cases it cannot be denied, that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the matter related or seen can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be prevented. The Soul is so quick
a Being, that no sooner doth the Object
strike the Organ of sense, but it frameth
an idea of it. If then in such obvious
Cases the first Thoughts of the Soul may
be absolutely involuntary; if the Mind
cannot prevent the gross Operations of
Sense, much less will it be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the more subtle Impressions of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Beings, such as are the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Devils, or the inward Suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Imagination. But then, as I said
before, Man is not accountable for these,
because not within his Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:34506:83"/>
A Man indeed may turn away his
Eyes from beholding Sin; he may stop
his Ears when he heareth pleasing Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Sin; he may for the most part
stifle these Suggestions, whether of evil
Spirits, or a depraved Imagination; he
may expel them from his Mind, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them not to Lodge themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Breast. This was the Practice of
our blessed Saviour, whose Example
should be our constant Pattern. He had
framed such a clear Conviction of
his Duty and firm Resolution of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
it, that in him to master any
Temptation was no more than to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
that it was contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God and his own Duty. No
sooner did the Devil suggest to him the
miraculous Conversion of <hi>Stones into
bread</hi> for the satisfying of his Hunger,
but he rejected the Proposal, because
contrary to a due Reliance upon the
Divine Promises of Protection. When
he would have perswaded him to work
an unnecessary Miracle in throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
off the Pinacle of the Temple, he
immediately remembred that God had
forbidden Men <hi>to tempt</hi> his Providence,
and the remembrance of that Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was a sufficient Safeguard against


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34506:84"/>
the Suggestion of the Devil. When he
tempted our Lord to <hi>fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
himself,</hi> by promising him in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>the Kingdoms of the earth and all
the glory of them,</hi> he opposed to this the
Divine Command of <hi>worshipping<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;</hi>
and did not so much as enter into
debate whether he should admit the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,
but with a generous Disdain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
rejected all<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Thoughts of it
with a <hi>Get thee behind me Satan.</hi> His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
of Obedience to God alone,
were as quick as his conceptions of what
was proposed to him by the subtle Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that because he had firmly rooted
this Principle in his Mind, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was his Duty he would perform;
whatsoever was unlawful, he would reject.</p>
            <p>If we by assiduous Meditation would
take care to fix the same Principle in our
Minds; if we would diligently recall it
to mind, as often as any Object of choice
were presented to us; if the same pious
Indignation would seize us, as often as
any thing were proposed to us Deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to the Honour of God and our own
real Interest; it would be no less easie
for us to overcome the Temptations of
the Devil, than it was for our Lord and
Master. The manner of Temptation in


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:34506:84"/>
each Case was not different; being in
each Case effected by inward Suggestion.
For we must not suppose that the Devil
visibly appeared to our Lord and spake
to him face to face; to have proposed
his alluring Temptations without any
disguise would more have prejudiced the
Efficacy of them, than all the specious
Arguments wherewith he recommended
them, could have enforced them. He
tempted Christ by insinuating secretly
into his mind such Thoughts as these,
that since he was Conscious to himself of
his Power of working Miracles, he had
better satisfie his Hunger by turning the
Stones into Bread, than endure it any
longer in awaiting the ordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God; that to leap off the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of the Temple, and to be seen to be
carried safe in the Air, would contribute
very much to raise his Glory and Fame
among Men; and that if he would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
that Power of Miracles, which he
had received from God for the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the World, to the Conquest of it;
it would be no hard Matter in a short
time to gain <hi>all the Kingdoms of the Earth
and the Glory of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Devil tempted our Lord, and
thus he continueth to tempt us; with this


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34506:85"/>
only difference, that our Lord by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Wisdom knew that all those Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
proceeded from that wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and we when we are tempted by him
are wont to ascribe those evil Motions,
which we then find within our selves,
to any thing rather than the Suggestion
of evil Spirits. For since these Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
are usually specious Arguments of
the extraordinary Pleasure or Profit to be
found in sin, Men are apt to ascribe all
this to the Excellency of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
which, as they imagine, rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them beyond the trifling superstition
of religious Fools; who are content to
forfeit the chief Satisfactions of this Life,
for fear of offending they know not
whom, and suffering they know not
what; or to their own extraordinary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity
whereby they alone can discern
what is the true Happiness of Man; or
perhaps reconcile all these sins wherein
they delight, to their Pretences of future
Happiness. When indeed pious Men
know, no less than they, what are the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Arguments recommending sinful
Pleasures, and by what Methods they
may be best enhanced; but they will
not entertain themselves with such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
and if suggested to them,


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34506:85"/>
presently do remove them; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by Attention to them, they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
to be allured or betrayed to
Consent to them; but also because vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
to continue such thoughts in
the mind and dwell upon them, is a sin;
since this includes a Connivence of the
Will, not restraining the Imagination
from such impure Ideas; and is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attended with a sort of Complacency;
which wanteth nothing but a fit occasion
to put the pleasing sin in Practice.</p>
            <p>So then the most secure method of
eluding the Temptations of the Devil, is to
decline his suggestions immediately, to
remove even the first Thoughts of them,
and divert the Soul to some lawful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
But because the imagination of
Man may be so strongly excited by some
violent Object or Impression; that it
shall not be even in the Power of the
Soul to suppress it for some considerable
time; as we see in violent Passions, which
can no more be allayed by one Act of
Dissent in the Will, than a tempestuous
Sea be calmed in one minute; therefore
it will be necessary to provide Remedies
against such Adventures. And the most
effectual is that prescribed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
Matth. V. 29. 30. <hi>If thy right


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34506:86"/>
Eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it
from thee: And if thy right hand offend
thee, cut it off and cast it from thee,</hi> &amp;c.
That is, if by the Enjoyment of any
otherwise indifferent Object, thou find
thy self often betrayed to an unlawful
use of it, or to any other sin, deprive thy
self even of that lawful Pleasure, rather
than for the sake of that expose thy Soul
to the Danger of total Destruction; and
thereby forfeit, not only that apparent,
but even, all real Satisfactions. If by
any pleasing Objects of sight, thou art
apt to be tempted to unlawful Desires;
by a prudent Caution debar thy self even
of those otherwise lawful Pleasures, which
thou mightest receive from that noble
Faculty. If grateful Objects of touch
do often excite such vehement Passions in
thee, as cannot be satisfied without the
Commission of sin; renounce even all
lawful Pleasures, which thou mightest
receive from thence. If thou canst not
look upon a Woman without lusting after
her, suffer not thy Eyes to gaze upon her.
If thou canst not engage in Company,
without being tempted to Drunkenness,
deny thy self so dangerous a Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and so in all other Cases. A most
Divine Counsel, and excellently fitted to


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34506:86"/>
defeat the Temptations of the Devil, or
the Propensity of our own Nature to sin.</p>
            <p>Every Man may discover in himself a
Proneness to some particular sin beyond
others; of which evil Spirits make their
advantage, and most frequently assault
Men by inciting them to the Commission
of it. Here a Man should be chiefly
careful, and rather than suffer himself to
be led into it, dread even the Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of it, suspect even his lawful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
of that Object, to which the
sin relates; and if all this Circumspection
prevents not the returns of his unlawful
Passions, as oft as the Object is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to renounce even all lawful use of it;
at least until those Passions can be so far
allayed, that the Soul can again entertain
the Object without any Danger of sin.</p>
            <p>But the most frequent Case remaineth
yet to be provided for; that is, when
the Idea produced by the Object, or by
the suggestion of the Devil, is so violent,
that it cannot be removed by a single
Dissent of the Will; and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the forementioned rules of Caution,
is, either by our own Negligence, or by
the subtilty of our Adversary, or both,
actually produced. Here it is that the
Efficacy of Temptations chiefly appears;


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34506:87"/>
the Devil is vigilant and unwearied in
the prosecution of his Designs, attacks
us on all sides successively; if he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed
at one Post, he assaults us at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and never gives over till he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
entrance. Here is the chief Conflict
of a Christian; when the Suggestion of
evils Spirits exciteth his Imagination;
when his Passions are raised by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
when his sensual Appetite grows
impetuous, opposeth the Directions of
Reason, and requireth blindly to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
The repugnancy of this to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Faculties of the Soul giveth the
Devil opportunity to assault us, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
in it. This proceeds no farther than
the bare satisfaction of Sense, it lyeth
grovelling on the Earth, looks not up to
Heaven, nor discerns any future Hopes;
therein common with Beasts, who pursue
the Enjoyment of present Objects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any regard to Futurity. This conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
inciteth a Man to enjoy the Object,
which is set before him, without enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
whether it be allowed or forbidden
by God; considers no further than whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be grateful and acceptable to the
Sense; becomes clamorous if denied;
and can never be wholly rooted out,
while we carry this Body about with us,


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34506:87"/>
whose Wants and natural Motions are
the Spring of it.</p>
            <p>It is indeed absolutely subject to the
command of the rational Faculty, if this
exerts its self vigorously, and maintains
a constant Guard; but if it grows remiss,
if those natural Motions, either by Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
or the Impression of evil Spirits,
be raised into strong Passions, the Danger
is evident; <hi>Sin lieth at the doors,</hi> and if
not repelled by a vigorous Opposition,
will force its entrance.</p>
            <p>This constant Rebellion of the sensual
Appetite against the Reason of Man, is
that unhappiness, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> so much
complains of, Rom. VII. <hi>I see another law
in my members warring against the law of
my mind, and bringing me into Captivity
to the law of sin,</hi> &amp;c. This alone is a
constant Temptation to Mankind; but
<hi>then</hi> most dangerous, when excited and
fomented by the impression of evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which imprint in the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all those Arguments, which can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the Desires of the sensual Appetite,
and render them plausible.</p>
            <p>In Opposition to these, we should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
our selves by a frequent Meditation
and full Comprehension of all those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
which may perswade us to the


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:34506:88"/>
performance of our Duty, to the restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Lusts, to the continuance of
our Obedience. If by an assiduous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of these Arguments in our
Thoughts, they become familiar, and as
it were habitual to us; no sooner shall
we be prompted to sin by the Insurrection
of our carnal Appetites, or the Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of infernal Spirits, but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Arguments will present themselves,
oppose and defeat the other. If it be
suggested to us, that this sin includeth
some considerable Pleasure; the mind on
the other side will remember, that God
sent us not into the World to take our
Pleasure, as we should think most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient;
but to perform those immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Rules of Justice and Sobriety which
he hath prescribed; and for the sakes of
which he bestowed Existence on us;
that this proposed Pleasure is indeed
mean and trifling, depriving us of a far
greater Pleasure, and drawing eternal
Misery upon us. If the Body or Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
now affected urgeth vehemently
for the Grant of their Desires; the Soul
will consider, that it is better to deny an
unnecessary Gratification to it, than to
destroy both Soul and Body by a soolish
Compliance with it. If Secrecy and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34506:88"/>
in the Commission of this sin be sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested;
Reason will oppose the all-seeing
Eye of God, will dread his Majesty and
fear his Anger. If the smallness of the
sin be pleaded; a knowing Soul will
presently call to mind that every wilful Sin
is mortal, and an open Rebellion against
God. If the uncertainty of future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishments be objected;
Reason silenceth the Objection and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to the Evidence of those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
from whence by frequent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
it hath received a thorough Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.
And thus in all other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of sin, suggested either by the
sensual Appetite, or the Temptation of
the Devil, if the Soul be prepared with
an exact and ready Comprehension of all
the Motives of Obedience; if it hath
fully weighed them, thoroughly dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
them, and firmly retains them; it
cannot want the proposed end, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
of Temptations, continuance of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
and increase of Piety.</p>
            <p>To prepare the mind with such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
will indeed successfully baffle
the Assaults of our spiritual Enemy; and
to employ it continually in such would
wholly prevent his Attempt. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such continual Attention to spiritual


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:34506:89"/>
Meditations is, I will not say rare, but
impracticable in this imperfect State of
Life; instead of that, Men should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to employ their Souls continually
with some certain Thoughts, which if
not Pious, yet at least may be innocent.
It is a no less true than common Maxim,
That <hi>Idleness lays men open to the snare of
the Devil.</hi> The reasonableness of which
Position, plainly appears from what I
have already laid down, concerning the
manner of the Devils Operation in his
Temptation. For this Being, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing
the first Thoughts of any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in the minds of Men, he hath no
where so easie an entrance, as where the
Soul lies open on all sides, uncultivated,
unemployed. In such a state, the mind
of Man is capable of any Impressions,
and ready to receive them, and when it
hath received them, will scarce make
any other than a feeble Opposition to the
plausible Insinuations of evil Spirits.
And for this Reason, I suppose, the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of the Devil is so often in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
said to be more particularly in the
Wilderness and in Desart Places, where
Men for want of Business or innocent
Society, wherewith to entertain the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of the Soul, lay open to his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults.


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34506:89"/>
Whereas if the mind busieth it
self continually either in pious Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
lawful Concerns of the Body,
Knowledge and Prosecution of useful Arts
and Sciences, in a chast Society, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Recreations; the Imagination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prepossessed with the Conception of
those Objects, wherein the mind is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
leaves no room for the Suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Devil, and happily precludes
them.</p>
            <p>Man is a thinking Being, enjoying an
active and immaterial Soul; which as
such, must necessarily be always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in some Cogitation or other.
If then Men will take no care to direct
and regulate their Thoughts at all
times, the infallible effect will be, that
they must blindly follow, either the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous
Conceptions of a roving Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
or the impressions of external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or the secret insinuations of subtile
and wicked Spirits. In this Condition
Man inconsiderately follows that Idea
which first strikes him; and then no
wonder the Devil makes use of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
opportunity to take Possession
of his Imagination, and turn it to his
own Destruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:34506:90"/>
Having thus represented to you the
principal and most effectual Methods
of resisting our grand Adversary the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
arising from our own natural Power
and Faculties; I proceed to consider the
external Assistances, whereby Man is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to carry on the same Design with
Success; and these are chiefly two, the
Grace of God, and the Assistance of good
Spirits. And of these briefly in their
Order.</p>
            <p>The Grace of God and the Inspirations
of his Holy Spirit are never wanting to
faithful Christians in this spiritual Combat.
He hath engaged that <hi>he will never suffer us
to be tempted above what we are able, but will
with the temptation also make a way for us to
escape.</hi> And this Promise he observes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably;
by enlightening our minds, by
directing our Thoughts, by influencing
our Wills. Not that all the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Faculties of the Soul of Man, and
Abilities of resisting the Temptations of
evil Spirits, are less owing to him, than
these more extraordinary Emanations;
both equally proceed from his Gift, both
are to be ascribed to his Liberality. But
the former are the natural Faculties of
Man, which cannot be wanting to him
while he is Man; which depend not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34506:90"/>
the good or bad use of them, and are
never withdrawn from us, nor denied to
us. The latter are the supernatural Gift
of God, which Man cannot claim in
right of his Nature, are conferred on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the worthy receiver; and are
withdrawn upon the abuse or neglect of
them.</p>
            <p>It is no hard matter to conceive, how
God herein influenceth the Soul of Man,
after it hath been shewed, that even fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Spirits can effect it. If they could
by long Experince find out what Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the mind were annexed to
such Motions in the Brain; He surely,
who did at first unite them, cannot be
ignorant of them. If evil Spirits, by the
Priviledge of immaterial Beings, can
communicate Thoughts to the Soul of
Man by immediate influence; He certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
who is the supreme Lord of all, can
do much more. He may proceed in
other Methods, <hi>nothing being impossible to
him,</hi> nor himself subject to the Laws of
Nature. However this we must assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe, that God changeth not
the Order of Nature herein, in violently
with-holding our Wills from Consenting
to the Sollicitations of the Devil. He
deals with us as with rational Beings,


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:34506:91"/>
pointeth out the right way to us, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth
us to enter into it, fixeth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
at the end of it, moveth us gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by his Holy Spirit to embrace it: but
after all, will not forcibly carry us into it.
And thus he deals with us when tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Devil, he giveth us sufficient
strength to withstand him, enlightens our
Souls with a full Prospect of those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which may withdraw the Will
from his Sollicitations; but after all leaves
it at Liberty, and awaits the issue. Not
that this extraordinary Assistance is given
to all, who are tempted of the Devil;
but that it is denied to none, who right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seek it. He withdraws his Grace, if
it be not earnestly desired, if it be not
thankfully received, if it be not soberly
used, if it be not rightly improved; as
he formerly delivered up the Rebellious
Israelites <hi>to their own hearts lusts, and
to follow their own Imaginations;</hi> and
as still by the solemn Censures of the
Church, when rightly applied, wicked
<hi>Christians are delivered up to Satan, to be
led captive by him at his Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another method, whereby God assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Mankind extraordinarily against the
Temptations of the Devil, is by restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his force and limiting his Malice.


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34506:91"/>
The Devil cannot perform any Act of
Temptation without the ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of God; and oft-times he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
restrained by his Almighty
Power from tempting faithful Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the proportion of their Ability to
endure. God putteth a Hook in the Nose
of this <hi>Leviathan<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> and fixeth his bounds
unto him, <hi>how far he shall pass and no
farther;</hi> as in the Case of <hi>Job,</hi> where he
determined, how far his Power of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
should extend, and forbad him to
proceed any farther than to such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
And this is one of the general and
most conspicuous Benefits of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that by the Reception and publick
Profession of it, the Devil, <hi>that old Dragon</hi>
in the Revelations, is chained up, his
Power abridged, his Malice weakned.</p>
            <p>Before the Promulgation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, he had procured to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
an universal Worship in the World;
except in the small spot of <hi>Judea,</hi> erected
Oracles, and daily effected lying wonders.
Men were from their Infancy trained up
in his Service, and to be subject to him
was the Unhappiness of their Education.
If any opposed his Worship, he was
presently decried as an Atheist, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducer
of new Religions, obnoxious to


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34506:92"/>
severe Punishments by the Laws of the
Empire; if Men entertained a Suspicion
of that irrational Worship which he had
formed; he could amuse the Minds of
his followers by seeming Miracles, Fright
them into his Obedience by Prodigies,
keep up the Reputation of Divinity
by Sorceries and Predictions. All this
was then permitted to him, till the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Light of the Gospel appeared; his
Power then sensibly decreased, untill the
open Exercise of it was wholly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by the publick Profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
in the World. He was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to the bottomless Pit, ceased to
be the <hi>Prince of the Air,</hi> deprived of the
Power of working apparent Miracles, at
least in Christian Countries; confined to
secret and dark Operations only; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
those in great measure enervated and
defeated by that ordinary Grace, which is
bestowed on all Christians in the publick
Sacraments and Offices of the Church.</p>
            <p>It remains that I add somewhat of
the Assistance given to us by good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
against the Temptations of evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
of which the Solemnity of this day
doth particularly require a grateful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment;
which was piously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by the Church in Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34506:92"/>
of those many and eminent Benefits,
which we receive from the Holy Angels.
Among these none of the least is what
we now treat of, their assisting us in
resisting the Temptations of evil Spirits.
For being <hi>ministring Spirits, sent forth to
minister for them, who shall be Heirs for
Salvation,</hi> as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> I. 14. they apply
themselves with unwearied Diligence to
this Charitable Office; attending the
Motions of our Minds, insinuating good
Counsels, countermining the Stratagems
of the Devil, enlightning the Mind,
moving the Affections, promoting the
good of the Soul.</p>
            <p>How all this is performed by them,
we may easily conceive, after a clear
Comprehension of the method whereby
evil Spirits operate in our Souls. For
whatsoever natural Power these Possess,
equally belong to the Holy Angels, who
partake of the same Nature, and differ
only in the quality of good and bad. If
they have the Power of moving Matter,
and so of affecting our Imagination;
much more these, who are the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of God. If they can imprint Ideas in
our Mind by immediate influence; much
more these, whose pious Designs are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and prospered by their Almighty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron.


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:34506:93"/>
If they by long Observation have
found out the turnings and windings of
the Heart of Man; these possess by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
an equal knowledge, and have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a much greater by Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.
If they have discovered the
less defensible places of the Soul of Man,
where the Attempt may most successful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be made; these have discerned the
Arguments of Obedience, which are most
perswasive to every single Man, and fail
not to apply them fitly. If they prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their hatred and wicked Designs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Mankind with unwearied Malice;
these continue their good Offices with no
less constant Diligence and Charity. If
they be rendered vigorous and powerful
in all their Actions by their Subtilty,
Agility, long Experience and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Knowledge; these obtain the same
Faculties in equal Perfection, and with
far greater Probability of success in the
use of them; in as much as therein these
act in Obedience to God, they in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to him; these with a constant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
and Prospect of reward to be
obtained by it; those with a perpetual
Vexation, as knowing the increase of their
Punishment, doth attend it; these assisted
and directed by God, those restrained and


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34506:93"/>
with-holden by him. In short, if the
Devils bring great Detriment to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Interests of Mankind, the Angels
bring no less advantage to it; that it may
be questioned whether it were more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
for Man to suffer the Temptation
of evil, for the Assistance of good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
or to want them both together.
Only the same Caution, which we before
observed to be necessary in procuring
and continuing the Grace of God, is also
required here; that we render our selves
worthy of it by a diligent Concurrence;
and that as we should not by our Perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>grieve the Holy Spirit of God,</hi> so neither
should we by our Negligence and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Perseverance in Sin grieve the Holy
Angels.</p>
            <p>And this is the only Reward, which
for all their Labour and Care bestowed
on us, they require of us; that together
with them we pay a due Obedience to
our common Master; that we defeat not
their Charitable Designs by our own Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.
Worship and other Signs of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Honour they affect not; nay this
they will not receive from us. The end
of their Labour is to procure Happiness
to Man, and the Reward of it, next to
the Conscience of having obeyed their


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34506:94"/>
great Master, is the satisfaction of their
Success in it. Their only aim is that we
would joyn with them here in paying
intire Obedience to our common Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
that so we may joyn with them
hereafter in singing Praises to him.</p>
            <p>To him therefore be ascribed the Glory
and Thanks of all their Charitable Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
in relation to Mankind; to him
be rendred all Praise and Honour, who
at first Created such excellent Beings, and
afterwards sent them forth to Minister
to our Salvation; who hath placed in us
Souls not unlike to these noble Beings;
and hath Promised, that if we be not
wanting to our selves, he will in due
time make us fully like unto them. <hi>To
him, with his Son and blessed Spirit, be ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all Power, Might, Majesty, Dominion and
Adoration, henceforth and for evermore.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is the peculiar Character of the
Christian Religion, that it is adapted
as well to the Interest as the reason of
Mankind; that it is not only Consentaneous
to our Natures, but advantageous to our
Persons; that it not only prescribes to us
our Duty, but directs us in the way of
Happiness. Herein it infinitely surpasseth
even all the more refined Systems of the
Gentile Divinity and Philosophy. They


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34506:95"/>
pretended to no more than to refine our
Reason, and enlighten our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by the Knowledge and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Truth. But then they could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
nothing, wherewith to satiate the
unbounded Appetite of the Will, and
create a real Happiness. Many of them
indeed asserted the immortality of the
Soul; but neither hoped a Resurrection
of the Body, nor any reward of the
Soul, beside the Conscience of a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Life.</p>
            <p>The Jewish Oeconomy indeed had a
reward annexed to it, but such as fell
infinitely short of the Desires of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and the Capacity of rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
as being wholly restrained to the
Pleasures of this Life, and appropriated
to the more ignoble part of Man the
Body. Whereas our Saviour, in this last
Revelation of God communicated by
him to the World, whereby the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of Mankind was fully to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,
and our Natures raised to the
highest Perfection, hath consulted not
only the Reason, but the interest of
Mankind.</p>
            <p>He hath satisfied the first, by giving
us a spiritual and rational Religion, not
tied up to the <hi>beggerly Elements</hi> of the


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34506:95"/>
World, nor wholly immersed in Rites
and Ceremonies; but agreeing to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Nature, and first Principles of
Reason. And then in the second Place
he hath advanced our Interest by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
to us an infinite and eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
far surpassing all the Pleasures and
Delights of this World.</p>
            <p>Our most Wise and ever Blessed Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
knew very well, that the greatest
part of Men are more moved with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of Profit, than with Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Duty. The latter only affect
our Understandings; but the first strike
our Senses, and ravish our Will.</p>
            <p>He might as well by the right of
Creation as Redemption have enjoyned
to us all the Precepts of the Christian
Religion, without annexing any Reward
to the performance of them. It had
even then been our Duty to obey; and
a sufficient Happiness by obeying to
serve the great ends of our Creator.
And therefore all the Patriarchs before
<hi>Abraham</hi> served God without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
promise of a Reward, much less
a Reward of that Nature and Value,
as is proposed to us Christians. They
might indeed justly hope for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God; but then that Favour


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:34506:96"/>
might consist only in providing them food,
and Rayment, and other common Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of humane Nature, and could not
with any certainty be extended farther.</p>
            <p>Since our Saviour therefore together
with a most excellent Religion hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to us an assurance of eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
and requireth our Obedience
for no other end, than that we may
thereby obtain this Reward: as we
ought to admire and magnifie the
infinite Goodness of God; so must
we condemn our own extreme Folly if
we neglect or contemn so great Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
            <p>This is an Argument highly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
to the Understanding and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of all Men, and therefore is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
urged by Christ, who begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his Sermon upon the <hi>Mount</hi> in the
V. <hi>Chap.</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> with affixing
this Promise to the greater and more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous
Duties of the Christian Religion,
that so the Difficulty of these might wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
be overseen by us upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Greatness of our Reward.
So <hi>Matth.</hi> XIII. 44. he compareth
the Kingdom of Heaven <hi>to a Treasure
hid in a Field, the which when a Man hath
found he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34506:96"/>
and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth
that field:</hi> and in the following Verses
to a Merchant <hi>selling all his</hi> Estate <hi>to
buy on Pearl of great price.</hi> By which
Sale<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>, and by the Joyfulness attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, he intimates that all worldly
Considerations are to be foregone, when
they stand in Competition with the
hopes of another Life.</p>
            <p>A Position which might justly be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
a Paradox, if that infallible
Mouth had not pronounced it; and
Reason did not in some measure assure
us of the Truth of it. But such was
both the Wisdom and Goodness of our
Saviour in prescribing to us a rule of
Life; that he chose to make use of all
the Arguments, wherewith either the
Will or Understanding of Mankind could
be incited, to engage us to the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of it; that so if the Duty we owe
to God for the Benefits of Creation, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
and Life, could not enforce us;
if the wonderful Love of our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
dying for us could not perswade
us; if Gratitude to both could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige
us; if neither Reason nor Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
could prevail with us to endeavour
the Perfection of our Nature, by Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Submission to the Divine Will;


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34506:97"/>
and thereby to serve the great Ends of our
Creation: yet the Promise of an eternal
Crown, and the Consideration of so vast an
Interest might enforce us to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>This obviates all the Objections even
of worldly Men, who must needs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that in vain do they Labour for the
Attainment of Felicity in this Life, if
it can never truly be found on this side
Heaven. A thorough perswasion of the
Truth of this would banish all sinful
Temptations, and extravagant Desires of
carnal Pleasures. For Men would be the
most deplorable and irrational of all
Creatures, if they preferred a present
trifle before a future Treasure, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
quitted the Life of Angels, to
retain those Pleasures which are common
to Beasts.</p>
            <p>And not only doth this Truth hold in
quitting the momentany Enjoyments of
this Life, and suffering our selves to be
deprived of them for an exchange of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Glory; but even in undergoing the
greatest Afflictions of this Life, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
Death it self, upon the same
Account. This our Saviour chiefly aims
at in this place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:34506:97"/>
For when in the foregoing Verses he
had foretold, that bearing the Cross
should be inseparable from the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Christian Religion; and that
he who endeavoured to decline this
Cross, and save his Life by a denial of
his Faith, should thereby incurr a much
greater Punishment than is the loss of
this temporal Life, he subjoyns in the
words of my Text, <hi>For what shall it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
a Man, if he shall gain the whole World,
and lose his own Soul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if he should say. That System
of Religion which I have instituted and
recommended to you, is not intended to
enlarge or satisfie the Pleasures of the
Body; but to increase the Dignity of the
Soul, improve its Faculties, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to it a Happiness commensurate to
the Vastness of its Desire, and the Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of its Creator. Whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seriously intends to become my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and partake of the Benefits of my
Gospel, must prepare himself with a
firm Resolution to quit all the Interests
and Advantages of the World, embrace
Afflictions, and not decline Death, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Malice of wicked Men and
the Obligation of my Commands shall
require that Tryal and Testimony of his


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34506:98"/>
Obedience. And in so doing he shall
not only perform his Duty, but secure
and promote his Interest. For those,
who shall basely renounce their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to me, or violate my Commands,
to save their own Lives, and avoid the
Malice of their Enemies, shall after this
Life undergo a much greater Loss and
Punishment, than that which they so
Cowardly fear'd, and ungenerously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd.</p>
            <p>On the other side, they who shall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
lay down their Lives, and slight all
the Terrors of Men and Devils, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their Obedience to me intire, and
retain the Profession of my Gospel, shall
be certainly Crowned with so great a
Reward, that the loss of this temporal
Life will be inconsiderable, in respect
of that eternal Life which is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by it. This is your Interest as well
as my Command; your Profit as well
as Duty. For it is not only reasonable
that every Man should quit that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
share and Portion, which he hath
in the Pleasures and Possessions of this
World, to secure thereby his Hopes of
a future Happiness; but even if all the
Riches and Possessions of the World were
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>aped upon one single Man, or could be


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34506:98"/>
all obtained by denial of my Religion
or Violation of my Laws, yet would
it not be a sufficient Motive for so great
a Crime. And he that should preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricate
upon such mean Considerations,
would find in the end, when he casts up
his Account, that he hath gained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>To evince, illustrate and recommend
to you this great Truth is the Design of
my present Discourse. Which therefore
I shall divide into these two Heads.
<list>
                  <item>I. That the Interests of the Soul are
infinitely greater and more considerable,
than those of the Body.</item>
                  <item>II. That this Interest is destroyed,
and the Soul rendred miserable by diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the Laws of God.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. That the Interests of the Soul are
infinitely greater and more considerable,
than those of the Body. And this appears,
if we consider either the Reason and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things, or the Revelation and
Commands of God. Under the first Head
may be comprised the Nature and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Soul, and the Excellency of
those peculiar Perfections and Rewards
which the Soul is capable of.</p>
            <p>First then, the Dignity and Precedence
of the Soul, was ever acknowledged in


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34506:99"/>
all Ages, by wife and learned Men of
all Sects and Perswasions; nay even the
more rude and illiterate parts of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
did ever firmly believe this, as an
Opinion planted in them by the first Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Nature, and arising from the first
Principles of Reason.</p>
            <p>That we have an immortal Soul, is a
thing which ought to be supposed by
all, who profess the least shew of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and cannot be denied without the
total Destruction of it. All false Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
were invented by Men, and the
true Religion proposed by God, merely
for the Improvement and direction of
this noble Being. It is this only which
distinguisheth us from the Rank and
Condition of Beasts, which likens us to
God, and makes us little inferiour to the
Angels. It is this, whereby we contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
the admirable and wonderful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of God; understand the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of his Government, and the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Works. It is this alone
whereby we form Habits of Vertue, and
do any thing grateful to our Creator:
whereby we receive the Instructions of
God, and know his Will. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Prov.</hi> XX. 27. the Spirit of Man is
called <hi>the candle of the Lord:</hi> because by


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:34506:99"/>
that only we receive the Divine Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and are instructed in the way to
Happiness. This Dignity and Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Soul beyond the Body
might be at large demonstrated from
many other Considerations, but I will
insist only upon three which are plain
and obvious to the understanding of all
Men.</p>
            <p>As first, by the Soul alone we receive
the influence and benefits of God. Some
Divine Benefits indeed belong also to the
Body, as Creation and Preservation, but
those are common to all other Creatures,
and belong equally to the vilest of all
created Beings: whereas the Favours
granted to the Soul are peculiar to it, and
to infinitely greater value. For to pass
by the natural Priviledges of Knowledge,
Desire and a Capacity of improvement;
all the superadded Happiness of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is intirely bestowed on it alone.
All Revelation was given for the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of this noble Being, that so it might
not be inferiour to the Angels in Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to whom it is little inferiour in
Dignity. To rescue this from the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of Sin and Dominion of the Devil,
the Son of God descended from Heaven,
lived an afflicted Life, and died a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:34506:100"/>
Death. Into this, as into a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Treasure, are all the Divine Graces
conveyed; Graces of which the Body
is no more capable, than a Stock or
Stone. Lastly by the Merits or Guilt of
the Soul, the Body will be hereafter ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saved or condemned. If then all
the Blessings of Heaven be primarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon the Soul; if this be the
only receptacle of moral Vertues and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Graces; if the Son of God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to do and suffer so much for the
Salvation of it; if all the future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Body depends upon the well-doing
of the Soul: certainly this Soul
deserveth our greatest Regard and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
as by which alone we obtain
the Favour of God, and are made like
unto him, by imitating his Perfections,
as far as our finite Nature will permit us,
in the Practice of Vertue and Holiness
of Life.</p>
            <p>In the next place, 'tis the Excellency
of our Souls alone which distinguisheth
one Man from another, and maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Person more excellent than his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
It is a childish mistake of Men
to imagine that Riches, or Honour, or
temporal Greatness, gives a real Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
to Mankind, or confers a true


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:34506:100"/>
Dignity upon the Possessors of them;
since all these outward Advantages are
common to the worst and most profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
of Men; who as they are most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
in themselves, so they deserve no
other than the Slight and Contempt of
all who know them. Not to say that
all these things are frail and momentany,
of which a Man may be bereaved in an
hour, either by the inconstancy of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
or the Malice of others. But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagine that our Wise Creatour
should assign that to be our chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
of which we might either be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
or defrauded; and that our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
should be in the Power, and at
the Mercy of another Man. In that
Case we should have been more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
than all the rest of the Creation;
if it were not in every Man's Power to
become Happy. So true is it, that all
the Excellency of Man consists in the
great and eminent Endowments of his
Soul; which the poorest of Men may
obtain, and when obtained can by no
Art or Fraud be taken from him.</p>
            <p>Thus the Scripture, giving an account
of the eminent Perfections of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the
Honour and Reverence paid to him, and
Dignities conferr'd upon him, gives this


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:34506:101"/>
as the Reason of it: <hi>Because an excellent
Spirit was in him,</hi> Dan. VI. 3. It was
that alone which caused him to surpass
the ordinary Rank of Men, and made
him the Favourite of Heaven. Not
that a more excellent and perfect Soul
was infused at first into him, than into
the rest of Men; (for all Souls are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
equal, and are capable of the same
Improvements) but that he had adorned
it with all the Perfections of Reason and
Religion, and thereby rendred it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the Favour of God, and Esteem
of Men.</p>
            <p>And herein clearly appears both the
Goodness of God, and the Happiness of
Men, that all these Improvements and
Cultivations of the Soul are equally pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to the Poorest, as well as the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Men. Poverty and temporal Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
cannot exclude us from the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Perfection, and in that from the
greatest Happiness. It is in the Power
of the meanest Person to be truly
more Excellent than his rich Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and to ensure to himself the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of Heaven, although not the
Riches of the Earth. Thus God hath
in Truth made an equal Distribution to
all Men, by assigning to all Souls an


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:34506:101"/>
equal Capacity. For as for the Goods
of Fortune, when put in the Scale
with Piety and the interests of Religion,
they deserve not the least Consideration.
There are some Endowments of the
mind indeed which are not common, and
cannot be obtained by all Men, as Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and an exquisite Knowledge. These
may put in a fair Plea for an intrinsick
Worth and Excellency, as being insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
from the Soul when once acquired;
of infinite use in this Life, and perhaps
greater in the next. But then there are
disadvantages attending such acquired
Knowledge, which may justly take off
the immoderate Desire of it, and
make it become no reasonable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Envy to a pious unlearned
Christian. As that it renders the way
to Heaven infinitely more difficult to the
Possessors of it; exposeth them to many
and great Temptations, not common to
all other Persons; but chiefly because
more and greater Duties are required of
them, greater and more severe Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
attend the neglect of them.</p>
            <p>In the more unlearned sort God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
no more than a hearty Sincerity,
Belief and sure Trust in the Merits of a
Crucified Saviour, and living up to the


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34506:102"/>
great Truths of Religion, and Principles
of common Honesty. In them he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
over-seeth small and trivial Faults,
and imputes not Errors to them, unless
they influence and corrupt their Practice.
But of the more learned sort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
he requireth right Notions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and worthy Conceptions of the
Divine Majesty, employing their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to the good of others, the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church; and after all, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Observation of the most minute Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilios
of the Divine Laws. In them
mistakes are dangerous, and Pardon not
so easie to be obtained. If indeed at last
they be thought worthy of the Joys of
Heaven, they will shine there in a more
eminent Station and brighter Glory.
But then, even the lowest Degree in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is a greater Happiness, than we can
either imagine or conceive.</p>
            <p>Thus all the truly desirable Perfections
of the Soul are possible to all, and debarr'd
from none. Those are no other than an
ardent Love of God, an active Zeal to
his Service, a strict Sobriety in our selves,
and a fervent Charity to all our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
How far these will advance the
Dignity of our Souls appears hence, that
these only make us capable of the Joys


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34506:102"/>
of Heaven; that 'tis the perfect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
Possession of these which
maketh Angels, and the want of these
which maketh Devils.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Our Body, when considered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
hath nothing excellent beyond other
material Creatures, nor is capable of any
Improvements. It is taken out of the
same Mass of Matter with other Bodies,
and after the Separation of the Soul by
Death is resolved into the same Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
becomes Filth and Rottenness, and
in Truth the most odious of all things.
Nay even in this Life, it would be subject
to the same miserable Condition with the
Beasts of the Field, if it were not
actuated by a noble and generous Soul,
which rescues it from the common Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of dull and vile Matter, and giveth
it the Honour to be joyned to, and be
the Companion of, a most excellent and
immortal Spirit. And so far is this Body
from receiving new Perfections in this
Life, that it continually decays till it be
laid in Ashes, and become as the Dung
of the Earth. None yet with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Care and Diligence could give Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to their Bodies, or as our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
it, <hi>add one cubit to their stature.</hi>
None with the greatest Art and Industry


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:34506:103"/>
can make their Senses more quick and
accurate: But certainly not any can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
immortality to their Bodies; a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
which naturally belongs to the
Soul.</p>
            <p>We believe indeed, That our Bodies
shall be hereafter invested with Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and made Partakers of the Glories
of Heaven, but then they shall be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a spiritual Nature; devested of
these gross Senses, which now accompany
us, and are the great Instruments of our
Worldly and admired Pleasures. For
then, <hi>There will be neither eating nor drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
marrying nor giving in marriage; but
we shall be like the Angels of heaven,</hi> in
the Fruition of purely spiritual Delights.
Which is an invincible Argument of the
Vanity and Vileness of earthly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Enjoyments: that we cannot be made
happy without the loss of them. If
they had been indeed of any real worth,
God would have continued them to us
in another Life. But since he hath made
way to the Consummation of humane
Happiness, by the Abolishment of all
gross and sensual Pleasures; and despoils
the Body, to enrich the Soul: We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but conclude these transitory Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are light and trifling, incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34506:103"/>
with real Happiness, and unworthy
<hi>the Spirits of just men made perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come next to consider the Excellency
of those peculiar Perfections and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
which the Soul is capable of
beyond the Body. Those Pleasures of
which alone our Body is capable, and
which we are apt so much to admire
here below, consist only in the Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of our Senses; Delights which
are so far beneath true Happiness, that
they are common to Beasts, finite, short,
and contemptible. The frequent Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of them may be thought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
their worth; but then this very
Repetition becomes nauseous, and is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the Reiteration of the same
thing. The desire of them is commonly
produced by an irregular Appetite, but
always by the infirmity of our Nature;
and when performed they leave no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
behind them. They cloy the
Appetite, and by their frequency become
troublesome and even odious to us; are
finished in a few moments; and then
leave nothing grateful behind them. But
which is chiefly to be considered, end
with our Life, and even in Life may
be obstructed by Diseases and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:34506:104"/>
An eminent Instance of this we have
in <hi>Solomon,</hi> in whom all the Greatness
and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>leasures of the World were joyned.
He presided over a mighty and powerful
People, and that in greater Glory, than
all the Kings before or after him. So
that if Ambition worldly Honour and
Pomp, could make him Happy, he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
them all in great abundance. If
the Fame of Wisdom, and a profound
Veneration among neighbour Nations,
could increase this Happiness, it was not
wanting to him; to whom the Queen of
<hi>Sheba</hi> came <hi>from the farthest parts of the
East to hear the wisdom of</hi> his mouth.
If Riches can confer any thing to this
desired Perfection, none can put in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Claim for it than he, in whose time
<hi>Gold was esteemed no more than Iron, and
Silver as stones for the abundance of it.</hi>
Lastly, if the Pleasures of Sense
can compleat our Happiness, none
had greater Advantages than he, at
whose Command was the most fruitful
part of the World, and who was Blessed
with a profound and uninterrupted Peace
all his Life.</p>
            <p>And least we should imagine, that he
made no use of all these Advantages, and
supposed means of Happiness; he assureth


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:34506:104"/>
us, Eccles. II. 10. That <hi>whatsoever his
eyes desired, he kept not from them; nor
with-held his heart from any joy.</hi> Nay by
a strange kind of Curiosity, that he
might leave nothing unattempted, he
tells us, That <hi>he gave his heart to know
madness and folly,</hi> Eccles. I. 17. One who
had all these Advantages, had run thro'
all the Scenes of Pleasure, and could by
his exquisite Wisdom and Knowledge of
the Nature of things, heighten and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
these Pleasures, must be allowed to
be a competent Judge of the worth
and value of them. Yet after all, he
gives this Verdict of them, <hi>Vanity of
Vanities all is Vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then no real Happiness, if no solid
Pleasure can be had from the Enjoyments
of Sense, from Riches, and the outward
Pomp of the World; we must recurr
to the Faculties of the Mind, where we
shall find an Happiness truly solid, and
which is more eternal. None but a vast
and infinite Good can satisfie the unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Desires of our Mind, nothing less than
Eternity it self can satiate an immortal
Being. For however our Souls be finite,
as all other Creatures are, yet our Wills
have no limits, but continually desire
somewhat more; unless that Good which


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:34506:105"/>
they already possess, can receive no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Additions. This Good is no other
than God, who alone can fix our restless
Wills, and by his infinite Perfections ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
them with Wonder and Pleasure
at the same time. This is a Happiness
truly peculiar to spiritual Beings, who
alone can contemplate the Majesty and
inimitable Goodness of their Creator;
and, by so doing, secure to themselves an
Happiness infinite in it self, not inferior
to the vast Desires of the Will, which
surviveth all the changes of Fortune,
Malice of Men, and even Death it
self.</p>
            <p>If we cannot, or will not, believe the
Greatness of these spiritual Pleasures, their
convenience to the Nature of our Souls,
and the infinite duration of them; 'tis
because we are unacquainted with them;
immersed in gross and earthly Delights
so far, that we are neither willing, nor
perhaps able to receive these greater and
more real Enjoyments, by attending so
much to the things of this World, we
have even changed the Nature and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of our Souls, and from Guides
and Directors made them mere Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to our Bodies, devested them of
all remembrance of their Divine Original,


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34506:105"/>
degraded them into a servile Condition,
and were we not sometimes put in mind
of the interest of another World, should
perhaps forget that we were created in a
Condition little lower than the Angels.</p>
            <p>Thus far Reason teacheth us, That
the interests of the Soul are to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to those of the Body: Revelation
doth the same no less fully. This was
the great end of the Christian Religion,
to wean our Affections from worldly
Pleasures, and fix them upon things
above; to withdraw us by degrees from
the Earth, and seat us at last in Heaven.
To this the whole Genius and Temper
of our Religion plainly tends, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to be ready at all times to take
up the Cross, undergo Persecutions, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Afflictions, and even suffer Death,
when the interest of our Souls requireth
us to do it. Thus our Saviour tells us,
<hi>He who loveth Father and Mother, Wife
or Possessions, beyond him, is not fit to be
his Disciple:</hi> and among other Precepts,
commands that his Followers should
<hi>deny themselves,</hi> that is, be ready to part
with all the Pleasures of the World, and
imaginary Delights of Nature, when
they stand in Competition with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of another Life. This Duty is


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:34506:106"/>
so strict, that for the Observation of the
most minute Precept, all Considerations of
wordly Profit and Pleasure must be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone;
and the whole Body destroyed,
rather than the Soul in the least be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour gave us an eminent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of this in himself; who in that
Life which he was pleased to lead on
Earth for the Salvation of a miserable
and wretched World, used none of all
those Pleasures, which we so much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
and greedily hunt after; denied
to himself even the Conveniencies of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therein put his Body to greater
Hardships than the very Beasts. <hi>For the
Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the Air
have nests: but the Son of Man had not
whereon to lay his head.</hi> As for Pains and
Torments, which we so much dread, and
are certainly the greatest Calamities
which can attend the Body, he willingly
underwent them, suffered himself to be
Crucified as a Malefactor, chiefly indeed
to appease the Divine Anger, and atone
for our Sins; but in the second place, to
give us an Example with how great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
and Patience, we ought to submit
to all Afflictions, and even Death it self,
when they tend to promote the interests
of the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:34506:106"/>
If then the Commands of God, and
the Example of Christ can perswade us;
if Divine Revelation, and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the Holy Jesus can move us;
there is no doubt to be made of this great
Truth, <hi>so plainly</hi> taught and revealed in
Scripture, that I will not any longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon it.</p>
            <p>I pass to the second Proposition, that
the Interests of the Soul are destroyed by
Sin or Disobedience to the Laws of God.
These Laws were at first given to direct
the Soul in the way to Happiness; and,
when complyed with, fail not to obtain
their End. No wonder then, if when
we neglect these means, we miss the End;
and, by pursuing contrary Methods, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our selves miserable. That ye may
the better be convinced of this, I will
speak of the Effects of Sin upon the Soul
in general, and of this Sin of Apostacy,
to which our Text more peculiarly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
in particular.</p>
            <p>As to the first then, we may observe,
That sin is contrary to the very Nature
of the Soul, which is a rational Being,
and as such ought to govern and direct
its Actions according to the Laws of
Reason. Otherwise it would be worse
than insensible Beings, which all perform


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34506:107"/>
the several ends of their Creation, and
by so doing perform the Commands of
their Creatour. Whereas the Soul in
contracting Habits of sin violates the
Laws of Reason, debases its own Nature,
rebels against God, and overthrows the
end of its Creation. For for this very end
our Souls were created, that they should
Act as spiritual Beings, and govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by the Principles of Reason insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them. For this Purpose God gave
us an understanding to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
good and evil, that we might be
able to imitate the Perfections of our
Creatour in Vertue and Holiness, and by
a strict Observation of the Rules of Life
formed by our Reason, at least maintain,
if not advance our Nature. When after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
through the Ignorance and Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy
of Men, these Rules were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and our Judgments blinded,
God gave us a standing Revelation, to
ascertain to us our Duty, and let us know
what we have to do. The performance
of this was the end for which we were
sent into the World, had Reason given
us, and a Soul assigned to us. To neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
our Duty then, or violate it by the
Commission of Sin, is no other than to
deny and disclaim our Nature, defeat the


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34506:107"/>
ends of our Creation, and degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a miserable sort of Beings. For as
Sin turn'd Angels into Devils; so it doth
the Souls of Men into somewhat worse
than Devils. 'Tis true, they will still
continue Souls, but that doth but aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
their Misery, because, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
they will never cease to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
always gnawed with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of their degenerous Actions, and
the Horror of their own depraved Natures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sin destroyeth the very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Happiness of the Soul, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in the Love of God, the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Attributes, and the Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Perfections, as we before prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And in these will consist the Joys
of Heaven, in a constant and serene Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
upon the unparallel'd Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our Creatour, in an ardent and
perpetual Love of him, and Conscience
of being loved by him. Now Sin sets
a Man at Enmity with God, makes him
unworthy his Favour, and hinders all such
Contemplation. For how can we think
on him with delight, whom we account
our Enemy? Or how can we not esteem
him our Enemy whose Laws we violate,
and whose Precepts we contemn? The
Conscience of this Divine Anger alone


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34506:108"/>
is a greater unhappiness than can be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
imagined.</p>
            <p>When a Soul is forced to say, God
hath created me and doth now preserve
me, but thinks me unworthy of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
and esteems me as the worst of his
Creatures. 'Tis true he gave me Reason
and Understanding, but they are to my
Destruction and Misery. I acknowledge
him to be an infinite Being worthy of
all love and dread, but he denieth to me
the influences of his Favour, doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
annihilate me; but 'tis because he
reserveth greater Punishments for me.
He put me here into a State of Probation
on Earth, that I might fit my self to be
his Attendant in Heaven; but now he hath
excluded me from all Hopes of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and destined me to be a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Devils. Such melancholly
Thoughts will render the Soul truly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
and not only unhappy, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of Happiness.</p>
            <p>For a Soul corrupted with Sin is no
more capable of the Joys of Heaven,
than is a blind Man of seeing the Light
of the Sun. They are Delights of a
purely spiritual Nature, and consist in
an intire Conformity to the Will of God;
so that if Heaven should by an unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:34506:108"/>
Miracle be bestowed upon wicked
Men, the Pleasures of it would neither
relish with them, nor be grateful to
them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Sin defeats the future Interests
of the Soul, by excluding it from its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Reward, and engaging it in eternal
Punishments. For in this Life the Soul
is no more than Probationer for another,
being a Being of it self capable of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and by the singular Mercy of
God to be endowed with it. So that it
Acts here only in order to the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that great Perfection which we
hope for hereafter; and by a prudent use
of this World gaineth Admittance into
the next, where it shall be received to
the immediate Presence of God; and
him whom it now views darkly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly,
shall then see <hi>face to face.</hi> This
will give the last Perfection to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and raise them to the highest pitch,
to which they can be advanced.</p>
            <p>But Sin depriveth the Soul of this Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and thereby permits it not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
its end. A Loss much greater, than
Thought can imagine, or Tongue
express; but still greater; when consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
not only as a bare loss of the Joys
of Heaven, but a fall into the bottom of


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:34506:109"/>
Hell; where such Punishments will be
inflicted, as will make the Soul desirous
of Annihilation. And then the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of its Nature will be so far from
helping it, that it will infinitely aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the sharpness of its Pains. For its
Immortality will render them eternal,
and its Understanding will heighten the
sense and feeling of them.</p>
            <p>In this Life Sinners often are pleased
with their own miserable Condition, and
Fancy themselves seated in Paradise,
when environed with Pleasures, and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Enjoyments. They can stifle
the Dictates of their Consciences, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
make use of their imaginary Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
But in Hell <hi>their fire is not quenched,
and their worm dieth not.</hi> The Sharpness
of their Torments will not suffer them to
rest. And if those should be extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet will they still be tormented with
an inward Fire, so much the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
because then they will be certainly
convinced in Judgment, that they acted
against their own Interests, and the plain
Rules of Reason, in running the Danger
of eternal Punishments, for the sake of a
few gross and trifling Pleasures.</p>
            <p>We may next consider the peculiar
influence of that Sin which our Saviour


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:34506:109"/>
here chiefly intends. This is the Sin of
Apostacy, or denial of the true Religion;
against which Christ fore-arms his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
by inculcating this necessary truth
of preferring the goods of the Soul to
those of the Body. For this foul Sin is
ever committed for some temporal End,
being too odious to recommend it self
without some outward Advantages. Men
deny not their God out of a dislike or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
of him, but to secure to themselves
a Fortune in the World, prevent some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies,
or gratifie some Lusts.</p>
            <p>This is a Crime of the same Nature
and Contagion with Idolatry under the
old Law. For to worship a false God
is the same thing as to deny the true one,
and the first cannot be done without the
latter. How heinous God accounted this,
appeareth from the whole Tenour of the
Mosaick Law, which is chiefly directed
against this Sin alone. All the Writings
of the Prophets are employed against it;
and all the Judgments, which God ever
inflicted upon his People of <hi>Israel</hi> are
solely owing to this Cause: Insomuch,
as there is no Record left in sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
of any Pardon ever granted to the
Commission of this Sin.</p>
            <p>And indeed a wilful Apostacy from the


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:34506:110"/>
true Religion dissolves the very Union
between God and Man, and leaves no
place for Pardon. Such a Person openly
by his Act proclaims to the World, that
he will have nothing to do with God, bids
defiance to him, and disclaims his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
It would prostitute the Divine
Mercy, and make it cheap and easie,
to bestow it upon such execrable Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which do violence to Heaven, and
are the very last Efforts of Impiety. This
cannot but degrade the Soul from its
Affinity to God, and debar it from all
nearer approach to his Presence. We
cannot hope to have any Interest left in
God after a denial of him, nor can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Horror entertain any remembrance of
him. How then shall we make our Souls
happy with the continual Meditation
of his Perfections; or please our selves
with the Hopes of the future Fruition of
him? In that Case it will be our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
to banish all thoughts of God, and
remove from our selves, as far as possible,
all Considerations of a future State; that
so we may not be alarmed with the dread
of an angry God, and the Terrors of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Torments. Thus a denial of God
against the Light of our own Consciences
doth not only render us unhappy, but


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:34506:110"/>
causeth us to endeavour to become yet
more unhappy, by a total and wilful
stifling of all Thoughts and Meditations
of God, in which alone true Happiness
consists.</p>
            <p>And this is true not only in the Case
of notorious Apostacy, when any one
openly renounceth his Religion and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his belief of the true God; which Case,
in these peaceable times of the Church
doth not often happen; but also in the
Commission of every deliberate Sin, which
in truth is a no less formal Apostacy from
God, than that before-mentioned; where
the Sinner puts in the Scale the present
Pleasure and Convenience of the Sin, with
the future Consequence and Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of it; and after having weighed
each rejects the Command of God, of
which he is very Conscious, and prefers
the present Satisfaction of the Sin. This
is done in every deliberate Sin, and this
is indeed a no less true Apostacy, than
an open denial of God. For this we may
be assured, that whosoever upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
Choice prefers the seeming Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of any sin to the Command of God,
would never foregoe all the Pleasures
of this Life, and even Life it self, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Will of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:34506:111"/>
It remains that I make some Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what hath been said. First then,
if the Interests of the Soul be much
greater than those of the Body, and the
Happiness of the Soul consists only in the
due Contemplation of God, and the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of Piety and Vertue; let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to render our Soul, even in this
Life, as Happy as we possibly can. It
is not reasonable, that all the Cares of
our Life should be employed in provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Necessaries or rather Superfluities to
the Body, or attending to the Pleasures
of it: That no farther use should be
made of the Soul, than to serve as a Slave
to the Body, to heighten its Enjoyments,
and refine its Pleasures. Let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that we carry about with us a more
noble Being, which deserveth our
Care in the first place, and cannot be
neglected without the loss of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>May not God justly say to Mankind,
I have given to you great and Celestial
Souls, endued with wonderful Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and capable of much greater, when
rightly cultivated; your Bodies I formed
from the Clay of the Earth, but your
Souls I sent down from Heaven; the
one I permit to return to Corruption, but


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:34506:111"/>
the other I have invested with Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality?
How justly might I expect that
you would have valued these two accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their several worth and Dignity:
That you should not indeed starve the
Body, nor Tyrannize over it, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
attend chiefly to the Concerns of
the Soul; that it might not fall short of
that Happiness which I intended for it,
nor be deprived of those spiritual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
which it is capable of? But
alas! Man is turned back and grown
foolish, employeth himself with all his
Diligence to procure Pleasures for his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
<hi>rises early, sits up late, and eats the
bread of carefulness,</hi> to heap up Riches
for the Continuation of these Bodily En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments;
makes this the only Business
of his Life, and thinks of nothing else.
As for his Soul he makes it a Slave to his
Body, refuseth to receive Directions from
it, and sometimes forgets that he hath
any. What shall we answer to these
Expostulations of God? I fear we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
plead Innocence. Our Actions
and the whole Course of our Lives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
the contrary. We are
continually busie about enlarging
our petty Acquisitions in the World,
we trouble and turmoil our selves about


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:34506:112"/>
the Conveniencies of the Body: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
no leisure to the Soul to meditate
upon the Greatness and Worth of her
Creator, the necessity of her own Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and to form these Meditations into
Habits of Vertue, and thereby procure
to our selves that real Happiness even in
this Life, which is infinitely more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
than all the Riches and Possessions of
the World when joyned in one.</p>
            <p>Again Secondly, If the Happiness of
the Soul in this Life deserveth our greatest
Care, much more doth the welfare of it
in a future State, as being free from all
Passions and Infirmities of the Body, and,
which is more, eternal. This ought to
be the Business and Employment of our
whole Lives, that we fail not of the
Consummation of our Hopes and Crown
of our Happiness. And it would be so,
if we were throughly perswaded of the
Existence and immortality of our Souls,
of the Greatness and Importance of their
Interests, and the infinite Preference which
is due to these beyond those of our Body.
For can it be, that we are perswaded of
the Truths of these things, and yet Act
as though we had neither Souls nor
Reasons; that we believe the Existence
of another more Glorious and lasting


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:34506:112"/>
State, and yet set up our rest in this;
that we hope for the appearance of a
Judge at the last day, and yet never think
of making our Accounts ready? Let us
reflect upon the Nature of our Souls, and
justly weigh the great Interests of them;
consider the Vanity of worldly Pleasures,
and the shortness and inconstancy of this
frail Life; remember the Glories of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the inconceivable Happiness of
another Life; and we must either put
off our Reason, or employ it in pursuing
those Interests, which do so greatly and
so nearly concern us.</p>
            <p>Let us be so brave and generous as not
to think that we <hi>die like the beasts that
perish;</hi> that we were made for greater
and more noble Ends, intended for the
Favour of God, and Society of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
that we carry about with us spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Beings which cannot die, and will
receive no Prejudice by the Dissolution of
the Body; that these Souls were designed
by God to receive a Participation of his
own Glory, and will certainly do so, if
they be not debarr'd from it by our fatal
Stupidity and Neglect; and that in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for this more Excellent part of us, we
secure likewise a Mansion for the Body,
which at the general Resurrection shall


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:34506:113"/>
be received into the same Station, and
undergoe the same fate with the Soul.</p>
            <p>If we were perfectly perswaded of the
Truth of all this; we could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
our selves up to pursue the Vanities
of the World, and heap up Riches,
which are of no Service for the Interests
of another Life, and promote not our
real Happiness in this. Can you be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to believe all this, and at the same
time imploy your Lives upon the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the contrary? Hope for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
designed, and make no step to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Attainment of it; rather let
us endeavour with our utmost Vigour to
maintain that Degree which God hath
assigned to us among created Beings;
and not by our Degeneracy become the
vilest and most miserable of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Let us do nothing unworthy that
noble Being, which is seated within us,
nor cloath the Body with the Spoils of
it. Let us maintain the Dignity and
Character of our Natures, by a severe
and unblemisht Integrity, and procure
to our selves an assurance of those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
which are allotted to us. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
in worldly Matters, we willingly
over-see lesser and more trivial Gains for
obtaining of a greater and more substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:34506:113"/>
Profit; and should we not slight the
impertinent Gayeties, and vile Allurements
of the World, to secure to our selves <hi>a
treasure which fadeth not, eternal in the
Heavens?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, If the benefits of the Soul be
ever preferable to the Interests of the
Body; if all the Glories and Riches of
this World be of small account, when
opposed to the Happiness of the next; if
the Favour of God, and Concerns of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
be the only true Perfections of
Mankind: a firm Constancy in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
and Profession of Religion, although
attended in this Life with the greatest
Inconveniences, Discouragements and
Afflictions, will not only be our Duty,
but our highest Interest. This is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Consequence of the words of my
Text, and the Conclusion which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
himself drew from them, in the
following Verse<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> with which I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<hi>Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed
of me and of my words, in this adulterous
and sinful generation; of him also shall the
Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in
the Glory of his Father with the Holy Angels.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words are the Conclusion
of a remarkable Parable of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and seem to be the Scope to which
his whole Discourse was therein directed;
to shew the Vanity of that Pretence,
wherewith unreasonable Men have been
wont to defend or excuse their Sins; the
uncertainty of the Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of another Life, arising from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of a visible Experience of them, or an


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:34506:114"/>
undeniable Attestation of the Truth of
them by constant Miracles.</p>
            <p>It was not for the peculiar Doctrines
of Christ alone that the Jews required
a Sign to be given to them, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the Truth of them; but also in
their ancient and received Doctrines they
entertained Scruples, because not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by a constant Continuation of
the same Miracles, which at first esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
them. An incredulity, as it
should seem, Hereditary to the Jews,
and renewed as often as the Divine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were interrupted. No sooner was
<hi>Joshua</hi> dead, and that Generation <hi>which
had seen all the great works of the Lord,
which he had done for Israel,</hi> as we are told
in <hi>Judges</hi> II. but the next Generation even
lost the knowledge of God, <hi>they knew not
the Lord,</hi> as it is there expressed: and
altho' Miracles were continued down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them by the Ministration of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Holy Men; yet as these could
be visible but to a certain Number, they
produced no universal influence, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
not the rest; and even in those who
saw them, they seemed to have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
no other effect than wonder and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musement.
They still continued their
disbelief of those Promises and Threats,


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:34506:115"/>
which they saw not yet effected, and of
that future State, which they did not yet
perceive.</p>
            <p>And it were to be wished that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity
of the Jews had been so here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
to them, as to be peculiar to them;
but it hath found place even among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
also; many of whom have even
renounced and denied their Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
themselves could not see those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
upon the Authority of which
Christianity was at first founded. Others
become irresolute and remiss in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of their Duty, as being upon
the same account unsatisfied in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of it. And all pretend that there
is no Duty so difficult which they would
not practise, no Pleasure so grateful which
they would not Renounce; if God would
satisfie their Doubts, raise their Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and awaken their Thoughts, by
some extraordinary Admonition or Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
such as the working of a Miracle,
or sending one from the Grave, to assure
them of the reality of another State from
his own Experience.</p>
            <p>That Men should make such Pretences
for their Irreligion, is no wonder; sin
appears odious and ugly to all even at
the first Sight, and ever wants some Cloak


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:34506:115"/>
to hide its Deformity; or that their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
should prompt them to such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
Fancies, is not strange. The
Desires of Men are wanton; and 'tis not
the Body alone that hath irregular Lusts
attending it. It is only to be admired that
Men should not easily discover the Vanity
of this Pretence; for the discovery of
which our Lord hath plainly marked out
the way to us in this excellent Parable;
wherein the Example of a rich voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Man is proposed to us, either disbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or at least putting far from him the
Thoughts of another Life, and therefore
busying himself wholly in the Pleasures
of this World. On the other side we
have a poor despised and afflicted Man,
who in prospect of the Rewards of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Life patiently endured the Afflictions
of this. Then the event of this different
Conduct is proposed to us; the one tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
to <hi>the bosom of</hi> Abraham, that is,
either to an eminent Station in Heaven,
as some expound it, or to a Condition of
Peace and Tranquility, as others: The
other condemned to a State of Torments,
to a Punishment so rigorous, that therein
even the most inconsiderable Refreshment
would appear to him the greatest Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and that, altho' received by the


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:34506:116"/>
means of one whom he had formerly
so much contemned; desiring only that
<hi>Lazarus, might be sent to dip the tip of his
finger in water and cool his tongue.</hi> He
now becomes sensible of the certainty of
those different States after Life, which he
had before either disbelieved, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
The Rewards of good Men he
finds in <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom <hi>he seeth afar off
in Abrahams bosom.</hi> The Punishments of
bad Men he experienceth in himself; and
to compleat his Misery, is assured from
<hi>Abraham,</hi> that the State of each is wholly
unalterable, an <hi>unpassable gulf being fixt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this miserable Condition, he cannot
but reflect upon his own unhappiness;
his incessant Pains will not permit him to
lay aside those Thoughts; and then it is
but natural to recal to Mind and bewail
the Causes of it. He remembers, that
all which now befalls him, had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
foretold unto him; but that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had not, while alive, entred into a
serious Consideration of it; as not being
favoured with any extraordinary Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
which might strike his Thoughts
and fix them to a serious reflection on his
Duty. The Conscience of his own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
maketh him desirous, that none dear


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:34506:116"/>
unto him, should fall into the same Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity;
and then judging that what
had been the occasion of his unhappiness,
might also become their Ruin, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
or inconsideration of a future State;
he desireth to prevent it; begging of
<hi>Abraham to send Lazarus from the dead
to his five brethren, to testifie unto them,
least they also come into this place of torment.</hi>
But in return to this, he is told, that his
desire is unreasonable; since God hath
provided an ordinary means for their
Instruction, <hi>They have Moses and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
let them hear them;</hi> Ver. 29. and
that even altho' granted, it would be
unsuccessful: <hi>For if they hear not Moses
and the Prophets; neither will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
though one rose from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parable was spoken to the Jews,
to whom nothing was expresly revealed
concerning the Rewards or Punishments
of another Life. So that it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
how <hi>Abraham</hi> could remit the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of <hi>Dives</hi> to <hi>Moses and the Prophets</hi>
for Satisfaction in this Matter, when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and the Prophets</hi> have nothing express
concerning it.</p>
            <p>To this we may answer, That the
opinion of future Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
was at that time universally enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained


<pb n="226" facs="tcp:34506:117"/>
among the Jews; and that drawn
from the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Prophets and inspired Men,
by Interpretations generally received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. Their Scribes and Doctors,
to whom our Saviour sends the People
for Instruction, and from whom they
received without scruple the Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Law, resolved all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
and Threats of God into this
Sense; so that those to whom our Lord
spoke, made no doubt, but that all this
was to be learned from <hi>Moses and the
Prophets;</hi> and that it might be indeed
deduced by just Inference, we may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
from that Argument of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
wherewith he convinced the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees;</hi>
and on which the Author of the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> so largely insisted after him;
the not performing of any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Benefits to the Patriarchs in this
Life by God, after the bestowing of very
ample and magnificent Promises of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
upon them. Whence it infallibly
followed, that since God was true and
could not be false to his Promise; he
reserved the performance of it to another
Life.</p>
            <p>But we need not go so far to justifie
this Expression of our Saviour; since his


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:34506:117"/>
Design in this place was not so much to
treat of the Nature or certainty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
or Punishments after Death, as to
confute the Pretence of those Sinners,
who in defence of their Sins alledged the
want of extraordinary Conviction. For
since God had prepared ordinary means
of Conviction, and those abundantly
sufficient for their designed end, in vain
were any extraordinary means desired.
Since if the Threats and Promises of God,
whether relating to this or another Life,
contained in the Writings of <hi>Moses and
the Prophets;</hi> if all the Arguments,
whereon the Truths of those Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were at first established, could not
engage Men to the Practice of their Duty,
could not induce them to the belief or
desire of those Promises, and to the fear
of those Threats; if this ordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Conviction proved ineffectual,
neither would the extraordinary Attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Divine Will by constant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
or of the consequences of it, by
the Apparition of deceased Men, who
had experienced them, have any better
Success. In Prosecution therefore of our
Lords design in these words I will
shew,
<list>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:34506:118"/>
                  <item>I. That the Desire of extraordinary
Conviction is unreasonable.</item>
                  <item>II. That such extraordinary means of
Conviction would be unuseful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As to the First, It is the Property not
of God alone, but of all rational Agents
also, not to Act in vain, but always for
some Cause, and in Prosecution of some
Design. When therefore God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
sufficient means for the Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all Men in the ordinary methods
of Salvation, which he hath established,
it would be vain and trifling to practise
extraordinary Methods; since this could
tend to no end, every reasonable end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
supplied by the ordinary Means;
and that the ordinary means doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the end perfectly and sufficiently, we
cannot doubt without calling in question
the Wisdom of God who established it;
but if it would be unreasonable in God
to practise such extraordinary Methods,
it will be absur'd in Man to desire it;
since 'tis impossible that God should do
any unreasonable thing.</p>
            <p>Further, if the Majesty and Wisdom
of God should permit it, it would yet
be an intolerable Presumption in Man to
desire or expect it. Our great Creator


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:34506:118"/>
in framing the Universe, whereof Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is but a small part, setled general
Laws, whereby every part of it might
be governed and directed. Not any
part of the whole Creation moveth, but
in Vertue of these general Laws, nor
can all together deviate in the least from
them. Now every Miracle is an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these general Laws; therein God
supercedes the ordinary Course of the
World, and produceth somewhat, which
would never have happened without his
extraordinary Interposition. What a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
then would it be in Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that God should exert his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
as often as his vain Imagination
should expect it; or that the constant
Course of the World should be altered
to please his Fancy?</p>
            <p>It is indeed a great mistake of many
Deists, that no Case can happen, wherein
it shall be fitting to change the Course of
Nature, and Act in a miraculous manner;
that were to limit the Power of God, and
to bereave him of the Attribute of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Goodness dispensing its self in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Emanations to Mankind. But
it is a no less insolence to Desire, that the
Divine Power should attend every idle
Motion or Capricio, and work a Miracle


<pb n="230" facs="tcp:34506:119"/>
as often as Man should entertain a doubt.
Not to say that this would vilifie the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of God; and that it supposeth some
greater Dignity in Man than is really in
him, as if all the Creation should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
or altered to satisfie his Will.
This would destroy even the end of
Miracles, which lose their Majesty and
their Efficacy by being prostituted upon
every mean Account. For if peculiar
Miracles must be wrought to satisfie the
Doubts of every Man, they must be so
frequent, that it would be impossible to
know what the fixed Course of Nature
were, and so equally impossible to discern
miraculous from natural Actions. Or if
they could be separated, yet one would
be no more regarded than the other;
since it is the rareness and surprizingness
of it which makes a Miracle considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And it is most certain, that the
Power of God doth no less truly and
fully exert it self in every ordinary Act
of Nature, than in the greatest Miracle.
Only the latter, being never performed
but for some great and noble End, is
justly esteemed the Indication of some
particular Will of God; which it could
not be, if it were as frequent as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Effects of Nature; nor could it be


<pb n="231" facs="tcp:34506:119"/>
less frequent, if it were always to be
opposed to the Doubts and Scruples of
private Men.</p>
            <p>Again, it must be remembred, that in
proposing any Religion to us, God deals
with us as with rational Creatures; he
giveth us sufficient means of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but as he forceth not our Will, so
neither our Understanding. If the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Faith were as demonstrative as
Geometrical Propositions, as it would be
impossible, that any should be Infidels;
so neither would it be in the least com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
to be Believers: no more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Reward, than to believe those
Axioms which we cannot disbelieve,
without forcing our Understandings, and
giving the Lye to our own Reason.</p>
            <p>All Religion, and the annexing of
Rewards to it, supposeth somewhat in
the Power of Man to embrace or reject,
but this would not be, if as often as any
Man should entertain a Doubt, God
should visibly interpose, and deter him
from it by some amazing Act of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence.
Whereas the knowledge of
God and true Religion, if it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
laudable or capable of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
must require a suitable Diligence
in Enquiry; a fit Preparation of Mind


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:34506:120"/>
for the Reception of it, by removing all
corrupt Passions and Inclinations, which
may oppose the Admission of it; a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Examination of the Arguments
which recommend it; a firm Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Promises of God, although
not yet perceived by Sense, nor as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained
by any Proof equivalent to
Sense, yet confirmed by Arguments,
which in a mind fitly disposed, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
judging cannot be rejected. All these
ends are excellently supplied in a fixed
and standing Rule of Faith, wherein Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelations are conveyed by the
Ministration of Men; whereby neither
the Divine Omnipotence is prostituted
in working Miracles upon all occasions,
nor the order of Nature continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed,
nor the Pride of Man fomented,
nor his Understanding forced, nor the
Merit of Faith defeated, but the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Divine Will is performed in an
easie, safe and sufficient method.</p>
            <p>And when such an excellent method
is once setled by the Divine Wisdom, it
is most unreasonable to imagine, that God
will violate or overturn it for the sake of
any private Man<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> For this were to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
That some Emergencies may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
not provided for in the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34506:120"/>
and which God did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
when he made that Establishment.
Which sufficiently demonstrates not only
the unreasonableness of those Men, who
require particular Miracles for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Scruples; but also the Vanity and
mistake of those Enthusiasts, who after
this ordinary Rule of Faith is setled, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have received their System of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
from extraordinary Inspiration. For
either the fixed Rule must be insufficient
to teach them the Faith, which to affirm
is a dishonour to God; or their Faith
must be somewhat different from that
contained in the ordinary Rule, which
themselves will not allow; or God must
Act in vain when he bestows such unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Illumination on them. The true
Reason of such Mens fond conceit is no
other than a vehement Pride, whereby
they scorn to be included in the common
Rank and Discipline of Christians; and
from a haughty esteem of their own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
affect to distinguish themselves from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by bold Pretences, expecting some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
extraordinary should be done for
them, as being extraordinary Persons.
Which is true not only in them, but in all
who desire particular Miracles to be
wrought for their satisfaction. For of these,


<pb n="234" facs="tcp:34506:121"/>
few or none are so unreasonable, as to think
it convenient that the same Favour should
be extended to all Mankind; but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
themselves to be more worthy, and
as it were of a higher Rank than their
fellow Creatures, presume to expect that
somewhat more should be done for them
than for other Men.</p>
            <p>After all, if none of these Reasons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the Expectation of such extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Methods to be indulged to any; yet
if they should appear no less ineffectual,
when bestowed, than the ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
are; it would be highly unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to desire them. So that to all
which I have offered upon this Head, a
new Confirmation will arise from the
Consideration of the second thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
Namely</p>
            <p>II. That such extraordinary means of
Conviction would be no less unuseful and
unsuccessful, than are the ordinary means.
And that will appear, either if we reflect
on the Reasons, which defeat the Success
of the ordinary means, or the force of
those Objections to which both Methods
are liable. The true Cause which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the ordinary means unsuccessful, is
not the want of Evidence, but the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of it to the Lusts and Passions of


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:34506:121"/>
Men. It finds no welcome Reception in
World, because contrary to the Genius
the of it; it abridgeth the Sensuality, the
corrupt Desires and inclinations of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
A covetous Man will not obey it,
least he should forgoe the immoderate
Love of Riches. A carnal Man will not
receive it, least he be obliged to restrain
his admired Enjoyments. It forbiddeth
Revenge, Envy and Malice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Minds possessed with these Vices can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear it.</p>
            <p>These are the Impediments which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
the Efficacy of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
they plead more strongly, and
perswade more effectually, than the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
which recommend that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Religion. Few or none, who enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Consideration of it, perceive not
the just Motives of its Credibility. They
acknowledge it reasonable to Assent to
it; but then comparing the Pleasure of
sin forbidden by it, with the certainty of
those Promises and Threats which are
annexed to it; they willingly over see
and reject the latter, that they may not
forego the former. And while Men act
thus against the Dictates of Reason, no
Evidence of Miracles will be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them. If any such were perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:34506:122"/>
for their satisfaction; it could have
no other Effect, than to convince them
of the reasonableness and truth of that
Religion, in Confirmation of which they
were wrought; and this Conviction is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
sufficiently performed by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
means. So that in both Cases
Reason directs them to embrace and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
this Divine Revelation; and if in
one Case the direction of reason be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
it can scarce be hoped that in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it will be admitted.</p>
            <p>For all true Piety and Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
upon this Principle, a Resolution
of performing whatsoever Reason shall
direct. And if this Principle be once
violated, it is no matter, whether the
Evidence of Reason be greater or less;
since the Man is resolved not to obey it,
any farther than it shall agree with his
own Lusts. For Miracles affect the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
only, they reform not the Will
of Man. They induce him indeed to
look up to the Author of them, from
whom he is to receive direction, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
not those Lusts and Passions, which
oppose the performance of that Divine
Direction. The same irregular Desires
continue, the same Affections possess his
Soul, and will infallibly render the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est


<pb n="237" facs="tcp:34506:122"/>
Evidence of Duty unsuccessful; until
a firm Resolution be formed by him of
performing whatsoever shall appear to be
his Duty, of submitting to whatsoever
Reason shall direct, of Assenting to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it shall recommend. And when
this Resolution is once formed, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
means setled for the Conveyance of
Religion, will obtain equal Success with
any extraordinary methods whatsoever;
since even in that, sufficient Evidence
may be found to convince Mankind of
the truth of it; and therefore Reason
directs and requires Obedience and Assent
to it.</p>
            <p>No wonder then that the Jews, even
under the Government of <hi>Moses,</hi> while
they enjoyed the sight of frequent Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
nay for Forty years together were
fed by a constant Miracle, continued still
no less disobedient, made frequent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacies
from God, rebelled against his
Prophet, by whose Ministration those
Miracles were performed, and could never
be brought to any tolerable sense or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Religion. In departing out of
<hi>Egypt</hi> they had not left their vicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
behind them, but retained the
same Sensuality and Perverseness of mind.
In which Case it was not possible that


<pb n="238" facs="tcp:34506:123"/>
the clearest Demonstration of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
could make any impression on
them. It was all one whether God
wrought one or ten thousand Miracles for
their satisfaction; since one alone might
convince them, and all together could
do no more; as a blind Man receives no
more advantage from the light of the
Sun, than from a single Star. Our Lord
indeed saith, in Matth. XI. 21. That <hi>if
the mighty works which were done in Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saida,</hi>
(among the Jews) <hi>had been done in
Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented
long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</hi> But this
may well be supposed to have been said,
rather to exaggerate the Impenitence and
Perverseness of the Jews, than to declare
what would have been the certain Event,
if those Miracles had really been perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides the Case was infinitely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
between the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Tyrians.</hi>
The former had a standing Rule of Faith,
whereby to receive the Knowledge of the
Will of God, in the Writings of <hi>Moses
and the Prophets;</hi> the others wanted that
advantage. The Tradition of the first
Patriarchs, whence they also descended,
had been worn out by a long Succession
of time; and the Notions of natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion


<pb n="239" facs="tcp:34506:123"/>
had been defaced by long disuse; so
that Miracles were even necessary to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that defect and restore the Knowledge
of true Religion among them; and had
they seen the mighty works of the blessed
Jesus, it is not improbable, but that <hi>they
would have repented in sackcloth and ashes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther, if we consider the common
Objections, to which the ordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of conveying Religion long since
setled without Miracles, and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
method by Miracles, are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
we shall find them equal on both
sides. The general Objection against the
ordinary method, is the want of absolute
Demonstration; and even altho' Miracles
should be always continu'd that still would
be wanting. Men desirous to retain their
Vices, in Contradiction to the Precepts of
Religion, would still alledge, That those
Miracles were no other than Illusions,
that their Senses deceived them, or were
imposed on by Tricks and Impostures.</p>
            <p>Particularly that sort of method, which
the rich Man in the Text desired might
be employed for the Conversion of his
Brethren, would be of all others the most
exceptionable; I mean the Apparition of
the Spirits of deceased Men, assuring the
living of the reality of another Life. It


<pb n="240" facs="tcp:34506:124"/>
would be impossible to form Rules where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to distinguish true from imaginary
Apparitions, the appearance of humane
Souls from Illusion of evil Spirits. Or
if such Rules could be formed; Men
could never be assured of the Truth of
what they should reveal; since the Souls
of Men put not off their Vices with the
Body, and may still retain such Sins, as
may be Exercised without the assistance
of corporeal Organs, such as Envy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
Lying, and Fraud. Or if all these
Difficulties were removed; the Terror
and Affrightment attending such Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions
would infallibly hinder all clear
Perception either of the reality of the
Apparition, or of the Matters revealed
in it.</p>
            <p>If then, there be any here, as it is a
Prejudice common to many Christians,
who imagines, that if he had lived in the
time of Christ and his Apostles, and had
seen with his own Eyes the miraculous
Works performed by them; or if God
should please to admonish him by the
Admonition of some departed Soul, he
should then carefully observe the Precepts
of Religion, and live up to the Rules of
it; let him be assured, That he deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>th
his own Soul; that if the present Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments


<pb n="241" facs="tcp:34506:124"/>
of Christianity, afforded to him
in the ordinary Rule, cannot induce him
to the belief or practice of his Duty;
neither would that extraordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
which he so much desireth. He
hath already sufficient Motives of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
and Instruction in the Scripture,
in the Exhortations of those who are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God for this very Office; and
if he rejecteth these, neither would he
be any more moved, altho' God should
speak to him from Heaven. The same
Lusts and Vices, which hinder the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of the one, would defeat the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of the other; and even if he should
be satisfied in his fond Desires, he would
still fly off, and seek some other Cloak
for his Impiety.</p>
            <p>Let us rather be thankful to God for
those ordinary means of Instruction a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d
Admonition, which he hath afforded <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s.
Let us by a right use of them approve
our selves worthy of them; and then that
Satisfaction and Conviction, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may pretend they can receive alone
from Miracles, Inspirations and Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we shall infallibly find in <hi>Moses
and the Prophets;</hi> in the common me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Salvation; in the Writings of
the Holy Pen-men, and in the constant


<pb n="242" facs="tcp:34506:125"/>
Instructions of the Church. This Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
will be raised and actuated by a
careful discharge of the Duties enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by it; by a frequent Conversing with
those means, whereby it is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
by a diligent use of all those Religious
Offices, and Participation of Holy Rites,
whereby it may be improved. So shall
what we now know certainly indeed, but
not Demonstratively, be at last advanced
into an absolute and perfect Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when we shall see our Lord Face to
Face, and sensibly enjoy, what we now
assuredly hope. <hi>To the Fruition of this Joy,
and Completion of this Hope, God of his
infinite Mercy bring us all for the sake of
Jesus Christ,</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>Now what the Sun is to the visible
World, to the Eyes of Men, and to all
corporeal Objects, which receive his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences;
the same is Christ to the Soul
of Man; dispensing the same Benefits to
it; producing the same Effects in it;
dispelling the Darkness of it, animating,
quickning and enlivening it, enlightning
and directing it; and Communicating
his beneficial Influences to all who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and follow the <hi>Light</hi> which he
holds out to them. All this Christ af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms

            </p>
            <p>A great and eminent Character indeed
to be <hi>the Light of the world;</hi> and which
can be verified of none but that Messias,

made in more than one place of the
Old Testament. For we read also in
the XLII. of Isa. <hi>I the Lord have called
thee in righteousness; and will give thee for

Gentiles, to open the blind eyes.</hi> And in

the LX. Ch. <hi>Arise, shine; for thy Light
is come; and the Glory of the Lord is risen
upon thee. And the Gentiles, shall come to
thy Light, and Kings to the brightness of
thy rising.</hi> And of the times of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias
it is foretold by the same Prophet,
XXX. 26. <hi>Moreover the Light of the
Moon shall be as the Light of the Sun; and
the Light of the Sun shall be seven fold as
the light of seven days, in the day that the
Lord bindeth up the breach of his people,
and healeth the stroke of their wound,</hi> and
LX. 19. <hi>The Sun shall be no more thy
Light by day; neither for brightness shall
the Moon give Light unto thee; but the
Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting Light,
and thy God the Glory.</hi> And as the Effect
of all this, IX. 2. <hi>The people, which sate
in darkness, saw great Light; and to them
which sate in the region and shadow of death,
Light is sprung up:</hi> Which Prophecy St.
<hi>Matthew</hi> observeth to have been exactly
fulfilled by our Saviour, in the IV. 16. of
his Gospel.</p>
            <p>After so many Magnificent Prophesies
concerning the extraordinary Light to be
brought into the World by the Messias;
we cannot but raise our Apprehensions,
and expect somewhat more than humane
Knowledge to be communicated by him


<pb n="248" facs="tcp:34506:128"/>
to the World, somewhat more than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<hi>Light</hi> to be dispensed by him. Nor

the <hi>Light</hi> communicated by our Lord to

both which Accounts he was <hi>the Light of
the World.</hi>

               </list>

            <p>I. Then, the Doctrine of Christ gave
Light unto the World, by removing the
Errors of it, and teaching it the Rules
of Truth, which might point out the
way to Happiness.</p>
            <p>To conceive the better the happy
Effects of the Doctrines of Christ, let us
take a view of the state of the World at
that time; and we shall find; as in the
beginning, Darkness to have over-spread
the face of the Earth. A very small
part of Mankind enjoyed the benefit of
Revelation; and even they had corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:34506:128"/>
and almost effaced the Divine Truths
revealed to them, by false Glosses and
gross Interpretations; they had forsaken
<hi>the weightier Matters of the Law;</hi> and
even those who were most Conscientious
among them, busied themselves wholly
in observing such trivial Ceremonies, as
themselves had for the most part formed
by mistaken Interpretations. But the
infinitely greater part of Mankind lived
as <hi>without God in the Word.</hi> They had
intirely lost those revealed Notions,
which were delivered to their Fore-fathers,
immediately after the Deluge;
and the natural Notions of Religion they
had so far corrupted; that their Worship
was downright Impiety, and all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Actions, so many gross Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
In the far greater part of the
World, all Notions of Morality and a
Natural Law were intirely lost; and it
was a brutish Fear only, which kept up
any sort of Religion among them: Which
after all was such a Religion, as was their
greatest Crime; being no other than a
most stupid Idolatry.</p>
            <p>In the more polite part of the World,
which retained Civility and pretended to
Letters; the natural Law indeed was
kept up among the more Learned of


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:34506:129"/>
them; but even by them so mistaken and
corrupted, that they allowed as lawful
the Practice of some enormous Vices;
which to convince of unlawfulness need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no more than to consult the common
Reason of Mankind; as Fornication, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy,
practising the idolatrous Worship
of the Country, although at the same
time convinced of the Folly of it; Self-murder,
and many other Vices, which
the most refined of their Philosophers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
to be lawful.</p>
            <p>As for the common People, their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of God were such as the publick
Religion of the Country infused into
them; the most vile and unworthy of a
Deity which can be imagined, such as
patronized all the Crimes they could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
provided they violated not the Laws
of their Country. For by these Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
no Notion of Morality was left
among them, nor any other distinction
of Good and Evil, than what the Laws
of their Country imprinted in them.
They could not but imagine that such
Actions were good in their own Nature,
which their chief Gods had practised;
altho' their inconvenience to the publick
had caused them to be forbidden. In a
word conceive a People ignorant both


<pb n="251" facs="tcp:34506:129"/>
of God and their own Nature; desirous
of Happiness, but knowing not where
to find it, and pursuing methods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to it; groping in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
without the least ray of <hi>Light;</hi> and
such was the state of the World at that
time.</p>
            <p>To rescue the World from this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Darkness, to restore <hi>Light</hi> to the
minds of Men, was a noble undertaking,
and worthy the Son of God: an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
which as it could be performed by
none but the Son of God; so was it most
happily effected by him. He saith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that <hi>he came a Light into the World;
that whosoever believeth on him should not
abide in darkness,</hi> John XII. 46. His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was <hi>to deliver us from the power of
darkness;</hi> as the Apostle assures us, Coloss.
I. 13. A Design first begun by himself
in Person, and afterwards carried on by
the Apostles and their Successors to this
day, by his Command and through his
Power: whom he sent (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
his Commission, Acts XXVI. 18.
<hi>To open the eyes</hi> (of the Gentiles or the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant)
<hi>and to turn them from darkness
to light, and from the power of Satan unto
God.</hi> Himself, while conversant on Earth,
busied himself in nothing more than in


<pb n="252" facs="tcp:34506:130"/>
detecting the false Explications of the
Moral part of the Jewish Law, which
was of equal Obligation to all Mankind;
in discovering the Corruptions of it, and
restoring it to its Primitive Integrity.</p>
            <p>And not content only to discover the
Errors of the World (as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
objected to the Heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
that they could easily overthrow
the Opinions of one another, but could
establish no Truth in the room of them)
he plainly revealed their whole Duty to
them; taught them even the Principles
of the Moral Law, that so Men might
no more be subject to mistake in it. To
this he added the Revelation of the
whole Will of God, which concerns ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Rewards or Punishments an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to this Law, which might rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the Practice of it; or the future Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
of Man to be obtained by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of it; or the means of Pardon
in Case of the Violation of it.</p>
            <p>Nor was this <hi>Light</hi> to be confined to
a Corner, to be appropriated to a few;
it was to be made truly <hi>the Light of the
World,</hi> to be communicated to all, to be
continued to the end of the World. The
easiness and simplicity of it adapted to
the Capacity and Practice of all Men, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:34506:130"/>
it for such an universal Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And that it should be actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
he abundantly provided by
proclaiming it himself to all while on
Earth; by establishing a numerous Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Disciples, who should propagate
it successively to the end of the World;
by inspiring Holy Writers to commit it
plainly and intirely to writing; by
founding a Church, the Members of
which should by certain solemn Rites or
Sacraments oblige themselves to the
Practice of it; by contriving the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and Government of this Church in
such a manner as might best tend to the
perpetual Continuation and Propagation
of this <hi>Light</hi> once delivered. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by these means in a few Centuries
almost all the known World was <hi>deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Power of darkness,</hi> freed from
its ancient Errors, and received the
Truth: when a considerable part of the
World still continues to enjoy the same
Benefits, Freedom from the darkness of
Ignorance in Divine Matters, and an
exact Knowledge both of the Nature of
God, as far as relates to us, our Duty to
him, and way to Happiness; may we
not justly conclude all the Glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
concerning the happy times of


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:34506:131"/>
the Messias, and the <hi>Light</hi> to be conferred
on the World by him, to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
completed in our Lord; and that
in removing the Ignorance of Mankind,
and restoring and increasing the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of truth among Men, he was in
an eminent manner <hi>the Light of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so pure and unspotted, as well as
clear and bright, is this light communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by Christ unto the World; so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
conformable to all the first Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Truth and Reason imprinted in
the Souls of Men, or to be deduced
thence; that a more clear Argument of
the Truth of the Christian Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be conceived or desired. A Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which may be worth our Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
a while, as being no small Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the Excellency of that <hi>Light,</hi>
of which we now treat.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to conceive, that a
Person devoid of all acquired Learning,
as our Lord confessedly was, should in an
Age over-run with universal Errors teach
and deliver an entire System of Doctrine
and Rule of Life, without the least Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
if he had not been directed by a
Divine Power, and really acted by that
Divine Commission which he pretended.
It might perhaps have been accounted


<pb n="255" facs="tcp:34506:131"/>
possible, if he had been brought up at
the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> instructed in all the
Learning of the Age; altho' even in
that Case, it would have been very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
possible, when the learned Men among
the Jews are all known at that time to
have been involved in so many Errors;
and how grosly the learned Men among
the Gentiles erred in the Rules of natural
Religion we before instanced; and that
any one Man should after the Reception
of his Education, from these very Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Doctors, happily discover all the
Errors both of Jews and Gentiles, and
find out the exact Truth in all Questions
of Morality and Religion, without the
least mixture of Error or Mistake, seems a
Matter wholly incredible. But that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
devoid of all Learning and external
Helps should effect it, is wholly impossible.</p>
            <p>Now it is most certain, that in the whole
System of Christian Religion, and among
all the Rules of Life, as delivered by
Christ and contained in his Gospel, not
the least Flaw or Error could ever be
found by all the Adversaries of it. Or
if we trust not them, let every Mans
Reason be his Judge. Let him view all
the Commands of Christ, and see if he
can find any thing contrary to Reason,


<pb n="256" facs="tcp:34506:132"/>
any thing unworthy either of God or Man.
An invincible Argument, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it proceeded by a Divine Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and derived his Knowledge from a
supernatural Revelation.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiss in a few words to
carry this Argument a little higher,
and apply it to the Religion of the Jews,
before the coming of our Lord. Where
if we think rationally, we shall find it
absolutely impossible, that a People so
barbarous as they were in the beginning,
so devoid of all Assistances of Arts and
Sciences in the whole Succession of their
Government, should form such just and
noble Notions of a Deity, contrive a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
without any mixture of Sin or
Idolatry; unless they had been directed
by God himself. View all the Nations
round about, and you shall find them
drowned in gross Ignorance and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
And then enquire if any other Cause
of this so great difference can be assigned.
Compare their Hymns formed in Honour
of God, and Books treating concerning
the Nature of him, now comprised in
the Old Testament, with the Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
formed by the Grecians or any other
Learned Heathen Nation in Honour of
their Gods, and with their Theological


<pb n="257" facs="tcp:34506:132"/>
Writings; you will find the first to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
just and noble Thoughts of God;
true Judgments concerning the Relation
between God and Man; nothing which
is not agreeable to the Honour and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of God; nothing, which is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
true. Whereas in the other, you
shall discover every where either childish
or impious Notions of God, nothing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to his Majesty, and little
agreeable to Truth. A difference which
can never be accounted for, but by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
the former to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from a Divine Direction and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration.</p>
            <p>So clear and undeniable is the force of
<hi>Light,</hi> that it discovers it self where-ever
it Acts; it cannot be hid, dissembled or
stifled; and according to our Saviour's
own Comparison, <hi>like a City placed upon
a Hill,</hi> appeareth at a distance, giving
direction to all far and near. And thus
our Saviour was also <hi>the Light of the
World,</hi> upon the account of the Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plariness
of his Life. In which Respect
he tells his Disciples that <hi>they are the Light
of the World,</hi> Matth. V. 14. giving Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to Mankind in the practice of
their Duty, by that eminent Vertue
which shone forth in them, and could not
but be observed by all Men. And of


<pb n="258" facs="tcp:34506:133"/>
himself, John IX. 5. <hi>As long as I am in
the World, I am the Light of the World.</hi>
Not that he was wholly to cease to be
<hi>the Light of the World,</hi> even after he
should be removed from it: For both his
Doctrine, and the Report of his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were to enlighten the World to all
Ages; but in the latter Respect, that of
his Example; the Efficacy of it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
upon his removal from the Earth,
inasmuch as the Sight moveth more than
the Fame of an illustrious Example.</p>
            <p>An Example indeed so eminent, that
whether seen or heard it was <hi>a Light</hi> to
all Mankind; so resplendent and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that as <hi>the Light,</hi> it struck the Eyes
of all Men, and could not but be taken
Notice of; so just and adequate, that it
included the whole Duty of Man in its
utmost Perfection; and as <hi>the Light,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
Men in the right way. His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was the most exact System of all
Moral and Divine Vertues, that ever was
proposed to the World. And in all this
System there is no one Vertue, which
himself possessed and exercised not in the
most perfect manner. All that Piety,
Temperance, Meekness and Charity,
which he prescribed to his Followers,
himself practised in the whole Course of
his Life. And that in a Degree which


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:34506:133"/>
other Men cannot hope to attain to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any interruption of Vice or Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Such an Example might well
be termed <hi>the Light of the World;</hi> in which
alone, if all Rules of Piety, if all No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of good were lost among Men,
they might be entirely recovered: And
not only illustrious in it self, but also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously
made so to all Mankind by a
studious Communication of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it. For this Purpose it was at
first acted in the Cities, in the solemn
Feasts, and in the publick Places of <hi>Judea;</hi>
not in a Desert or in a Cell, not spent in
a solitary Retirement or known to few.
And after that, the History of it was by
the wise Direction of the Holy Spirit
committed to Writing; whereby the
knowledge of it might be conveyed to
all Ages and Nations; and that <hi>Light</hi>
which first arose and shone in a small
Corner of the World, might be diffused
through the Universe, and become a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and eternal Standard of Duty to
all Mankind.</p>
            <p>The Second thing proposed to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to were the Benefits, which this
<hi>Light</hi> should conferr upon the World,
by the Communication of it: Which our
Lord expresseth in the latter part of the
Verse, <hi>He that followeth me<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> walketh not


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:34506:134"/>
in darkness, but shall have the Light of Life.</hi>
And this is but a natural Consequence;
for if <hi>the Light,</hi> which Christ communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the World by his Doctrine and
Example, were so illustrious, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
described; it was impossible that any
Man, who obtained the Knowledge of
the one, or imitated the other, should
still continue in <hi>Darkness,</hi> in the same Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and Error, in which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
involved. He had thereby his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
removed, the measure of his Duty
ascertained to him, and the Knowledge
of saving Truth conveyed to him; which
was the thing our Lord chiefly intended
in these Words; where he speaks of the
Perfection of all necessary Knowledge of
Divine Matters, which he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to those who should put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under his Discipline.</p>
            <p>But then, there is another easie and
practical Sense of the words which may
be of more use to us. <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
in Scripture do most frequently sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
those two contrary States of Life,
which ought to be led by the Professors
of the Gospel, which enjoyed the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of this revealed <hi>Light;</hi> and which
was wont to be led by those who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lived or still continued in the <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of Gentilism. Hence in the New


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:34506:134"/>
Testament, the Disciples of the Christian
Religion are often called <hi>the Children of
light;</hi> and that State of Sin and Error,
from which they were converted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by <hi>Darkness,</hi> as Ephes. V. 8. <hi>Ye
were sometimes darkness, but now are ye
light; walk as the Children of light;</hi> and in
many other places. And all Sin is called
<hi>the work of Darkness,</hi> as Rom. XIII. 12.
<hi>Let us cast off the works of Darkness;</hi> and
Ephes. V. 11. <hi>Have no fellowship with the
unfruitful works of Darkness.</hi> Our Lord
therefore in this place teacheth us; that
his <hi>true</hi> Disciples, they who followed the
Conduct of his <hi>Light,</hi> walked in the right
way, <hi>cast off the works of Darkness,</hi> and
were directed into, and followed <hi>the path,
which leadeth unto Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Sins to which they were before
subject, were the effect of their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
occasioned by the <hi>Darkness</hi> of
their Mind. They knew them not to be
Sins. Their Judgment, which is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<hi>Light</hi> of Man, could not direct the
Will aright, or betrayed it to a wrong
Choice; even when it was disposed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and as Reason Wills, resolved to
follow the Direction of the Judgme<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>t.
A miserable State indeed, when Men
were willing to perform their Duty, and
knew it not. The unhappiness of which


<pb n="262" facs="tcp:34506:135"/>
our Lord fitly describeth, Matth. VI. 23.
<hi>If therefore the light that is in thee be
darkness;</hi> (if thy Judgment be corrupted
with Error or Ignorance of thy Duty;)
<hi>how great is that darkness?</hi> From this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness
our Saviour fully freed his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
by teaching them all necessary
Truth, by informing their Judgment, by
setting their Duty in a full <hi>Light;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
if they would use any ordinary Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
they could not mistake in the
Knowledge and Practice of it.</p>
            <p>Further, these <hi>works of Darknses,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
among the Gentiles, much less among
Christians, proceeded not always from
the defect of Judgment, from the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Duty; but more ordinarily from
the Corruption of the Will were acted
against the Dictates of Conscience, and
known to be Sins while acted: Yet fitly
called <hi>the works of Darkness,</hi> because (as
our Lord told <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> John III. 20.)
<hi>Every one that doth evil hateth the Light,
neither cometh to the Light, least his deeds
should be reproved.</hi> There is a natural
Detestation of Sin, when known to be
such, in all Men; which maketh the
most profligate, Men desire their Sins may
be concealed from the knowledge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
not considering perhaps (as they
seldom give themselves time to consider)


<pb n="263" facs="tcp:34506:135"/>
that they cannot escape the knowledge
of God. This Corruption of the Will,
which occasions such <hi>works of Darkness,</hi>
Christ hath also provided for and remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by proposing such Arguments of
Reward and Punishment, as if seriously
reflected on, cannot fail to perswade; by
rectifying the Judgment, and thereby
influencing the Will. For besides the
external Arguments of our Obligation to
God, and our own Interest concerned in
it; every part of our Duty, when right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood, carrieth internal and
powerful Arguments of Perswasion with
it.</p>
            <p>Further, this Sentence of Christ may
be of use to us, to the discovering the
true Followers of Christ, and to the
making a right Estimate of our own as
well as others Relation to Christ. For as
<hi>he that followeth this Light, cannot walk
in Darkness,</hi> so it is impossible that he
who walketh in <hi>Darkness</hi> should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
this <hi>Light.</hi> It was formerly the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi>
of the Jews; <hi>that Light came
into the World, and Men loved darkness ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than light, because their deeds were
evil.</hi> They retained their Infidelity, and
rejected the Doctrine of Christ, because
contrary to their beloved Lusts and Vices.
And it is now the Condemnation of as


<pb n="264" facs="tcp:34506:136"/>
many Christians, that professing <hi>to follow
the Light,</hi> they still <hi>walk in Darkness;</hi>
that in the midst of all that Knowledge,
which by Christianity is conferred to
them, they practise the same Vices, which
the Gentiles and Infidels were guilty of,
betrayed to them by their Ignorance and
Blindness: who nevertheless call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Sons of <hi>Light,</hi> pretend to be
the Disciples of the Author of it, and to
have a near Relation to him. Of such
St. <hi>John</hi> hath pronounced, 1 <hi>John</hi> I. 6.
<hi>If we say that we have fellowship with him,
and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the
truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed if the <hi>Light</hi> of Heaven
was not intended only to gaze upon, and
please the Eyes of Men; if much less the
<hi>Light</hi> of the Soul, the Doctrine and
Truth revealed by Christ, was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
merely to promote the Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and gratifie the Fancies of Men; if
a rational and vertuous Conduct of Life
be the natural Effect of a sound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and accurate Knowledge of Duty,
and the Arguments enforcing it; it is
but a natural Consequence that this <hi>Light,</hi>
wheresoever it is found, should exert and
discover it self in Actions conformable to
it. But it is absurd to pretend that <hi>Light</hi>
hath there any influence, where <hi>the


<pb n="265" facs="tcp:34506:136"/>
works of Darkness</hi> are performed; or that
two such Contraries can consist together.
Let us rather give thanks to God, who
hath sent this Glorious <hi>Light</hi> into the
World; and then <hi>hath called us out of
darkness into this marvellous light;</hi> hath
rescued us from the former Darkness and
Ignorance, and clearly revealed to us all
necessary Truths. Let us secure to our
selves, and improve the Benefits of this
<hi>Light,</hi> by <hi>invariably</hi> following the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
of it; so shall it become to us
(what our Lord promiseth in the Text)
<hi>the Light of Life.</hi>

hath endeavoured to convince us, by those

Persecutions, Hatred and Tribulation,

Argument than in these words, which
reach all sorts of Men, both those who
earnestly desire and pursue Salvation;
and those who either not desire it, or
with the desire of it retain those Sins,
which are manifestly Destructive of it.</p>
            <p>To increase the Diligence of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
they are told, that <hi>the Righteous,</hi>

their vicious Course of Life, if they will
with any appearance of Success continue
their Desire of Happiness, they are assured
that even the <hi>Righteous</hi> are but hardly
saved; and then certainly no Hopes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
can be left for them. To enforce
this Argument upon each sort of Men, is
the Design of the words in the Text; and

1. Of the Difficulties peculiar to the
Christians of those times. The Principal
intended by the Apostle in this place, was
the Persecution to be brought upon them,
by the Jews and other Enemies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
He had prepared them for the
patient enduring of this Persecution, both
in this and in the precedent Chapter, by
the Prediction of it, by the Example of
Christ, by the Promise of Reward, by
the certainty of Revenge to be executed
by God upon their Persecutors: calls it <hi>a
fiery Tryal</hi> in the 12th. Verse; tells them in
the 16th. Verse, that it should be raised
against them for this very Reason, that
they were <hi>Christians;</hi> subjoyns in the 17th.
Verse, <hi>for the time is come, that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must begin at the house of God.</hi> The
time now drew near, that the Predictions
of Christ concerning the Destruction of
the Jews were to be accomplished. But
our Lord had also foretold in the XIII.
Chap. of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the XXI. of
St. <hi>Luke,</hi> that this Destruction of the
Jews should be preceded by a fierce Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Christians, <hi>who should be
hated by all Men for his names sake;</hi> should
be <hi>betrayed</hi> by their nearest Relations
through a blind Zeal; driven from <hi>one
City to another, delivered up</hi> to be afflicted
and killed: an Affliction so great, <hi>as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:34506:138"/>
was since the beginning of the World, no
nor ever shall be;</hi> as himself saith, Matth.
XXIV. 21. Insomuch <hi>as many should be
offended,</hi> and Apostatize from the Faith;
and if God did not in Mercy shorten those
days, an universal Defection might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ensue. This was that Judgment then,
which St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith should <hi>begin at the
house of God;</hi> should cause that <hi>the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
should scarcely be saved;</hi> should shock
their Faith, and almost extinguish their
Hope; or if both Faith and Hope conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
should tempt them to prefer the
ease and quiet of the World to them
both.</p>
            <p>Men are apt to distrust the Providence,
and sometimes even to disbelieve the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, when they see wickedness
Triumphant in the World, Injustice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished,
and Innocence oppressed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any extraordinary Interposition or
apparent regard of God. This Argument
hath made all the Atheists of former and
latter Ages; and when it was so signally
visible, as in those dreadful Times, we
cannot wonder, that it should stagger the
Faith of many. In taking that Profession
on them, they believed themselves to be,
and were indeed the Elect of God; cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
out of the rest of Mankind to receive
the peculiar Favours of God. When


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:34506:139"/>
upon their first Entrance instead of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Advantages, they were encountred
with all the Miseries and Afflictions,
which a subtle and powerful Enemy could
bring upon them: Such Discouragements
could not but deterr from the Prosecution
of their Duty many of these new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
who by their Education and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived
Opinions were ill prepared to
withstand such fierce Assaults.</p>
            <p>The Jews having been brought up in
Expectation of temporal Rewards and a
powerful Messias, who far from the subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to their Enemies, should put the
whole world under their Command: And
the Gentiles having been wont freely to
indulge themselves in all the Satisfactions
of Sense and Pleasure: To bring off the
one from these Prejudices, and the other
from this Ease and Luxury, to follow a
Crucified Saviour, not only in the belief of
his Doctrines, but also in the imitation of
his Sufferings; to exchange the Pleasures
of the World, and the Hopes of earthly
Happiness, for all those Calamities, which
our Lord foretold, and daily experience
did then confirm, to be a necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of belief in him; must certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have been such a Difficulty, as could
be surmounted but by few.</p>
            <p>If we should even remove those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34506:139"/>
of Education and Custom,
and suppose a serious belief of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and the Promises of Christ, an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desire of Salvation, and an hearty
Endeavour to attain it; yet are we not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
against the force of such violent
Temptations, as are the Effects of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.
It is not every Man, not an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Soul, that can surmount the Fears
of Death, and without Astonishment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wait
the Execution; when the renouncing
of a mere Opinion, of an invisible Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
can prevent it. It is a Resolution of
a far higher Nature, than what the World
generally accounteth Courage; which is
commonly no more than the effect of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and is still maintained by the Hopes
of Success, and the Prospect of some visible
Interest. When therefore, the Professors
of Christianity retained their Faith with
the universal Hatred of all Men, with the
probable Loss of their Fortunes, and even
of their Lives, as it was highly generous,
so it was extremely difficult to retain a
good Conscience, and therewith the Hopes
of Salvation.</p>
            <p>This was a Difficulty indeed so great,
that your own Imagination will amplifie
it more than any words I can use for that
Purpose. If it seem strange to us, that
God should suffer his chosen Servants to


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34506:140"/>
be thus afflicted and exposed to the Insults
of wicked Men; we must reflect upon
the Condition of those Christians, before
they entred upon the Profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity:
That the far greater part of
them had spent their Lives in the open
Exercise of all those Sins, to which the
Temptations of the World, the Flesh or
the Devil could incite them; and that
without any remorse of Conscience, or
intervals of Piety. This the Apostle
chargeth them with, in the 3d. Verse of
this Chapter. It was incongruous to the
Divine Justice, to suffer such enormous
Sinners wholly to escape unpunished; and
therefore his infinite Wisdom so ordered
the state of the World, and of the Church
at that time, that they should undergo
sharp Afflictions and Persecutions in this
Life; that so without any Diminution of
his Justice he might receive them to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in another World. Not that the most
Glorious Martyrs have been the greatest
Sinners, or that temporal Calamities do
always attend the Sins of the Faithful.
But as in a general Persecution brought
upon the Church for the precedent Sins
of the greater part of it, it would have
been unreasonable for any particular Men,
altho' not Partakers of the Sin, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
to have been excused from parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king


<pb n="273" facs="tcp:34506:140"/>
in the general Calamity: So neither
may we flatter our selves, that we are
more righteous than those first Christians
were before their Conversion, for this
Reason only, because we are not punished
in the same visible manner; but ought
rather to fear, that a far greater Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is reserved to us hereafter; if by a
timely and hearty Repentance we prevent
not the Execution of it.</p>
            <p>This precedent sinful Course of Life
was another great Difficulty to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of those days, who had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before their Conversion long and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
habits of Vice; effaced by disuse all
Notions of natural Religion and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty;
which to restore could be the work
of nothing less than an extraordinary
Diligence and Application. If to these
peculiar Difficulties of those Times, we
add the common Difficulties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
we shall soon perceive what
just Reason the Apostle had to say, That
<hi>the Righteous are scarcely saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not here insist upon the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of particular Duties, the depraved
Nature of Man, and the Solicitations
of evil Spirits, with many other disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of Piety, which we experience
and lament. That which chiefly deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to be considered, is the spiritual


<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34506:141"/>
Nature, and Futurity of the Reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by it. Man, in almost all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Life, is inured to follow the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of Sense, which are easily form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and affect the Mind without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Preparation of it. He is assured
of the Existence and certainty of those
Objects, which Sense presenteth to him,
without entring into a serious Inquiry,
or forming any Conclusions by the
strength of his own Understanding.
Whereas the Rewards proposed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
being purely spiritual, and Men
not put into the present Possession of
them, they cannot obtain nor yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them without a regular proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Judgment. They must first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Nature of God, his Dignity,
Power, and other Attributes; their own
dependence on him; the Manifestation
of his Will, and the Contrariety of their
own Actions to it; the necessity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
the certain Immortality of
their Soul, and the possible Immortality
of their Body; the assurance of both,
from him who can perform it and <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lie;</hi> and the end for which such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
shall be conferred; to receive
then the Reward or Punishment of the
good or bad Conduct of this Life. All
this must be first considered and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,


<pb n="275" facs="tcp:34506:141"/>
before any Conviction can be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the truth of Christianity.</p>
            <p>And when the Mind is thus convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
there wants a second Series of
Thoughts to convince Mankind, that
to embrace this Truth is their real Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
The Rewards proposed by it are
chiefly spiritual, they affect not the Senses,
nor strike the Imagination, by which
Man is wont to measure the fruition of
all Pleasures. He relisheth but little the
Pleasures and satisfaction of the Mind,
he scarce knoweth wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist:
And that which draweth nearest
to it in this Life, the Conception and
Meditation of intellectual Objects, he
finds himself soon weary of it, or perhaps
is wholly unacquainted with it. And
when all these disadvantages are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
here is still required another train of
Thoughts, to fix the Mind in a constant
Expectation of the Reward, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the bestowing of it is deferred
till another Life.</p>
            <p>If then so much Consideration be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to render the Arguments of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
effectual; if the Nature of the
Reward be so hardly conceived, so far
removed from present Fruition, and so
little grateful to those Organs of Sense, by
which Men are wont to judge of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:34506:142"/>
of Fruitions; it may easily be
foreseen, that the Promises of the Gospel
will lose their Efficacy upon the greater
part of Men.</p>
            <p>For how small a part of Mankind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their Souls to entertain any Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
beyond what Sense administreth to
them? How few ever entertain a
Thought of immaterial Beings or spiritual
Interests? Not that any extraordinary
strength of Mind is required to form
such Thoughts and Convictions. The
Providence of God hath so ordered it,
that these things are brought home to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Man's understanding, and frequently
urg'd upon them. It is only required of
them, that they would retain such
Thoughts, improve them, and Act upon
them. But even this is irksome to his
depraved Nature, he seeth and feels his
Body, his Soul he little knows; the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Body are always present to
him, the noblest Pleasures of the Soul
are removed at a mighty distance. He
is convinced of the one by his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
for the other he must rely upon
the assurance of Reason. And this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
betrays him either to neglect
the Consideration of the Interests of the
Soul, or to prefer the Concerns of the
Body before them, unless by frequent


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:34506:142"/>
Meditation, and diligent Attention, he
hath formed a full Conviction both of the
Truth and the value of them; that as they
will certainly follow the performance of
the Conditions prescribed by the Gospel,
so even the Reversion of them is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more to be esteemed than the present
Possession of all corporeal Pleasures.</p>
            <p>Another Difficulty alike common to
all, is the Extensiveness of the Duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired:
That it includeth every Action
of Man; and that the defect of any one
part destroyeth the benefit of the whole;
that it is not sufficient to exercise this or
that Vertue in the highest degree, unless
the whole Life be uniform, and deficient
in none of the parts of it. Which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
a Christian upon his constant Guard,
least he should at any time be surprized.
And surely a Surprize is hard to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
where so many passages must be
guarded; when the Enemy may enter in
by the Senses or Imagination, by the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of external Objects or the sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of internal Thoughts; and all these
as numerous and various, as are the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from whence they proceed, or about
which they are imployed. Scarce in the
best of Men may we not discover some
Passion predominant to the rest; and
which might he be allowed to indulge,


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:34506:143"/>
he would confidently undertake for the
good Behaviour of all the rest. But this
Liberty Christianity denieth to him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth
him an universal Conquest of all
his Passions, a general performance of the
whole Will of God; forbids the Omission
of any one Duty, upon Pain of incurring
the Guilt of all. And this is truly so
great a Difficulty, that we need not seek
any farther Reasons, why the best Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of all Ages are but hardly saved.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the Difficulties peculiar to
the latter Ages of Christianity, and
which more nearly concern us. I will
mention but two: 1. The want of an
universal Example; and 2. The want of
Miracles. By these the ancient Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
converted the Heathen World; and
through want of these we are almost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to Heathenism.</p>
            <p>It could not but be a powerful Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Vertue to all ingenuous Men,
when they could not so much as retain
the Character they had undertaken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a diligent Exercise of Piety; when
to be a vicious Christian was to be a
Monster in the account of the World;
when Vice was a Singularity and Dissent
from all others of the same Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Whereas in latter Ages the whole
hath been inverted, the Character uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally


<pb n="279" facs="tcp:34506:143"/>
retained without any regard to
the Conditions of it. A pious Christian
must dissent in the Course of his Life
from the greater part of the Christian
World, and Vertue is become a Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity:
inasmuch as, what cannot be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficienty
lamented, many ingenuous Minds
have been betrayed to sin, to which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they were not inclined, least
they should appear uncivil and morose.
And when unlawful Customs can acquire
the Esteem of Civilities among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
we cannot but confess an extreme De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy
of the true Spirit of Christianity.</p>
            <p>It may truly be said of Examples in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
that they have more influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the greater part of Mankind, than
Reasons or Arguments. Men of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Capacities (such as make up the Body
of Christendom) take their measures of
Christianity, from the Practice of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of it; as Men do of the Laws of any
Countrey, from the Practice of the Courts
of Justice; and will hardly be perswaded
that Christianity is so severe and serious
a Matter, when they perceive the far
greater part of Christians trifle with it.
It is natural for Men to hope for impunity
in a multitude; to fall into impiety, when
no shame restrains them, when a prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Example leads them. As for Men of


<pb n="280" facs="tcp:34506:144"/>
more raised Understandings, it is impossible
they should thus deceive themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Obligation of their Religion;
yet even those escape not this universal
Contagion; they fear to be accounted
singular, are forced to dissemble and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
at last to stifle their Knowledge;
as not being able to withstand the force
of such a mighty Torrent.</p>
            <p>This Difficulty receives yet farther
Aggravation, if we reflect, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from our own Guilt; that our selves
are the Authors of it. The Difficulties
of the Apostolick Age were purely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous,
for which those Christians were
not accountable. They brought not their
Persecutions upon themselves, and their
Sins committed before Conversion could
not afterwards be justly imputed to them
as Christians. Whereas this disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
we now complain of, is the Effect
of our Sins committed in the Profession
of Christianity, to which every one of
us have contributed somewhat; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the internal Guilt of the Crime
committed, have upon that account in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
our sin. The Sense of which
ought to be a Motive to us to endeavour,
by the Exemplariness of our future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
I will not say, to remove this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
and retrieve the glorious Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple


<pb n="281" facs="tcp:34506:144"/>
of former times, (for that can scarce
be hoped) but to compensate the Injury
which we have done to the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
by our sinful Deportment.</p>
            <p>The other disadvantage of the present
Age, which I mentioned, the want of
Miracles, cannot indeed be ascribed to
any Fault of ours, nor yet be retrieved
by us. Yet a sensible disadvantage it
must be acknowledged; when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
our selves with former times, whose
Faith and Zeal were constantly awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
kept up, and enlivened by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
sight of Miracles; which confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them the Truth of what they had
received, the certainty of what they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and the Power and the Favour of that
God they worshipped. But I wave the
farther Consideration of this Difficulty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the removal of it is not in our Power.
Yet this use we may make of it, to take
occasion from it to reflect upon the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Goodness and most Wise Providence
of God, which hath so contrived the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and disadvantages of former
and latter Ages, that both of them have
very near equal Assistances and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the Prosecution of their Duty:
that so he might without derogation to
his Justice, perform what our Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
in the Parable of the Housholder


<pb n="282" facs="tcp:34506:145"/>
in the XX. of St. <hi>Matthew, reward those
whom he had called in the eleventh hour,
equally with those</hi> whom he had hired in
the Morning, <hi>who had born the heat and
burden of the day;</hi> which the Fathers ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
expound of this very Case.</p>
            <p>For now those whom he called first,
who underwent such grievous Afflictions
and fierce Persecutions for the defence of
the Faith, cannot justly complain, that
we are equally rewarded with them,
who endured none of those Calamities.</p>
            <p>The Church indeed in latter Ages
hath enjoyed Peace and Quiet, hath not
maintained the Faith of Christ with the
expence of her Blood; so neither doth
she enjoy those Miracles, with the sight
of which they were Blessed. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the eminent Example, the
Miracles and the Sufferings of our Lord,
were yet fresh in the minds of Men:
the extraordinary Gifts of the Holy
Ghost were every where Conspicuous; the
Apostles yet alive, who spoke and writ
by the immediate impulse of God; and
even after their death, the same Gifts and
Miracles were continued, till Peace was
given to the Church. All these advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
we want, which they enjoyed;
Peace and Security we have, which was
denied to them. If we proceed in the


<pb n="283" facs="tcp:34506:145"/>
Comparison; we want also that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Example of universal Piety, which
shone forth in their Days. But then on
the other side we enter not upon the
Profession of Christianity with the same
Prejudices and Habits of Vice, with
which they did. They felt not the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
of an ill Example prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Christians: So neither did they
enjoy the benefit of a Christian Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thus God hath most wisely in all
Ages made the Aids and Difficulties of
Christianity to be equal. I wish I could
add, that the Effects were also equal.</p>
            <p>And as we admire the Wisdom of
God herein; so must we acknowledge
his Justice also. It may perhaps seem
too severe, that Salvation, the supreme
Happiness of Man should be rendred
thus difficult to him; that God should
invite us to it, and then by so many Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
exclude us from it. To this it
is easie to reply, that Salvation is purely
the Gift of God, which, as such, he might
bestow upon whatsoever Conditions
himself pleased. Nor in requiring so
many, such laborious and difficult Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of us, hath he raised the Price (I
mean the Conditions) above the worth
of it. It is the supreme end of Man, the
utmost Improvement of his Felicity.


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:34506:146"/>
Now look into the Writings of all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers;
consult the common Voice of
Mankind; they do all confess, that the
supreme end of Man not only ought to
be his chief Design, but also can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
at no less Expence, than his utmost
Diligence, the constant and most exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Operations of all the Faculties of his
Mind; that it must be the business of
his whole Life. Look into your own
Actions and daily Experience, and see
whether any thing desirable in this Life,
even as your selves value it, be not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with a proportionable Difficulty.
And then Confess, that God hath done
no more than what the Nature of things
required, when he annexed so many Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
to the Acquisition of Salvation.</p>
            <p>The second Part of my proposed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
I mean the Consequence raised in
the Text, <hi>If the righteous scarcely be saved;
where shall the ungodly and the sinner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear?</hi>
is so evident, that I need say little
to it. For if after the Conquest of so many
Difficulties, so many Afflictions endured,
and Labours employed, a righteous Man
doth but very hardly obtain Salvation;
surely no hopes can be left for him, who
affrighted by these Difficulties, gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Conduct of his own unruly
Lusts, to the practice of Vices directly


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:34506:146"/>
contrary to the means proposed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this ultimate Happiness.</p>
            <p>This Reason assureth, and the common
Notions of the Divine Justice confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to us, not only that the ungodly and
the Sinner shall miss of that excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
which shall be rendred to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and Diligence of the Righteous;
but also shall draw upon himself the
Wrath of God, and the consequence of
it extreme Misery, in Punishment of
his Sin. Which is more clearly expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> XI. 31. from whence
these words of St. <hi>Peter</hi> are word for
word taken, according to the Septuagint
Translation: But in the Original, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our Translation they run thus.
<hi>Behold the righteous shall be recompenced in
the earth; much more the wicked and the
sinner.</hi> That is, since God suffers not
the failings of the <hi>Righteous</hi> to pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished,
but corrects and chastiseth
them in this World, with sensible Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
much more hath he reserved the
extremity of Torment for the wicked
and the sinner. As in this place of St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> God thought fit to chastise the
former Sins of the convert Christians,
with a fierce and terrible Persecution:
from whence the Apostle draweth a like
Consequence in the 17th. Verse. <hi>And if


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:34506:147"/>
judgment first begin at the house of God;
what shall the end be of them that obey
not the Gospel of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Doctrine so the Examples
also of the Old and New Testament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
herein. Wherein we find, that God
inflicted temporal Calamities upon his
most beloved Servants, in Punishment of
their Sins, even of inadvertency; that
he might teach us, not to expect any
Pardon for a wilful obstinacy and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
in Impiety. Thus <hi>Moses,</hi> who
had this Testimony from God himself
that <hi>he was faithful in all his house,</hi> yet
for some slight appearance only of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
of the Divine Power, in bringing
forth waters out of the Rock, was exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Enjoyment of the Promised Land;
altho' an ancient Writer aggravates the
sin of <hi>Moses</hi> from hence, that in all that
frequent and familiar Converse, which
he afterwards had with God, he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
found to have begged Pardon for his
Sin. But however that be, we must all
Confess, that the best of us have far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<hi>Moses</hi> both in the number and the
weight of our sins, and ought therefore
much more to fear the Execution of
the Divine Justice.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, we read that God propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to <hi>David, the Man after his own heart,</hi>


               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:34506:147"/>
the choice of three Signal Calamities,
only in Punishment of a light Vain-Glory,
manifested in his Design of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
his Subjects. For the same failure,
he threatned good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> with
the deprivation and carrying away of his
Treasures; and sent the great Apostle St.
<hi>Paul a thorn in the flesh,</hi> (some bodily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity)
<hi>the Messenger of Satan to buffet
him.</hi> And if God excused not these great
and excellent Persons from Punishment,
for such small Offences, with what reason
can we promise Impunity to our selves?
Do we Fancy our selves more dear to
God, or more righteous, than they were?
Surely no. Rather, if they were not
saved without some Difficulty, we shall
not without the most extreme hazard:
and this altho' we did with earnest Study
and sincere Endeavours apply our selves
to attain Salvation; altho' we were
worthy, which be it far from us to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
to our selves, to be ranged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
those, who in the Text are call'd
<hi>Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of the <hi>ungodly</hi> and the <hi>sinners</hi> what
shall I say? But that if the <hi>Righteous
scarcely</hi> be admitted to Mercy, they are
wholly excluded from it. To them, as
the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> saith, Chapter
X. 27. <hi>There remaineth only a certain fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful


<pb n="288" facs="tcp:34506:148"/>
looking for of judgment and fiery indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
Yet we find that the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate
Christians do flatter themselves
with the hopes of Salvation, and upon
Confidence of it proceed securely in a
vicious Course of Life. For I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that there are very few Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
who are not convinced of the
truth of the Religion they profess, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they give their Minds leave to
reflect upon it. Only they put the
Thoughts of it far from them; and
whensoever either the workings of their
own Minds, or the admonition of others
represent to them the Obligation of it,
they render both unsuccessful through
a vain Hope, which they took up upon
they know not what Reasons, that they
are in the number of the saved.</p>
            <p>To this foolish Perswasion many Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
may contribute; a constant and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Success in the World; too great an
Opinion of the Endowments either of
Body or Mind, or whatsoever may raise
in Man a Conceit of his own worth; a
strong Imagination; a false Notion of
the Mercy and the Justice of God; or an
unhappy illusion derived from the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of absolute Predestination. All
these and many other Causes may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to this fatal Error, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:34506:148"/>
the Scripture hath particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
against it; notwithstanding the
meanest Capacity cannot but conclude,
that if God taketh so severe an account
of the Actions of the <hi>Righteous;</hi> if he
always noteth, and oft-times punisheth
their smallest Failures; if with all their
Care and Vigilance, their Mortification
and Circumspection, they are but <hi>hardly
saved;</hi> it is absurd to hope that Heaven
will open to them, who have lived re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missly
and securely, have betrayed their
Profession, and by an impenitent Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in Sin have dishonoured the Author
of Salvation, and rebelled against the
Author of their Being.</p>
            <p>From what I have said, it doth appear
what great Reason there is that those,
who are careful of their Salvation, should
continue and increase their Care; and
that those who are negligent of it,
should shake off their Stupidity, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themselves with their utmost Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to the Acquisition of it. The
difficulty of Salvation ought neither to
discourage the good nor affright the bad.
The Worth and Happiness of it infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
countervaileth all the Labour which
can be employed about it: Nor will the
loss of it be a mere Deprivation, a State
of insensibility; but the beginning of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding


<pb n="290" facs="tcp:34506:149"/>
and endless Torments. The
Consideration therefore of the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which attend it, ought to confirm
the Diligent, and awaken the Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
to increase the Resolution of the
one, and expel the Remissness of the
other; that so the one may continue his
Course so well begun; the other may
find the right way to Happiness, and
enter into it. <hi>God Grant, that what I
have now said, may be of use to both.</hi>

            <p>NOT to trouble you with the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Interpretations of <hi>Yoke</hi> and
<hi>Burden</hi> in the Text, and the Distinction
made by some between them; I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the peculiar Scope of the words to
be a Recommendation of the Christian
Religion, from the easiness of its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and agreeableness of its Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>All Systems of Religion, whether Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or Revealed, may be fitly expressed
by the Metaphors of <hi>a Yoke</hi> and <hi>Burden,</hi>


               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:34506:150"/>
inasmuch as they restrain the Actions of
Man, limit them to certain Rules, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon him the Practice of some,
and Abstinence from other Actions,
which otherwise he should not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
and used them as indifferent;
which demonstrates their Subjection to
God the Author of such Religion, as
fully as <hi>a Yoke</hi> doth the Subjection of
Beasts to their Possessors, or of Captives
to their Conquerors.</p>
            <p>Yet this difference ought to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that however the latter may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pined
at with some shew of Reason, as
being the Deprivation of precedent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
the former is no more than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
and necessary Consequence of humane
Nature; which deriving its Being from
God, doth upon that account owe abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Subjection to him; and enjoying the
use of Freewill, is capable of receiving
and practising such Rules of Conduct,
as the Sovereign Lawgiver shall appoint.</p>
            <p>So that altho' in the former Case it
may be oft-times lawful to cast off <hi>the
Yoke,</hi> or at least desire the removal of
it; yet in this Case it is no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to deny Subjection, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any advantage, and yet refuse to
perform the Condition of it.</p>
            <p>While Men therefore put any value


<pb n="293" facs="tcp:34506:150"/>
upon the benefit of Life and Being, it is
but just that they should receive it with
those inseparable Burdens, which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Author of it to annex to it; such
as Subjection to himself, and obedience
to his Laws.</p>
            <p>And as natural Religion may upon this
account be truly called <hi>a Yoke;</hi> so much
more all instituted Religions. Wherein
the Professors of it, beside the natural
and common Reasons of Subjection to
God, do in a peculiar manner, and for
some more particular Reasons put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under the Command and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, and testifie their Subjection,
by solemn Professions and some external
Rites.</p>
            <p>The Jews did therefore fitly express
the whole Obligation of their Law by
the Denomination of a <hi>Yoke;</hi> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
became a Proselyte to it, was said
to take <hi>the Yoke</hi> of God upon them; and
Men who denied all Obedience to God,
either in their Opinions or Practice, were
called Men of <hi>Belial,</hi> that is Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>a Yoke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Compliance to this received form
of Speech among them, our Lord also
calls his Religion <hi>a Yoke,</hi> and confesseth
the Precepts of it to be <hi>a Burden.</hi> But
then as well to distinguish it from other


<pb n="294" facs="tcp:34506:151"/>
Religions, whether Natural or Jewish,
as to encourage Mankind to take that
<hi>Yoke</hi> upon them; he assureth them that
his <hi>Yoke is easie,</hi> and his <hi>Burden light.</hi> In
pursuance of which Design, I shall treat
of the Words
<list>
                  <item>I. Comparatively, as this Description
of the <hi>Yoke</hi> or Religion of Christ distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
it from all other Religions. And</item>
                  <item>II. Absolutely, as it implieth the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of it, taken either separately or all
together, to be <hi>easie</hi> of Practice, and not
grievous to be undergone.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Easiness and Gentleness of his
Religion above all others, our Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates
in his whole Discourse precedeing
this final Sentence. <hi>Come unto me all ye
that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest:</hi> in the 28th. Verse. Which
supposeth Men to have been oppressed, and
even to have yielded under the weight of
their Burdens, to have been so far from
receiving any Satisfaction or compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
therein, that they grew weary of
them; sought for rest and relief, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
themselves with the sense of the
want of it. And surely not without
Reason.</p>
            <p>For to begin with <hi>the Yoke</hi> of Natural
Religion; that could not but be very
grievous, when no prospect of Reward


<pb n="295" facs="tcp:34506:151"/>
appeared to the Conscientious Observers
of it.</p>
            <p>It is the hopes of some good to be
obtained by it, which excites the Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of Man; and the Continuation
of those hopes will support him under all
Difficulties. Nothing less than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of some excellent Reward could
encourage the Soul of Man to break
through all the Temptations of the
World; to maintain a constant and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
War against the Lusts of the
Body, to afflict it self with continual
carefulness, and enter upon all the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
of a vertuous Life. When no
Reward therefore is promised; when
the Supreme Happiness is, if not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
yet at least uncertain; as they
wanted an effectual Motive to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of Vertue; so the very Ignorance
of true Happiness was none of their least
Anxieties.</p>
            <p>They found themselves to be capable of
more noble Enjoyments, than what their
Senses could present to them, and they
could not stifle the restless Desires of this
Happiness. They set themselves to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after it, framed nice Systems and
subtle Definitions of it; yet all their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
ended in empty and uncertain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
What a continual Vexation was


<pb n="296" facs="tcp:34506:152"/>
it then to the Soul of Man, to consider
that they were capable of great Improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Felicity, and yet knew not
either wherein they consisted, or how
they might be obtained. To view the
extent of their Duty, the many and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
Vertues, which were required of
them, and yet to be unsatisfied to what
Purpose all this tended, or wherein they
should receive any advantage by it. They
could not but conclude indeed, that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God did require a Discrimination
of the good and bad: But then it did not
appear, that because the bad were to be
punished, the good must be Rewarded
with any supernatural Favours. It was
a sufficient Reward to Man for his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Divine Laws, that he had
received his Being and all the Benefits
of his Life from God, and enjoyed them
upon no other Condition.</p>
            <p>Or if an extraordinary Reward might
be reasonably hoped for from the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Divine Justice, yet could
no Man in that State conceive an Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his Title to it; since no such
Reward could be claimed but upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of an absolute and most perfect
Obedience; and every one was Conscious
to himself, that he could not put in any
such Claim. Lastly, to remove all this


<pb n="297" facs="tcp:34506:152"/>
Anxiety, it was not sufficient to renounce
all hopes of future or supernatural Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and live regardless of it. For the
natural Reason of Man would still sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
to him, that this was his Duty, and
that was unlawful to him. If he slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Suggestions; his Conscience would
afflict and torment him, would upbraid
him with it, and cause him to condemn
himself. If he endeavoured to stifle these
Suggestions, he would find it to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible;
and if he could effect it, he
must conceive himself to be reduced to
the State and Condition of a Beast. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole, the Mind of Man could
not but labour with great Anxieties,
grow restless and impatient under the
Burden of Natural Religion, and be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
necessitated to betake it self to the
direction of Christ, who promiseth <hi>Rest</hi>
and Satisfaction to it.</p>
            <p>But our Lord, in this place, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
referreth to the severity of the
Jewish Dispensation; a Religion encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
with so many Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
so many positive Precepts and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
that St. <hi>Peter</hi> justly complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of it in Acts XV. 10. as of <hi>a Yoke,
which neither their Fathers nor themselves
were able to bear.</hi> Nor indeed was it at
first intended to perfect the Nature of


<pb n="298" facs="tcp:34506:153"/>
Mankind, or immediately to procure
Happiness, but rather to guard that stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked
People from the sin of Idolatry,
to which they were so strongly inclined;
that while they were busied about these
Legal Observations, they might be drawn
off from superstitious Rites, and even
conceive an hatred of them. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they contributed little, to raise the
Soul of Man, to improve his Faculties,
or give him Assurance of what he most
desired, an Happiness equal to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of his Nature. They are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deservedly
called <hi>the weak and beggarly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the world</hi> by the Apostle, and
are by God himself in Ezek. XX. said to
be <hi>statutes that were not good,</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whereby the observers of them should
not live;</hi> to have been given <hi>in his Anger;</hi>
in <hi>Punishment</hi> of their <hi>many Rebellions and
Apostacies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed if we consider the great
number of their positive Precepts, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and Observations; how little
they contributed to the cleansing of the
Will, or enlightning of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
how obscure the Reasons of them
were; and how inconsiderable the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
annexed to them; we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it to have been an Institution infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more severe, than what was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward


<pb n="299" facs="tcp:34506:153"/>
introduced by Christ. There was
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ndeed a Reward adjoyned to it, but
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>hat so far beneath the Capacity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, that it could by no means
terminate the Desires of the Soul. And
even this Reward they found by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
to be common to the Observers
and Violators of the Law; and if it had
been appropriated to the good alone,
yet was subject to as many Variations,
as was the Body, which it principally
concerned.</p>
            <p>Again, it could not but be a sensible
Vexation to a considering Mind, that
they were treated by God at such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
debarred the Knowledge of the
Reasons of those Ceremonies, which
were required of them; were left whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the dark as to the Intention of God
in prescribing of them; could disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
no Reasonableness or Excellency in
them, no Agreeableness between them
and their own Nature. It was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them to enter into the Holy of
Holies; to understand the Reasons why
such carnal Observations were imposed on
them: Or if they had understood them;
yet when they viewed the number, the
extent, and the Difficulty of them, they
even despaired to perform them.</p>
            <p>They had indeed all the Reasons


<pb n="300" facs="tcp:34506:154"/>
common to Natural Religion, and some
peculiar to themselves, to expect from
the Divine Justice a better and more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Reward. But then the Nature of
Legal Righteousness consisting in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
and unsinning Obedience, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
their hopes, and subjected them to
the fear of all the Punishments denounced
against the Transgressors of the Law,
which had provided Remedies, expiatory
Sacrifices, for Sins of Omission, inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency,
and a lesser Guilt; but gave
no hopes of Pardon to Sins of a more
hainous Nature; had assigned no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
for their Expiation, nor allowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
means of Pardon for them. Amidst
all these Difficulties the Mind was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
being Conscious of her own Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
but not discovering the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the guilt; despising the unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factoriness
of temporal Felicity, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
no better; obliged to the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of a multitude of Precepts, but
taking no Complacency therein; fearing
the wrath of God, and yet scarce able
to avoid it. Thus was the Jewish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in it self an heavy Burden, even
without the addition of Pharisaical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations,
who by their Scruples,
Niceties and Supererrogations had at that
time almost doubled the weight of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:34506:154"/>
In relief of all these disadvantages our
Lord invites the wearied Soul to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
in his Religion; assureth her of <hi>Rest</hi>
and Satisfaction therein; ease of Scruples,
and removal of Anxiety; in the 28th.
Verse, bids his Disciples not be disquieted
with the Conscience of their past Sins,
nor despair of Pardon; not fear to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to him, as the Jews did to <hi>Mount
Sina,</hi> when the Law was delivered by
God from thence; for that <hi>himself was
meek and lowly in heart;</hi> in the 29th. Verse,
ready to forgive their Sins upon sincere
Repentance, condescending to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities;
willing to lay open all the
Mysteries of his Religion to their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings;
to adapt it to the meanest;
to treat all with a constant Sweetness and
Gentleness; to fill all the Faculties of
their Souls with the Promise and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a Reward, which should be
nothing Inferior to their most extended
Desires. The farther Consideration of
these things will fall under the Second
Head proposed, Namely</p>
            <p>II. The <hi>Easiness</hi> of <hi>the Yoke</hi> and <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of the <hi>Burden</hi> imposed upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
by the Commands of Christ, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the Comparison of other Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stems
of Religion, and as it more nearly
respects our Practice and Observation of


<pb n="302" facs="tcp:34506:155"/>
the Duties of it. This <hi>Yoke</hi> is no other
than the performance of all Christian
Duties, or of the Commands of Christ;
which word St. <hi>John</hi> makes use of to
express the same Sense, 1 Joh. V. 3. <hi>For
this is the love of God, that we keep his
commandments; and his commandments</hi> are
<hi>not grievous.</hi> A Proposition, which might
perhaps appear incredible to any one who
reflects upon the Nature of the Obedience
required, and other passages of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
That every Action of our Life
is limited and regulated by it; that it
extends not to the outward Act alone,
but includeth the most secret Motions of
the Will; that it enjoyneth Man to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
Father and Mother, to quit his
dearest Affections, to renounce the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the World, and upon occasion
even Life it self; That therefore <hi>strait
is the gate and narrow is the way, which
leadeth unto Life; and few there be which
find it;</hi> and the Life of a Christian is said
to be a continual War against the united
force of the World, the Flesh, and the
Devil. These Reasons might possibly
affright Mankind from taking such a
severe Profession on them, did not the
Reason of the thing, the Experience of
all good Men, and the infallible Asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of him who is Truth it self, assure


<pb n="303" facs="tcp:34506:155"/>
us, That this <hi>Yoke</hi> far from being insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
<hi>is light and easie.</hi> I might Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
this by many Reasons, but shall
at this time confine my self to Three.
<list>
                  <item>1. The Agreeableness of it to the
Nature of Man.</item>
                  <item>2. The Greatness and certainty of the
Reward.</item>
                  <item>3. The external Assistances afforded
in the Practice of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The first Reason is drawn from the
Agreeableness of the Precepts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
to the Nature of Man. For
what doth Christianity enjoyn, which
Reason doth not confirm to be the Duty
of Man? What doth it require, which doth
not adorn, perfect and exalt his Nature?
The Sum of Christianity is to conserve
a reverent Conception of God, to obey
his Authority, and prefer it to all other
Reasons; to exercise a constant tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the use of Pleasures; an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Charity in relation to our Fellow-Members;
to be just and true; to oppress
none, to defraud none, to do as we would
be done by.</p>
            <p>These are the great Lines of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
Duty, these are the chief subject of the
Law of Christ. To these indeed must
be added to compleat a Christian, Faith
in Christ, reliance on his Merits, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion


<pb n="304" facs="tcp:34506:156"/>
with him in those external Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
which he hath instituted, to
declare the mutual Union between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and us; whereby we visibly joyn
our selves to him, put our selves under
his Command; declare, confirm, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterate
our Resolutions of obeying his
Commands and following his Directions.
Yet can these latter scarce be accounted
any part of the Christian <hi>Yoke;</hi> since
simply considered, they include no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
no restraint of the Will of Man,
and would not even by the most sensual
Person be accounted any <hi>Yoke</hi> or <hi>Burden;</hi>
but as they are so many Marks and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations
of the Covenant made with
God by every Christian to observe those
Primary Duties, which we before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>These are no other than the necessary
result of the Nature and Condition of
Man in the World. As a created Being,
he oweth Obedience to God; as posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the use of Free-will and Reason, he
is obliged to direct his Actions according
to those Rules which reason prescribeth
to him. From the light of this Reason, he
is easily convinced, that it is his Duty to
exercise all those Vertues we before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
that every Sin is a Violation of
his Duty, inasmuch as it opposeth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection


<pb n="305" facs="tcp:34506:156"/>
of his Reason which ought to
guide him, and over turneth that Order
and <hi>Decorum,</hi> which he ought to observe
in the World. The Infirmities of his
Body, the Imperfections of his Mind
force him to confess his Dependence
upon some greater Being; convince him
that he was not put into the World to
follow blindly the Inclinations of his
own Will, but to conform himself to
those Rules of Government, which the
common Author of all Creatures hath
established among them.</p>
            <p>If when he undertaketh any Action
or formeth any Resolution, he consults
his Reason, it will tell him, that this is
his Duty, that is unlawful to him; this
is Decent, that unfit for him; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes,
that dishonoureth his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Nay, whether he takes Councel
from Reason or not, it will not fail to
suggest to him in every Action, what is
good, just, and honourable; what impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
injust, and disgraceful to him.</p>
            <p>Now all these natural Suggestions of
Reason, are no other than those very
Duties, which make up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Christ.
The Actions and Rules of Conduct are
the same in both; the only difference lieth
in the Greatness of the Obligation, and the
reasons upon which every Action is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.


<pb n="306" facs="tcp:34506:157"/>
For whereas Nature directeth
that this should be performed, because
consentaneous to Reason, that omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
because repugnant to it: Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
requireth that the one should be
done, the other forborn, chiefly for
the Love of God; in Conformity to his
Will, and in gratitude for the Benefits
of Creation and Redemption. However
the Acts are still the same. For doth not
the Reason of all Men agree in this, that
Obedience and Reverence is due to God;
that whatsoever opposeth his Will is an
Act of Rebellion, and denial of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
on him; that the Appetites,
Passions, and Lusts of the Body ought to
be subjected to the more noble Faculty
of Reason; that it is this which consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
a Man, and distinguisheth his
Conduct from that of Beasts; that to
let loose the Reins to these Lusts, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
any of them without the Assent of
Reason, is to pervert the Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and violate the Dignity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
that to be just, true, and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is what the Order and Peace of the
World requireth, to which he ought to
conform himself, while he continueth a
Member of it; that he hath no Right to
defraud or injure any other; that if he
should do it, he is unworthy to continue
his Station among Men?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:34506:157"/>
All this natural Reason suggesteth to
the Conscience of every Man. These
draw not their Original from any reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Religion, but are only inforced by
it. It hath been pretended indeed by
some Patrons of Atheism, tho' it can
scarce be believed, that themselves were
perswaded of it; that all these Notions
are derived from the precedent Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of some Revealed or supposedly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
Religion. On the contrary, all
Ages and Nations, all Orders of Men
have agreed in these common Notions;
which cannot possibly proceed from any
thing but an universal instinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>View the most barbarous Nations of
the World, who never heard of any insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Religion; they have the same ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Conceptions of good and bad,
which we have. Look back into the
most ancient Ages of the World, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to any supposed Revelation, the
same Ideas of Vertue and Vice will be
found in all. Consult the Schools of
Philosophers. They differed from one
another in almost all their Speculations:
In these practical Truths they all agreed.
Lastly, search the Conscience of every
single Man; and because you cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Secrets of other Men, appeal


<pb n="308" facs="tcp:34506:158"/>
to your own Experience; whether every
Action be not attended with an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Approbation or Condemnation of
Reason; whether your Conscience doth
not instruct you, that many things you
ought to do, others to omit; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if you refuse to follow the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, it doth not upbraid to you the
Omission or Violation of your Duty.</p>
            <p>If then all the momentous Duties of
the Christian Religion be required by the
Light of Nature; if what our Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth
of us be no more than what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
would have prescribed to us, if no
Revelation had intervened; surely the
Obligation laid upon us by Christianity
is <hi>a Burden</hi> very <hi>easie</hi> to be born. For
hence it will follow, that to execute the
Office of a Christian is no more, than to
perform the Duty of a Man; that it is
but natural to Practise all the Precepts of
it, and that a contrary Conduct is a force
of Nature. Now that whatsoever is
natural to any Being is most easie to be
effected by it, is no more than what
common Sense will teach us. For in
being such, it is most adapted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to the Faculties of that Being
to which it is natural.</p>
            <p>This Argument will receive a farther
Illustration from that sweet Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency


<pb n="309" facs="tcp:34506:158"/>
of Mind which is inseparable from
all good Actions, and which doth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
alleviate the Burden and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate
the Difficulty of it. This our Lord
seems to have had a particular regard to
in the Text, when affirming his <hi>Yoke to
be easie,</hi> he useth a word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, which
in the Original more properly denoteth
<hi>Sweet</hi> and <hi>Pleasant.</hi> What greater Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
then can be conceived either of
the Ea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>iness of the Duties of Christianity,
or of their Agreeableness to humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
than that a grateful Complacency
always attends them, while the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulates
to her self the performance of
her Duty, the Conquests of adverse Lusts,
and the right use of her own Faculties?
No Joy can be conceiv'd more intense than
this, none more Serene and undisturbed,
because none more Spiritual, or founded
upon better Reasons.</p>
            <p>The truth of this every good Man can
confirm by his own Experience. Nor do
even bad Men want the same Conviction.
For none almost are found so totally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
who do not sometimes Practise
good Actions. And then I appeal to
themselves, whether they receive not an
inward Satisfaction from the Conscience
of it. And if any Degree of Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
be found in them, who through


<pb n="310" facs="tcp:34506:159"/>
disuse are wont little to relish or value spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Pleasure, what infinite Satisfaction
must good Men reap from thence, who
by a well fixed Determination have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
themselves, that the Exercise of
Christian Vertues is the only means of
present Happiness, and will hereafter
procure yet more noble Enjoyments?</p>
            <p>On the contrary, all vicious Actions
are attended with a no less constant Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction
and regret of Mind, raised
by the Dictates of Nature only. For
who can be impious or disobedient to
God, and not conceive Indignation at his
own Ingratitude? Who ever reflected
upon any inordinate Lust committed by
him, and did not afterwards vex him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that he had no more command of
his Passions, and could not over-come
a foolish Desire? Who ever yielded to
Drunkenness, and did not at the return
of his Wits conclude that he had done a
thing unworthy of himself? Thus in all
other Sins, Reason doth not fail to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
to Man, that he perverted the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of his Nature, degraded his Soul, and
dishonoured himself. This Remorse alone
(without the Fear of future Punishments
made known by Revelation) brings far
more Affliction to the Mind of Man, than
the Enjoyment of any Sin brings Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure


<pb n="311" facs="tcp:34506:159"/>
to it. These expire in a moment;
those continue as long as the use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
remains; which altho' it may be
suspended by violent Lusts for a while,
yet will certainly break out with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
force, and torment the Mind with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Shame, Anxiety, and Distrust.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, a vertuous Life is
most agreeable, most easie, and most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to the Nature of Man, even
abstracting from the Obligation superad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Revelation, and the Reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
by it. So that our Lord in making
the moral Vertues the only practical Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his Religion, and the Exercises of
them to be the Conditions of his proposed
Reward, hath imposed a most <hi>easie</hi> and
most desireable <hi>Yoke</hi> upon Mankind.</p>
            <p>A Second Reason of the <hi>Easiness</hi> of the
Christian <hi>Yoke,</hi> is the Greatness and
the certainty of the Reward annexed to
it. Which Reason more particularly
rendereth easie that most arduous Duty
of Christianity, the Patient enduring of
Persecution, Affliction, and even Death
it self in the defence of it: and is to that
Purpose imploy'd by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. IV.
17. <hi>For our light Affliction, which is but for
a moment, worketh for us a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> Facility
and Difficulty are relative Notions, and


<pb n="312" facs="tcp:34506:160"/>
are to be measured by the Proportion
which the worth of the end to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
beareth to the Labour and hazard,
which are to be employed in the Acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. If an eminent advantage may
be obtained by a proportionable Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
we allow it to be an easie Condition.
When therefore the greatest Happiness,
which our Nature is capable of, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to us upon Condition of such a
right use of our Free-will, as is in our
Power; the Imposition ought to be
esteemed an <hi>easie Burden,</hi> when it procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to us such an infinite Reward. And
not only doth the Excellency of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
take off the Imputation of severity
from Christ's imposing so strict and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Holiness upon us; but is also an
effectual Motive to us of Vigilance and
Industry, in the Execution of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
required of us.</p>
            <p>In all other Actions of Life our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
are wont to be more or less
vigorous, as the desire of the end we
aim at is more or less intense. The Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
of the Desire is always proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to our Esteem of the Excellency
of the end. That we may therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an earnest Desire of this noble End,
and be thereby incited to use a suitable
Diligence for the Attainment of it, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary


<pb n="313" facs="tcp:34506:160"/>
that we form to our selves a right
Estimate of the Greatness and Worth of
it; by reflecting on the infinite Duration,
the inconceivable Pleasures, and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
State of it; by comparing it with
all the trifling Enjoyments of this Life,
and raising the Thoughts to an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of somewhat yet greater than can
be now conceived. This will carry the
Soul of Man through all the Difficulties
of a Christian Life, baffle the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the World, surmount the Fears
of Death, or temporal Affliction, much
more effectually, than the desire of Glory,
the Ambition of a Crown, or the Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some violent Passion hath engag'd
many in the most desperate Undertakings.</p>
            <p>For in these latter Cases, the Acquisition
of the end was never ascertained to the
Undertakers in the beginning of their
Design. The most vigorous Industry
and Courage was in them subject to the
Chance of Fortune: Whereas in the
former Case, there is an inseparable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
between the end and the means,
between eternal Happiness and true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Obedience; which no change of
Fortune can dissolve, no unforeseen Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
can overthrow. Therein the
Undertaker is only to answer for his
Diligence; nor is any thing required to


<pb n="314" facs="tcp:34506:161"/>
compleat his Success but what is intirely
in his Power. If he be not wanting to
himself, he may rest secure of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
the Nature, the Extent, the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and the Seat of which our Lord
hath fully made known unto Man; that
so he might not any longer be distracted
with anxious Thoughts about it; and so
hath upon that account also, as he Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the precedent Verses, given <hi>Rest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Soul,</hi> wearied before with a Fruitless
and uncertain Search of Happiness.</p>
            <p>The last Argument, which I proposed
to speak of, is taken from the external
Assistance, which Christ hath Promised,
and doth still continue to his Disciples
in the Exercise of their Duty. Our
Lord, in imposing his <hi>Yoke</hi> upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
knew very well the Infirmities of
their Nature, the Opposition of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
to their ordinary Passions, the
Tenderness and Clemency, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the Saviour, Redeemer, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
of Mankind; and therefore did
not abandon them to the Conduct of
their Free-will alone, but assisted their
Obedience with the Motions of his Holy
Spirit, with those supernatural Gifts and
Graces, which he bestows upon all his
sincere Disciples; which render the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of those Precepts, which he laid


<pb n="315" facs="tcp:34506:161"/>
upon them, Easie and Pleasant to
them.</p>
            <p>To convey this Grace to all the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Receivers of it, he hath founded
a Church, a Society of Men professing
and publickly declaring Obedience to
him in that manner, and with those Rites,
which himself hath instituted. He hath
made himself the Head of this Body, and
as such Communicates the influences of
his Blessed Spirit to all the Members of
it, to us who continue in Communion
with it. If any separate themselves
from this Body, whereof himself is the
Head, they cease to have any Relation
to him, receive none of those supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Assistances, which are derived from
the Head to all parts of the Body: At
least they cannot receive them by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
method appointed to convey
them. And if any pretend new Lights
and new Ways; they are such as have
no Promise annexed to them.</p>
            <p>It is not to be admired therefore, what
may be truly observed, That all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Schismaticks dividing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the Communion of the
Church, have in all Ages endeavoured
to take away the Obligation of moral
Duties, and set up the Pretence of greater
Lights, of a more refined Knowledge,


<pb n="316" facs="tcp:34506:162"/>
to compensate the neglect of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Meekness, of Justice and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
They having divided themselves
from the Body of the Church, cut off
the ordinary Communication between
Christ and them; and thereby depriving
themselves of the benefit of those Divine
Graces and Assistances which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
by that Channel, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unable to Practise those Christian
Vertues, which our Lord requireth of
his Disciples; and therefore endeavoured
to annul the necessity and Obligation of
them.</p>
            <p>But this is not to alleviate, but to cast
off the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Christ; to Claim the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
and refuse the Conditions of the
Covenant which he made with Mankind:
and in the mean while to cheat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others, with vain Perswasions
and arrogant Pretences.</p>
            <p>Our Lord hath Promised the Assistance
of his Spirit, and therein he will not
fail; he hath settled the means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
it, and that he Will not change.
If we slight the Assistance, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of it; if we forsake the means,
we are incapable. Let us rightly esteem
and implore this Assistance to our selves;
let us hold fast the means, whereby we
may receive it; that is, a constant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion


<pb n="317" facs="tcp:34506:162"/>
with his Body the Church in all
her Holy Offices and Sacraments; so shall
we Experience, that his Commands
are not only Excellent in themselves,
agreeable to our Nature, and rendred
Pleasant by their Reward, but are also
made Easie by his Grace and the Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his Spirit. In the whole we shall
be convinced of the Truth of what he
affirmed, That <hi>his Yoke is easie, and his
Burden light,</hi> and <hi>find</hi> assurance of what
he Promised, <hi>Rest to our</hi> wearied <hi>Souls.</hi>

            <p>THE Apostle having exhorted to
the Duty of Charity throughout
this whole Chapter, and enforced his
exhortation with many Arguments, at
last concludeth his Arguments, with these
words, whereby he proveth, that to act
in a contrary manner, were to encroach
upon the Prerogative of God, and invade
what he claimeth peculiarly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:34506:163"/>
And surely no less an Argument than
the fear of violating the Majesty and the
Power of God could deter Men from
the Practice and Prosecution of revenge,
which at first Sight appears to be so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
a Passion in Man, and can plead
for it self with more plausible Arguments
than any other sin whatsoever. As that
Nature directeth all Creatures to defend
themselves and repel the Assaults of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
that for this Purpose all Animals
are endued with proportionable Strength
and Courage; that to pass by one Enemy
unrevenged exposeth a Man to the insults
of Enemies, to the scorn of Friends, and
to renewed Wrongs; that it is no other
than Baseness and Cowardize, an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a mean and timorous Soul, to
submit patiently to the Affronts and
Wrongs of another Man; and that to
return <hi>evil for evil,</hi> to punish the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of an Offender by procuring Loss or
Grief to him, is no other than a part
of distributive Justice, of which every
Man may be allowed to be the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strator;
that so as the smart of Revenge
inflicted may punish the Malice of the
Aggressor, the Pleasure of inflicting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
may make some amends for the
undeserved Sufferings of the injured
Party.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:34506:164"/>
Such Arguments Men are wont to
plead in behalf of Revenge; and such
did once introduce an universal Opinion
in the World, that Revenge was not only
a Matter allowed, but even a Vertue,
the Duty of every Noble and Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
mind, Consonant to the intentions
of Nature, and the Office of every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Man.</p>
            <p>Thus the great Masters of Morality
among the Heathens; among whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more frequent than such Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
as these; that Revenge is sweeter
than Life it self; that Moderation is to be
observed in creating, but none in reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Injuries; that not to revenge a
Wrong, is an Argument of Fear and
Sloth, of an unmanly and degenerous
Mind.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, we are taught,
throughout this whole Chapter, <hi>to bless
them which persecute us, to recompence to
no Man evil for evil, to live peaceably with
all Men,</hi> and in the last place (which
concerns my present Design) <hi>not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
our selves, but rather give place unto
wrath;</hi> not to take upon us to inflict the
Punishment due to any sin of Injustice
committed against us, but to leave that
to be inflicted by God, either by his own
immediate Power, or by those Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,


<pb n="321" facs="tcp:34506:164"/>
to whom he hath delegated part
of his Power: Not to prevent the Justice
of God herein, and forestall his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>For that is the meaning of those words:
<hi>But rather give place unto wrath.</hi> Leave
room for the Wrath or just Anger of
God against such Sinners to take place
and display it self. Do not you therein
arrogate to your selves the Office of a
Judge, and by pretending to punish the
Offender, prevent the Punishment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
by the proper Judge. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
follows, and that not new, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
many Ages since in the Old
Testament: <hi>For it is written; Vengeance
is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.</hi> I am
the Supreme Judge of the World, the
Lord of all Mankind. To me only, as
such, it belongeth to execute Judgment,
and punish the demerits of Men. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
takes upon him to avenge himself,
violates my Authority, and invades my
Office.</p>
            <p>An hard Lesson this, as it should seem;
to restrain the natural Passions of Man;
to forbid the returning of Evil to avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Enemies; to tye up the hands of Men,
and that not only (as it may happen)
from retaliating past Injuries, but also
from preventing future Wrongs, Nay


<pb n="322" facs="tcp:34506:165"/>
to reluctant Minds this generally appears,
and is represented, as yet more Difficult;
as destroying the Peace of the World,
taking away the means of Self-defence,
and exposing the Observers of it, to the
Injuries and Tyranny of all other Men.</p>
            <p>Yet if the Matter be well considered,
nothing is more reasonable, or more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
to the Peace of the World; that
as it may be universally affirmed of the
Doctrine of Christ, that it is in all things
agreeable to humane Reason, and the
Law of Nature; so more eminently it
will appear in this point to have restored
the depraved Notions of natural Reason,
and to have introduced a right Sense of
the Duty of Man, in Relation to the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
and returning of Injuries. To
clear this we must first fix a right Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Revenge; and it will then be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that the Execution of it belongeth
to God alone.</p>
            <p>And here in the first place, Self-defence
is to be distinguished from Revenge: the
want of which distinction hath mightily
promoted the cause of Revenge; while
all the Arguments, which warrant a
Self-defence, Men have employed in As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
of Revenge.</p>
            <p>Christianity forbids not those lawful
means of Self-preservation, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture


<pb n="323" facs="tcp:34506:165"/>
allows, and hath not herein in the
least abridged the Priviledges of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
It is still lawful to repel force
with force, to seek the Preservation of
Life and Fortune, even with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of an Adversary, if it can be
obtained no other way; provided that
this Priviledge be never employed to the
disturbance of the publick Peace of the
World, or in opposition to those lawful
Powers, to whom both Life and Fortune
are subjected.</p>
            <p>So far was God from disarming his
People in this Case, and forbidding to
them the means of Self-defence; that he
often exhorts them to fight their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
Couragiously, sent them Prophets to
conduct them, endued their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
with Wisdom and Valour; and was
even Content, that his own positive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
should yield to Self-defence, when
the latter could not be maintained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Violation of the former, as in
the Case of fighting on the Sabbath day.
A plain Argument, that Self-defence is
not only permitted by God to Men, but
even commanded to them; otherwise
it could never take place of a positive
Divine Precept; and that it is a Sin to
neglect the lawful means of Self-prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:34506:166"/>
In the Gospel our Lord bids us indeed,
<hi>If any one smites us on the one Cheek to
turn to him the other also;</hi> and <hi>if he takes
away our Coat, to give him our Cloke also.</hi>
But all this, as it appears from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
to have been spoken in opposition to
that eager Prosecution of Revenge which
was familiar to, and thought lawful by
the Jews, so it plainly amounts to no
more than this; that rather than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
Revenge, properly so called, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to delight in the Misery of an
Enemy retaliated by us upon him, we
should suffer a yet much greater Loss;
that it were more preferable to endure a
double Injury, than to contract the guilt
of Malice or Revenge.</p>
            <p>Otherwise our Lord, who professeth
it far from his Intentions to alter the
least Tittle of the Moral Law, hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forbidden nor discountenanced a
Self-defence, when free from Revenge
and Malice. On the contrary he hath
ratified and approved, and even insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
the Civil Magistrate (for St. <hi>Paul</hi>
calls it the Ordinance of God) and put
the Sword into his hand on purpose to
punish Malefactors, and repel the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of one Man from another by violence.
For upon this Principle of Self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all Government is founded; and


<pb n="325" facs="tcp:34506:166"/>
every Act of it, every Punishment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on a Malefactor, is done in Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the same Design.</p>
            <p>Thus doth not this Self-defence in the
least interfere with the Prohibition of
Revenge; since it necessarily includeth
not Hatred or desire of Revenge; or if
it should include it, it hath passed its
Bounds, and is to be called by another
name. The sole end of Self-defence is
to preserve Life or Goods, not to offend
any other; whereas the Nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
consists wholly in designing or
desiring the Death, Loss or Misery of
another, not as contributing to our
own Self-preservation, but as returning
and punishing his Malice and hatred
to us.</p>
            <p>Thus Revenge, being separated from
the Cause of Self-defence, will easily
appear what it truly is; and will want
those Arguments to recommend it, which
it borrowed from the latter. It is the
desire or endeavour of bringing Evil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another Man, solely or chiefly for this
end, that he may suffer some loss or grief;
when we return an Injury to any one
for this only Reason, because we have
received one either real or imaginary
from him. Thus Self-defence may easily
degenerate into Revenge; when a Man


<pb n="326" facs="tcp:34506:167"/>
not Content to have secured his own
safety, to have disarmed his Enemy, or
to have made a fair retreat, presseth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Adversary, pursueth his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and seeketh the hurt or destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of him; when any one Projects
how to return a like Injury to that he
hath received; when he conceiveth a
personal Hatred of the Man, studieth to
create some disadvantage to him; at least
retains so much Malice in his Heart, that
he envieth and maligneth him, and should
entertain his Misfortunes with Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
            <p>The methods and kinds of Revenge
are as different, as are the secret workings
of Malice; nor can either Malice or Envy
be ever found without the conjunction of
Revenge and Imagination of some past
Injury. It is said, that <hi>Cain</hi> slew his
Brother out of Envy; yet was that Envy
accompanied with the desire of Revenge,
for having as he thought, robbed him
of the favour of God, by procuring the
greater share of it to himself. Other
Acts of Revenge may more eminently
appear to belong to that Denomination;
as when <hi>Joab</hi> killed <hi>Abner</hi> for the Death
of his Brother; and <hi>Herod</hi> sought the
Death of <hi>John</hi> the Baptist for reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his incestuous Marriage; yet this we


<pb n="327" facs="tcp:34506:167"/>
may be assured of, as Revenge can never
be formed in the Mind without prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Malice, and subsequent Envy of the
others out-living, altho' but for one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Execution of his Revenge; so
neither can Malice or Envy take place
without a desire of Revenge. And then
as in all other Sins, so in this also, the
Guilt of it consists not so much in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it, as in the precedent Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of it by the Will; and becomes
not the less because not put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And as all other Sins are proposed to
the Will under some specious Pretence;
so Revenge assumeth the shew of Justice;
and therein chiefly makes good the
Charge, which we before mentioned, of
incroaching upon the Prerogative and
Authority of God. It is indeed a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Plea to pretend, that Justice must
be strictly observed in the World; that
it is not fit the least Injury of Men should
pass unpunished; that they ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
the Guilt of their Injury by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
Punishment; that otherwise
the Peace of the World cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and good Men will be always
exposed to the Insults and Oppression of
others. Upon this ground, and with
these Pretences, Men take upon them the


<pb n="328" facs="tcp:34506:168"/>
Office of a Supreme Judge; they will
needs determine the quantity of every
Man's demerits, and inflict a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon it.</p>
            <p>This Arrogance is visible in every Act
of Revenge; where the Person reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proposeth to himself to punish the
Malice of the Offender; not only to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his own safety (for while it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
no farther, it is not Revenge) but
also to procure such a Punishment to the
other, as may compensate for the Flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness
of the Injury which he hath
committed. And herein chiefly consists
the Offence of a revengeful Mind against
God, (for as it is an Offence against our
Neighbour, I do not now consider it)
this constituteth the Guilt of it, that it
invadeth the Office of the Supreme
Judge, which belongeth to God alone.
And upon this is founded the Reason
brought against Revenge by the Apostle
in the Text: <hi>Avenge not your selves; but
rather give place unto Wrath</hi> (await the
Execution of the Divine Wrath upon all
Sinners,) <hi>For it is written, Vengeance is
mine; I will repay saith the Lord.</hi> In which
words, God taketh the Execution of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
from Men in the former part of
them, and in the latter part appropriates
it to himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:34506:168"/>
I will consider both together; for that
the same Reasons, which forbid the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Revenge to Man, affix it to
God; and for this very Cause it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to Man, because it belongeth sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to God. To pass Judgment upon the
demerits of every sinful Action, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the quantity of the Guilt, and affix
a proper Punishment to it, belongs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Supreme Judge of the World;
which Office is invested in God, as being
the Creator of all things living, and the
absolute Lord of the World; which
when he had formed, he quitted not to
the blind Operations of Chance, nor to
the Disposition of inferior Spirits, nor
yet to the unruly Wills of Men; but
retained the Government in his own
hand, reserved to himself the distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Rewards and Punishments, upon
which account he is called <hi>the Judge of all
the Earth,</hi> Gen. XVIII. 25.</p>
            <p>One part of this Office of Judge is to
execute Vengeance upon Sinners; for
which Reason he is called <hi>the God of
Vengeance</hi> more than once in the Ninth
Psalm. The Execution of his just Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
upon Sinners is termed Revenge;
and Sinners the object of it are called
his Adversaries, as Deut. XXXII. 43.
<hi>He will render Vengeance to his Adversaries;</hi>


               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:34506:169"/>
and in many other places of Scripture.
To teach us, that he claims that Office
to himself, and that he alone is capable of
recompencing in due manner the Guilt
of every injurious Act, and all Sins are
such to him.</p>
            <p>He is the Supreme Lord of all, and
therefore hath a full Right to judge his
Creatures; he is the common Lord of all,
and therefore cannot be suspected of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.
His Justice will not suffer any
Sin to escape unpunished. He is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and far from punishing Offences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their Merit, chastiseth Sinners less
than they deserve. He searcheth the
Conscience of every Man, cannot be
deceived by false Representations, nor be
drawn aside by Passion or Prejudice. He
knoweth exactly the true demerit of
every Sin; and can unerringly Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Punishment to the Crime. He
hath promised in a peculiar manner to
revenge the Injuries done to his faithful
Servants; and by a positive Precept
hath taken Revenge out of the hands of
Men.</p>
            <p>If after all this, Men will presume to
intermeddle in the Cause of Revenge,
and pretend to punish the Pravity of any
Action; they manifestly usurp the Office
of God, and place themselves in his Seat


<pb n="331" facs="tcp:34506:169"/>
of Judicature. An attempt, which he
will not so easily pardon; who, as he
saith of himself, is <hi>jealous of his Honour,
and will not give his Glory to another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor indeed can such Revenge be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
without pretending to that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power, which is invested in God.
For not to say that this were to refuse
Obedience to his Commands, and therein
to renounce his Government, who hath
commanded the contrary; to pass by
that; to revenge an Injury must suppose
an absolute Subjection of the Person, on
whom the Revenge is to be inflicted.</p>
            <p>For after every Man hath used the
Priviledges of Self-defence in opposition
to the other, he hath no more Right left
of acting any against him. The Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the others injurious Malice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
not to him, unless the absolute
Subjection of the other gives him just
Title to it. And in this Case it is not
sufficient, that the Body of the one
should be subject to the other (for that
doth often happen) but the Cognizance
of the secret Actions of the Soul must
also belong to him, who judgeth of the
demerits of the Fact; otherwise it will
be impossible to determine how much,
or how little Malice the Injury included
in it. Whereas in this respect no Man


<pb n="332" facs="tcp:34506:170"/>
is subject to another; we are all equally
Fellow-Servants to God. And then the
Expostulation of the Apostle will take
place: <hi>Who art thou, that judgest ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mans servant? to his own Master he
either standeth or falleth.</hi> This cannot
be done without assuming the Authority
of the Master; and this is certainly done,
as often as Revenge is intended or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>But not only upon this account are
we injurious to the Majesty of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as we are all Fellow-Creatures
and the works of his hands, if we take Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and in that make our selves Judges
of such our Fellow-Servants; but in that,
while we all equally hope for Pardon
from the hands of God our common
Judge, we deny it to one another, and
presume to require that from God, which
we will not Grant our selves. If in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Revenge we alledge, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath injured us; and are not we in
every Sin injurious to God? Thy Fellow-Servant
hath perhaps injured thee once
or twice; but thou hast injured God, the
Lord of both, very often, perhaps every
day of thy Life; and then what equality
is there between injuring a Fellow-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
and a Master? He perhaps was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
nay first injured by thee, before


<pb n="333" facs="tcp:34506:170"/>
he committed any Acts of Hatred or
Malice against thee: But thou hast of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
thy Lord, from whom thou never
receivedst any Injuries, by whom thou
hast been obliged with the greatest Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
by whose Favour thou livest, and
from whom thou expectest all that can
make thee Happy.</p>
            <p>Consider, that if God should examine
strictly, and immediately revenge all thy
Offences against him, thou hast not one
day to live: <hi>For if thou Lord shouldst be
extreme to mark what is done amiss, O Lord
who may abide it?</hi> So said a better Man
than thou art; and much more must
thou confess, if thou either dissemblest
not with others or deceivest not thy
self.</p>
            <p>For to pass by all those secret Sins,
which are known only to every Man's
Conscience, and have no witness but God
alone; if we should be required to give
an account of those open and manifest
ones which we daily commit, what Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
could we expect? If God should
take a severe Account of our Negligence
and want of attention in Prayer, of all
the idle Speeches proceeding from our
Mouth, and the rash Judgments which
we make, and such other Sins and Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertencies
committed but in any one day;


<pb n="334" facs="tcp:34506:171"/>
we should have just Reason to despair of
Pardon. But if he ransacks our Souls,
and brings forth into Judgment all the
secret Sins of it, the evil Desires and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Thoughts, the unlawful Motions
and vain Imaginations; we should then
have no hope left. And if the Sins of
one day bring inevitable Destruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, without the Mercy and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of God; what an Abyss of Mercy
will the Sins of a whole Life require?
Yet all these Sins he condescends to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
all this Mercy he extends to Man,
with this single Condition, that he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the Offences of his Fellow-Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
For this is an Argument against
Revenge peculiar to the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>To the Jews the Promises of Divine
Pardon were neither so full nor so clear;
and therefore God in giving Laws to
them, thought it convenient to wink at
their exercise of Revenge in some Cases.
I will not reckon as such that Law of
giving <hi>an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</hi>
For however it was afterwards most
grosly mis-interpreted by the Jews; it
included not any thing of Revenge in
the first Institution and Design of it.
But certainly that Law cannot be excused
from Revenge, which alloweth to the


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:34506:171"/>
Kindred of any Man slain unadvisedly to
retaliate his Death upon the Author of it,
if they overtook him before he entred
into any City of refuge.</p>
            <p>It is our Happiness, that as we have
a better Religion and greater Promises,
so we have stronger Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us to our Duty. And in this Case,
he, who gave us both, hath forbidden
the Execution of Revenge to us, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
it to himself. So that not
only upon account of the Nature of the
thing, but also of the Divine Command,
Revenge is made injurious to God, and
unlawful to us.</p>
            <p>Further, not only do we want that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
which Revenge pre-supposeth;
not only are we precluded by the express
Prohibition of God; but we also want
other qualifications absolutely necessary
to us, before it be convenient that we
be intrusted with the Execution of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
I will instance but in two:</p>
            <p>First, Knowledge of the true Guilt of
the Crime which we would revenge.</p>
            <p>It must be acknowledged that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of a Cause ought to be known, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Judgment be passed on it. In
Humane Judicatures the Peace of the
World and Interest of publick Societies
require, that probable Evidence be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,


<pb n="336" facs="tcp:34506:172"/>
that Judgment be given accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the appearance of things. But
if Men pretend to judge the Consciences
of others, to define the Hainousness of
the Guilt of their Offences, and to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Punishment upon it, which is
the Proper work of Revenge; they ought
exactly to know the most private
thoughts of the Soul; by what steps and
arguments the Will was induced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that Injury; what Judgment the
Understanding formed of it when it
was committed. Otherwise Men may
grosly mistake; they may Judge that to
be an Injury, which was intended by
the other for a Kindness; in which Case
there is rather Merit than Guilt in the
Offender: And if his intended Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
doth really turn to the Detriment
of the other, it will be a misfortune to
them both; yet the Merit of the Benefit
ought not to be esteemed less. Thus a
passionate Revenge may be employed
against its own Benefactors, and invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Course of Justice punish the Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers.</p>
            <p>In other Cases Men may interpret Acts
of inadvertency to proceed from a formed
Malice, and punish what is indeed but a
venial Injury, as a Mortal offence. They
may prosecute the Execution of revenge,


<pb n="337" facs="tcp:34506:172"/>
even after the other hath repented of the
Injury in his mind, and resolved (if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
to make Reparation for it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hath expiated the guilt of the Offence.</p>
            <p>In all these and many other Cases, Men
may err most grosly in passing their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the enormity of Injuries offered
to them, which must be supposed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
all Revenge. And how dangerous
such Errors are our Lord acquaints us,
when he assureth us, Matth. VII. 2. <hi>With
what Judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and
with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured
to you again.</hi> This Reason makes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for Man to execute Revenge aright,
if it should be permitted to him; and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to be desired; and for this Reason
it ought to be taken out of the hands of
Man, and be committed to him alone, who
is the Searcher of all Spirits.</p>
            <p>Again, if it were possible for Man to
form a right Judgment of the guilt of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Offence, and the quantity of the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be inflicted; he would still com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
fatal Miscarriages in the Execution of
it. His Passions are so violent, that
he would far exceed the Limits of the
prescribed Punishment, add weight and
sharpness to it in Complyance with his own
Hatred, and imagine that his Anger ought
to be indulged therein. Nay I fear, that
in all Cases of Revenge it will be found;


<pb n="338" facs="tcp:34506:173"/>
that the Punishment is inflicted not out of
abhorrence to the sin committed, but out
of Malice and Hatred to the Person of the
other; not to reform the irregularity of the
other, but to gratifie his own Passion; not
to oppose sin, but to harm a supposed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
And thus not only the Danger of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
the guilt of Injustice, Hatred and
Malice would ensue; but also the Peace of
the World would be wholly over-turned;
Mankind would be involved in continual
War; while he who were first injured car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
his Revenge beyond the limits of a
just Punishment, and the excess of that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
being a real Injury, Entitles the
other to a fresh Revenge. I might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
insist upon the reasonableness of the
Divine Prohibition of revenge to Man, from
the advantage which it brings to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Peace and Order of the
World; were it not an Argument too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
to be employed in Conjunction
with the former.</p>
            <p>To return therefore to the former Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
since the Justice of all Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
consists in the Parity of it to the
guilt of the Crime committed; and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
of Passion, to which humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is incident, suffers not Men to observe
that Parity in execution of Revenge, and
not to observe it is a sin against God; as in
many other Respects, so in this also, that


<pb n="339" facs="tcp:34506:173"/>
it is a Violation of Justice; we ought to
esteem it a singular Benefit, that God
hath taken the Execution of revenge into
his own hands, and not left the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it to our Discretion; least it should
unavoidably expose us to the Danger of sin,
either in carrying it beyond its just Bounds,
or in executing it for other Reasons than
the Love of Justice or Hatred of sin.</p>
            <p>And to this Consideration the Apostle
seems to have had a peculiar regard, when
he citeth that passage of the Old Testament,
<hi>Vengeance is mine,</hi> &amp;c. which in the place
referred to, <hi>Deut.</hi> XXXII. 35. plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to this Matter. For there God hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
denounced to the Jews the Punishments
he would inflict on them, in Case of their
Apostacy from him, telleth them among
other things, that he would deliver them
into the hands of their Enemies, into the
power of strange Nations, who should ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize
over them, and mightily oppress
them, and therein become the Executioners
of those Punishments, which he designed to
their sins. Not that thereby their Tyranny
and Oppression should become the less un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
because subservient to the secret
purposes of God, to which they in oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Jews, had no regard, but only to
the satisfaction of their Hatred and other
Passions. And therefore this Oppression,
so far exceeding the Rules of Justice, God


<pb n="340" facs="tcp:34506:174"/>
in the 35th. Verse aforecited threatens, that
he will severely revenge upon them. And
accordingly in XXV. of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 12th. God
foretels the utmost Execution of his Wrath
upon <hi>Edom,</hi> for taking a too severe Revenge
of the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> altho' himself had
delivered them into their hands to be
plagued by them. So that if no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
disswaded us from the prosecution
of Revenge, if a moderate Revenge were
even permitted by God, yet the Difficulty
of observing moderation in it, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of incurring sin thereby, should deterr
us from it.</p>
            <p>Thus Men are made unfit to be entrusted
with the execution of Revenge, for that
they know not certainly the just Proportion
of the supposed Crime, and the Punishment
due to it; and altho' they were secured of
it, yet would rather consult the direction
of their own Passions than the Rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
Yet the Cause of revenge is still main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the World; and no wonder, when
it is supported by so many Passions, as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
Hatred, Malice, and the like.</p>
            <p>These indeed, to minds of more happy
Education, and nobler Thoughts, naturally
appear odious; and therefore such as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to a better Blood and greater Minds,
found their Practice of revenge upon a
Principle of Honour, to which they Fancy
all other Considerations ought to yield;


<pb n="341" facs="tcp:34506:174"/>
entertaining a vain Perswasion that this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
cannot consist with the patient indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Injuries, and that every Affront
unrevenged draws upon them the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Cowardize.</p>
            <p>An Opinion built upon false Notions of
Honour and Valour; and which far from
being an Argument of true Greatness of
Mind, manifests a real weakness in it.
For wherein is the Honour of Man to be
placed, but in such Perfections, as may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
his Faculties, adorn his Nature, and
promote his Happiness? If upon these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
he raiseth the favourable esteem of
other Men; his Honour is then truly
founded. If for other Reasons, which are
indeed no Perfections, he fancieth himself
to be admired, he betrays the weakness of
his Judgment, in that he prides himself in
the Admiration of others no less injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Such is, when Esteem is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Rashness or a precipitate Boldness, upon
Impatience of bearing the least Indignity,
and preferring this Resolution to all Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.
If this be a real Honour, then
such a passionate determination must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a perfection of Nature, an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Reason; but if that be too gross
to affirm, the pretence of Honour must be
laid aside.</p>
            <p>Nor yet can any Argument of Valour or
Greatness of Mind, be drawn from such a


<pb n="342" facs="tcp:34506:175"/>
Conduct. Valour indeed is such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Resolution of Mind, as cannot be
moved or over-turned by any external Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
cannot be interrupted by Fears and
Passions; and a Mind truly great is placed
above all such mean Resentments, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
scorns than fears the Attempts of other
Men. How then can he be said to make
good this Character, whom an Injury
shall torment and disquiet; whose Thoughts
may be ruffled, and his Passions raised at
the pleasure of any other; who by manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
so great a Concern in little matters,
betrays the Consciousness of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness
and imperfection, of the want
of real Worth and Happiness, which can
be so far impaired by Trifles and petty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
that without Revenge it cannot be
restored? In Truth there is no greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of an abject and mean Spirit, of
Cowardize and Imperfection of mind, than
that impatience, that fear and jealousie,
which always attends Revenge thus found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon mistaken Honour.</p>
            <p>But I do injury to the Cause I handle,
when I seek to recommend the Laws of
God concerning Revenge by an Argument
so far inferior to the weight of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
To Christians (and in this place
I presume my Speech doth reach no other)
it ought to be a sufficient Confutation of
the pretence of Honour in Revenge, that


<pb n="343" facs="tcp:34506:175"/>
our Lord hath forbidden the practice of it.
For since his Religion tends to advance the
Perfection of humane Nature, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
right Notions of all Moral Actions;
it is impossible that true Honour or Valour
should promote the exercise of Revenge
which he hath forbidden.</p>
            <p>The pretence of Honour in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Revenge is vain indeed, yet not so
Criminal as that other ordinary pretence
of satisfying Justice therein: When Men
prosecute their Revenge against others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of Zeal for Justice, and least the
guilt of any sin should escape unpunished.
This those are wont to alledge in defence
of their Revenge, whose Revenge is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a Principle of Malice, not of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
Honour. To Confess openly that
they take Revenge, because they hate their
Neighbours, would be too shameless an
Acknowledgment of their own baseness;
and might also overthrow those Artifices,
by which such Men commonly work their
Revenge. For which they strain their
Wits to find out plausible Pretences for the
visible Effects of their secret Malice; assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Cause of all to be their Love of
Justice, of their Religion, or of their
Countrey. And such is the Credulity
of Mankind, that these Pretences seldom
want Success, covering the Malice and
Rancor of a canker'd Soul; and giving


<pb n="344" facs="tcp:34506:176"/>
the most easie and secure Opportunities of
Revenge.</p>
            <p>All are apt to censure and condemn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
when proceeding from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of false Honour, which was before
mentioned; because the Motive of it is not
and cannot be dissembled; yet in Truth
this sort of Revenge is infinitely less Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
than the former arising from Hatred
and Malice, however dissembled, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
to it self more specious Names.
This is formed by a violent Commotion of
Mind, which lasteth not many hours; but
that by an hardned Malice, which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
secretly for many years together. This
is commonly effected in the heat of Blood,
when the Soul hath scarce time to recollect
it self or command the unruly Passions of
the Body; but that is raised and carried
on by deliberate thought and resolution,
which is the utmost Aggravation that any
sin can receive. This may sometime fall
even upon a good Man, who through the
heat of Passion, and from a violent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
of receiving unworthy Injuries,
may suddenly be betrayed to the Desire or
the Execution of Revenge; but of the other
a good Man can never be guilty, since it is
impossible that Hatred and Malice, which
are habitual sins, should consist with the
least degree of Goodness.</p>
            <p>In all habitual sins the Mind cannot but


<pb n="345" facs="tcp:34506:176"/>
many times reflect upon its own Diseases,
and be as often convinced of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of those Vices, which it nourisheth.
The Divine Prohibition of those sins often
recurs to the Memory, and the Soul cannot
but be conscious of her own Diseases; yet
in spight of all these Considerations the
Man resolveth to retain his Hatred and
Malice towards others. And in this Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
is encouraged from the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that these sins (being close and secret)
will consist with the pretence of Sanctity,
and may be serviceable to him in his base
Designs against his Neighbours.</p>
            <p>And of this sort are all the sins of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites;
fixed and determinate Resolutions
of persevering in opposition to the Laws of
God; and still making use of his glorious
Name to carry on private Designs. No
wonder then, that in Scripture the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Punishments are still denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Hypocrites; since theirs are all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
sins, such as Oppression, Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Injustice, Lying, Slandering, Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
Hatred, and Malice, all sins of the
most enormous Guilt, and heightened by
this farther Consideration, that the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pretences of Piety, Religion, and Zeal
are made use of to execute the several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of them.</p>
            <p>Particularly in the Case of malicious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
nothing is more ordinary than to


<pb n="346" facs="tcp:34506:177"/>
pretend a zealous Concern for the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Evil doers, as if they would sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the defect of the Divine Justice, or of
the Laws of their Countrey, and punish
the Guilt of sins, for which God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
provided no Punishment in this
Life, reserving it to another. Yet often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the sins of others, which these Men
would pretend to punish, are indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but opposition to their Humours,
Fancies, and Designs; it being in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of some Men an unpardonable Crime
to be of a contrary or another Party; to
have crossed or opposed a Design of the
others, altho' never so unreasonable; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to have once performed their Duty
without Partiality and corrupt Favour to
others, when the Laws of their Countrey
did require it. Certainly if the Guilt of
sins is to be measured from the Evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of them; such malicious Revenge
will be found the greatest of all sins: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Cause and occasion of publick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamites,
over-turning the Peace and Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of whole Nations, and bringing them
to Destruction.</p>
            <p>Great and numerous Societies of Men,
such as this Nation is, cannot easily be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
without intestine Divisions; and
such are always the effect of malicious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
In this manner we shall find almost
all the great Societies of the World to have


<pb n="347" facs="tcp:34506:177"/>
been broken, when they have divided into
two or more Parties, and those continually
practising upon each other, under Pretence
of preserving the religious or civil Rights
of the Countrey against the Invasion of the
other; and as each prevail, employing their
Interest and Power not to the upholding of
the Religion or Laws, but to the ruin or
vexation of the others.</p>
            <p>I will not apply this to our own Nation,
or bring any Instance from our Times, least
I should be thought to engage in any Party:
But if we call to mind the History of the
Jews, we shall find many Examples of such
malicious Revenge covered under such spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pretences.</p>
            <p>Thus when the Jewish Magistrates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to take away our Saviour's Life;
they put on a mighty shew of Zeal for the
publick Service, and accused him to the
Roman Governour, as an Enemy unto <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar:</hi>
Although themselves indeed cared so
little for <hi>Cesar,</hi> that they had at that very
time formed the design of a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against him, as appeared short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after. And when this Rebellion broke
out, and the People unanimously attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to cast off the Roman Yoke and recover
their ancient Liberty; the most bloody and
wicked part of them, took upon them the
name of Zealots, and under pretence of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Concern for the publick Interest,


<pb n="348" facs="tcp:34506:178"/>
and punishing the secret Favourers and
Friends of the Romans, murdered or rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
every Man his private Enemy; and
by this Division made way to the Arms of
the Romans, who without this advantage
could not easily have overcome that popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and resolute Nation.</p>
            <p>These Considerations ought to divert
Men from a resolved Prosecution of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
and much more those Arguments,
which might be drawn from the Scope or
Design of the Christian Religion might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this Effect, if we could perswade our
selves, that Men did in earnest believe the
Truth of it and submit to it. But when
almost every Man pleads an Exemption
from the Obligation of it in all Commands,
which oppose his peculiar Passions; when
little beside the Pretence of it is left among
us, and even that pretence continued, not
out of any Reverence to Religion, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is serviceable to Secular and mean
Designs, we cannot but despair of prevailing
with the greater part of Men therein. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we must declare, that nothing is more
contrary to the Spirit and Design of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
than to study Revenge, to continue
Hatred and Animosity without end, and
never to forget and forgive an Injury. Such
a Conduct is directly opposite to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Example of our Lord; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
covered with specious Colours of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful


<pb n="349" facs="tcp:34506:178"/>
Zeal, or Purity, or Affection to any
Party, will be no less damnable in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
than Idolatry in a Heathen.</p>
            <p>Lastly, If neither the Reason of the
thing, nor the Divine Prohibition, nor the
regard of publick Security concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
nor the direct opposition of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to it, can draw Men from the Love of
Revenge; yet at least it cannot be denied,
that the assurance of God in the latter part
of the Text, <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will repay,</hi>
hath taken from them that common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
before mentioned, of Zeal for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of Justice; least if Revenge should
not be inflicted, the Guilt of any sin should
escape unpunished.</p>
            <p>This therefore God hath fully provided
for; who as he is the supreme Lord of all,
and Judge of the whole World, cannot be
supposed to fall so far in the Distribution
of Justice, as to permit any sin to pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>observed
by him, neither expiated by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
nor attended with Punishment;
and hath moreover obliged himself by
Promise to revenge the Injuries offered to
his faithful Servants; and that (as our Lord
saith) he will do, <hi>although he bears long with
them,</hi> Luk. XVIII. 25.</p>
            <p>It would be unreasonable to expect that
his Punishments should always be inflicted
on the unjust Aggressor in this Life; nor
hath he promised any such thing. The place


<pb n="350" facs="tcp:34506:179"/>
in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> referred to in the Text, in
the Original runs thus: <hi>To me belongeth
Vengeance or Recompence in time,</hi> or to be
executed in due time. It cannot be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that his Punishments should always
immediately follow the Commission of
every Crime or Injury, unless we desire the
World should be in a manner dispeopled
and become a Theatre of dreadful Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
It is sufficient, that he hath ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
secured us from the more disquieting
Injuries of unjust Men, by the Commission
which he hath given to the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to revenge them in his stead. And
if he should fail in the Execution of his
entrusted Office; we are not so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as singly to deserve an extraordinary
Interposition of Providence in behalf of us.
If we desire this Revenge should be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
yet farther, and should punish in this
Life, and for our Sakes even the Guilt of
Injuries offered to us; we manifest an inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Disposition of Mind, delighting in
the Miseries of other Men.</p>
            <p>God hath promised indeed as a benefit
to his faithful Servants, that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the Injuries offered to them. But
if this Revenge be taken in this Life; the
benefit consisteth not in the Pleasure arising
from the suffering of Enemies, but either in
the Enjoyment of temporal Peace secured
thereby, or in the perswasion which good


<pb n="351" facs="tcp:34506:179"/>
Men may thence conceive, that they are
beloved by God. If the Revenge be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in another Life, the benefit consisteth
wholly in the latter. For far be it from the
Spirits of good Men now in Heaven, who
were injured by bad Men when alive, to take
delight in the Torments of the Damned,
because they were once their Enemies; and
far be it from us to enhance the Joys of
Heaven by such unworthy Considerations.
Complacency in the Sufferings of other
Men, which is to be found in all Revenge
properly so called, can find no place in
Heaven; and that it may find no place on
Barth, may this Discourse conduce.</p>

            <p>HOW Glorious the Resurrection of our
Lord was, which we this day Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate,
how undeniable at that time, how
powerful an assurance of all his precedent
Promises and Revelations, what effect it had
both in the Mind of his Disciples and his
Crucifiers, how effectually it demonstrated
to the whole World, the Divinity both of
his Mission and his Person; as the whole
Series of their Actions immediately subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to it do demonstrate, so this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
made by them in the Text doth evince.
They, who before had fled upon his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,


<pb n="353" facs="tcp:34506:180"/>
had lost all their hopes at his
Crucifixion, had either denied or forsaken
him; who began to doubt whether <hi>it were
he that should have redeemed Israel,</hi> and gave
up all for lost, resumed their Courage and
their Faith at the news and assurance of his
Resurrection. They now saw that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wrought, which before they had even
ceased to hope for. The most incredulous
of them could now say to him, <hi>My Lord and
my God;</hi> nor did they henceforward admit
any doubt of those glorious Promises, of
which they had herein received so great a
Testimony. They feared not to profess
their belief in him openly, to Arraign the
Impiety of the Jews in Crucifying an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Person, and him, no other than their
own Messias, <hi>the Lord of Life,</hi> to denounce
to them the certainty of their Destruction
without belief in him; not only to testifie
his Resurrection in that great Concourse
of the Jews met together at the Feast of
Pentecost, but also to declare it impossible
that he should not have risen again; as

            <p>1. The words assure us of the Truth of
Christ's Resurrection: a Truth both well
known to the Apostles, who did then
relate it, and attested by <hi>many infallible
proofs,</hi> as it is in the foregoing Chapter,
Verse 3. so that it could not be denied by
those who should only hear it. Let us take
a view of these Proofs, both for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of our Faith, and to amplifie the
Glory of that Mystery, to the Memory of
which this day is Sacred.</p>
            <p>In relating then the Resurrection of our
Lord, the Holy Penmen have been very
exact in relating all the Circumstances and
the Proofs of it; manifesting that he was
really dead after his Crucifixion, and as
truly alive again after his Resurrection;
that this was known to his Enemies, as
well as his Disciples; and attested from
Heaven by the Ministry of Angels, and by
God himself. In a matter of so great
Concern it was necessary that all the Points
of it should be clearly proved, and none
remain liable to the least Exception.</p>
            <p>In the first place, it was required that
assurance should be given of his having
been really dead. An Article which is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expressed in the Creed, the common
Profession of our Faith; wherein we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
him <hi>to have been dead and buried, and


<pb n="355" facs="tcp:34506:181"/>
to have descended into Hell;</hi> that his Soul
was truly separated from his Body; the
places being therein assigned, wherein each
were contained from the time of his Burial
to that of his Resurrection. His Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in the Grave. His Soul was in the
state of other separated Souls, <hi>in Hell;</hi>
whether we understand thereby, either the
ordinary Condition of departed Souls, or
the place of damned Souls. I will not now
engage in that Controversie, it is sufficient
to say, That either Opinion placeth his
Soul in that interval of time among other
Souls separated from the Body.</p>
            <p>That the Soul of Christ was thus truly
separated, appeareth from the concurrent
Judgment of his Enemies, as well as Friends
at that time. The Soldiers sent to break
his Legs while hanging on the Cross, that
so they might hasten his Death, whom
they supposed not yet to have expired,
found him <hi>already dead. Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi>
and the devout Women which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, taking him down from the Cross,
laid him in his Grave, being well assured
that he was then Dead. His Disciples,
who if any shew of Reason might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
would not easily believe <hi>him</hi> dead,
from whom they then expected a temporal
Kingdom, yet were so far perswaded of it,
that at his first appearing to them, they
were affrighted, and <hi>supposed they had seen a


<pb n="356" facs="tcp:34506:182"/>
Spirit.</hi> To these Proofs nothing more could
be added to Evince the reality of his Death;
an Evidence, which is wanting to all the
Relations of Men raised from the Dead, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by the Heathens to the Resurrection
of our Lord. They alledged from <hi>Plato</hi>
the Story of <hi>Eris</hi> lying for many days
among the dead Bodies, and after that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
Life again; and pretended that
<hi>Apollonius Tyaneus,</hi> whom they set up in
opposition to Christ, had raised a certain
Person to Life. But the first was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by any, for more than a thousand
years after the Fact was pretended to be
done; and in the second Case, the Heathen
Historian confesseth, that he dare not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that the Person was truly Dead.</p>
            <p>Nor after his Resurrection was it less
evident, that Christ was truly alive, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
with Soul and Body. All the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Life, and Arguments of a real Body
met in his. He was seen by a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his Disciples, who judged it to be
such. He eat and drank with them, which
proved his Body not to have been a meer
Phantasm or Aerial Apparition. He talked
and <hi>reasoned with them out of the Scriptures,</hi>
which demonstrated that Body to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with a rational Soul. He appealed
to their Sense of feeling, commanded them
to <hi>handle</hi> him; said to unbelieving <hi>Thomas,
reach hither thy finger and behold my hands,


<pb n="357" facs="tcp:34506:182"/>
and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into
my side,</hi> which manifests that the Body
which he then offered to that Tryal, was
that very Body which had suffered on the
Cross, and still retained the Print of the
Nails, and the Impression of the Spear.
That this same Body and Soul reunited,
was also joyned to the Divinity, as before
his Passion, appeared from his many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
wrought after his Resurrection.</p>
            <p>Thus we have a true, proper and real
Resurrection. And that all these things
were so, we have the Testimony, first of
his own Disciples; the Faith of whom,
although so nearly related to him, cannot
be called in question, since they laid down
their Lives in Confirmation of it: Nor can
it be imagined that any Men should die
for the Testimony of what they knew to
be false. Of these the pious Women were
first Blessed with the sight of him; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were in Reward of their maintaining
their Love and Fidelity to him, when his
Apostles had forsaken him; or that they
came into the Garden where the Sepulchre
was, immediately after the Resurrection,
and before he was yet departed out of it.
They saw him, knew him, and saluted him,
<hi>held him by the feet and worshipt him.</hi> The
Apostles being advertised of it by them,
hasted to see their Master, and received not
only a transient view of him, but conversed


<pb n="358" facs="tcp:34506:183"/>
with him <hi>for forty days together,</hi> and <hi>by many
infallible proofs</hi> were assured of the truth of
it. Afterwards <hi>he appeared to more than five
hundred at once;</hi> and at last ascended up to
Heaven in the presence of them all.</p>
            <p>To the witness of Friends, we will add
the Testimony of his Enemies, which in
all Cases is allowed to be of great weight.
The Soldiers who were employed by the
Jews to watch his Sepulchre, plainly saw
the Effects of Divine Power, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
his Resurrection, although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
astonished and confounded at such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
Prodigies, they did not well perceive
it, or perhaps were not suffered by their
Fears to stay, till Christ should proceed out
of the Sepulchre. They felt the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
which removed the stone rolled to
the mouth of the Sepulchre, <hi>they saw the
countenance of an Angel like lightning, and
his raiment white as snow,</hi> upon which <hi>they
did shake and became as dead Men,</hi> and coming
into the City <hi>shewed to the chief Priests all
the things that were done,</hi> as we read, Matth.
XXVIII. II.</p>
            <p>The Angels and heavenly Hosts had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
joyned with Men in celebrating the
Nativity of Christ, and they here concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in witnessing his Resurrection. The
Women coming to the Sepulchre betimes in
the Morning, presently after the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and looking for the Body of their


<pb n="359" facs="tcp:34506:183"/>
beloved Lord in the Sepulchre, found there
<hi>two Angels in white, sitting one at the head, the
other at the feet, where the Body of Jesus had
lain, who said to them, why seek ye the dead
among the living? he is not here, he is risen,
come see the place where the Lord lay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, If we should imagine both his
Friends and Enemies, the report of Sense
oft-times repeated, to have been deceived
in the Opinion of his Resurrection, God
hath been pleased to confirm the Truth of
it, and to set his Seal to it. This he hath
done not only by his Holy Spirit comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
enabling, and encouraging the Apostles
in Preaching the Mystery of Christ's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furrection,
but also in confirming their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
with concurrent Miracles. As it is,
Acts IV. 33. <hi>With great power gave the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
witness of the Resurrection of the Lord
Jesus.</hi> They openly affirmed it upon their
own Knowledge, and then in Proof of the
truth of their Affirmation wrought Signs and
Miracles; which to the Spectators did as
fully evince the Truth of the Relation, as if
they had seen it done with their own Eyes;
since it was impossible, that God should
exert his omnipotent Power, in working
Miracles for the Attestation of a Lye.
Thus much for the reality. I proceed in
the second place to the</p>
            <p>II. Manner of the Resurrection, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in those words, <hi>having loosed the pains of


<pb n="360" facs="tcp:34506:184"/>
death,</hi> which are variously interpreted; some
maintaining that they imply only a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from Death, and rescue from the
Grave; others that they point out the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
Sufferings by which our Lord was
brought to the Grave, and raising him up
to a state opposite to that Humiliation; a
third sort understanding by them a Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Power and Dominion of Death.
All these Opinions are supported with great
Reasons; nor will it here be proper to enter
into a strict Examination which of them
rather is to be embraced. They are all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
Consonant to the Design of the
Apostle, and Significative of the manner
of Christ's Resurrection. I will therefore
apply them all.</p>
            <p>The first Opinion includeth only a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from Death, that is, a reunion of
Soul and Body separated by Death. In
which Sense it chiefly referreth to the
words of <hi>David,</hi> and the Promises made
to him, here alledged by the Apostle. <hi>David</hi>
had been often brought by his Enemies into
extreme danger of Death, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
expresseth by the same or the like
words, as Psal. XVIII. 4. <hi>The sorrows of
death compassed me,</hi> and Verse 5. <hi>The sorrows
of hell compassed me about,</hi> and Psal. CXVI.
3. <hi>The sorrows of death compassed me, the
pains of Hell gat hold upon me.</hi> Yet trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Promises of God, amidst all these


<pb n="361" facs="tcp:34506:184"/>
Calamities he rested assured of Deliverance,
and expresseth his Confidence of it in the
words cited by the Apostle in the following
Verses, <hi>My flesh shall rest in hope; because
thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt
thou suffer thine holy one to see Corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a Matter at that time received, and
on all hands granted by the Jews, that <hi>David</hi>
was a Type of the Messias; that his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Sufferings, and Deliverance prefigured
the Office, the Death, and Resurrection of
Christ, who should descend from him; and
particularly the Apostle sheweth, how this
Passage was much more evidently and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
fulfilled in Christ than in <hi>David.</hi>
He indeed was delivered from his Enemies
and died in Peace; yet die he did, and after
Death <hi>his soul was left in hell,</hi> that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Dead, or in the place of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Souls; <hi>and his Body did see Corruption,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been buried many hundred years. But
as for Christ he died indeed, yet <hi>his soul was
not left in hell, neither did his Body see Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>
His Soul was presently reunited
to the Body, and even during the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not left by the Divine Nature, which
still continued to be joyned to it; neither
was his Body corrupted, but raised up and
united to the Soul in less than forty hours,
in which time the Bodies of deceased Men
are wont to be corrupted.</p>
            <p>According to the second Interpretation,


<pb n="362" facs="tcp:34506:185"/>
Christ was raised from a painful Death to
an opposite State, to a condition of Glory,
Happiness, Power, and Immortality. The
Sufferings of our Lord so lively described
to us in the Holy Offices of the last week
we cannot forget, and over all these he
eminently triumphed in his Resurrection
upon this day. He was then made subject
to Death, but is now become <hi>the Lord of
life,</hi> and set above the reach of Death.
<hi>For Christ being raised from the Dead, dieth
no more; Death hath no more Dominion over
him,</hi> Rom. VI. 9. He then bore the wrath
of God for the sake of Man. He now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseth
the Favours of God granted to
Men. He was then subjected to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of Sinners, to the Will of his
own Creatures, appeared as the vilest of
Men, suffered as a Malefactor; he is now
entred upon his Kingdom, raised above the
Earth, <hi>seated at the right hand of God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and Authorities, and Powers being made
subject unto him,</hi> 1 Pet. III. 22.</p>
            <p>The words explained in their third Sense
infer the overthrow of the Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of Death, effected by the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Christ. The whole Design of our
Lords Incarnation, of his Death, Burial and
Resurrection was, as it is expressed, Hebr.
II. 14. <hi>That he might destroy him that had
the power of Death, that is the Devil.</hi> To do
this all the parts of his Life contributed.


<pb n="363" facs="tcp:34506:185"/>
He converted Sinners from the Error of
their way. He confuted the Mistakes of the
seduced World. He founded a Church
wherein open Enmity should be professed
to the Devil. He took upon himself the
guilt of Death, due to the sins of Men, and
all this Dispensation he gloriously finished
in his Resurrection. Therein he literally
<hi>broke the bonds of Death, he led Captivity
Captive,</hi> baffled the opposition, and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed
over all the Assaults of the Devil, who
had vainly imagined, that by procuring the
ever Blessed Jesus to be given up into the
hands of wicked Men, he had put an end
to the Salvation of Mankind. But to our
eternal Happiness, and to the Glory of our
Redeemer, his Designs and Attempts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
that very end which he so much
dreaded; he knew not that it was <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
counsel and foreknowledge of God,</hi>
as it is in the precedent Verse, that Christ
should <hi>both die and rise again</hi> to perfect our
Salvation; that he was for a while to be
subject to Death, but that <hi>it was impossible he
should be holden of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. This was the third thing proposed
to Discourse of, that it was not possible
that Christ should continue in the state of
Death. The Apostle foundeth the <hi>impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility</hi>
of it in this place, upon the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of God to the contrary; so that
here, <hi>it was not possible,</hi> is no more than it


<pb n="364" facs="tcp:34506:186"/>
was not Consonant to the decree of God;
it was not fit, just, or convenient; as it is
said, Matth. IX. <hi>It is not possible for the
Children of the Bride-Chamber to mourn, as
long as the Bridegroom is with them;</hi> that is,
it is not fit or convenient. In this Sense
then I shall consider it; and</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It was not possible</hi> or convenient, <hi>that
Christ should be holden of death,</hi> because he
was both God and Man; the Divine was
united to his Humane Nature. It would
have appeared surprizing to our Reason,
and been an Argument of little affection
of God to Mankind, if he should have
suffered that very Body, which had the
Honour to be joyned to his own Nature,
wherein <hi>the fullness of the Godhead dwelled
bodily,</hi> to continue in Hell, in the common
state of Mortality, or <hi>to see Corruption. It
was not possible</hi> that the Divinity should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that Nature to be corrupted, or lye
neglected among the Dead; to which it
self continued to be united even in the
Grave. This we of the Catholick Church
do believe; and if any should oppose this
wonderful Union of the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature in the person of Christ, his
very Resurrection will convince their Error.
For to raise a dead Body to Life again,
must be allowed to be no less than the
work of Omnipotence, that it can be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by God alone. Yet it appeareth from


<pb n="365" facs="tcp:34506:186"/>
the express words of Scripture, that Christ
had Power to raise up his own Body. He
saith of himself to the Jews, John II. 19.
<hi>Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will
raise it up: Speaking of the Temple of his
Body,</hi> as the Evangelist subjoyns. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
John X. 18. <hi>No Man taketh my Life
from me, but I lay it down of my self. I
have power to lay it down, and I have power
to take it again.</hi> Our Lord, who came into
the World to do the Will of his Father,
and to glorifie him, would never have
claimed this Power, had it not been inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in himself. He therefore by his own
Power reunited his Soul to his Body. I
mean not in Exclusion to the other persons
of the Blessed Trinity, who all concurred
therein. For Power being an essential At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
of the Divine Nature continueth
undivided in the Persons of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is no Objection against the Truth of
this, that the Father is said in many places
of the New Testament to have raised up
his Son; since he is the chief Person in that
Blessed Trinity, by whose Power the Soul
of Christ was rejoyned to the Body.</p>
            <p>2. Christ was the Author of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Founder of a revealed Religion;
and therefore <hi>it was not possible,</hi> not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<hi>he should be holden of death.</hi> The
Resurrection of Christ was to be the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
and chief Proof of the Divinity of


<pb n="366" facs="tcp:34506:187"/>
his Mission, and Authority of his Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
so clear a Testimony, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Man should not be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Evidence thereof. To this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he at all times refers, as to the last and
greatest Proof of his Mission. This was
the only Sign which he would give to the
Jews demanding a Miracle in Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Authority, <hi>that as</hi> Jonas <hi>was three
days and three nights in the Belly of the Whale,
so the Son of Man should be three days and
three nights in the heart of the Earth.</hi> Upon
this he had fixed the Expectation of his
Disciples, and of all his Hearers; and by
this he was to set the Truth of his Doctrine,
and the Divinity of his Person, beyond all
Contradiction.</p>
            <p>Had he left his Body in the Grave af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all these Assurances, the Jews might
have insulted over his Disciples with as
much Reason, as Christians do over the
Followers of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who promised to
rise again after a Thousand years; little
imagining that his Name or Religion should
continue so long in the World; although
now after more than a Thousand years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
the Impostor still lieth in Hell. Had
<hi>Christ not risen again,</hi> the Apostle confesseth,
1 Cor. XV. 14. <hi>Their preaching had been
vain, and your faith also vain.</hi> But when
so illustrious a Testimony of Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
hath intervened; when Heaven it self


<pb n="367" facs="tcp:34506:187"/>
hath declared it so eminently; to deny As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
would be <hi>to fight against God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jews, in the most violent Execution
of their Hatred and Malice, engaged <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on him, if he would come down from the
Cross and save himself.</hi> It had been no less
easie for our Blessed Lord to have descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Cross, than to have ascended
from the Grave. But first the Design of
his Sufferings did not permit it, since he
was to lay down his Life as an Expiatory
Sacrifice for the Sins of the World; and
then he would not suffer the Exercise
of Divine Power manifested in restoring
himself to Life, to Labour under any doubts.
Had he descended from the Cross before
he died, he could not have attoned for the
Guilt of our sin. Had he descended im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after his Death, it would have
been pretended that he had not died; yet
even this they would have Confessed to
be miraculous, but perhaps referred the
Cause of it, as they did his former Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
not to a Divine Power, but to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Operation. Whereas this Pretence did
wholly vanish in the Miracle of his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
Since no Magick or Diabolick
Power remaineth after Death.</p>
            <p>In short, so great was the Evidence of the
Divinity of Christ arising from his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
so undeniable the Fact, and so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant,
that the Apostles in all their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons


<pb n="368" facs="tcp:34506:188"/>
imployed this as the chief Argument
of Conviction: And when they chose <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi>
to the Apostleship, described his Office
to be no other, than <hi>to witness the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
of Christ.</p>
            <p>God had more than once before his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion,
declared him by Voices from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
by constant Miracles to be his Son;
yet so far is the Evidence of this inferiour to
that Proceeding from his Resurrection, that
he is in many places said to have then adopted
Christ for his Son, because he then eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared to him be so. As Acts XIII. 33.
<hi>The Promise made unto the Fathers God hath
fulfilled, in that he hath raised up Jesus again,</hi>
as it is in the Psalm, II. <hi>Thou art my Son,
this day have I begotten thee.</hi> And Rom. I. 4.
<hi>Jesus Christ our Lord declared to be the Son
of God with Power, by the Resurrection from
the dead.</hi> He was from all Eternity his
Son as to his Divine Nature, he was from
the Incarnation his Son as to his Humane
Nature, but the Truth of this appeared to
the World chiefly in his Resurrection.</p>
            <p>3. By the Resurrection of Christ we are
assured chiefly that we also shall rise again;
and therefore, it was not convenient <hi>that
he should be holden of Death.</hi> Christ had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to his Disciples, That <hi>where he was,
there they should be also.</hi> When he therefore
rose from the Dead, and ascended into an
incorruptible State of Glory, they then


<pb n="369" facs="tcp:34506:188"/>
raised their Hopes, and conceived full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Immortality. Till then, Mankind
had found by long Experience that there
was no Redemption from the Grave; and
by this alone could be convinced, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Nature was capable of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
or that God would vouchsafe to
confer it on them. They might perceive
in the Person of Christ the Dissolution of
Death, the Capacity of their Nature, and
the Favour of God; and then considering
their own Relation to Christ, might hope
to partake of the same Happiness. Christ
is the Head of his Church, and what more
natural than for the Members to follow
their Head? He was <hi>by his Resurrection</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<hi>to be the Son of God;</hi> and himself
hath often promised that his faithful Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
should be Co-heirs with him. He
is called <hi>the first born from the Dead, the
first fruits of the Resurrection;</hi> which being
accepted by God, Entitled the whole Mass,
the whole race of Mankind, to the same
Favour.</p>
            <p>Only it is required, and that justly, if
that we desire to follow him in his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
we must also imitate him in his
Death. For so the Promise runs in the
whole VI. Chapter of the Epistle to the
<hi>Romans.</hi> For <hi>if we have been planted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the likeness of his Death, we shall be
also in the likeness of his Resurrection.</hi> If


<pb n="370" facs="tcp:34506:189"/>
we crucifie our Sin, as it is there expressed,
if we as fully forsake all vicious Habits, as
he who dieth is bereaved of vital Actions;
if farther, we imitate the Death of Christ
in the Perfection of it, that <hi>as he died but
once, but liveth for ever; so we</hi> henceforward
be <hi>dead unto sin, but alive unto righteousness,</hi>
then we may reasonably assure our selves,
that we shall follow the Example of him
the forerunner in our Resurrection, which
we have so nearly expressed in our Death;
we are then truly Members of himself the
Head, <hi>being made conformable to his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi>
we are sanctified by the gracious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
and raising up of him, <hi>the first
fruits of them that slept,</hi> while we inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
continue our Relation to him. Others
indeed were before him raised from Dead to
Life, as those raised by <hi>Elijah, Elishah,</hi> and by
Christ before and at his Crucifixion. But
these were all to die again, and so thereby
gave no assurance of immortality to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
It was Christ alone, <hi>who being raised
from the dead, dieth no more,</hi> who in behalf
of Mankind hath taken Possession of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
which he hath acquired for us,
and will communicate to us, unless we chuse
rather to imitate the imperfect Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those mortal Men before mentioned,
that is, unless we rise from Sin to die
again.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the Justice of God, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable


<pb n="371" facs="tcp:34506:189"/>
Humility and Patience of
Christ manifested in his Sufferings, rendred
<hi>it not possible,</hi> not fit <hi>that he should be holden of
Death.</hi> He died not for his own but for the
Sins of others; and to demonstrate that his
own Guilt drew not that Punishment upon
him, it was agreeable to the Justice of
God to raise him up, to relieve the Cause of
oppressed Innocence, and not suffer his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors
any longer to triumph in their
wickedness. Further, by his exact Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
by his inimitable Patience in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Pains, and his admirable Humility
in undergoing the Shame of the Cross, he
did deserve to be raised up, that as he had
humbled himself in so extraordinary a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
so he should be exalted to a no less
illustrious Glory. And therefore the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
and Humility of Christ are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assigned as the meritorious Cause of his
Exaltation. It was long before Prophesied
of him, Psal. CX. 7. <hi>He shall drink of the
brook in the way, therefore shall he lift up his
head.</hi> And after his Passion and Ascension
it is said of him by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Philip. II.
<hi>He humbled himself, and became obedient to
death, even the deash of the Cross. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God also hath highly exalted him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first step of his Exaltation was his
Resurrection; which therefore was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to both those parts of his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which had undergone that meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous


<pb n="372" facs="tcp:34506:190"/>
Humiliation. Not only his Soul had
suffered Agonies <hi>and the Contradiction of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi>
had resigned it self intirely into the
hands of God, and submitted quietly to the
Execution of that bitter Sentence, which
was inflicted on him as the Representative
of sinful Men; had endured the Shame of
the Cross, the insults of his Enemies, a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Separation from the Body with invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Patience and Charity: But also his
Body had partaken in his Agony, had sweat
drops of Blood, had endured Scourgings
and Buffettings, Crucifixion, and the wound
of the Spear. Both Soul and Body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were to share in the Reward of all
these Sufferings, which began to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on him in his Resurrection. His
Body was to be raised from the Grave; and
his Soul, being in no other Sense capable
of Resurrection, was to be reunited to the
Body, and both to continue for ever joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
since by his Death and Resurrection he
is become the Mediator of a new and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Covenant.</p>
            <p>Thus I have passed through the several
parts of the Text: and from the whole I
shall make but one Inference, proper to
the Solemnity of this day. If the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Christ be the great and ultimate
Confirmation of the Christian Religion;
that upon which our Faith is founded,
our hopes are raised; that by which the


<pb n="373" facs="tcp:34506:190"/>
Mystery of our Redemption is compleated,
the Author of it Crowned and advanced
to be the Head of all the faithful who look
for the same Resurrection; it becomes us
to celebrate this Festival Dedicated to the
Memory of it with a suitable Religion.</p>
            <p>We are not to account it an Arbitrary
institution, or the invention of the Church,
that this day is accounted Sacred beyond
all others of the Year. Our Lord hath
made it so, by rising from the Dead, and
compleating the Redemption of Mankind
on it. No revealed Religion was yet ever
professed in the World, which did not ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
some certain and solemn Festivals at
fixed times of the year; and to cast off the
publick Solemnization of those Festivals,
upon which the most illustrious Acts of the
Life of our Saviour were performed, is no
other, than in Fact to deny all belief in
him, and relation to him. It is not enough
to say that he hath declared, he will be
<hi>worshipped in Spirit and Truth.</hi> He was
himself then going up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
a solemn Festival, when he spake
those words. And surely unless there be
solemn times and places of worshipping
him <hi>in Spirit and Truth,</hi> it will never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that he is so worshipped; nor is he
worshipped in <hi>Truth,</hi> when Men pay no
external Acknowledgments of those emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Benefits, which he hath truly obtained

            <p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:34506:191"/>
Himself hath consecrated this day by
his rising from the Grave on it. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
have Dedicated it to this sacred Use,
by their own, and by Divine Authority.
The Jews had before celebrated one day
in seven, in Recognition of their adoring
that God, who had created the World in
Six days, and rested on the Seventh; and
that Seventh day which they celebrated
rather than any other of the Week, was
sanctified in Memory of their Deliverance
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> wrought upon that day, as
it is, Deut. V. 15. <hi>Remember that thou wast
a Servant in the Land of Egypt; and that
the Lord thy God brought thee out thence by a
mighty hand and by a stretched out arm.
Therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee
to keep the Sabbath day.</hi> As the Jews there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dated their Seventh day for ever from
that day of their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt;</hi>
so the Apostles began, and the Church hath
to this day continued to date their Seventh
day from the day upon which their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
was compleated. A Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so far greater than that given to the Jews
from the Bondage of <hi>Egypt;</hi> that well
might the day instituted in remembrance
of their Deliverance, give way to the day
celebrated in Honour of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>This change therefore was made by the
Apostles immediately upon the Resurrection


<pb n="375" facs="tcp:34506:191"/>
of our Lord, and even before his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and so no doubt by his personal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and Approbation. For all the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Assemblies we find of them, both before
and after his Ascension, were upon <hi>the first
day of the Week.</hi> That so, as the Jews ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
their belief in God the Creator
of the World, by celebrating one day in
seven; and manifested their Worship of
that God, who brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
by Solemnizing for ever that Seventh day,
in which he brought them out: So we
Christians should declare, that we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the same God the Creator of the
World, by celebrating one day in seven;
and also manifest that we worship him in
and through Jesus Christ, by Sanctifying
for ever that Seventh day, upon which the
great and last Act of our Redemption
wrought by him was performed, which
is therefore in Scripture called <hi>the Lords
Day,</hi> Rev. I. 10.</p>
            <p>Farther, as the particular Day of the
weekly Festival of the Jews was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
wrought upon the Seventh day; so the
far greatest of their Annual Solemnities
was instituted in Commemoration of that
Deliverance effected in the first Month of
the year. This God did institute by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Command, which was at large repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb n="376" facs="tcp:34506:192"/>
to you in the first Lesson of this day:
And exacted the Observation of it with so
great Rigour, that he declared, <hi>That Soul
which did not keep this annual Feast should
be cut off from</hi> Israel. And can we imagine
that God should require such eminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Testimonies of Gratitude from the
Jews, for Deliverance from a temporal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Bondage; and leave us without any
Obligation of rendring publick and solemn
Honour to him for freeing us from a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and eternal Slavery? The Redemption
wrought by Christ, is to us what the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was to the Jews. The
Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> instituted in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the Completion of that Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is to us what the Feast of the Passover
was to them, appointed in Memory of
their Deliverance. <hi>Christ is our Passover,</hi> as
we heard this Morning from 1 Cor. V.
<hi>Let us therefore keep the Feast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Determination of our Christian Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals
is to be taken from the most illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Actions of Christ our Redeemer; and
when they are determined, they are to be
celebrated with no less Religion than were
the Festivals of the Jews; nay rather with
greater Expressions of Joy, Gratitude and
Devotion, because they Commemorate far
greater Benefits. That this Festival there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was particularly instituted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,


<pb n="377" facs="tcp:34506:192"/>
those words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely
intimate, but the Practice of the
universal Church immediately after their
times, do most evidently manifest it. Scarce
was St. <hi>John,</hi> the last Liver of the Apostles,
Dead, when the Eastern and Western
Churches began to divide about the time
of Solemnizing <hi>Easter;</hi> not whether it
should be solemnized, but whether it should
be a fixed or a moveable Feast, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
for their own Custom as for an
essential Point of Religon; in that indeed
straining a Circumstance too far, but clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proving thereby, that the solemn Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of <hi>Easter</hi> was then by all Christians
accounted an essential Institution of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
in that they esteemed it unlawful to
vary the least Circumstance formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Observation of it.</p>
            <p>And as this Festival hath succeeded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the Jewish Passover, which did
prefigure the whole Mystery of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
so the due manner of our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of it was typified by the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
prescribed by God to them, in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Paschal Lamb. As they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to remove all Leaven out of their
Houses; so we are to <hi>put away the Leaven of
Malice and Wickedness,</hi> in the words of
St. <hi>Paul.</hi> As they then sung Hymns of
Thanksgiving to God for their Deliverance


<pb n="378" facs="tcp:34506:193"/>
out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> so we ought to give Praise
and Glory to God for consummating our
Redemption by the Resurrection of our
Lord upon this day. As they eat the
Paschal Lamb with bitter Herbs, in a
Habit and Posture expressing their readiness
to go out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with great Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of rejoycing and mutual Kindness: So
we should receive the Elements of Bread
and Wine, representing the Sacrifice of
Christ the Lamb of God, once offered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cross for the sins of the whole
World, (which is the chief and most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Act of our Worship to be paid upon
this day,) with a bitter Repentance and
Sorrow for past sins; with a stedfast reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
upon the Promises of God, with a
perfect Submission to his Will, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to go wherever he shall lead us; with
a sincere Charity towards one another, and
to all the Members of Mankind for whom
Christ died, that is, for all Men without
Exception; and with the most intense
Thanksgiving that our Souls can form, for
all the Benefits of our Redemption; but
more particularly for raising to Life, as
upon this day, him, who <hi>died for our sins, and
rose again for our Justification.</hi> So by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
Celebrating here on Earth the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the glorious Resurrection of our
Lord, we shall obtain to be hereafter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted


<pb n="379" facs="tcp:34506:193"/>
to follow the Example of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and share in the Glory which
he now enjoys in Heaven. <hi>Which God of
his infinite Mercy grant, for the sake of him
who died and rose again, our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ; to whom with the
Father, &amp;c.</hi>

Exhortation to the Practice of it to
be found in Scripture; we ought to be
well instructed in the Nature, the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Conditions of it. To effect
this was the chief Intention of the Apostle
in this whole Chapter, in which this Verse
being more comprehensive than the rest,


<pb n="381" facs="tcp:34506:194"/>
I have chosen it for the Subject of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Discourse of Prayer. In it the
words easily direct me to insist on these
Four Heads.
<list>
                  <item>I. The Duty of Prayer, <hi>I will that Men
pray.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. The Place of it, <hi>Every where.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. The posture of Prayer, <hi>Lifting up
their hands.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV. The Conditions required to make
it acceptable and effectual, <hi>Lifting up holy
hands without wrath and doubting.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. The Duty of Prayer is expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the first words: <hi>I will,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To inforce the Authority of which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Apostle saith in the former Verse,
that he was <hi>ordained a Preacher, an Apostle and
Teacher of the Gentiles,</hi> acted herein by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Commission. And surely it was no
light Matter, when the Apostle, whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
was long since received in all the
Churches founded by him, thought fit to
produce his Commission, before he imposed
the Command; a Command, not first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
by him, but often repeated by
our Lord himself, who taught his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
a Form of Prayer, and injoyned them
<hi>to watch and pray.</hi> But since none (as I
suppose) will dispute the Command, or
deny the Authority of it; it will be of
more advantage to shew the reasonableness
and the use of Prayer: Which I proceed
to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:34506:195"/>
First then, Prayer is the principal Act of
Adoration paid by Man to God, and upon
that account becomes necessary to us. Man
being the Creature of God, at first produced
out of nothing by his Almighty Power,
and afterward all his Life long depending
on his Providence, and maintained by him,
oweth to God all that Service, which he
is capable to pay; and that is no other, than
to adore his Majesty, to acknowledge his
Power, to celebrate his Praises, to admire
his infinite Perfections, in all things to own
his dependence on him, to profess himself
the Creature, the Servant, the Subject of
God, and to behave himself as such.</p>
            <p>This is all, which Man can pay to God
for those infinite Benefits, which he hath
received from him: God hath no Interests
of his own to be promoted by us. The
Infinity of his Nature hath set him beyond
all want of external Aids, and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all increase of Happiness; even that
Glory, which he receiveth from our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
is of no advantage to him; yet is it
not the less required of us, since it declares
our Conviction of that Gratitude, Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Obedience, which are due to his
Benefits and his Power; that Honour, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Reverence, which belong to the
infinite perfection of his Nature.</p>
            <p>Adoration then consists as well in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
and reverencing the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons


<pb n="383" facs="tcp:34506:195"/>
of the Divine Nature absolutely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
as in professing our Subjection to
God, considered as the Author of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all those Benefits, which we either
do already enjoy, or hope hereafter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
In both these Respects Prayer is
the most natural and significant manner of
Adoration. For by it we profess our Wants,
of which we desire relief: We thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
our selves finite and imperfect Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
We proclaim our selves the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants
of God, from whom we beg the
Supply of our Wants: we confess our
Belief of his All-sufficiency, from whom
we expect the relief of all our Necessities;
of his infinite Goodness, whence we raise
our Hopes that he will grant our Petitions;
of his Almighty Power, by which we are
assured that he can effect our Desires. All
these Acknowledgments are necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in all Petitions for supply of Wants,
which are the most ordinary subject of
Prayer. For he who addresseth himself to
another for the relief of any Wants, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
confesseth there is somewhat wanting
to his own Perfection; that the Person to
whom he maketh this Address, is not only
in being, (for otherwise all address to him
would be frivolous) but also able to relieve
him. If in all Cases and Wants he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
himself to that Remedy, he plainly
supposeth that Being, from whence he


<pb n="384" facs="tcp:34506:196"/>
hopeth relief, to be All-sufficient, and the
Fountain of all Good.</p>
            <p>In Confessions of sin, and Supplications
of pardon, which among Persons especially
professing revealed Religions are wont to
constitute no small part of Prayer; the
Power and Government of God, and the
subjection of Man to him is more eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acknowledged. For from whence can
this Confession and intreaty of Pardon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
but from a Sense, that every sin is a
violation of that Subjection, which is due
to God; that the Sinner is hereby subject to
the execution of the Divine Revenge, and
that it will certainly follow, unless it be
averted by obtaining of Pardon? Further
it supposeth God to be indued with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Goodness and Mercy; otherwise all such
Intreaties would be but vain; since it can
be no less than an infinite Mercy, which can
Pardon an offence against an infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.
In both Cases, and in all other
Forms of Prayer Man owneth himself to
be the Creature and Dependant of God,
even by making Application to him.</p>
            <p>But that which chiefly manifests that
Conviction which all Supplicants have of
the Majesty and infinity of God, is that
they direct their Prayers to him, altho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
and with the same assurance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heard in all places. Whence they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
declare, that they believe God to be


<pb n="385" facs="tcp:34506:196"/>
Omnipresent, and to know all things.
And since the natural reason of Men tells
them, that none but God possesses those
Perfections, they thereby testifie their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
that he to whom they direct their
Prayers, is no other than God; that he is
endued with all possible Perfections, that he
is the supreme Lord of all, and extendeth
the influences and efficacy of his Attributes,
such as Power, Knowledge, Goodness and
the like, to all places at the same time; that
is, that he is Omnipresent.</p>
            <p>And this alone, if nothing else were to
be considered, will make all manner of
Prayer to be a true and proper Act of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
such as is due to none but God; nor
can be paid to any Being, without suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it to possess truly the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
that is, without supposing it to be
truly God. For it is unreasonable to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that any Man directing his Prayers
to any Being, should not believe at the same
time that he is heard by it; nor do any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to it. They who address their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to Saints and Angels, acknowledge
themselves to believe that they are heard
by them: Which since it cannot be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
beleiving at the same time that they
know all things, and are present in all
places; Attributes peculiar to God alone;
it cannot be avoided, but that in praying
to them they must be supposed to own


<pb n="386" facs="tcp:34506:197"/>
them to be so many Gods, and every Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a true and proper Act of Divine Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
given to them. Justly therefore
doth the Psalmist say, <hi>Thou that hearest
the Prayers, unto thee shall all flesh come.</hi>
Thou only, O God, hearest the Prayers of
Men; therefore to thee only shall they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
their Prayers.</p>
            <p>Thus Prayer, in the very Nature of it,
is an Act of Adoration, and an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of the infinite Perfections of God,
and our dependance on him, altho' no such
explicit Acknowledgment be made in it.
This will be more evident, if we consider
the general Form of Prayers received in
all Ages, and in all Religions. Not only
in the Christian Religion, and in those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Forms of Prayer, of which the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
of our Church is composed, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all Nations, among the Jews and
Heathens, Men have been wont in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of their Prayers, at least in some
part of them, to confess the Authority of
God, and their own Subjection to him, and
more especially to magnifie those Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
the benefit of which they then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored.</p>
            <p>If they desired Pardon, they magnified
the Greatness of his Mercy, and the guilt
of their own Sins committed in contempt
of his Authority. If they begged extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Relief and Assistance in any Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,


<pb n="387" facs="tcp:34506:197"/>
they declared their Opinion of his
unlimited Power and Goodness; if in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
any Favours, they confessed at the
same time their dependance on him.</p>
            <p>Nor is it easie to find, either in the Old
Testament, or in the Writings of Heathens,
(in both which a great number of Prayers
is to be found), any, wherein such express
words of Adoration are omitted. The first
formal Prayer which we find in the Old
Testament, is that of <hi>Abraham</hi> in Gen.
XVIII. for the Deliverance of <hi>Sodom</hi> from
the Destruction intended by God. And
therein the Supplicant doth more than
once acknowledge his own unworthiness,
and the Power and Justice of God; that
himself was but <hi>dust and ashes;</hi> that God
was <hi>the Judge of the whole earth,</hi> and could
not Act any otherwise than justly. The
Prayers of the Heathens generally began
with what in our Language is, <hi>O Almighty
God, and O most merciful God.</hi> And that most
excellent Form of Prayer, which our Lord
gave his Disciples, and intended as well
for a Pattern, as for a Form to us, both
beginneth and endeth with an express Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of God. In the beginning we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
him to be our Father, the Author of
our Life and Fountain of our Happiness;
that he dwells in the highest Heavens, and
from thence doth govern the Earth. In the
end we profess, that to him belongeth <hi>the


<pb n="388" facs="tcp:34506:198"/>
Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, for ever
and ever;</hi> that he is the supreme Governor
of the World, and of all Mankind; that
he possesses infinite Power; that Glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to him, and ought to be rendred to
him; that all these Perfections are eternal
in him.</p>
            <p>Further, if every Supplicant to God doth
therein by consequence adore him, and all
received Forms of Prayer do expresly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
an Act and Confession of Worship,
much more doth a fervent and devout
Soul, which prayeth to God in the most
perfect and excellent manner, truly adore
him at the same time. For he who prayeth,
as he ought to pray, doth at the same time
submit himself to the Divine Will, with the
most absolute Complacency and Subjection
which his Soul can Form; conceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be so far the Creature, that he is <hi>as
nothing in respect of God;</hi> as such, wholly
devotes himself to him, and depends not
only upon his Power for the execution of
his Desire, but also upon his good Pleasure
for the Grant, and upon his Wisdom for the
convenience of it: In imitation of our Lord,
who, in his admirable Transport of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Garden, committed his request
to the Will of God, with an intire Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And all this put together is the
most intense Act of Adoration, which Man
can pay to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:34506:198"/>
Add to this, that humble posture of
Body, which Men of all Ages and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have been wont to use in Prayer; and
it will appear, that Prayer is in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
a compleat Act of Worship. Men
have differed indeed as to the particular
Posture, some using Prostration, others
stretching out the Hands, and most Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but in this all have agreed, that that
Posture was to be employed, which might
best denote the Subjection of the Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
to God. But the farther Consideration
of this belongs to the third Head proposed.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole it is manifest, that Prayer
is the most natural, and most expressive
Act of Worship. And if so, the same ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
which we before shew to lye upon
us of adoring God, will also require us to
offer up Prayers to him. And as our Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to God, and other Reasons, for which
we owe Adoration to him, always continue
the same, and equally oblige a Man in every
part of his Life; so Prayer for the same
Reasons ought to be continually addressed
to him, altho' we have many times no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Wants which we desire to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by him.</p>
            <p>Prayer as an Act of Worship, is a Debt
at all times due to God, and as such is also
founded upon eternal Reasons which admit
no change. Our dependance upon God
always continueth the same; the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite


<pb n="390" facs="tcp:34506:199"/>
Perfections are invariably possessed by
him; the same Relation between God and
Man persists unalterable. Adoration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is in almost all Cases to be formed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same Conceptions, to be raised by
the same Considerations, to be founded
upon the same Reasons, to consist in the
same Operations of Soul and Body. So
that altho' it be repeated in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ten thousand times, it is no more than
what is the Duty of Man to do, no more
than what is reasonable; and a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ational
Man can no more alter the Thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Adoration is founded, than he
can the eternal Causes, upon which those
Thoughts are raised. No wonder then,
that in all well constituted Churches the
publick Forms of Prayer, whereby Men
worship God, always continue the same,
are over and over again repeated every day,
oft-times a day; and that for many Ages
together. For it cannot be denied, that
we owe Worship to God every day, every
part of the day; altho' the Necessities of
Life require, that not all but some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
fixed times be employed in it. This
Worship is to proceed upon the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
In adoring God we confess our selves
his Creatures, we acknowledge his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority, we implore his Mercy,
we sollicit his Goodness. When we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him a second time, the same Thoughts


<pb n="391" facs="tcp:34506:199"/>
return; if a third time, 'tis but the renewal
of the same Conceptions. What then can
be more reasonable, than that the words of
Prayer, which we employ in this Act of
Adoration, should always continue the
same?</p>
            <p>It is therefore a most unreasonable Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
against set Forms of Prayer, that in
them the same words are repeated again
and again every day. For is not God to be
worshipped again and again? Are not his
infinite Attributes deserving Adoration, the
same yesterday, to day and for ever? Can
our Conceptions be really changed, while
the Object remains the same? Have these
Persons discovered new Perfections in God,
or new Foundations of Worship, since the
last Act of it? Do they believe, that God
continually affects new Complements and
new Harangues; that there is any Vertue
in the words themselves, or any Magical
force in the Variation of them? That were
to espouse the very grossest Error of the
Heathens, which our Lord reprehendeth
in the VI. of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> who placed the
Efficacy of their Prayers not in the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Heart, but in the Vertue and
multitude of their words.</p>
            <p>Yet cannot this Error be avoided by
those, who cry up the necessity of extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore
Prayer, or frequent change in it.</p>
            <p>For since the Internal Conceptions of the


<pb n="392" facs="tcp:34506:200"/>
Mind in the Act of Adoration, being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the eternal Attributes of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
continue the same; to what Purpose
is any change in the external words, unless
there be some secret Vertue in the words
themselves? If they pretend, that this
change more effectually promotes the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
of the Hearer; it is so far from true,
that it rendreth all true Devotion absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impossible to the Hearers. For in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Prayer before unknown and unheard
of, even an understanding Man, and of
quick Apprehension can do no more than
singly examine every Sentence of the Prayer
he heareth, whether he may safely joyn in
it; least perhaps any Blasphemy, or Folly,
or Indecency should be contained in it. As
soon as one Sentence is thus examined, a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Presents it self, and then a third; so that
an intelligent Auditor, attending only to
examine by parts the Prayer he heareth,
hath no leisure to pray to God, or in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to adore him. And if the Devotion of
a knowing Man be thus defeated, an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
of lower Capacities will never be able
to form in his Mind such a rational Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as becometh the Soul of Man, and will
wholly employ himself in diverting his
Fancy with some new and surprizing Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and expecting what next shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>Whereas in set and known Forms of


<pb n="393" facs="tcp:34506:200"/>
Prayer, the devout Hearer is before assured of
the Lawfulness and Decency of the Prayer;
and his Mind, being at rest upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
attends wholly to form all those
Acts of Devotion and Worship in the Soul,
which the words of the Prayer express:
and therein receiveth extraordinary As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
in that the Mind being accustomed
to that Form of Prayer, hath through long
use formed noble Conceptions of God upon
the hearing of some words, and raised intense
Affections upon others; conceived an hearty
Sorrow of sin upon these, and been excited
to a most profound Reverence of God by
the hearing of those words. The Soul ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
affixed all these Thoughts and Acts to
those several Words and Sentences of the
received Form of Prayer, the same affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and thoughts will easily recur as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as the words of the Prayer are repeated,
and immediately create a real Devotion in
the Soul, which hath by frequent hearing
and Meditation of those words fully attained
the whole Scope of them, and long since
received deep Impressions from them. By
this Benefit, the devout Members of the
Church, are enabled and directed to put
themselves in a certain method of Devotion
and Worship; which mightily facilitates
their Conceptions, removes their Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and leaves them free to attend to that
alone, on which they are then employed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="394" facs="tcp:34506:201"/>
This alone ought to recommend the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Prayer, and frequency of it to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that it makes up the principal part
of the positive Worship of God. Yet this
Consideration will perhaps be more perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
that it produceth great Advantages and
Benefits to Men; which are so amplified in
Scripture; by the many Promises of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to devout Supplicants whatsoever they
shall desire, by the frequent Examples of
the wonderful Deliverances and Benefits
obtained by Prayer; that 'tis almost impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
the Duty should be neglected by any,
who are not either devoid of Faith, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardless
of their own Interest.</p>
            <p>It is not only Promised by Christ, That
<hi>whatsoever Men shall ask in his name, shall be
given to them;</hi> That <hi>if they have Faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
which they desire <hi>shall be impossible to
them;</hi> That <hi>the door shall be open to them
that knock; That the effectual fervent Prayer
of a righteous Man availeth much,</hi> even to
obtain more than is included in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and general Promises of God, as is
there illustrated by Examples: But God
hath also been pleased to represent himself
as labouring under the ordinary Passions
and Infirmities of Men, who often Grant
what they had not designed, to avoid the
restless importunity of the Petitioner;
that so no Sense of his own unworthiness
might discourage Man from applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self


<pb n="395" facs="tcp:34506:201"/>
to God by Prayer. Thus <hi>Luk.</hi> XI. our
Lord describeth God under the Parable of
an Housholder, who altho' he would not
lend to his Neighbour upon the account of
Friendship, yet did it to satisfie <hi>his Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</hi>
And <hi>Luk.</hi> XVIII. he resembleth
God to <hi>an unjust Judge,</hi> who altho' he
would not do Justice to the poor Widow
for Justice sake, as <hi>who neither feared God,
nor regarded Man,</hi> yet did it to be rid of her
troublesome Importunity.</p>
            <p>These Representations may perhaps ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
surprizing, it being unaccountable, that
God should dispense his Favours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect to the Merits of the Petitioners,
and impossible that he should fall under any
Temptations common to Man. Yet if we
look a little nearer, we shall find this whole
Conduct agreeable to the Justice and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God. God indeed bestows not any
Favours but upon the worthy Receivers.
He hath affixed certain Conditions to all his
Gifts, and will not separate them in favour
of any one. He ever giveth Judgment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Merits of Causes, and is
deaf to the Prayers of wicked Men, yet
granteth many Petitions to the Importunity
of the Petitioners, which without that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
would never have been obtained.</p>
            <p>For he who prayeth importunately to
God, doth thereby qualifie himself for his
Favour; since it cannot easily be conceived,


<pb n="396" facs="tcp:34506:202"/>
that any Man should address himself by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and fervent Prayer to God, and not at
the same time purge his Conscience from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Sin, which may obstruct the Grant of
his Desire. And herein his Care will be no
less intense, than is his Desire of what he
then requesteth. His very addressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to God, manifests that he believeth him
to be the Fountain of all Good, that he is
convinced of his Power and Goodness, that
he depends upon him, and founds the hopes
of his Happiness in his Favour. If the
Prayer be often repeated, as is always in
Cases of Importunity, the Soul doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
contract an habit of Piety, of thinking
upon God, and submitting to his Power,
of fearing him, and depending on him.
And when Man by the use of Prayer is
brought to this Disposition, no wonder that
God should then grant to him what at first
he was unworthy of, and then indulge to
him the Rewards of the Faithful, since
he is now become as one of the Faithful.
Thus Prayer hath a natural Efficacy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Mind of Man, to expel Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Infidelity and the contempt of God,
and to introduce all those Vertues, which
will at last give a just Claim of Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to him.</p>
            <p>Man, by presenting himself to God in
Prayer, doth accustom his Mind to just
Conceptions of his Power, his Goodness


<pb n="397" facs="tcp:34506:202"/>
and his Command over us; doth imprint
therein an awful regard of his Majesty.
After many Resolutions formed and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Prayer, she findeth the very inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Will changed: What at first he
did but coldly desire, after many Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on the worth of it he vehemently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
what at first he was but lightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of, after many Professions he is
fully convinced of; what in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
was but a weak impression of Mind,
after frequent Iteration of the same thoughts
becometh a well fixed Habit. It must be
an unnatural sort of Perverseness, which
dares to invoke the name of God in Prayer,
to confess therein his Justice, Power and
Omnipresence, and yet immediately Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
them all; which can desire the Favour
of God by frequent Petitions, and yet oppose
him by constant Rebellions. The Minds
of very few Persons are capable of such
monstrous wickedness. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Prayer is not only a Duty of Men
already pious and religious, but also an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
method to make Men such; which
when it is once performed, they then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
qualified to receive the Benefit of all
those illustrious Promises, which are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to Prayer.</p>
            <p>Thus much of Prayer in general. I now
proceed to apply all this to publick Prayer,
for that was the principal design of St. <hi>Paul</hi>


               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:34506:203"/>
in this place. This whole Epistle is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a Bishop, a Governor of the Church,
and is almost wholly taken up in prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rules of external Worship and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter then, the Apostle giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
direction for publick Prayer; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by his opposing the Form of Prayer
he there commanded, to that in use among
the Jews, in those words. <hi>I will that Men
pray every where,</hi> or more literally, in every
place. The publick and solemn Worship of
the Jews was affixed to the Temple at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
The publick Worship of Christians
was to be celebrated equally in all places,
that is, in all parts of the World wherever
Christianity prevails, God being equally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in all Congregations of devout Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <p>Had the Apostle here spoken of private
Prayer, the opposition of it to the Jewish
manner of Prayer had been frivolous and
also false. For the Jews did believe and
maintain no less than himself, that private
Prayer both might and ought to be offered
up equally in all places. Besides in the very
next Verse the Apostle giveth rules for the
Dress of Women, in which they were to
appear in the publick Place of Worship, that
is, in the Church. All which put it beyond
all doubt; that St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth in this place
treat of the publick worship of God, and


<pb n="399" facs="tcp:34506:203"/>
of publick Prayer to be used in Churches.</p>
            <p>In the first place then, if all Prayer be
an Act of Worship, publick Prayer is more
eminently so. The intention of private
Prayer is in the first place to obtain Supplies
to the wants of the Petitioner, and then to
worship God. Whereas in publick Prayer,
on the contrary, the worship of God is the
chief design, and the supply of Necessities
but a Secondary intention. So that to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the use of publick Prayer, and pray
only in private, is for Man to worship God
only in Subordination to his own designs.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, that publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Prayer do far more effectually tend
to the Honour and Glory of God; when
Men do openly, and in the hearing of all
others, confess their Subjection to God, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
his Benefits, deprecate his Anger, and
acknowledge their own unworthiness. This
is truly and properly to give Glory to God.
Whereas he who confineth his Devotion to
a Closet, may perhaps be allowed to have
a just Esteem of the Divine Benefits, but
seems ashamed to confess so much to other
Men; that he is the Creature of God as
well as others, that he equally depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, that he hath also violated his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and wants his Mercy. The Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
therefore upon the receiving of great
and eminent Benefits is wont to affirm, that
he <hi>will praise God in the Congregation,</hi> as well


<pb n="400" facs="tcp:34506:204"/>
knowing, that such a publick acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them did far more contribute to the
Honour of God, and was also more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to him.</p>
            <p>It is not enough to say, that God receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no increase of Honour from our Praises:
For neither doth he receive any such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
from private Worship; yet it
would be impious to say, that the worship
of God is not the Duty of Man. But by
publick worship Men do more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifest their gratitude to God, and the
Sense which they have of his Benefits, and
their own Obligation, than by private
Prayer and Adoration. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the former is more acceptable to God,
who delights in the good of his Creatures,
which good can be no otherwise procured
or maintained, but by an exact discharge
of their Duty, one part of which is a just
return of Gratitude and Worship to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>God receiveth not increase of Honour
from the Praises of Angels, any more than
from those of Men. Yet all the Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which we find of Heaven, represent
them, as incessantly singing Praises to their
great Creator: Who not content to retain a
reverent Conception of the Divine Majesty
in their own thoughts, communicate them
to each other, and publish them to the
whole World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:34506:204"/>
And indeed to what purpose can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that God should both under the Old
and the New Testament, found Churches,
that is, separate Societies of Men, united by
certain Laws, and under one common Form
of worship; if it be not the Duty of all the
Members of those Churches to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at certain times and places, and adore
him by one common Form? If God had
intended to rest satisfied with private Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
in vain did he contrive and found
Churches by wonders of Providence, as he
hath that both of the Jews and Christians; in
vain hath he given to them particular Laws,
and annexed many Priviledges and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to the whole Society, and to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it as such.</p>
            <p>Under the Old Law he required <hi>every
Male to appear before him</hi> in the publick
Place of worship <hi>three times in the year,</hi> and
commanded publick Worship to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
paid to himself in daily Sacrifices.
Yet as he declared, altho' he cared not for
ten thousand Bullocks, nor for Rivers of
Oyl, he would not remit the Duty; and
adjoyned Rewards to it, because it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
declared the Subjection of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Sacrificers to himself.</p>
            <p>In these publick Forms of worship in the
Jewish Temple, our Lord while one Earth,
constantly gave his Attendance at appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
times. After his Ascension and the


<pb n="402" facs="tcp:34506:205"/>
Gift of the Holy Ghost, the Apostles (as
we find in the III. of the <hi>Acts</hi>) frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Temple at the usual hours of Prayer,
and joyned in the common Forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
there made use of, altho' by the Operation
of the Holy Ghost, then received by them,
they could have poured out <hi>Extempore</hi> far
more excellent and devout Prayers than
those received in the Temple, which were
of humane Composition.</p>
            <p>If then God so strictly exacted the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of publick Worship in all times; if
Christ and his Apostles so exactly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it; if for this very Purpose God hath
gathered and united a Church, under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Laws, and the hopes of a common
Reward; what account can they make,
who either lay aside all publick Worship as
superfluous, or decry the daily Sacrifice of
prayer and praise to God offered up in the
Church; or when themselves meet once a
week to worship God, place the Religion
of the day in hearing a Sermon, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
no part of Worship, but only an Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to, and direction how to worship God?</p>
            <p>In the next place, as the Obligation of
publick Prayer is greater than that of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;
so the Promises made to the one are
far greater than to the other. Our Lord
hath promised, <hi>That wheresoever two or three
shall be gathered together in his name,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
there shall be an Assembly of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians


<pb n="403" facs="tcp:34506:205"/>
joyned together to offer up Prayer
and to worship God, <hi>he will be in the
midst of them:</hi> He will watch over them
with his Providence, he will own them as
Members of his Body, he will excite and
render effectual their Devotion by the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Holy Spirit, he will intercede
with God for the Grant of their Petitions.
And how effectual must those Prayers be,
wherein our Lord himself concurrs? Or
what doubt can remain of the acceptance
of our Worship, and the grant of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
when he is present with us?</p>
            <p>All the glorious Promises of Assistance,
Pardon, Favour and Protection, which were
anciently made to the Jews worshipping
God at the Temple in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> are now tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
to the Christian Churches. The only
difference is, that whereas among them the
publick worship of God was confined to
one place; in the Christian Religion, which
was given not to one Family or Nation
but to the whole World, the same Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is made common to all places of
publick Worship in all parts of the World,
wherever Christianity doth prevail. To
Worship offered up from publick places
alone, the Promises of the greater and more
illustrious Blessings of God are annexed.
And no wonder; since by this alone the
publick Religion of any Nation doth appear,
by this alone the publick Honour of God is
maintained in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:34506:206"/>
While the Tabernacle made by <hi>Moses,</hi>
and afterwards the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
stood, while daily Sacrifices and Worship
were performed therein; it was an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
Evidence, that the Jews worshipped
the true God, that he was their God, and
they his people. When the people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
forsook the publick Worship, thought
it sufficient to perform the Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
at home, to worship God <hi>upon every
high Hill, and under every green tree;</hi>
there then remained no farther Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the publick Belief or Religion
of the Nation. While therefore Worship
was duly paid by them in the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God, all the Promises, Blessings
and Rewards mentioned in the Jewish Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
took place; they enjoyed Peace, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
and abundance; their Sins were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated;
their Petitions granted; no publick
Calamity did attend them.</p>
            <p>When this publick Worship was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by them, God was no longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
by Promise to protect them: Since
they did not now any longer appear to be
his People, the only Evidence of which
was publick Worship. All this doth fully
appear from the whole History of the Old
Testament, where we find the publick
Prosperity or Misery of the Jews to depend
upon the regular Observation or general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission
of publick Worship.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:34506:206"/>
In like manner, and for the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the Christian Church, the more
eminent Promises and Benefits of God are
affixed to publick Worship; since by this
alone the Honour of God is preserved and
maintained among us. If Men should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselves to worship God in Private,
and proceed no farther, it could never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
what Religion any Nation professeth,
what God they worship. No publick Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
could be said to be paid by that Nation
to him; and consequently no National Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
could be expected. But when in any
Countrey, places are solemnly Dedicated
to the true God, when in them Divine
Worship is constantly paid, especially if
this Worship be daily renewed; if the
Body of the Nation joyn in the Profession
of the same Religion, in paying the same
Worship, as they have opportunity; then
such a Religion appears to be National;
then all those Expressions, so frequent in the
Old Testament, <hi>For my names sake, For my
Temples sake,</hi> and <hi>Least my name should be
blasphemed among the Heathen,</hi> will take place
among us.</p>
            <p>For Example, what greater Evidence can
there be of the Profession of Christianity
in this Nation<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> than that in this Sacred
place Prayer hath been daily offered up to
God, through Christ, for many Ages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Such Sacred places are the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="406" facs="tcp:34506:207"/>
Monuments, and the undeniable Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Piety and Devotion of any
Nation; by these we know that our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
worshipped the true God; and by
these our Posterity will know, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
the same Worship. By this the
Honour of God is chiefly kept up in any
Countrey; and since he hath affirmed, That
<hi>those who Honour him, he will Honour;</hi> then
only can we rationally presume to receive
from God publick and national Blessings,
while such a publick Worship is duly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
amongst us.</p>
            <p>Thus I have passed through the first
Branch of my Text, the Duty of Prayer.
The present time will not permit me to
proceed to the Consideration of the rest;
but give me leave to apply what hath been
already said.</p>
            <p>From hence it appears to be the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable
and constant Duty of Men
to worship God; that the best and most sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
way of worship is Prayer; that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayer best answers the end of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and is also most acceptable to God.
Such is the Duty of Man, and such are
the Reasons of it.</p>
            <p>Let us now look upon the general Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Christians, and more particularly
those of our own Communion, who are
better instructed, and have greater Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
in the exact Discharge of their Duty


<pb n="407" facs="tcp:34506:207"/>
than any other Society of Men. I would
not be so uncharitable as to affirm, yet I
much fear it, that great numbers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
never worship God in private; altho'
no Necessities of Life can be so urgent, as not
to permit every one to address himself daily
to God in that short Form of Prayer, which
our Lord taught us, (of those who have
more leisure, and Knowledge much more
is required.) But to pass to the publick
Worship of God, how few are there of
those which frequent it, who perform it
as they ought to do? Education Custom,
and the Laws of the Countrey, oblige
Men to cease from Labour upon those days
which are dedicated to the worship of
God; I wish I could add that the same
Considerations obliged them to frequent
duly the publick Place of worship upon
those days; but from them who do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
it, as many as have not given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up to Irreligion, we expect a true,
constant, and humble Devotion.</p>
            <p>But instead of that, we cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and deplore the great Negligence
and stupid Carelessness of many who are
present at the publick Prayers. Many sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
themselves to have discharged the
Duty of this day, if they have heard a
Sermon. Hence they are not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
if they enter after the Prayers are
begun, after the Confession is made, and


<pb n="408" facs="tcp:34506:208"/>
the Absolution pronounced by the Priest in
the name of God. When they are present
at them, they seem Irksome to them; They
joyn not in them; far from any Devotion
in the Soul, they will not be perswaded
to pay any Bodily Reverence; they refuse
to kneel, and some even presume to sit still
at the time of Prayer. We want that
cheerful Concurrence in the Congregation,
in which the ancient Christians so much
glorified, saying, that an <hi>Amen</hi> pronounced
by the whole multitude, was like <hi>a clap of
Thunder,</hi> which pierced Heaven. In our
Assemblies how small a part joyn in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
the common Forms of Confession,
Praise and Adoration of God; and not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vouchsafe to add an <hi>Amen</hi> to the end
of the several Prayers. Such is the State
of publick Devotion at this time, lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
indeed to be considered, but such as
cannot be denied. To such therefore let
me address my self.</p>
            <p>Do not you believe your selves equally
obliged to worship God with others? Were
not you also created by him, and still depend
upon him? Why then do you refuse to do
Homage to him, to profess publickly your
Subjection by such an humble Posture of
Body as may declare it? If an Heathen
should enter into our Churches, in the
time of Prayer, and examine our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(give me leave to put the Case, for


<pb n="409" facs="tcp:34506:208"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> before put it to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)</hi>
what would he say, when he should
behold some kneeling, the greater part
standing, and many perhaps s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>tting? He
could say no other, than that little De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
is observed in the religious Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of Christians; that in them many
Persons are present, but few of those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God; that the greater part express a
strange unconcernedness in a Lazy posture
of standing; and that some seem designedly
to affront the Majesty of God by sitting in
his immediate Presence, and when he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked.</p>
            <p>Let not these Reproaches any longer be
said of Christians, who want no means of
Instruction, and whose Religion teacheth
them the contrary. Assure your selves,
that it is not listning to a Sermon, which
can suffice; this is not to worship God,
but only to learn how to worship him,
and to be excited to it.</p>
            <p>The chief Design of your meeting in
this holy Place is, that you may worship
God herein. But how can you be said
to worship him, who place your selves
in no Posture of Worship, who express
no Concern at the words of publick Prayer,
joyn not in them, nor add an <hi>Amen</hi> to
them? Can you really believe standing or
sitting to be a posture of Worship? Or will
you not confess kneeling to be really the


<pb n="410" facs="tcp:34506:209"/>
most humble Posture? And if so, surely the
Creator of Heaven and Earth, the Lord
of Life and Death, is to be approached in
the most humble and most devout manner.
Be not ashamed to correct an ill Custom;
study to offer up to God a compleat Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to be present at the beginning of
Prayers, to attend diligently to them, to
joyn devoutly in them, to worship God
both with Body and Soul, since both were
created by him. So shall you truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God; so shall you Entitle your selves
to all those glorious Promises, which are
annexed to true Piety and Devotion, obtain
your Desires, and save your Souls.</p>

            <p>IN my last Discourse upon these words,

of this Duty from these two Con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
especially, that Prayer is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Act of Adoration, and the most essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
part of the positive Worship of God;
which being a Duty incumbent upon all
Men, and at all times, maketh the Duty
and the frequency of Prayer to be no less
necessary.</p>
            <p>In the Second place I laid open the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages


<pb n="412" facs="tcp:34506:210"/>
to be received from Prayer, and
the Promises annexed to it; that so if the
Sense of Duty could not engage, yet at

            <p>I then proceeded to apply all this to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayer, having first proved to you that
the Apostle in this place treateth of that
especially; and therein manifested how
much greater the Obligation is to publick
Prayer, how more expressive of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to God, what greater Advantages
it bringeth to devout Supplicants, and what
more noble Promises are annexed to it. It

            <p>I. The place of Prayer, the Apostle
teacheth to be <hi>every where;</hi> that is, not in all
places alike, but in all parts of the World,
wherever any Members of the Christian
Church are to be found. Herein he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth
the publick Worship of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
from that of the Jews; among whom
the more solemn parts of Divine Worship,
nay all the parts of the positive Worship
of God, instituted by himself, were affixed


<pb n="413" facs="tcp:34506:210"/>
to one certain place, where the Priests
daily offered Sacrifices, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the other Offices of Legal Worship;
and adult Males among the Jews thrice
every year gave their Attendance.</p>
            <p>This was both easie to the Jews, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the small Dimensions of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and also necessary to preserve them
from relapsing into Idolatry and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which would not have been avoided
in that stiff-necked People, had the publick
Worship of God been permitted to them in
many separate places, where the High Priest
had not the immediate over-sight of them;
as they did actually fall into Idolatry and
corrupted their Religion, whensoever quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> they began
to worship God <hi>upon every high Hill, and
under every green Tree.</hi> To this Temple
therefore, after the full Settlement of the
Jews in the promised Land, the publick
Worship of God was wholly affixed; out
of which it was not lawful to offer Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
nor was any Expiation of sin provided.
To it many glorious Promises were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated,
as that God would hear the Prayers
offered up in it, and be gracious to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for the sake of it.</p>
            <p>But in the Christian Religion, which was
not to be contained in one Family or Nation,
but to be propagated to all the Members of
Mankind; the Observation of this Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="414" facs="tcp:34506:211"/>
became both impossible and unnecessary,
and was therefore abolished by God. The
publick Worship of him was thenceforward
commanded to be alike celebrated in all
places, that is, in all parts of the Church.
His Presence was not confined, nor his
Promises annexed to one place; he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
present in all Congregations of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Believers, and receiveth their Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with equal Favour. Upon this account
the Apostle distinguishing the Christian
from the Jewish Worship, directeth pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers to be offered up <hi>every where;</hi> as
he had before distinguished it upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respect in the first Verse of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
there commanding <hi>that Supplications,
Prayers and Intercessions be made for all Men;</hi>
whereas the Jews never prayed for any but
those of their own Nation and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>This Enlargement of the place of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
could not indeed but be extremely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
to the Jews, who had been brought
up in a profound Veneration of the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to which
the publick Worship of the true God had
been now appropriated for near twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years. And therefore the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which from all Ages determined to
enlarge his limits of the Church, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into it as many of the Jews as by a
right use of their Reason should be brought


<pb n="415" facs="tcp:34506:211"/>
to believe in Christ, had, both by prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and subsequent Facts, provided abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
Reasons to convince the Jews, that
the publick Worship of himself should not
always be confined to the Temple of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
but after the coming of the Messias
should be extended into the whole Earth.
Thus <hi>Zeph.</hi> II. 11. it is foretold, That when
God should found the glorious Kingdom of
the Messias, then <hi>Men shall worship him every
one from his place, even all the Isles of the
Heathen.</hi> And in Mal. I. 11. <hi>For from the
rising of the Sun even unto the going down
of the same, my name shall be great among
the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall
be offered unto my name, and a pure offering;
for my name shall be great among the Heathen,
saith the Lord of hosts.</hi> Which Prophesies
did clearly instruct the Jews, that when the
Gentiles should be gathered into the Church,
that is, at the coming of the Messias, he
should be worshipped alike in all places of
the Earth; and even those Acts of publick
Worship which were more peculiar to the
Temple of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that is, Incense and
Sacrifice, should be then offered up <hi>from
the rising up of the Sun to the going down of
the same,</hi> although in a more spiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
This Doctrine and Institution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought not to have appeared strange
unto the Jews, whose Minds God had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the Reception of the Messias by
the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e and many other Prophesies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:34506:212"/>
After the actual Institution of the Christian
Religion he gave a more visible and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
Argument of his Pleasure herein;
an Argument which not only might have
convinced the Jews of those days, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerably
confutes their Infidelity to this
day, and grows more strong with time;
that is, the Destruction of the Temple at
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and thereupon the perpetual Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of the Legal Worship of the Jews,
contrived and effected by his Providence
not many years after the Ascension of
Christ, and as soon as the sound of the
Gospel was gone out into all parts of the
then known Gentile World. Which put
it past all doubt, that God intended to put
an end to the Jewish Dispensation, which
could no longer take place, than while that
Temple did exist, and continued in the
Possession of the Jews; in which the more
essential parts of it were necessarily to be
performed.</p>
            <p>Had God intended still to have obliged
the Jews to the practice of their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Worship in the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
he must also be supposed to have obliged
himself to continue the Existence and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of that Temple to them. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
indeed was once before destroyed, and
the Worship of it discontinued under the
Captivity of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But that was only
for one Generation, till that universal Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry


<pb n="417" facs="tcp:34506:212"/>
which had then corrupted the whole
Nation of the Jews, should be worn out;
and to preserve their Faith during that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption,
God foretold by his Prophets
that they should return again, <hi>and serve him
in that very place,</hi> fixed the number of years
in which this Restauration should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished,
<hi>in seventy years,</hi> and at that
time accordingly did perform it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this latter Destruction of the Temple
being without any Promise of Restitution;
and the Jews now kept from the Possession
of it for more than sixteen hundred years,
no Prophet in the mean while appearing
to Comfort, and keep up the external Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God among them, as was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
done during all the Captivity of
<hi>Babylon;</hi> it cannot but be concluded, that
they are no longer the peculiar People of
God; that the Divine Wisdom will not any
longer confine the publick Worship of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to one certain place; that by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
contriving the Destruction of that
Temple, he hath offered sufficient Reasons to
the Jews, that he would not any longer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
his Worship to their Temple, and
to us, that he heareth us alike in all parts of
the World, since he hath appointed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fixed place of Worship in the room
of it.</p>
            <p>And thus much in Proof of what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
advanceth in these words, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality


<pb n="418" facs="tcp:34506:213"/>
of the Divine Worship, as to the
place of it. A Doctrine necessary to be
inculcated and set in a clear Light at that
time, when the unbelieving Jews made it
a matter of great Offence; and even the
believing Jews were so hardly drawn from
that perswasion which they once received,
and which indeed once was true, that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Prayer were no where so accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God as in the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
that many of them continued to pay their
publick Worship in that place, even until
the final Destruction of it. Nor is this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Apostle without great use to
Christians of all Ages; encouraging them
to offer up Prayers with assurance of being
heard, giving them more noble and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
thoughts of the Worship and the
benefits of God, and a righter Notion of
the Nature of Prayer.</p>
            <p>The Encouragment ariseth from those
many Promises made by God to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that he would be there pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
Present, that he would hear the
Petitions of devout Supplicants presented
in it, that he would be gracious to the
whole Nation for the sake of it. Of all
these Promises he gave assurance not only
by the many Examples of Success attending
the Prayers of Men offered up therein,
which we read in the History of the Old
Testament; but also by those visible Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols


<pb n="419" facs="tcp:34506:213"/>
of his Presence which he placed in it,
such as were the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> the
glorious appearances of the Mercy-Seat,
the Fire consuming the Sacrifices, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which induced all who came to pay
their Worship at the Temple to address
themselves <hi>boldly to the throne of Grace,</hi> and
with assurance of Success; being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by those visible Symbols, and by the
often repeated Promises and Protestations
of God, that he was indeed there eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
present, and ready to bestow those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
in it, which in vain had been begged
in any other place.</p>
            <p>Under the Gospel, God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
publick places of Worship in all parts
of the Believing World; and to every one
of these hath transferred those same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of Favour and peculiar Presence,
which were once appropriated to the
Temple. The certainty of Success, the
advantages of Prayer are the same in both:
Only in the Christian Church the benefit is
more universal. Which serveth also to
raise the thoughts of Man in Relation to
the Worship and the benefits of God. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
was equally due to God from all the
Members of Mankind; but it was not
morally possible that all should worship
him in that single place. Yet at that time
was there no other place in the World,
where any revealed Promises of graciously


<pb n="420" facs="tcp:34506:214"/>
hearing the Prayers, and rewarding the
Devotions of Men were given.</p>
            <p>So that it easily appeared that the Jewish
Religion was calculated for a very small
part of Mankind, and that the Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence
was not yet displayed in its full
Lustre; in that God confined his Presence,
and appropriated his Promises to that place
alone. Whereas in founding a better and
more lasting Covenant under the Gospel,
he hath communicated the Promise and
blessed Effects of his peculiar Presence to all
true Worshippers of him, in all places and
at all times.</p>
            <p>It is now undeniably manifest, that his
Favour is founded in eternal Reasons of
Piety, Justice and Goodness, not in Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of Sects, or Parties, or Nations,
or Kindreds. All which raise a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Conception of the Nature of Religion,
and of the Wisdom, Justice and Beneficence
of God, the Author of it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it giveth to Men right Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Nature of Prayer; who while
the peculiar Presence of God was annexed to
one certain place, were prone to believe,
that not so much the Devotion or internal
Qualifications of the Supplicant, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the Prayer to God, as the place
from which it was offered up. That God
respected not so much the Fervour, Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Attention of the Mind, as the


<pb n="421" facs="tcp:34506:214"/>
Circumstances of place and time; or at least
that the latter was chiefly regarded by him.
But since the Promise of a kind Reception of
Prayer directed to him, is, by God under
the Gospel, alike granted to all places, it is
evident, that no external Circumstance is
so much respected, as the internal Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it, Faith and Submission, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Intention: That these he requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the first place, and the other only in
Subordination to them.</p>
            <p>For however the external Circumstances
of place and time are required, but in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the more essential Conditions
of Prayer; yet they are still required. The
necessity of publick Worship, whereof
Prayer is the principal part, was in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Discourse largely treated of. This
Worship cannot be reduced into Practice,
unless it be determined to certain places and
times. To speak of the times of Worship
is not my present Purpose: And if the places
of it be not fixed, no publick Worship can
well consist. The Apostle therefore in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
Prayers to be offered up <hi>every
where,</hi> hath not therein taught that all places
are equally fitted in which Prayers may be
made. He hath taken away the Singularity
of one place, and the Appropriation of all
publick Worship to that alone; but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the necessity of fixing some certain places,
in all parts of the Believing World, for


<pb n="422" facs="tcp:34506:215"/>
that Purpose; not left it indifferent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men pray to God in a place dedicated
to religious Uses, or in a place made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all the ordinary Uses of Life. The
Christian Religion hath taken away what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
was merely Ceremonial in the Jewish
Religion, but retained all which was deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Law of Nature or the light
of Reason. And that the Consecration of
certain places to the worship of God, and
appropriating them to that use alone is such,
will be useful to manifest; since there are
not wanting some, who decry all difference
between sacred and prophane places.</p>
            <p>First then, it was not in the Institution
of the Jewish Religion that God began to
be a God of order and Decency; those Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
were eternal in him, and evidently
appear in that most beautiful and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Order of the World, and all the parts
of it, which himself hath fixed in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it: Which is contrived with the
most exact Symmetry, disposed in a most
beautiful Order, and continued in it. The
Worship which Man pays to God, being
founded upon his Attributes; and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of those Attrributes chiefly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Effects of them, it is Consonant
to Reason that Man should direct his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with respect to them. If then, in the
visible Operations of God, such a decent
Order be every where Conspicuous, in the


<pb n="423" facs="tcp:34506:215"/>
publick Worship of him the same Order
ought also to be maintained; otherwise
no Acknowledgment is made, no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
paid to that divine Perfection,
which was the Principle of that Order
and Decency, which we see and admire
in the Creation. God hath not only form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what was absolutely necessary for the
Life of Man, but also added infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Lights, Minerals, Plants, and
Animals for his Delight, and for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of Life.</p>
            <p>Since therefore the Rules of Divine
Worship are to be taken from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Perfections manifested by their Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
this conduct of God in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and governing the World, doth not
only warrant the Addition of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and many Circumstances to the more
essential Parts of Worship, but also makes
it to become a Duty. And to accuse
such Additions and external Ceremonies
of Superstition, is no less unreasonable,
than to question the Wisdom of God,
who hath added to the Creation many
things not necessary, yet ornamental to
it. How incongruous would it be to
worship the God of Order and Decency
in an irregular and slovenly manner?
how improper a return for the additional,
yet unnecessary Conveniences of humane
Life, to adore the Author of them


<pb n="424" facs="tcp:34506:216"/>
without any Order or external De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency?</p>
            <p>The Sense of this induced men before
the Institution of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion, to
dedicate certain Places to the Worship of
God, and set them apart for that use only.
The Monuments of those times are few,
being all comprized in the Book of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis;</hi>
yet therein we find evident Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of such Dedications; more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in <hi>Gen.</hi> xxviii. 16. where <hi>Jacob</hi>
enjoying a Vision at <hi>Bethel,</hi> because it
was a Mark of the Divine Presence, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
concluded that the Place was
dedicated to his Service. <hi>And he said,
surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew
it not. How dreadful is this Place! this is
none other but the House of God, and this is
the Gate of Heaven.</hi> Which Reflection
of <hi>Jacob</hi> proveth it to have been the
Custom of the Patriarchs to Dedicate cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Places to be the Houses of God, and to
have been their Belief, that in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
God was more peculiarly present.
And to manifest that his Notion of the
House of God was no other than of a
Place of Worship, he immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
himself to worship God in it; as
it follows in the 18th. Verse.</p>
            <p>I might add, that the Dedicating cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Places to this use, was not the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Patriarchs alone, but of all


<pb n="425" facs="tcp:34506:216"/>
Ages and Men professing any Religion,
whether true or false; which general
Practice and Perswasion is in all other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
allowed to be a certain indication of
the Voice of Nature.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to observe the Reason
of it; where it may be considered, that
as God is the Author of Soul and Body,
of Heaven and Earth, of Life, and all the
Conveniencies of it; so he requireth, as a
just and necessary Act of Adoration, that
some part of every one of these should be
dedicated to himself, as an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Dominion over the whole.
Thus the Operations of the Soul pay
Homage to him in the more essential
parts of Worship; the Body in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
Parts of it, that is, in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Gestures of Adoration; we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to have received our Goods and
Wealth from him, by offering up some
part of it to himself, to be employed as
he shall direct; which in the Jewish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
consisted chiefly in Sacrifices and
Oblations; in the Christian Religion, in
Acts of Charity. We confess him the
Author of Life, by dedicating certain
times of it to his Service; and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
him the Lord of the whole Earth, by
appropriating and submitting some parts
of it to his immediate Service. By


<pb n="426" facs="tcp:34506:217"/>
this his Right and Title to the whole
Earth is eminently acknowledged, and
the Vassallage of Man the Inhabitant
of it is declared.</p>
            <p>Further, the Erection and Dedication
of Churches to the Worship and the
Honour of God, is an illustrious Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the publick Religion of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Country, and upon that Account
is both useful and necessary. It is our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to proclaim our Subjection to God, and
Belief in him, by all significative Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
to testifie it to the whole World,
and, if it be possible, perpetuate the
Memory of this our Profession to all
Ages, and communicate the Knowledge
of it to all men. This, Fabricks dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the Service of God do most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
signifie, which are so many stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and lasting Monuments of our Belief
in that God, to whose Service they were
appropriated.</p>
            <p>For this Reason, we often find in the
Book of <hi>Genesis,</hi> that the Patriarchs erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Pillars, and Heaps of Stones, to be so
many lasting Monuments of their Belief
in God and Subjection to him. And how
graciously God accepted such visible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
of Faith and Obedience to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
appears from that frequent Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
employed by him in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,


<pb n="427" facs="tcp:34506:217"/>
               <hi>For my Temples sake at Jerusalem.</hi>
What Reason can be assigned why God
should be moved to do any thing for
his Temples sake, which being purely
material, was not capable of any Merit;
but that it being erected to his Honour,
and dedicated to his Service, by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jews, was an illustrious Sign
to the whole World, that that Nation
believed and trusted in him? While
that Fabrick stood consecrated to his
Name, and Prayers were offered up in it
to him; it could not be dissembled that
he was the God of that Nation, and they
his People.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is too sad, and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable,
that wherever the solemn and
publick Worship of God in certain and
fixed Places dedicated to that use is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued,
Religion, the Honour and
Reverence of God immediately decays,
and becomes forgotten. As in all Parts
of the Christian Church it may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that wherever the publick Worship
of God in Churches hath been taken from
Christians, as in <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> the
Faith of Christ hath been wholly lost in
one or two Generations; whereas the
Church of <hi>Greece</hi> by the Advantage of
the use of Churches permitted to them,
hath continued to flourish and retain her


<pb n="428" facs="tcp:34506:218"/>
Faith unshaken under the Government
of the Turks; although continually op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
discountenanced, injured, and
persecuted by them.</p>
            <p>It was therefore the Effect of the most
benign Providence of God in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church, that he suffer'd not any of
their Persecutions to be of long Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
but restoring Peace to the Church,
gave them Liberty therewith to exercise
the true Worship of himself in publick,
solemn, and sacred Places. Could the
Religion of Christ have been maintained
by private and clancular Meetings, the
Zeal and Piety of those Times would
have effected it. Yet then it was thought
impossible to perform it. Nor would
God have interposed by so many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Providence, to restore his Church
to the Freedom of worshipping him in
publick Churches, had not such Worship
been more acceptable to him, than that
directed from Corners of private Houses.
And therefore no sooner was the Storm
of any Persecution blown over, but the
Christians immediately set themselves to
erect magnificent Churches to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the true God, and in them to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
all Acts of Worship. Not that
God heard not their Prayers directed
to him from secret and private places;


<pb n="429" facs="tcp:34506:218"/>
their Piety, Patience, and Constancy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
no less: but himself received far
less Honour from private than publick
Worship, and therefore for his own
Names-sake, as he frequently told the
Jews, he restored them to the enjoyment
of peace and quiet.</p>
            <p>Thus the Jews also contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to worship in a movable Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
while they travelled in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or were not fully settled in the
Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But no sooner were
all the Jebusites driven out of the Land,
but <hi>David</hi> prepared to build a stately
Temple in Honor of the God of Israel.</p>
            <p>Thus the Erection and Dedication of
Churches, is not only an open profession
of the Worship of that God to whose
Service they are consecrated, but also an
eminent Monument of Gratitude to God
for giving peace and quiet unto the
Church, procuring to her Members the
Liberty of offering up Prayers to him,
and professing to believe on him in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
The Magnificence of these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks,
is a further Argument of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
for the wealth and plenty of that
People, by whom they were founded in
Honour of God, and remain an eternal
Mark of Acknowledgment, that both
peace and plenty proceeded from his Gift,


<pb n="430" facs="tcp:34506:219"/>
to whose Name they are sacred. They
are the most obvious and sensible Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the long and uninterrupted
Continuance of the Faith of Christ in any
Nation, and the Devotion and Zeal of
his Followers; and thereby exceedingly
promote the Honour of God in the World,
which is the chief end of all publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Religion. To confine the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God to private Houses, or movable
Congregations, is what the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
thought the greatest Misfortune at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
their Persecution. And they
who in times of Peace pay no more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Worship to God, than what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
necessary to pay in time of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if they should indeed be persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it is more than probable will pay no
manner of Worship. At least to decry
the Erection and Consecration of sacred
places, seems to be no other than to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Increase of Divine Honour, and
to include a fear least posterity should
know from those durable Fabricks, that
their Fore-fathers worshipped the true
God.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if the publick Worship of God
is to be celebrated in places solemnly set
apart for that use, and the peculiar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God is promised in such Places;
if his Honour be promoted by erection of


<pb n="431" facs="tcp:34506:219"/>
such sacred Buildings, and kept up by the
Continuance of them; it follows that no
small Reverence is to be paid to them.
To treat them as unholy or common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in any matter, is to withdraw them
from that use to which they were design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to rob God of his peculiar possession,
and to deny his presence in them. On
the contrary, all external Acts of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
manifest our Acknowledgment of
the Relation which they bear to him;
of our Belief in him, to whose Honour
they are dedicated; of our Gratitude to
him, by whom we enjoy the open Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our Religion; of our Zeal for
his Glory, which is chiefly advanced, and
maintained by them; of our perswasion
of his constant and immediate presence
in them; that Veneration therefore which
the devout Members of this Church pay
to sacred Places, is neither the Effect of
Superstition, nor the Remains of Popery;
but ariseth from a pious and rational per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of the Honour due to God, and
all things relating to him. A Practice as
ancient as Christianity it self; and which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes use of as received and
confessed among all Christians, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
the Indecencies committed by
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in their Churches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
XI. 22. he aggravates the Guilt of them


<pb n="432" facs="tcp:34506:220"/>
by this Consideration, <hi>What have ye not
Houses to eat and to drink in? or despise you
the Church of God.</hi> Where opposing the
Church of God to private Houses, it is
plain that he speaks of material Churches;
and no less plain that he taketh it for
granted, and allowed by them, that so
great Reverence is due to these Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
that even for the sole Consideration
of their Holiness, no indecent Action
ought to be committed in them.</p>
            <p>Before him, our blessed Lord had by
his own Practice given us an eminent
Example of the same Regard due to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
places; when he scourged the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Changers
out of the Temple at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
although they had placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
only in the outward Porches, and
Avenues of the Temple, where no Act
of religious and publick Worship was
wont to be performed. And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he assigned was this, <hi>It is written, my
House shall be called the House of Prayer;</hi>
which maketh this whole Observation
concerning the Veneration due to
Churches not improper in a Discourse
concerning the place of Prayer.</p>
            <p>III. I pass now to the third Branch <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>
the Text, that is, the Posture that is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>
be used in Prayer, which is expressed in
those Words, <hi>Lifting up holy Hands.</hi> Nor


<pb n="433" facs="tcp:34506:220"/>
is the Posture of Prayer a Matter so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
as deserveth not our Enquiry.
It is indeed the Error of some, that all
external Modes of Worship are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
but to them who are no professed
Enemies to Order and Decency, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
far otherwise. For since God is
the Creator both of Body and Soul, since
the Existence of both is derived from
him, and continued by him; since he
hath provided for the Body as well as
Soul both in this Life and in the next,
it follows that both ought to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of Praise and Worship to God.
This the Soul, the sole Fountain of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
doth, by loving, honouring, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and submitting to him. The Body
indeed is not capable of such noble Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yet is it enabled to give Praise and
Glory to God by Gestures implying A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration,
Submission, and Subjection
to him. To worship God only with the
Body, were to make no returns of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
for the Faculties of the Soul recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from him; and to worship him only
with the Mind, were to deny the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the Body to him; Both there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
are alike necessary. The Worship
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> the Soul is indeed more acceptable,
because the Faculties of it are far more
noble: but the Worship of the Body is


<pb n="434" facs="tcp:34506:221"/>
no less the Duty of Man; and that espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in publick Worship, where the
chief Design being the Glory of God;
the Worship of the Body is the only vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Testimony of the internal Honour
pay'd by the Soul to God: and that not
only because the Words of publick praise
and adoration are expressed by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of the Body, but also in that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Gesture of the Body is a Mark of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
paid to God; since such Gestures
used in sacred Places, and to an invisible
Being, are notoriously known to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in Honour of God.</p>
            <p>Bodily Worship therefore is absolutely
necessary, and that such as may express
the greatest Submission, and deepest Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
The most intense Operations of
the Soul are due to God, and so are the
most significative Humiliations of the
Body. That posture therefore, which
expresseth the most humble Submission,
ought to be employed in Prayer, the
principal Act of Worship; and is indeed,
an essential Part of Worship. Only the
particular posture is not determined in
Scripture, because the Expressions of
Civility, Honour, and Subjection, vary
in several Ages and Countries. So that
it was impossible to determine any one
Gesture, since what was very expressive


<pb n="435" facs="tcp:34506:221"/>
of Worship in one Nation, might be
contrary in another.</p>
            <p>The external Mode of Worship there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was left indifferent to the whole
Church; because such Modes varied in
the several parts of it; but in any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church it is not indifferent, but
that it be esteemed absolutely necessary,
essential, and commanded by God;
which according to the received Customs
of that Nation is most expressive of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
Submission and Subjection. If
Kneeling be the most humble posture of
Respect which obtains in any Nation,
that ought to be employed in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God; and in that Case to pretend
to pray to God standing, is not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent,
but unlawful; a detaining from
God the Honour due to him, and offering
to him an inferiour degree of Worship,
when a more exalted degree is possible.
If by the Custom of the Country Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
be the most significative posture
of Humility, that then becomes necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in Divine Worship. If neither Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
nor Kneeling be in use; neither
ought it to be employed in Prayer; but
the same infallible Rule is always to
obtain, that whatsoever Posture by
Custom, Institution, or Prescription, is
most significative of Honour, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,


<pb n="436" facs="tcp:34506:222"/>
that ought to be made use of in
adoring God, and in Prayer, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
accompanied with Adoration.</p>
            <p>To apply this Rule to our own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:
It is notorious and undeniable,
that in the Nation wherein we live,
Kneeling is the most humble posture;
that whereof we should make use, were
we to do Homage to our Prince, or to
beg his Pardon. This posture therefore
becometh our indispensable Duty in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
wherein we adore God, and implore
his Mercy. In this Nation therefore, or
in any other where Kneeling is the most
submissive Gesture, to practise Standing
in publick Prayer, is in truth to deny
that the supream Honour is due to God,
to refuse to pay that Homage to him
which Men are content to pay to earthly
Princes; as if either he were not worthy
of it, or themselves were too great and
noble to condescend to it.</p>
            <p>In many Eastern Countries Prostration
hath been in use; and there it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in the Worship of God for the
same Reason. In others Standing, with
either spreading forth the Hands, or
gently inclining the Body, and laying the
Hand upon the Breast. In all these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the Custom of the Country was to
give Directions to the posture of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous


<pb n="437" facs="tcp:34506:222"/>
Worship. To enquire which of
these is the best and most significative
posture, is wholly vain, since no posture
signifieth any Respect in that Country
where it is not used; and what in one
place includeth the highest Honour and
Reverence, in another may signifie
none at all. Among the Jews, Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Hands lifted up, or spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
was the most reverential Gesture
as might be proved from innumerable
places of Scripture. (<hi>Psal.</hi> CXLI. 2. <hi>Dan.</hi>
VI. 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> XXII 41. <hi>Acts</hi> IX. 40.
XXI. 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and so also among the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore writing to both
of them, joyned in one Church in <hi>Corinth,</hi>
expressed in this place the posture of
Prayer to be <hi>lifting up of Hands,</hi> because
that Custom did prevail among them,
not that he intended to oblige us
to the same posture in Prayer, who for
the same Reason are left to be directed
by the Custom of our particular Nation;
amongst whom the most submiss, and at
the same time most civil posture is Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with clasped Hands; and that if I
be not mistaken, was always the most
received Gesture in the Western World;
but most certainly was in use from the
very beginning of Christianity in the
Western Church. <hi>vid.</hi> Tertul. <hi>&amp;</hi> Cypr.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="438" facs="tcp:34506:223"/>
It hath been indeed received in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and in all Countries as far as we can
find, that in Sacrifices the Priest who
offers them up, should do it standing. In
Compliance with this universal Custom,
our Church hath most certainly directed,
that the Prayers presented to God from
the Altar, where the Sacrament of the
Body and Blood of Christ, the great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the Christian Religion, is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
should be offered up by the Priest
in a standing Posture; which I would
not omit to observe to you, lest that
Practice should be any Objection against
the necessity of Kneeling in time of
Prayer; since it is founded upon the
same reasons, for which Kneeling is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the Priest at other times, and
to the People at all times in praying, that
is, upon the universal Consent and Custom
of Nations and Countries, concerning
the most proper and significative Postures
of Humility, Subjection, and Duty in
any Action whatsoever.</p>
            <p>I have gone through the second and
third Heads of my Text; It remains
that I consider the last Part of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
The Conditions of Prayer: but that,
God willing, shall be the Subject of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>HAving before discoursed at large
concerning the Duty, the Place,
and the Posture of Prayer, laid down in
the former part of the Words; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
now to treat of the Conditions of
Prayer expressed in the latter part of
them.</p>
            <p>How necessary and useful the serious
Consideration of these Conditions is, doth
partly appear from the precedent Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
For if Prayer be a principal Duty of
Man, the chief Act of Adoration which
he pays to God, requisite for the Supply
of his Wants, and the Conveyance of


<pb n="440" facs="tcp:34506:224"/>
all necessary Benefits and Graces to him,
he ought to be well instructed in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of those previous Qualifications,
without which, his prayer will fall short
of all the Ends and Designs of it; and
not only so, but also become a Sin, and
an Occasion of a Curse to him.</p>
            <p>If the determination of the place and
posture of prayer, not universally design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God, be in all Cases so useful, and
in some necessary to us, much more will
those constant and unalterable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of prayer be so, which ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
it in whatsoever place or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it be to be performed; and without
which, it is at no time accepted by God.
The more general and necessary of these
Conditions the Apostle hath, in the latter
Words of the Text, subjoyned to his
Exhortation of Prayer, which are these
Three.
<list>
                  <item>I. That it be offer'd up <hi>with holy Hands.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>Without Wrath,</hi> and</item>
                  <item>III. <hi>Without Doubting.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Reason and Necessity of these
three Conditions in their Order.</p>
            <p>First, it is required that Prayers be
offered up <hi>with holy Hands,</hi> that is, with
pure and clean Hands, defiled with
no Rapine or Uncleanness, innocent
from all Rebellion towards God, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice


<pb n="441" facs="tcp:34506:224"/>
towards Men. A Condition not
first introduced in the Christian Religion,
but of universal and eternal Obligation,
allowed both by Jews and Gentiles. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, Prayer was directed to the
same use, which it obtaineth among us;
that is, in the first place to worship God,
and in the next place to deprecate his
Anger, or procure his Favour. Upon
either of these Occasions, the Jews and
Gentiles were wont to add Sacrifices to
their Prayers, whensoever they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to pay a more solemn Act of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
or more signally to engage the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God in their behalf. Yet at the
same time, even the Gentiles placed the
Efficacy of the whole Act of Worship
rather in the Prayer, than in the Sacrifice,
as appeareth by those many nice and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Rules and Cautions used by
them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in reciting the publick Forms of
Prayer at the time of Sacrifice. So fully
were they convinced, that Prayer alone,
was that whereby Men could truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God: and at the same time no less
perswaded, that without purity their
Prayers would be ineffectual.</p>
            <p>Hence proceeded that ancient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Institution of preparing themselves
to sacrifice by Washings, Lustrations, and
other Signs of Purity. An Institution


<pb n="442" facs="tcp:34506:225"/>
received also among the Jews, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Command of God; who as we read
<hi>Exod.</hi> XL. 32. commanded that the
Priests should wash and cleanse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
whensoever they approached to
the Altar. Consonantly to which Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<hi>David</hi> saith <hi>Psal.</hi> XXVI. 6. <hi>I
will wash mine Hands in Innocency; and so
will I compass thine Altar, O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is so well known to all the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of Christianity, that the external
purity practised under the Law, did ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie
the internal purity to be received
under the Gospel, that I will not insist to
evince it to you. I will only desire you
to consider that this purification of the
Body was chiefly required in order to
Prayer, which will instruct you in the
necessity of internal Purity at the same
time; and to reflect with what Care and
Constancy both Jews and Gentiles puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
themselves before their Sacrifices;
that so Christians may be ashamed, if
with the same Diligence they cleanse
not their Souls in preparing them for
Prayer.</p>
            <p>The same Argument perswadeth in
both Cases; namely the Sense of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
arising from the Rules of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which either do profess. Yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we never find that either Jews


<pb n="443" facs="tcp:34506:225"/>
or Gentiles presumed to sacrifice with
unwashen Hands, it is but ordinary to
observe that Christians pray with impure
Minds. It may be pretended indeed,
that external Purity is an easie Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but internal Holiness a difficult
Duty. A Difference indeed not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
but infinitely outweighed by
the greater Certainty of Truth, by the
promises of more glorious Rewards, by
the constant pleasure of Mind attending
internal Purity, all which were wanting
to the outward Ceremonies of Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and lastly by that Conviction
which every one may have of the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of it, whereas the Reasons of
external Holiness were either obscure,
as among the Jews; or none at all, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Gentiles. Some of these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
I will now insist on.</p>
            <p>And first, that the Prayers of Men be
accepted by God, it must be supposed
that they are at Peace with him, which
cannot be without innocence and purity.
Every Sin is an Act of Rebellion against
God, by which Man withdraws himself
from his Obedience, pretends to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
from him, and proclaims En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to his Laws and Government. It
is easie then to conceive, that while the
Soul of Man is detained in any Vice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary


<pb n="444" facs="tcp:34506:226"/>
to the Commands of God, his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
will be ineffectual and offered up in
vain. If we look in the ordinary Actions
of Life, we hold it to be absurd to beg
any Favour of him whom we profess to
hate, whom we declare our Enemy,
whom we revile, affront and despise.
All this we do to God by every deliberate
sin, and himself professeth Hatred and
Abhorrence of sinful Men. But that
the Prayers of Men should obtain any
Benefit from God, it must be supposed
that they are dear and well-pleasing to
him. As among human Benefactors, a
Kindness is always supposed to precede
the Benefit. But far be it from a rational
Man to believe, that Sinners can be dear
to God, or receive his Favour. Or if
Man could flatter himself into such a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
yet the express Denunciations of
God will not suffer him to entertain it:
who far from allowing any kindness or
favour to them, proclaims that <hi>there is
no peace unto the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eminent and innumerable promises of
Favour are indeed annexed to the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of penitent Sinners; but for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
because by Repentance they cease
to be sinners. If the Repentance be true,
perfect, and serious, the Sinner thereby
cleanseth his Soul, and in that Moment


<pb n="445" facs="tcp:34506:226"/>
may be truly said to <hi>lift up holy Hands in
Prayer.</hi> If not so, an imperfect or a
feigned Repentance will no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Efficacy of Prayer, than if the
Supplicant had still continued in the
open Practice of his Sins.</p>
            <p>Nor ought this to be any Disswasion
from early and constant Innocence, that
the same Promises of Audience and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
are annexed to the Prayers of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Sinners, as to those of holy Men
who <hi>need no Repentance,</hi> that is, no total
Change of their Life and Actions. That
was indeed objected by the envious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
in the Vineyard against the good
Housholder who rewarded the late-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
into his Vineyard <hi>equally</hi> with those
<hi>who had born the Heat and Burden of the
Day,</hi> as an Act of Injustice, and unequal
Distribution. To this it may be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to answer, what that good Houshol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
representing God, in the Parable
replied; <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what
I will with my own? Is thine Eye evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
mine is good?</hi> That is in a strict
Sense, a Man Pious from his Infancy,
without any notorious Sin, deserveth no
more from God, than a penitent Sinner
newly return'd to Obedience; yet to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
both the exactness of the Divine
Justice, and to inforce a constant Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness


<pb n="446" facs="tcp:34506:227"/>
from the Motive arising from this
Consideration, I will proceed in it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
further.</p>
            <p>It is most true, that God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
pardon and Favour to the Petitions
of repenting Sinners; that he will blot
out their Iniquities, take away their
Guilt, and remove the Punishment of
their Sins. This he did to <hi>Manasseh,</hi> to
the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> to many both under the
Old and the New Testament. But we
find neither Promise nor Example of any
extraordinary Favour, beside Pardon,
conferred immediately at the Prayers of
Penitents; such as miraculous Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from Enemies, Prolongation of
Life, Communication of Benefits to others
for their sakes, Effusion of eminent Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the like. All which, seem to
have been Rewards reserved to Persons
of more illustrious and more constant
Piety: who by a long Obedience gave
undoubted Proofs of their Devotion to
the Service of God; and were in their
times as <hi>shining Lights</hi> in the World;
such as <hi>Abraham, Moses,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> the
Prophets, and Apostles, who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
defiled with any notorious Habit of
Sin. And therefore as they distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves from the World by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Acts, and uninterrupted habits


<pb n="447" facs="tcp:34506:227"/>
of Piety, so they were distinguished by
God by visible and extraordinary Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
and Graces consequent to their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Their Piety, Patience, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
were raised far above the Standard
of latter times. No wonder then that
we who have so far degenerated from
their Example, find not the same Effect
of Prayer; and that we even dare not to
ask those things which were so easily
vouchsafed to them.</p>
            <p>Many indeed of those extraordinary
Benefits, granted at the Prayers of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Saints, were intended as so many
miraculous Proofs of the Doctrine which
they professed; and under the Law were
the only promised Reward; and under
the Gospel, were at first necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Faith; yet still we may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
that the Efficacy of Prayer doth
at this Day decrease with the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Piety, and may be raised with it.</p>
            <p>A second Reason of the Necessity of
<hi>lifting up holy Hands in Prayer,</hi> is taken
from the Nature and chief Design of it;
which, as I before largely proved, is
the Worship of God; in that it acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
his Dominion over Mankind,
his Justice, his Power, his Goodness,
and his Omniscience. In praying to
God, man declareth his Belief of all these


<pb n="448" facs="tcp:34506:228"/>
Divine Attributes, but without <hi>lifting
up holy Hands</hi> at the same time, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
them all, defeats the End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Prayer, and far from worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
God in it, denieth his Perfections,
and overthroweth what otherwise he
might be supposed to do. This we shall
soon be convinced of, if we pass through
all the Reasons, upon the Account of
which, Prayer is an Act of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            <p>If it be considered as a Testimony of
Obedience, because the Practice of a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
enjoyned by God; no less is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
Purity commanded, for which
we now plead. The same Authority
which requireth Prayer, willeth withal
that it be offer'd up with Innocence, and
Purity of Mind. To perform the Act,
and withhold the Condition, is then no
other than to confess an Obligation,
and immediately to deny it. If Prayer
includeth a Confession of our Wants, and
Imperfection, and Dependance upon
God; continuance in Sin argueth that
we have no Sense of that Imperfection,
that we affect to be independent from
God, and exempted from his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If in that, Man professeth Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to him, by not purging his Mind
from Sin, he makes his Profession to be


<pb n="449" facs="tcp:34506:228"/>
no other than a Protestation against plain
Fact. If there, he implyeth a Belief of
the Justice and Goodness of God; here
he manifests by his practice, that he
thinks it not just to be deprived by his
Laws the satisfaction of his beloved Lusts.
If by addressing himself to God, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
him to know all things, and to be
every where present; by his Sins he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to escape his Knowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
from his Presence. If in the one
he publisheth a Belief of his Almighty
Power; in the other he defieth the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it. He boweth his Knee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
and prostrates his Body in Honour
of God; but at the same time he giveth
up the Government of his nobler part,
the Soul, to the Adversary of God, the
Devil. Thus a Sinner willfully conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
in sin, destroyeth that Adoration,
which by Prayer he pretendeth to pay
to God. Nor is that the only Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
attending Sin in Prayer, that it
defeateth the Act of Adoration, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth
the Rewards annexed to it. It
farther involveth the Soul of Man in a
most horrid Crime; in that he therein
affronteth all those Perfections of God,
which in praying to him he professeth to
believe. The guilt of Perjury consisteth
in commiting the Fact, after a solemn


<pb n="450" facs="tcp:34506:229"/>
and deliberate Invocation of the Divine
Presence; and the guilt of Blasphemy
in reviling the Attributes of God, after
a particular mention and profession of
them. Both these and many more Crimes
are Acted, as often as a Love or Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sinning is retained with Prayer.
So that if the mind of Man were not
depraved to a most deplorable Degree,
it would fear to approach to God in
Prayer without a perfect Innocence, that
is, either Conscience of having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
no sin, or unfeigned Sorrow for
it.</p>
            <p>If we joyn all the Aggravations of
sins in one, we still shall not conceive
a greater than to fall down and worship
God, professing his supreme Dominion,
and at the same time proceed to violate
the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>aws which he hath founded: to
call him by the Glorious name of God,
and acknowledge his Power; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to revere his Majesty, nor to fear
his Punishments: to celebrate his Justice,
and at the same time to defraud, oppress
and injure: to own his Goodness, and at
the same time to deny Compassion to his
Creatures made in his own Image: to
intercede with him for new Benefits,
and employ those already granted in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
his Authority: to acknowledge


<pb n="451" facs="tcp:34506:229"/>
the having received Life and Being from
him, and not to yield him any Service
for it: to confess his unlimited Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Presence, and therewith retain
secret Resolutions of sinning. All these
are as hainous Provocations as the Soul
of Man can possibly form; all yet are
the necessary Consequence of Praying
with impure Hearts and Minds; and all
yet receive this farther aggravation, that
they are performed in the immediate
Presence of God, that is, in Prayer.</p>
            <p>Such are the universal Reasons of <hi>lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up holy hands in Prayer;</hi> but to those
who profess Belief in Christ there is a
peculiar Reason, no less weighty than
the former: Namely, that the Efficacy
of our Prayers consists in our Relation to
Christ, and are granted merely for his
Sake, and through his Merits; which is
acknowledged in the Conclusion of all
Christian Prayers; and if our selves
should not acknowledge it, yet the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
would abundantly inform us, that
he is our only Mediator, and that in him
and through him all good things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from God to us. No Christian
therefore hath any other Title to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God, than his Relation to his
Lord and Master the Son of God; which
Relation cannot consist without intire


<pb n="452" facs="tcp:34506:230"/>
Obedience to his Laws and Doctrines,
which are all directed to promote Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Justice and Holiness. The want
of these Conditions breaks off the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between Christ and Man; who then
in vain supplicates in the name of Christ,
when by disobedience he ceaseth to be
his Disciple. He may plead the Merits
of the Death of Christ to be All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
but himself hath no share in them;
he may fly to the Mercy Seat, but will
find no High Priest to intercede for him;
who by his Sins hath cast off the Yoke
of Christ, and even <hi>Crucified him afresh,
and put him to an open Shame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. The Second Condition of Prayer
is, that it be offered up <hi>without wrath,</hi>
that is without Malice or Hatred, which
is no other than Anger grown inveterate.
The Passion of Anger is indeed no less
unlawful to those that apply themselves
to Prayer; but that is not so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
by the Apostle in this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is scarce credible, that while the
heat of that Passion continueth, any
one should be disposed to Pray. While
that Commotion of the Spirits, which
attendeth Anger, lasteth, the Mind can
attend to nothing else, and cannot direct
its thoughts and desires to God in Prayer;
so that during that time it is not only


<pb n="453" facs="tcp:34506:230"/>
impious but unnatural to undertake
it.</p>
            <p>In Prayer the Soul ought to engage
its whole strength and intention, and
offer them up to God; which it cannot
do, when the Affections of it are divided
between Prayer and Anger. It ought
at the same time to compose it self in a
sedate and quiet Disposition, to receive
the Communications of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and Favour; which it cannot do,
while disordered by any Passion.</p>
            <p>Which Reason will also make Prayer
unbefitting, and Devotion in Prayer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
not only in the heat of Anger,
but also in such an Hatred, as by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the violence of it continually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth
the Passions of the Mind; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
where the person hated is present
to it, and alloweth to it no intervals of
Calm and Quiet, until it be either satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with Revenge, or expireth with long
time. Such a degree of Hatred is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
uninterrupted Anger, which for
the former Reason excludeth all possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Prayer during the continuance of
it.</p>
            <p>But such a Degree is monstrous; the
most ordinary Case of Hatred alloweth
frequent Intervals of Serenity to the
Mind, frets not the thoughts continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;


<pb n="454" facs="tcp:34506:231"/>
and hath this immediate effect only,
that whensoever the Memory of it doth
return, or the Causes upon which it was
first founded are recalled to Mind, either
Resolutions or Desires of Revenge are
conceived, and a Purpose formed of not
forgiving. Even this moderate and most
ordinary Case of Hatred rendereth the
Soul unfit for Prayer, and always defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Success of it.</p>
            <p>For in Prayer, if directed and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
aright, Man is supposed to resign up
his Affections and Faculties intirely to
the Disposition of God, to acknowledge
him to be the supreme Judge of the
World and Lord of all. But he who
nourisheth Hatred in his Mind, on the
contrary, neither resigneth up himself,
nor confesseth the Dominion of God.
For that very Affection he retaineth
in opposition to his Will; and by seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or desiring Revenge, he maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Judge of the Merits of other Men,
and the measure of the Punishment due
to the Malice of their supposed Injuries;
and thereby invades the Office and
usurps the Authority of God; who if
he be indeed the supreme Lord and
Judge of all, hath the only right to
exercise such a Judgment.</p>
            <p>This Confession therefore of Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="455" facs="tcp:34506:231"/>
and Self-resignation, which is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in Prayer, cannot consist with
Hatred. And indeed the Sense of a
Prayer joyned with Hatred can be no
other than this, <hi>Lord I resign up my self
to thy disposal; but will not commit my
Cause to thy Decision. I devote my Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Faculties to thy Service; but
will not quit my hatred for thy command.
I acknowledge thee to be the Sovereign Lord
and Judge of all Mankind; but reserve to
my self a right to judge and punish by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
my Enemy, who yet is my equal and
thy subject.</hi> So absurd, incongruous, and
repugnant are the thoughts and Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a malicious Soul compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as do not only justly defeat the
Success of the Petition, but also deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
an eminent Punishment for daring
thus to collude with God.</p>
            <p>But the chief Reason of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
of Hatred with Prayer is yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind:
Namely, the institution of God;
who may justly affix whatsoever Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
himself pleaseth to his own Favours.
And to the assurance of Success in Prayer,
he hath above all other Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
pre-required Freedom from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
Hatred and Malice, and forgiveness
of Injuries. This he hath commanded
to be done, before any Act of Worship,


<pb n="456" facs="tcp:34506:232"/>
and especially that solemn one of Prayer,
be paid to himself, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> V. 23.
<hi>If thou bring thy Gift to the Altar, and
there remembrest that thy Brother hath
ought against thee, Leave there thy Gift
before the Altar, and go thy way; first be
reconciled to thy Brother; and then come
and offer thy Gift.</hi> He hath made this
the indispensable Condition of Pardon to
Mankind. <hi>Forgive, that ye may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.
For if ye forgive Men their Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes;
your heavenly Father will also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
you. But if not, neither will your
Father forgive your Trespasses,</hi> Matth. VI.
14. He hath inserted this Condition into
that Prayer, which he hath given both
as a Form, and as a Pattern, to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
<hi>Forgive us our Trespasses, as we
forgive them that Trespass against us;</hi> that
so as truly, sincerely and unfeignedly as
we desire Pardon, so truly and really we
may Pardon others; and not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
Pardon to others in using this form
of words, but also renounce all hopes or
claim of Pardon from God, if what we
then profess, we do not indeed intend.</p>
            <p>All the Benefits of God which we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
by Prayer proceed from his own
Beneficence, and are undeserved by Men.
If he vouchsafes to grant them, he may
well be allowed to affix what Conditions


<pb n="457" facs="tcp:34506:232"/>
himself pleaseth to them. He might have
commanded some very difficult Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
some extraordinary return of
Thanks; but when he hath resolved all
into a Condition so easie, so agreeable
to our Nature, so much conducing to
the Happiness of Mankind, as the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
remission of Injuries; he hath left
Men without excuse, and manifested that
all the Duties exacted by him are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
rather for their Benefit, than the
increase of his own Glory.</p>
            <p>If it seems a hard Condition to forgive
those many Provocations and Injuries,
which one Man may receive from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without any Compensation or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
we ought to consider, how much
greater Provocations, and more numerous
Injuries the best of Men have offered to
God, and how much more they stand
in need of his Pardon. We are injured
by others, who are our Equals, who
possibly have no Dependence on us, have
received no Obligations from us, and
may have been provoked by us; but
we by our Sins offer violence to our
Creator, by whom we subsist, on whom
we depend, who hath conferred on us
already eminent Benefits, and intends
yet greater. We may have been injured
once or twice; but whoever calls to


<pb n="458" facs="tcp:34506:233"/>
mind the wandring Thoughts, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
Desires, the vain Imaginations, and
perhaps the more flagrant Sins of any
one day, will find, that he hath more
grievously offended God in that little time,
than by all the Injuries of other Men
he can have been provoked in his whole
Life. If then, it be necessary to depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the Anger of God for the Sins of
any one day, and much more for the
sins of a whole Life; and Pardon be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by God upon no other Condition,
than Freedom from wrath and hatred,
it will be no less our Interest than our
Duty <hi>to lift up holy hands in Prayer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. To this Condition the Apostle adds
in the last place, that Prayer ought to be
offered <hi>without doubting.</hi> The word in
the Original signifieth a Disputation and
reasoning in the Mind concerning an
Opinion, and in this place concerning
that Opinion, which all true Believers
ought to entertain of the Efficacy of
Prayer. This doubting may relate ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the whole System of Religion,
or to the peculiar Promises concerning
Prayer, or to the particular worthiness
of the Supplicant.</p>
            <p>In the first Case it is evident, that
doubting overthrows the Success of


<pb n="459" facs="tcp:34506:233"/>
Prayer. <hi>He that cometh to God, must first
believe that God is, and that he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
of those who seek him;</hi> that is, he
must be fully perswaded of it. If he
doubts, he dishonoureth God, and cannot
perform the Essential parts of Prayer.
For shall he be said to commit himself
entirely to God, who questions his Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence?
Or can he rely upon God, who
is not satisfied that he is Infinite or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty?
The least mixture of doubt
herein taketh off so much from that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
Reliance, Subjection and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which ought to intervene in every
Act of Worship, and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Prayer; which thereby ceaseth to
be perfect and sincere.</p>
            <p>So also in the Articles of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
upon which the Efficacy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Prayers are chiefly placed; in vain
doth he plead in the Name of Christ,
who is not well assured of the Dignity
and the Merits of Christ. Audience of
Prayer is promised as a Reward of Faith,
which cannot consist with doubting. It
is the confidence and assurance which
we have in God and Christ, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth
Acceptance to our Prayers; if
we firmly believe it, because he hath
said it, if for the sake of his Authority
we esteem things future as present to us,


<pb n="460" facs="tcp:34506:234"/>
which is the Condition laid down by our
Lord, Mark XI. 24. <hi>Whatosever things ye
desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive
them, and ye shall have them.</hi> This made
the Prayers of the ancient Saints and
Patriarchs so successful, as is at large
described, <hi>Hebr. XI.</hi> that having seen
the Promises afar off, they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of them, and embraced them;
and, as a sure Testimony of their perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
quitted their present Pleasures and
Possessions in exchange for future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>It is said of our Lord while conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
on Earth, that <hi>he could not do many
mighty works</hi> among the Galileans, <hi>because
of their unbelief:</hi> and himself required
it as the previous Condition of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Cures; <hi>believe, and thou shalt
be made whole.</hi> Not that it was impossible
to his Almighty Power to have wrought
Miracles without the concurrent Belief
of Men; but that he wrought not upon
them, as upon so many Machines, but
dealt with them as with rational Beings,
and therefore distributed his Favours in
proportion to their Faith. And herein
an imperfect Faith, or a cold perswasion
will not suffice; St. <hi>Peter</hi> demonstrated
much more, when he adventured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the water at the command of


<pb n="461" facs="tcp:34506:234"/>
Christ; yet because he still retained some
doubt and fear, our Lord permitted him
to sink, that so he might reprove the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of his Faith: <hi>O thou of little
Faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Second sort of doubting, is a Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
concerning the peculiar Promises
of Success and Advantage consequent to
Prayer; when the Existence or the power
of God is not called in question, but his
Will disputed; and it seems incredible
that such an Almighty and most perfect
Being, having no need and receiving no
benefit from the Service or Prayers of
Men, should condescend so far as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
such eminent Favours, and so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
at the Petition of mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Creatures.</p>
            <p>To overcome this doubt, it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to manifest, that God hath indeed
promised such favourable Audience to
the Prayers of Men; and for the truth of
this, (because I speak to those convinced
of the Authority of Scripture) to remit
you to those many Promises contained in
the Gospel. The places are numerous
and evident. I will now insist but on
one of them, namely the Parable of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
Judge, <hi>Luk.</hi> XVIII. delivered as the
Evangelist saith <hi>for this end, that Men
ought always to pray, and not to faint,</hi> not


<pb n="462" facs="tcp:34506:235"/>
to doubt of Success. There the unjust
Judge is represented, as granting that to
the importunity of a poor Widow, which
neither the Justice of her Cause, nor the
fear of God, nor the regard of Men could
obtain from him. And this inference
drawn from the whole, Verse 7. <hi>And if
so, shall not God avenge his own Elect,
which cry day and night unto him, though
he bear long with them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To allure us to the practice of Prayer,
Christ proposeth the Efficacy of it with
an unjust Judge. It had been sufficient
to have introduced the Person of a just
and benign Man; that so his Justice, if
compared with the Divine Clemency,
might demonstate the force of Prayer.
For if a good Man receives those kindly
who address themselves to him; how
much more will God, the Greatness of
whose Bounty exceeds our comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
It had been enough, as I before
said, to have proposed the Person of a
just Judge; but to represent a cruel, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
inhumane Judge, unmerciful to
others, but kind and easie to Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants;
instructeth us, that even a wicked
Nature may be by Prayer inclined to Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Mercy. This therefore our
Lord chose to do, more lively to express
the force fo Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="463" facs="tcp:34506:235"/>
When in the next place, he carrieth us
from the Consideration of this severe
Judge, cruel by Nature, but mollified
by Prayer, to the Consideration of God
the Father, most good, kind, gentle, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
<hi>slow to anger and forgiving sins,</hi>
bearing with insuperable Patience, the
daily Affronts of Men, the Honours paid
to his Adversary the Devil, and the
Contumelies therein offered to his own
Son; what Success may we not then
hope to our Prayers made to him, if
they be presented with a due Reverence,
and necessary Preparation? The unjust
Judge although <hi>he feared not God, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
Man,</hi> yet did Justice to the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
for her importunity. What Fear
could not do, Prayer obtained. Neither
Threats nor the Fear of Punishment
could incline the Man to Justice; yet the
Cries and Supplications of a poor Widow
softned his Nature, and made him tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable.
If she could obtain so much
from a rough ill-natur'd Man; how
much greater Kindness, Goodness and
Love may we not expect from God, who
always desires to shew Mercy, but never
to exercise Severity; whose very Threats
and Punishments are intended for our
good, and directed to deterr us from Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="464" facs="tcp:34506:236"/>
Let us once more review the effect of
Prayer upon this unjust Judge, that we
may the better discover the infinite kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and love of God to Men. If he,
who never willingly and of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
did any good, changed on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the Petitions of a poor Supplicant,
and was moved to Compassion; much
more will the importunate Prayers of
Men be prevalent with him, whose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
includeth an infinity of Goodness;
and who dispenseth the Emanations of
that Goodness in vast and constant Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
even without intreaty. For who
doth not see that the Light of the Sun,
the influences of Heaven, the Fruits of
the Earth, Riches, Life and Health are
given by God to all Men, to the good
and to the bad; and that only for his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
Kindness to Mankind, but if he so
favours, cherisheth and maintaineth
those who ask him not, and are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
so much as sensible that the Benefit
proceedeth from him; what will he not
bestow on those, who spend a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
part of their Lives in Prayer and
Supplication?</p>
            <p>The last Reason of doubting in Prayer
is the Conscience of unworthiness in the
Supplicant, which Conscience is either
founded in the natural unworthiness of


<pb n="465" facs="tcp:34506:236"/>
Man, or arises from the Sense of his
want of these Qualifications of Prayer,
which are required to make it accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The former falls in with that doubt,
which I last spoke of, and the latter is
in the Power of every Man to remove;
and to perswade the necessity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of that removal, hath been the
Subject of this days Discourse, I shall
therefore add no more upon this Head.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole it doth appear, that
the Duty of Prayer is necessary, the place
of it to be regarded, the posture not to
be neglected, the Conditions indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the Success certain.</p>

            <p>THE Resurrection of our Lord
from the Dead, being so illustrious
a Confirmation of the Truth of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which he taught, so undeniable an
Argument of the Divinity and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Person, so firm an Assurance of
those Hopes which we conceive of our
own Resurrection, deserveth at this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
more than a single Consideration.
It is the knowledge and conviction of
that, which chiefly Establisheth the Faith
of a Christian, continueth his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of enjoying hereafter a better State;


<pb n="467" facs="tcp:34506:237"/>
and after a serious Meditation of the
Actions of his Saviour here on Earth
wrought for his sake, compleats his
Joy.</p>
            <p>In the ancient Church therefore, all
the time between <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsunday</hi>
was dedicated to the Memory of this
wonderful Mystery, as was manifest by
the particular expressions of Joy, during
that whole Season, in the publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and Ceremonies of the Church.
And as the benefit of Christs Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
doth no less extend to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of these Times, than to those of
more ancient Ages; so our Gratitude
and Rejoycing in Memory of it ought to
be no less intense.</p>
            <p>It may be pretended, that those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Christians living nearer to the time
of Christ, had more certain assurance of
the Truth of the Fact related, than we
now have at so great a distance; and
that the Will of Man always acting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably
to the perswasions of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
cannot now be so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by the consideration of an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Interest, as they were then, when
the Experience of frequent Miracles ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
it most certain. Or that however
the Apostles and those Five hundred


<pb n="468" facs="tcp:34506:238"/>
Disciples, who were blessed with the
presence of Christ after his Resurrection,
had no less just Cause of Joy than Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
Yet that others, who were not
convinced of the same Truth by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of their own Senses, could not but
be less concerned at the relation, by
how much the less they were ascertained
of the reality of it. And as the Mind
of Man is fruitful in inventing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
opposing the Obligation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
some have been brought to doubt
of, and others even to deny the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Christ, upon this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that after he is said to be risen from
the Dead, he appeared not in Publick,
conversed not in solemn Places and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Multitude, as before; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew himself to some few Disciples of
his own, whom he had chosen for that
purpose.</p>
            <p>To take off this Objection, and assert
the Truth of our Lord's Resurrection,
I will endeavour to manifest the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of that conduct of Christ
related in the Text: <hi>Whom God raised up,
and shewed openly, not to all the People, but
to Witnesses chosen before of God.</hi> To this
purpose I will divide my designed Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
into these three parts.
<list>
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:34506:238"/>
                  <item>I. That to have shewed Christ after
his Resurrection to the whole unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Multitude of the Jews, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
the Majesty, Justice and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God.</item>
                  <item>II. That it would have failed of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
an universal Conviction.</item>
                  <item>III. That God hath notwithstanding
offered to Mankind sufficient Arguments
of reasonable Conviction.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First then, neither the Wisdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Honour of God, nor the design
of Christs Ministerial Office here on
Earth, would permit him to expose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
after his Resurrection to the publick
View of the unbelieving World. As
God is the Fountain of all Wisdom, it is
impossible he should act any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
just Cause and Reason. It is not
in the ordinary direction alone of created
Beings that he exerts not his Power
without just occasion; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it hath been long since received as
an Axiom in Philosophy, that Nature
works nothing in vain; but also in the
dispensation of Spiritual Concerns, in
founding Methods for the Salvation of
Mankind, he proceeds by just and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
Rules exactly fitted to produce the
effect intended: Fitted, I mean, to


<pb n="470" facs="tcp:34506:239"/>
produce that effect, if the Will of Man,
which is herein the Subject of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Operation, rejects not wilfully what
is intended for its benefit. In that case
God seeks not other Remedies, exceeds,
not the ordinary Rules of Salvation fix'd
by him, nor employeth new and more
powerful Engines to effect his Design.
Those he before employed were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
and that they should fail of their
end, is to be ascribed, not to their want
of Force, but to the Wickedness of Man
hardening his Mind against receiving the
effects of them.</p>
            <p>Thus God giveth to every Man a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Acting according to the dictates of
Reason, of overcoming the violent Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his sensual Appetite, of resisting all
Temptations offered to him. If not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this, Man useth not his
Free-will aright; if he yieldeth to his
Passions, and embraceth sinful Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
God doth not by his Almighty
Power restrain these sinful Actions, or
violently over-rule the inordinate Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Will of Man.</p>
            <p>When the Serpent tempted our first
Parents, God, if he had pleased, might
as well have interposed before their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the suggestion of the Serpent, in


<pb n="471" facs="tcp:34506:239"/>
eating the forbidden Fruit, as he did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
denounce their Punishment;
and had he done so, it is scarce possible
to be imagined that they would have
dared to transgress; yet would it be
unreasonable to have required, that God
should have interposed in such a manner.
He had given them sufficient strength
of Will to maintain their Innocence;
and having done that, justly left them
to their own choice.</p>
            <p>Thus also after the Fall of Man, God
hath granted to Man, in vertue of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Promises and Covenants, such a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of assisting Grace, as may repair the
weakness of the Will enervated by that
Fall, and fully enable him to discharge
the several Duties required of him: But
if neither with this the Will of Man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
if self aright, God doth not double,
treble, or multiply his Grace, or put a
force upon the Will. That were not to
deal with Man as with a rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and to over-rule or force the Will,
would be to take away the very essence
of Good and Bad, which consists in the
free determination of the Will.</p>
            <p>And as God directs his most wise Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
in relation to the Will of Man,
so also he acts in relation to his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.


<pb n="472" facs="tcp:34506:240"/>
He hath proposed sufficient
Motives of Conviction to every point
which he requireth to be believed by
Man: If he gaineth not assent, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
no farther, heapeth not one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
upon another.</p>
            <p>To apply this to the case of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.
Our Lord, in his triennial
Preaching before his Crucifixion, had
offered to the Jews abundant reason to
perswade them of the Authority of his
Mission, by almost daily Miracles, by
proving that the ancient Prophesies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Messias did clearly belong
to his Person, by visible declarations from
Heaven, by his own incomparable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
by the Preaching of <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
and his Apostles. After so many
and evident Arguments produced in
vain, and rendred ineffectual by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness
and unreasonable Prejudices of
the Jews, Can we think it just to require,
that God should change his Methods, and
propose other yet more forcible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
Or must we not confess that
God had done enough, and that to go
yet farther, were to exceed the bounds
of Reason, and depress the Majesty of
God? He had before the Deluge, when
no such extraordinary Methods of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction


<pb n="473" facs="tcp:34506:240"/>
were employed, justly resolved,
<hi>My Spirit shall not always strive with
Man.</hi> And after so many Miracles
wrought by Christ, so many Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
conferred on the unbelieving Jews,
to have still strove with their unbelief
by the publick Manifestation of Christ
after his Resurrection, would have been
unnecessary and unreasonable.</p>
            <p>Thus the Wisdom of God was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to deny to the unbelieving Jews
the personal Conversation of Christ raised
from the dead. His Justice also may
well be thought to have inclined him to
the same. That People in rejecting the
Messias, in opposing the evidence of his
Doctrine, in withstanding the force of
his Miracles, had committed as great
a Sin as the Soul of Man is even capable
of; had offered as great an affront to
the Majesty of God, as can possibly be
conceived. So signal an Impiety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
a no less eminent Punishment from
the Hands of God. The visible Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which Punishment might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
as it was for near forty Years, till
the total Destruction of their Nation;
yet other Punishments less visible, but
no less grievous, the Justice of God did
immediately inflict; and that was, <hi>In


<pb n="474" facs="tcp:34506:241"/>
giving them up to their own Hearts Lusts,
and letting them follow their own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;</hi>
not offering to them the most
undeniable Argument of the Truth of
their Messias, the Conviction of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
by their own Senses, when
they had rejected all those precedent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
which would more than have
sufficed to convince and inform them, if
their wicked perverseness had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the Conviction.</p>
            <p>They had by denying belief to the
Doctrine of Christ, confirmed by so
many and such evident Arguments, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
themselves to be given up to <hi>a
reprobate Mind,</hi> and far from deserving
so great a Blessing, as the Conversation
of the Son of God now raised from the
Dead. That was a Favour, than which
a greater could not be granted to the
Apostles. And then what was given by
Christ to his beloved Disciples, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of their Faith and Patience, could
not in Justice be communicated to the
worst of Men.</p>
            <p>Nor doth it extenuate the Guilt of the
Jews therein, that they proceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their present Judgment, and
acted upon the Direction of a mistaken
Conscience. For first, it is manifest,


<pb n="475" facs="tcp:34506:241"/>
that many of them opposed him, even
while inwardly convinced of the Truth
of his Mission, and the Arguments of
it; as those did to whom he upbraided
the Commission of the Sin against the
Holy Ghost. And then Conscience sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
is not the Rule and Warrant of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Actions, but Conscience directed
by right Reason. God hath given to
Man a faculty of Understanding as well
as Will; full Power of judging right in
all Matters absolutely Necessary, as well
as of following the report of this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
when made. He requireth a like
right use of both these Faculties, and
punisheth equally the Miscarriage of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if it concerns matters of Obedience
to himself, or of ordinary Duty. In
which case, it is no less Fatal or Criminal
to pervert the Understanding, than to
corrupt the Will; and then, to plead
Ignorance or a mistaken Conscience, will
be no more allowed, than to plead
Drunkenness for Crimes committed in
that absence of right Reason.</p>
            <p>There is not in all History a more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous
Sin to be found, than the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of the Jews, and the Crucifixion of
their Messias by them; none so severely
branded in Scripture, or punished with


<pb n="476" facs="tcp:34506:242"/>
so remarkable a Judgment in this Life:
Yet our Saviour hanging on the Cross de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that those his Persecutors <hi>knew not
what they did.</hi> And altho' he then, out
of the abundance of his Charity, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
for their Pardon, yet the Justice
of God would not grant it, much less
continue to them the former Favours of
Heaven. And such would have been the
visible and publick Preaching of Christ
after his Resurrection.</p>
            <p>Farther, the Honour of God was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
herein; nor was it agreeable to
the Divine Majesty, that the Person of
Christ, after his Resurrection, should be
exposed to the publick view of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jews. Reason did require,
and all the Prophets had foretold, that
the Messias should pass through a double
State, that is of Humiliation and Glory.
In his State of Humiliation, before his
Death, he had undergone all the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Ignominies and Calamities, to
which humane Nature is subject. He
was pressed with the want of the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
of Life, was afflicted with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults,
Provocations and Injuries of the
Jews, was delivered up into the Hands
of wicked Men to be treated at their
Pleasure. To these meritorious Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings


<pb n="477" facs="tcp:34506:242"/>
was to ensue a State of Glory;
wherein Christ should be placed far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Rank and the Power of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Men, should be exempted from the
infirmities of Nature, and enter upon an
everlasting Kingdom. This State of
Exaltation was begun in his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
perfected by his Ascension, and
continued without interruption to all
Ages.</p>
            <p>It was not then agreeable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Honour, that the Sacred Body of
the ever Blessed Jesus now exalted to a
State of Glory, should be again subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Attempts and Persecution of
the Jews. That it should be exposed to
the rage of Men, and reduced to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
mean Condition. Yet all this could
not have been avoided, if Christ had
appeared publickly among the People af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Resurrection. The same Hatred
and Persecution would have returned,
unless he had pleased by a Miracle to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue
his Body from their Attempts. A
Miracle indeed was no less easie to his
Almighty Power, than any other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Operation. Yet the Honour of
God is concerned not to work Miracles,
but for great Reasons; and the Impiety
of that People deserved not to have a


<pb n="478" facs="tcp:34506:243"/>
Miracle conferred on them: Or had
Christ appeared openly among them,
even altho he could have been secured
from their Persecution, it must either
have been in his former meek and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Habit; and as such, they would have
despised him; or what they greedily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
as a glorious Prince, armed with
Power and temporal Greatness; and that
was contrary to his Design, who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his Kingdom not to be of this
World.</p>
            <p>Nor in this respect only was the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
appearing of Christ after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
contrary to his Design for which
he came into the World. To have then
publickly manifested himself for this
purpose, to have removed the incredulity
of the Jews, and convinced them of the
Truth of his Mission, would have been
to have continued his Prophetical Office
after his Crucifixion: For therein did his
Prophetical or Ministerial Office consist,
in declaring the Will of God, in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Repentance, in converting of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
This Office was to expire with his
Life; and after his Resurrection, his
State of Glory, and therewith his Regal
Office was to commence. Upon which
account, himself when ready to expire


<pb n="479" facs="tcp:34506:243"/>
upon the Cross, said, <hi>It is finished.</hi> All
the parts of his Ministerial Office were
now fully compleated, not to be perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
renewed again. He had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all that the Divine Wisdom had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to be effected by him in Person,
towards the Conversion and Salvation of
the World; the rest he was to commit
to his Apostles and their Successours.
Himself was no longer to remain in <hi>the
form of a Servant,</hi> which he had taken
on him; but entring upon his Kingdom,
to govern that Church which he by
his former Preaching and Death had
founded. I proceed to the second Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
namely.</p>
            <p>II. That even if Christ, after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surection,
had appeared and conversed
Publickly, it would yet have failed to
produce an universal Conviction, and
remove all Doubts. This is undeniably
manifest in respect of our selves, for
whom we are most concerned, and of
all Ages subsequent to that time: For
allowing that the whole Nation of the
Jews had been ocular Witnesses of the
Resurrection of Christ, yet all other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
both of that and all succeeding
Ages, would have had no other Proof than
what we now have, that is, the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony


<pb n="480" facs="tcp:34506:244"/>
of those who saw him after his
Resurrection. All others, even in that
case, would have equally wanted the
Demonstration of Sense, and must have
depended upon the Relation of others.
So that all the certainty which any can
have of Matters seen and related by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
we have; unless we imagine that
<hi>five hundred</hi> cannot as certainly judge of
a plain Matter of Fact as so many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.
And even if so many millions
had seen it, we should not have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that every one should severally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to writing, and so testifie it to us;
we must still have relied upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of some few Historians, and that
in this case we have. So that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the number of ocular Witnesses
was then confined to <hi>five hundred;</hi> we
who were not Blessed with that Sight,
have the same Evidence of it, as if all
the Members of Mankind then living
had seen it.</p>
            <p>Whatever force therefore the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might have in that Age, it hath none
in ours. We have sufficient Arguments
offered to us to prove the Truth of it;
equal and even Superiour to those, upon
which we believe the Truth of any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact, which our selves did not see.


<pb n="481" facs="tcp:34506:244"/>
And if we reject these Arguments, it is
not probable that even Demonstration
would move us, if it could be had.</p>
            <p>For whatever Men may pretend in
excuse of their Infidelity, it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that he who will not believe what
is proposed to him upon reasonable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
but probable Motives, will not even
yield to Demonstration, if the Truth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
opposeth his Lusts and Passions.
And this indeed is the true cause of all
those Doubts, which unreasonable Men
produce in defence of their unbelief. It
would be too gross and shameless to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
the true Cause, and alledge that they
will not submit to the Yoke of Religion,
because it checks their Vices, restrains
their Lusts, forbids the Gratification of
many beloved Passions. They would
gladly be esteemed to act Reasonably in
shaking off this encumbrance from them;
and therefore pretend they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Divinity of that Religion which
lays it on them. Whereas in truth, they
seldom consider the Arguments recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the Truth of any Religion,
least the Obligation of it also should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into their Minds. Or if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
avoid the Thoughts of it, yet their
Wills struggle against their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
They would esteem it the greatest


<pb n="482" facs="tcp:34506:245"/>
Unhappiness which can befal them, to
be thoroughly convinced of that Truth,
which if obeyed, would deprive them
of all their darling Pleasures.</p>
            <p>For the Truth of what I here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
I appeal to your own Experience.
View all these Scepticks in Religion, and
see if you can find any in all your Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
who make any Conscience of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
moral Vertues, of being Chast,
Temperate, and Just. It is the Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and enforcing of these Vertues,
which hath made the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
grievous and distasteful to such Men;
not the want of Evidence of the Truth
of it. These Pretenders are seldom of
such raised Capacities as to discern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
true and false reasoning, with
greater accuracy than other Men; or to
discover the weakness of an Argument,
which before their Sagacious Enquiry
was universally allowed. They wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betray their Judgment, or rather the
Pretence of it, to the depraved inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Wills; which that they
may enjoy, they are content to undergo
the Ignominy of groping at Noon-day,
and not discovering a Truth set in so
great a Light. But this Consideration
being more general, I dismis it; only
reminding you how unjustly an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="483" facs="tcp:34506:245"/>
is raised by these Men from Christ's
not publickly appearing after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
since if he had so done, the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his Resurrection at this distance
of time could have been no more than
now it is.</p>
            <p>Farther, not only would the publick
appearance of our Lord after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
have been of no advantage to <hi>us;</hi>
but would even have failed of convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
at least converting the Jews, who
should have been Spectators of it. The
Jews had continued their Infidelity not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
so many hundred Miracles,
that it could not be hoped the Addition
of one Miracle more should create a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
among them. They had rejected
all those many undeniable Proofs, which
our Lord was pleased to offer to them in
Testimony of his Divine Mission; and
after the long Experience of such a strange
Perverseness, it is scarce credible, that
the Resurrection alone should effect, what
all other Arguments and Proofs joyned
together could not perform.</p>
            <p>In the first Place, the Prophesies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Old Testament, (to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority of which the Jews did
own Submission) all the Predictions and
Descriptions concerning the Messias deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered


<pb n="484" facs="tcp:34506:246"/>
in it, were to them the most cogent
Argument, which could be offered. By
the Concurrence and Completion of all
these Prophesies in the Person of Jesus,
it did so evidently appear, that he was
the Christ, that they could not deny it,
without proclaiming at the same time
their disbelief of those sacred Oracles.
And then as our Lord truly said in a not
unlike Case; <hi>If they would not believe</hi>
Moses <hi>and the Prophets, neither would they
have been perswaded, though one rose from
the dead;</hi> although himself had rose from
the Grave in the sight of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If the greatest Argument had no
effect upon their Minds, lesser Proofs
would certainly lose their Force.</p>
            <p>However, because it may with some
shew of Reason be alledged, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Concurrence of the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
in his Person were in the Nature
of things the better Argument; yet that
Miracles as being more surprizing, and
more affecting the Mind of Man, were
the more effectual Demonstration; let us
compare the Miracles of Christ wrought
before his Crucifixion, with the Evidence
which would have been produced by his
Resurrection, if he had been pleased vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
to manifest it to the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Jews.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="485" facs="tcp:34506:246"/>
The number of Miracles, which we
find recorded in the Evangelists, is very
great; and yet St. <hi>John</hi> assureth us, That
what is written contains but a small part
of the Actions of Christ. Every one of
these Miracles gave as full a Proof of that
Divine Power by which they were
wrought, as the Resurrection could have
done.</p>
            <p>The Resurrection indeed is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more considerable to us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
than any other Miracle; because
it is the assurance of our own Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the entrance of our Lord upon his
state of Glory: But to Unbelievers, it is
of no more Efficacy than the many other
Miracles wrought by him.</p>
            <p>What could be more admirable than
that he commanded the Elements, <hi>the
winds and the seas, and they obeyed him:</hi> That
he removed Infirmities, and cured all
manner of Diseases immediately and by
a single Command? What greater Proof
could be offered of his own Divinity, than
that he did this by his own Authority,
without invoking the name of God, or
intreating his Presence? If stupendious
Acts were required; what more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
than his feeding whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
with a few Loaves? If nothing


<pb n="486" facs="tcp:34506:247"/>
less than the sensible Experience of his
raising the Dead to Life could convince
them, what more notorious than the
raising of <hi>Lazarus</hi> known to the whole
City of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> than the raising of
the Widows Son of <hi>Naim,</hi> performed in
Presence of the whole City attending
him to his Grave; than the Bodies of
Saints departed arising at his Crucifixion,
entring into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and appearing
unto many?</p>
            <p>If in all his Miracles precedent to his
Death, the Jews not able to deny the
Fact, pretended they were done by a
Diabolick Power, (a Pretence more than
once alledged in their own <hi>Talmud</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
at this day, and published by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
the same Pretence would with
equal Reason have been retained after his
Resurrection. For if the absolute dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of Life and Death were to them,
the only confessed Proof of a truly Divine
Power, it was offered to them in raising
those to Life, whom I before mentioned.
Although by other Arguments he had
given abundant Demonstration, that he
acted not by any Commission from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
Spirits. The whole Design of his
Doctrine tended to overthrow the Power
and Dominion of the Devil; to root out


<pb n="487" facs="tcp:34506:247"/>
Idolatry and Sin, whereby Mankind was
held Captive to the Devil; to establish
Truth and Piety, than which nothing
could be more contrary to the interest of
Hell. His Miracles consisted chiefly in
casting out Devils from the Bodies of
unhappy Persons, whom they had pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed,
than which nothing could be
more ungrateful to them: in relieving
the Wants and curing the Infirmities of
Mankind, than which nothing could be
more opposite to their Practice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
who always endeavoured the
Destruction, but never the benefit of
Mankind.</p>
            <p>This same Power of working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
he communicated to his Disciples
long before his Crucifixion; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth
the idle Pretence of the Jews in
the <hi>Talmud,</hi> that his miraculous Power
was a personal Quality, obtained by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding
a Spell placed of old by <hi>Solomon</hi>
in the Temple. All these Proofs of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power, our Lord had exercised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Jews for three years together;
and that not in private, in a corner, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his own Followers, but in all the
great Cities of that Nation, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of multitudes, in their Streets and
Synagogues, before the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,


<pb n="488" facs="tcp:34506:248"/>
the most Learned, and discerning
Men among them; in the solemn Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals
and Concourse of the Jews at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
where <hi>every Male</hi> was bound <hi>to
appear three times a year before the Lord,</hi>
and where Christ never failed to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and to declare his Mission by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
and by Oral teaching. So that
it is not improbable but that every Male
of <hi>Judea,</hi> arrived to Man's Estate, had
at the time of his Death personally seen
some Miracle wrought by him. Even
at his Death, such manifest Indications of
his Divinity appeared, that an unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
Heathen, the Roman Centurion, who
guarded his Cross, could not forbear to
confess <hi>that he was the Son of God,</hi> that is,
in the Language of the Heathens, a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Person.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding all these Proofs
and Miracles, it was found that the
Jews retained their Infidelity; that far
from being converted by them, even
while the Sense of them remained, they
did affront and revile him; accused him
of Combination with the Devil, even
while they saw him cast out Devils;
and were scandalized at his Doctrine,
even before they had digested the Bread,
wherewith he had miraculously fed
them; as we read, <hi>Joh.</hi> VI.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="489" facs="tcp:34506:248"/>
What then could be concluded from
this whole Carriage of the Jews, but that
they were a People, whom no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
could perswade, no Miracles could
affect; who deserved no farther to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
by God, and who would have
treated the visible Resurrection of Christ,
with no less Contempt than they had
done his former Miracles.</p>
            <p>It is at first sight somewhat incredible
indeed, that Man endued with a rational
Soul could possibly so far deprave his
Reason, as to withstand such powerful
Arguments, and deny the Truth set in so
clear a Light. And some have not fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hereupon to object to the whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the Life of Christ, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
he should have wrought so many
Miracles; since had he done it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be conceived that the Jews should
disbelieve him, and deny Assent to his
Revelations. But alas! who can account
for the Perverseness of the Will of Man,
or the Failures of his Understanding?
A little reflection upon our own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of humane Life will convince us, how
gross, and to us unaccountable Errors,
many Men commit: How often a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which seems most clear and evident
to us, when proposed to others, cannot


<pb n="490" facs="tcp:34506:249"/>
or will not be understood by them.</p>
            <p>To recurr to more particular Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
this very Nation of the Jews con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
stubborn, incredulous, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
amidst all the Miracles, which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
wrought in the sight of them. They
murmured against him, even while they
subsisted by his miraculous Ministry;
and notwithstanding all the wonderful
Benefits and Punishments of God daily
visible to them for Forty years together,
often renounced their Allegiance to the
true God.</p>
            <p>Nor are they the former Ages only,
which have committed such prodigious
Mistakes; even in our own Age, we
have no less eminent Instances of unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Corruption of understanding
in some Men, which because they are
ordinary and common we cease to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at; but in Truth had the Ancients
by Revelation foreseen them, they would
have no less admired the Folly of subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Ages, than we now do the Errors
of precedent times.</p>
            <p>To name only one now among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
who could have then believed,
that in the latter times of the World,
there should exist a large Society of Men,
who should pretend to eat their God,


<pb n="491" facs="tcp:34506:249"/>
to devour his Body ten thousand times,
and yet retain it whole; to divide it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
as many parts, every one of which
should be equal to the whole; and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
other like Absurdities? And yet this
we know the Papists do.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it ought not to be
concluded, that because such a Perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Will or Corruption of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot be well conceived by us, or
seems incredible to us, judging according
to the Nature of the things themselves;
that therefore it is impossible Mankind
should be ever Guilty of them. For it
doth appear, that there is no Error so
gross, no Miscarriage so enormous, which
Man may not commit. And that if the
Jews had seen and handled the Body of
Christ after his Resurrection, it is more
than possible, that they who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
so many antecedent Proofs, would
have been insensible of this also; but it
is most certain, that they were not
worthy, to whom such a Favour should
be granted.</p>
            <p>It remains, That I speak to the third
and last Consideration, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
our Lord vouchsafed not to the
unbelieving World, the visible Presence
of his Body after his Resurrection; yet


<pb n="492" facs="tcp:34506:250"/>
that he hath by other Methods offered to
Mankind sufficient Arguments of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Conviction of the truth of it.
This was absolutely necessary not only
in Relation of the rest of the World,
who had not seen his precedent Miracles;
but also in regard of his undertaking to
the unbelieving Jews, whom demanding
a Sign from him, he had referred to his
Resurrection from the Dead after three
days continuance in the Grave. And
this he hath effectually performed by
the Testimony of unexceptionable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
his Apostles and other Discliples;
who as they were well assured of the
Truth of it themselves, so they were
fitted and enabled to testifie it to the
World, beyond all Contradiction.</p>
            <p>They had seen and Familiarly convers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their Lord after his Resurrection;
handled his Body; clearly perceiv'd that
a rational Soul was united to it, and the
Divinity to both, as before his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
They were afterwards enabled
to testifie this to all Nations of the World,
by the gift of Tongues; and to do it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully,
by the Power of working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
not only conferred upon themselves,
but upon whomsoever they laid their
hands for that Purpose. They confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb n="493" facs="tcp:34506:250"/>
the Truth of their Testimony by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
laying down their Lives, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing
all the Hardships of Life; the
Persecution of the Jews, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of Heathen Philosophers; all
which none can be supposed to have been
done without an inward Conviction of
the Truth of what they Preached. And
if they were indeed so convinced, it is
impossible that in forming their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it they should have been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken.
Or if it can be imagined, that
any should be so Vain-glorious, as to
forego the Pleasures of Life, and suffer
a Death in defence of what they knew
to be false, yet are we not in this Case
permitted to believe it, by Reason of
the many and wonderful Miracles
wrought by them, by the various Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the Holy Ghost working in
them, and communicated by them; by
which God himself gave a concurrent
Testimony to the Resurrection of Christ
preached by them, and set to his Seal,
that what they taught and affirmed was
true. But of this Head, I need add no
more, having more largely treated of it
in my Discourse upon <hi>Easter-day,</hi> which
I will not repeat.</p>

upon the Possession of his Kingdom; but
also by those eminent Benefits, which the

whole Church received from it, the Gift
of the Holy Ghost, the Confirmation of
Faith, and the increase of Hope.</p>
            <p>In Discoursing of it, I will confine

            <p>I. That it was necessary our Lord should
leave the Earth, and ascend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
himself often declared, and in <hi>Joh.</hi>
XVI. 7. gives the Primary Reason of it.
<hi>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for you, that I go away; for if I
go not away, the Comforter will not come
unto you; but if I depart, I will send him
unto you.</hi> The Mission of the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that is, the Holy Ghost, was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary, and the necessity of it
confessed by the Disciples of Christ;
yet could not this be effected, untill
Christ should ascend into Heaven. It
was convenient for the Apostles that
the Comforter should be sent, as by
whom they received a most invincible
Confirmation of their Faith and their
Hopes.</p>
            <p>What greater Consolation can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined


<pb n="496" facs="tcp:34506:252"/>
to Disciples afflicted for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of their beloved Lord, than to
receive such an infallible Assurance of his
Being placed in Power and Glory in
Heaven, as did arise from the eminent
Operations of Divine Power brought
down by the Holy Ghost at his Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
What stronger Confirmation of
their Faith could they receive, than that
the Promises of their Master concerning
a Comforter were effected, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
the Truth of all he had said,
the actual Possession of that Glory, which
was vailed in the Infirmities of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, while he conversed upon
Earth, and the Prevalency of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
with God the Father in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half?
What more could be desired to
assure them of the continuance of their
Masters Love after his Departure, or to
enable them successfully to discharge
that Office of converting an unbelieving
World, which was imposed on them;
than that such Gifts should be conferred
on them, as were never before vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
unto Mankind; the knowledge of
all Tongues, the Faculty of speaking
Eloquently and Boldly, and the Power
of working Miracles? All these Reasons
made it convenient and desirable to the


<pb n="497" facs="tcp:34506:252"/>
Apostles, that the Comforter should be
sent unto them.</p>
            <p>To the whole Church this was much
more necessary, which without that Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
could never have had Existence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
founded and maintained by those
Divine Gifts and Influences, which were
derived from thence. Yet neither could
the Apostles, nor the Church have been
Blessed with this so necessary, so often Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
and so much to be desired Mission
of the Holy Ghost, had not our Lord first
ascended into Heaven, and there by his
Power and Intercession have procured
it. The Comforter, as he was to be the
Advocate, the Deputy, to plead the Cause
of Christ on Earth, could not naturally
take place but in his Absence; and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Mission of him, as it was an Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Power, could not be administred by
Christ until he had taken Possession of his
Kingdom, which commenced at his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension
into Heaven.</p>
            <p>Nor is this the only Reason, which
made it convenient for the Church, that
our Lord should remove his visible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from us; but the Possibility, at least,
the increase of Man's Reward did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon it. The Design of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Messias so long expected was


<pb n="498" facs="tcp:34506:253"/>
known and confessed to be to restore the
lost Happiness of Mankind, to redeem
them from their former Misery, and to
advance them to a State of Glory. In
prosecution of this Design, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
either the Wisdom of God, or the
Nature of Man, it could not but be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that this Happiness should be
affixed to certain Rules, consequent to
certain Conditions to be performed by
Man; not indifferently bestowed on all,
nor yet on any without Respect to their
peculiar Merits. The Application of it
was to be directed and determined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the right use of Reason and
Free-will in every Man. The whole of
this consists in Obedience to the Laws of
God, and one great Branch of it, in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to his Authority, and believing
all his Revelations. And as an Assent
to all the Revelations of God, made at
all times, was the Duty of Man; so
more especially an Assent to those last
and most considerable Revelations made
by his own Son incarnate was required
of Man, and was farther intended to
qualifie him for the Reception of that
super-natural Happiness, which was by
him to be conveyed unto the World:
Since no greater Evidence of a right use


<pb n="499" facs="tcp:34506:253"/>
of Reason and Veneration of the Divine
Majesty could be offered, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after, to Assent to, and obey the
Revelations communicated by him.</p>
            <p>It would be tedious and unnecessary
to repeat those great Commendations of
this eminent Act of right Reason call'd
Faith, and those many Promises of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
annexed to it, which may be found
in the Scripture. But from the whole
it appeareth, that this was to be the
principal Condition of the Justification,
and therein of the Happiness of Man.
That this Act therefore might be the
more Illustrious, and might be Crowned
with a more noble Reward, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
that Christ should withdraw his
visible Presence from the World, and
therein give way to the Operation of
Faith, <hi>which is the Evidence of things not
seen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had Christ continued for ever upon
Earth in that glorious Majesty, which
was to take place after his Resurrection;
had he presented to the Senses of every
Man sensible Demonstrations of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power; in that Case, to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
on him, would have been no
more praise worthy, no more meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
than to assent to the ordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of Sense.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="500" facs="tcp:34506:254"/>
Who ever pretended to have acquired
Merit by believing an Axiom of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Demonstrations? Or who ever
thought it an Argument of a true and
just <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>anagement of the Will and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
to believe that one Colour dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
from another, or that the <hi>Sun
doth shine?</hi> These things strike our
Senses, and force a Belief whether we
will or no; in this Case, to offend while
the Soul enjoys its Reason, and the Body
the Organs of Sense, is not so much as
possible.</p>
            <p>To have believed the Divinity of
Christ, while the Sense of an illustrious
Miracle wrought by him was yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
to confess he came in the Flesh,
while his Body was yet visible; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his Resurrection from the
Dead, when the Senses of every Man
proclaimed no less; all this would have
been so slight an Argument of the right
use of Reason, so little deserving any
Commendation or Reward, that it would
be no more than the necessary result of
the Faculties, and even not in the Power
of the Will to avoid.</p>
            <p>But when the Object is removed from
the Sense, and yet discovered by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
when the Eye doth not see what


<pb n="501" facs="tcp:34506:254"/>
the Affections still embrace, when the
Soul ceaseth not to hope upon probable
and just Motives, what it never received
by Demonstration of Sense; this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a noble Act of right Reason, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a spiritual Being, and worthy of a
Divine Reward. And such a Reward
hath our Lord annexed to it; pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
<hi>Joh.</hi> XX. 29. <hi>Blessed are they that
have not seen, and yet have believed.</hi> This
Blessedness Christ by his Ascension hath
communicated to the whole Church;
which without that, had wanted the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
of a rational and well grounded
<hi>Faith,</hi> to acquire the Favour of God.</p>
            <p>Further the Ascension of our Lord,
and therein his Exaltation to the supreme
Degree of Glory, was in Justice due to
his precedent meritorious Sufferings;
which are therefore assigned as the
cause of his Exaltation by St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
Phil. II. <hi>He made himself of no Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and took upon him the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>wherefore God also hath highly
exalted him,</hi> &amp;c. The Humility mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
by him in his Incarnation, in the
whole Course of his Life, and in his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
infinitely surpassed all the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of former times. That the Son of
God should vouchsafe to descend from
his Seat of Glory in Heaven, to leave the


<pb n="502" facs="tcp:34506:255"/>
Bosom of the Father, and cloath himself
with the Infirmities of humane Nature;
that in this Nature he should not take
upon him the Majesty of a Prince, nor
so much as allow himself the ordinary
Satisfactions and Pleasures of it; but live
an afflicted Life, and die a shameful
Death; and all this for his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
who far from deserving such a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
from him, had rebelled against him
from their Creation, would lay violent
hands upon themselves, and continue
their Contempt of his Authority till the
Dissolution of all things; this was such
an extraordinary Humiliation, that none
other but the Son of God could have
effected: And therefore was in Justice
to be Crowned with such a Reward, as
none but the Son of God could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
namely, that that Body, which
had been thus depressed, should be raised
above all Creatures, should be placed
above Angels and Archangels, should
be advanced to the immediate Presence
of God, should for ever remain united
to the Divine Nature, and therewith be
translated into the principal Seat and
Throne of the Deity, that is, into Heaven.</p>
            <p>Lastly, To name no more Reasons;
it was necessary for Christ to ascend into
Heaven, that so he might <hi>fulfill all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi>


               <pb n="503" facs="tcp:34506:255"/>
perform all which the ancient
Prophets had foretold of the Messias, or
he had denounced of himself. It was
long since Typified by the Ceremonies
used by the High Priest among the Jews
in the Day of Propitiation; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
the Final Attonement to be
made by Christ for the Sins of the World.
It was commanded by God, that the
High Priest should enter but once every
year into the Holy of Holies, that is, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Day, when with the Blood of
the Sacrifice he passed thro' the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
and the parts of it into that place.</p>
            <p>It was a received Opinion among the
Jews, that the Holy of Holies represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Heaven of Heavens, and the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
this visible World. From which
Opinion joyned with the legal Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of that day, it appeared, as the
Author of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
argueth, IX. 11, 12. <hi>That the High Priest
of the good things to come, by a greater
and more perfect Tabernacle not made with
hands, was to enter into the holy place, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obtained eternal Redemption for us:</hi>
That he should lay down his Life as an
Expiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of the
People, and being slain should pass thro'
all the Stages of this World here below,


<pb n="504" facs="tcp:34506:256"/>
and ascending into the highest Heavens,
the Throne of the Divine Majesty, should
there present his Blood; Blood of that
inestimable value, as need not be shed
and presented every year; but <hi>as he once
appeared in the</hi> lower <hi>World to put away
sin by the Sacrifice of himself;</hi> so once for
all he ascended into the higher Heavens,
not to appear again, until he shall come
in the Clouds with Majesty and great
Glory, to judge the quick and Dead.</p>
            <p>The same was fortold by the Prophet
<hi>David,</hi> Psal. LXVIII. 18. and from
thence urged by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Ephes. IV. 8.
<hi>Thou hast ascended up on high</hi> (into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as it is in the common Acceptation
of the Original word) <hi>thou hast led
Captivity Captive, thou hast received Gifts
for Men.</hi> A Prophesie, which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the Pretences of the Jews,
can neither be applied to <hi>Moses,</hi> nor to
<hi>Joshua,</hi> nor to <hi>David</hi> himself, nor to any
illustrious Conqueror of that Nation,
who never ascended into Heaven, but to
Christ alone; who really and bodily
ascended into the highest Heaven, unto
the Throne of the Majesty of God.</p>
            <p>By his Death and Resurrection he
subdued Sin, Death, Hell and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
and in his Ascension visibly trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed


<pb n="505" facs="tcp:34506:256"/>
over them, and led them Captive.
When that Body, which by the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of it self had destroyed Sin, was in
Reward of that meritorious Suffering,
advanced into Heaven, there to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
present with God; when that
Body which had been subjected to Death,
and afterwards was raised from it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
now a certain Proof of its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
was raised into Heaven, where
is no place of Corruption left; when the
Captain of Man's Salvation visibly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
unto the eternal Place of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
having first Promised to draw all
his faithful Followers after him; and
from whence he dispensed the precious
and glorious Gifts of the Holy Ghost to
the Sons of Men.</p>
            <p>If these Prophesies and Types foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and prefiguring the Ascension of the
Messias should seem obscure, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied, that the Messias was to
receive a glorious Kingdom. This, we
are well assured, the Nature of our Lords
Office, the Design of his Coming, the
Dignity of his Person permitted him not
to receive on Earth; and therefore it
was necessary he should ascend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
there to take Possession of it.</p>
            <p>It had been a mean Reward to his


<pb n="506" facs="tcp:34506:257"/>
Humility, Patience, and Sufferings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
his Resurrection, to have been
advanced to a temporal Kingdom, to be
dignified with a Reward common oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to the worst of Men. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this World was inconsistent with
his Design, the Pleasures of it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
by him; and that Divinity, which
was no longer to be clouded or depressed,
but to shine forth in its full Lustre,
could find no fit Habitation upon Earth,
which in Scripture is faid to be <hi>the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool
of God.</hi> Upon all these Reasons, it
was necessary, just, and convenient that
Christ should ascend into Heaven.</p>
            <p>II. And that he really did ascend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(which was the 2d. Head proposed)
evidently appeared, from the History of
his Ascension recorded in the Gospels and
Acts of the Apostles. That Body of
Christ which the Apostles had <hi>felt and
handled,</hi> that with which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
<hi>for forty days together,</hi> that whereof
they were assured <hi>by many infallible Proofs,</hi>
that it was no other than the material
Body of Christ which hung upon the
Cross, and was laid in the Grave, which
was united to the Soul again, and had
performed all manner of vital Actions;
that very Body they saw ascend into


<pb n="507" facs="tcp:34506:257"/>
Heaven. For that Jesus, who had rose
again and conversed with them, who had
led them out of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and present to them till the very
moment of his Ascension, as he was yet
speaking with them, <hi>was parted from
them and carried up into Heaven;</hi> as we
read, <hi>Luk.</hi> XXIV. Which refutes the
Opinion of those ancient Hereticks, who
taught that Christ ascended in Spirit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
having first put off and returned to
the several Elements that Body, which
he had received from them.</p>
            <p>Again that Body, which the Apostles
saw and felt to be locally present with
them upon Earth, they saw soon after to
be really removed from the Earth and
carried into Heaven. For as it is related
in the sacred History, <hi>When he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
unto the Disciples and blessed them</hi>
(which being performed by laying his
hands upon them, testified his real and
corporeal Presence with them in that
moment; in the next moment, even)
<hi>while he blessed them, he parted from them,
and while they beheld he was taken up, and
a cloud received him out of their sight.</hi>
Which proved his Ascension to have
been a true proper and local Translation
from the parts here below to those above;


<pb n="508" facs="tcp:34506:258"/>
and that at that moment he was indued
with a perfectly humane Body, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
glorious Changes it underwent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
its Reception into Heaven, the Seat
of Immortality and Spiritual Beings.
Other Circumstances deserve to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the History of this Ascension,
And</p>
            <p>First, Our Lord at his Ascension was
pleased to call together many, if not all
his Disciples, and admit them to the
sight of it; a Favour which was not
vouchsafed to them at his Resurrection.
The Conduct indeed was different, but
the Reason not unlike in both Cases.
Both the Resurrection and Ascension of
Christ were thenceforth to pass into ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles of Belief, to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
supports of the Faith and Hopes of
Mankind; both therefore was to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
beyond all doubt and contradiction,
by the Attestation of many and credible
Witnesses.</p>
            <p>To effect this at his Resurrection, it
was not necessary that any witnesses
should be present; since the Actions of
Life, visibly and in the Presence of many,
performed by him after his known Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion
and Burial, abundantly and even
demonstratively proved, that he was


<pb n="509" facs="tcp:34506:258"/>
really risen from the Dead. They were
well assured, that some few days before he
was truly Dead, their Senses assured them
that he was now truly alive: Whence
they might as certainly conclude that he
was risen from the Dead, as if they had
actually seen his Resurrection.</p>
            <p>Whereas in the Case of his Ascension,
he was to be taken from them, no more
to be seen by them in this Life; no
Mortal was thenceforward to see his
State of Glory, or testifie his Station in
Heaven: upon which account it was
absolutely necessary that his Disciples
should be present at his Ascension, and
be Eye-witnesses of that Action, which
afterwards they were to testifie and
preach to others.</p>
            <p>In the second Place, it deserveth to be
observed, that the Testimony of Angels
was added to that of the Apostles. Those
blessed Spirits, far from repining that
the Nature of Man in Christ was by his
Ascension exalted to a superior Degree
of Glory, descended from Heaven to
bear the glad Tidings of his Arrival
there, as at his Nativity they had done
to proclaim the Descent, of the Deity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth. For it follows, Acts I. 10. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
two Men stood by them in white Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,


<pb n="510" facs="tcp:34506:259"/>
which also said, Ye Men of Galilee,
why stand ye gazing up into Heaven. This
same Jesus which is taken up from you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven, shall so come in like manner,
as ye have seen him go into Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was this Apparition of Angels
an empty Pageant or an unnecessary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to the Glory of our Lords Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
By their Ministry and Attendance,
they demonstrated the Divinity and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his Person; by their Testimony
concerning his Ascension, they proved the
truth of it. The Apostles indeed saw
him received upon the Clouds, they
looked up and followed him with their
Eyes, as far as their sight could reach;
but that being terminated in the lower
Regions, and not able to penetrate into
the highest Heavens, their Sense could
not assure them that their Lord was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
thither. To evidence therefore the
truth of it, it remained, that God by
these ministerial Spirits should declare it
to the Disciples.</p>
            <p>These Angels were wont to Minister
before and see the face of God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
they were known to come down
from thence. They testified that Christ
had ascended thither from whence they
had descended, and thereby perfected


<pb n="511" facs="tcp:34506:259"/>
the Testimony of the Disciples concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ascension of Christ into Heaven,
whose sight could not reach so far. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
these blessed Spirits, not only
brought Evidence to the Disciples of the
real Ascension of their Master into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but also gave them Comfort and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated
their sorrow conceiv'd for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
by adding those words, <hi>This same
Jesus, which ye have seen taken up from
you into Heaven, shall so come in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as ye have seen him go into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elisha</hi> had seen his Master <hi>Elijah</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
up into Heaven; yet knowing not
certainly how the Divine Goodness would
dispose of him, and despairing of ever
seeing him again, he entertained the
sight with Grief, and in Testimony of
it rent his Clothes. Nor had the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
been free from the same Anxiety,
without the present Consolations of these
Angels. When their Lord had before
his Death declared to them his Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of returning to the Father, (<hi>John</hi>
XVI.) they could not dissemble their
Grief, as himself observeth, Verse 6.
<hi>Because I have said these things unto
you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</hi> And
immediately before his Ascension, still


<pb n="512" facs="tcp:34506:260"/>
retaining their erroneous Opinion of a
temporal Kingdom to be founded by
him, they had asked him <hi>whether he
would</hi> not <hi>at that time restore the Kingdom
unto Israel,</hi> which hopes were totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
by his Departure into Heaven.</p>
            <p>Both these occasions of Sorrow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Angels happily do remove in
these words. They assure them that the
Presence of their Master shall not be for
ever taken from them, but themselves
should see him return in the last of days;
and that they may not imagine his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to be abolished, they add that he
shall return in like manner as they
saw him go, that is, in <hi>Power and great
Glory;</hi> as our Lord describeth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Judgment, <hi>Matth.</hi> XIII. 26. It will
be of little use to inquire into what part
of the Heavens the Body of our Lord
was translated; yet not unfit to observe,
that our Lord is said to have ascended
into those Heavens, by which the most
glorious Presence of the Divine Majesty
is in Scripture expressed. Thus it is said
of him, <hi>Ephes.</hi> IV. 10. <hi>He that descended
is the same also that ascended far above all
Heavens,</hi> and Hebr. VII. 10. <hi>That he
was higher than the Heavens,</hi> and Heb. IX.
12. <hi>passing into the holy place, even into


<pb n="513" facs="tcp:34506:260"/>
Heaven it self, to appear before the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God,</hi> that is, he was advanced to
the same state of Glory with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
his Body was translated to the place
of his more immediate Presence in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which is fully expressed by his <hi>sitting
at the right hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To determine the place, whether in
the third, in the fourth, or above the
Heavens, is rash and unwarrantable.
But this we may be assured, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
part of Heaven is the immediate resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Divine Majesty, whatsoever
Region is most Holy, whatsoever Place
is of greatest Dignity in those Celestial
Orbs; thither Christ ascended, and there
now Reigns in Glory.</p>
            <p>III. The Advantages, which the
Church and all the Members of it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Ascension of Christ, are
many and great. The first and most
eminent Benefit derived from it was the
Mission of the Holy Ghost, of which I
spoke before. A Benefit, which was indeed
more sensible in the Apostolick times,
when it communicated to many the gift
of Tongues, the power of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
or a prophetick Spirit; but is at
this day no less advantageous; since by
the Influences and Operations of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost the Church is still maintained,


<pb n="514" facs="tcp:34506:261"/>
the Faithful are enabled to perform their
Duty, and the unfaithful are converted.
Thus the Ascension of Christ became a
lasting Benefit to all his Followers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
to them those Graces, which
otherwise could never have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
The Ascension of <hi>Elijah</hi> made
one <hi>Elisha,</hi> left a double Portion of his
Spirit with one Disciple to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to no other; but the Ascension of
Christ was of universal Benefit, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
blessed Effects, which should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to all Believers, and to all Ages.</p>
            <p>A second Benefit of the Ascension of
our Lord, is the Confirmation of our
Faith, which from thence received firm
Assurance of the truth of his Doctrine
and the Divinity of his Person. He had
proclaimed to the unbelieving Jews, as
well as to his own Disciples, in the VI.
of St. <hi>John,</hi> that he would ascend into
Heaven. <hi>What and if ye shall see the Son
of Man ascend up where he was before?</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Resurrection he said unto the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<hi>Go to my brethren and say unto them,
I ascend unto my Father and your Father.</hi>
It was not therefore unexpected to the
Apostles, they were acquainted with his
Resolutions herein, and when they faw
effected what he had before foretold
them, they could no longer doubt that


<pb n="515" facs="tcp:34506:261"/>
he was the true Messias. Thus although
the prophetical Office of our Lord expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon the Cross; all his subsequent
Actions offered convincing Arguments
to Mankind of the truth of his Mission,
and the certainty of those things he
taught. No greater Proof of either
could be imagined than his Resurrection
from the Dead; and when to this was
added his Ascension into Heaven, there
was no more place left for doubt.</p>
            <p>Thus the Faith of the Apostles was
confirmed by the Ascension of Christ,
but their Hopes were much more
exalted. By this glorious Triumph they
saw him put into Possession of that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Power, which they so long wished
to be assumed by him, which might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
him to reward his Followers, and
effect those Promises which he had made
to them. In <hi>John</hi> XIV. he had told them
there were <hi>many Mansions in his Fathers
house;</hi> and that he <hi>went before to prepare
a place for them,</hi> intending to receive
them afterwards to himself, that <hi>where
he was, there they might be also.</hi> The
former part of the Promise they saw to
be effected in his Ascension, and thence
conceived assured Hope that the latter
would be accomplished.</p>
            <p>There can be no greater Motive to


<pb n="516" facs="tcp:34506:262"/>
believe the truth of Prophecies or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
than to consider the performance
of those which went before. The same
foreknowledge of our Lord, which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
the Exaltation of himself, could as
easily foresee the like Reward to be given
to his Followers; and the same Power
which advanced him to the right hand
of God, could exalt whomsoever he
pleased into Heaven. So that his Power
could not be questioned; and his Will
therein he had often declared, assuring
them, <hi>Joh.</hi> XII. 32. <hi>When I am lifted up
from the Earth, I will draw all Men unto
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein the Hopes of all Mankind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
increase and strength. They had
all impatiently wished for Immortality;
it was easie to believe that their Souls
should still exist; but their Bodies
were equally parts of themselves. They
were equally concerned for the future
Happiness of both; yet that either should
be hereafter Happy, they were assured
only by the Revelation of Christ. He
affirmed it, he promised it, he confirmed
it by wonderful Signs and Miracles; yet
it could not but seem strange, that <hi>Flesh
and Blood should inherit the Kingdom of
God;</hi> that such a gross corporeal Being
should be admitted to the Society of


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34506:262"/>
Angels; that Man who was exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from an Earthly Paradise, should be
taken up to the immediate Presence of
God. All this did seem incredible, till
they saw an Example of it in the Body
of Christ, which consisting of the same
Flesh and Blood, partaking of the same
Nature, was visibly received into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and placed in eternal Happiness.</p>
            <p>By this they were convinced, that
the like Immortality of their own Bodies
was not impossible; and while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
the Promises of Christ, and their
own Relation to him, that he was the
first Fruits of humane Nature, their <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
which is entred into Heaven for
them,</hi> the Captain of their Salvation, and
the Head of their Society; they were
fully satisfied that it should in time be
granted to them; since what he foretold
of his own Ascension they saw effected;
since it was but natural to follow their
Captain, their Head, and their Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and with him to be received into
the place of their desired Happiness.</p>
            <p>Farther, as Christ is our King and our
Priest, the Benefits which we hope to
receive from either of those his Offices,
received increase by his Ascension into
Heaven. As King, he is thereby invested


<pb n="518" facs="tcp:34506:263"/>
in the actual Dominion of his Church,
enabled to bestow upon her all those
Graces and extraordinary Assistances,
which are necessary for her Well-being.
As our Priest, his Intercessions with God
the Father in our behalf, are made much
more prevalent by his personal Presence
with him.</p>
            <p>Under the Law, the Efficacy of the
great Propitiatory Sacrifice depended
upon its being presented by the High
Priest, in the Holy of Holies, the place
where God was pleased to Promise his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Presence. How much more Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
then must be conceived to be the
Intercession of our High Priest; who not
once a year, but continually; <hi>not with
the Blood of Bulls or Goats, but with his
own Blood;</hi> not in an Earthly Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
but in the highest Heaven, maketh
Intercession for us? If the Mediation of
the Jewish High Priest could avert tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Punishments due to the Sins of the
People; much more will the Mediation
of our High Priest free Mankind from
eternal Punishments. If their Priest being
cloathed with the same Nature could
more sensibly commiserate the Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of his People; our's for the same
Purpose took our Nature on him. But


<pb n="519" facs="tcp:34506:263"/>
whereas their Priest was subject to the
Guilt of the same Sins for which he
interceded, our's knew no Sin; their's
was admitted no farther than to the
Symbols of God's Presence, to the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims
and the Mercy Seat, our's to the
very Throne of his Majesty; where he
continually pleadeth his Sufferings on our
behalf, diffuseth his Graces to us, and
prepareth Mansions for us.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if we consider Christ as the
great exemplar of humane Life, his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension
will upon that Account also be
of great use to us; teaching us with him
to exalt our Affections, to withdraw them
from the Earth, and to place them in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
This Inference the Apostle draweth
from his Resurrection and Ascension,
Colos. III. 1. <hi>If ye be risen with Christ, seek
those things which are above, where Christ
sitteth at the right hand of God.</hi> Christ
died to the World, to instruct us, that
we ought to mortifie our worldly Lusts,
to restrain and subdue to Reason the use
of Carnal Pleasures. He left the World
and Ascended into Heaven, to teach us
that there our Affections ought princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
to be fixed, that there our chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
is placed, and there only perfect
Happiness to be expected. Could the


<pb n="520" facs="tcp:34506:264"/>
Pleasures, the Power, and the Prosperity
of this World have given the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
Happiness; our Lord, who deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it by the most complete Obedience
which was ever paid, who was more dear
to God than all the Sons of Men, who
was himself <hi>heir of all things</hi> and <hi>Lord of
all,</hi> would have fixed his abode here, and
not removed it into Heaven. But when
immediately after his Exaltation, as soon
as he began to receive the Reward of his
Obedience and Sufferings, he forsook the
Earth, and returned unto the Bosom of
his Father, he hath thereby instructed
us, that in vain is true Felicity to be
sought here below; that this World can
afford no adequate recompence for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Piety; that we are indeed but
<hi>Strangers and Pilgrims upon the Earth;</hi>
and that as many as pursue the end of
their Creation, and study to be truly
Happy, ought to <hi>seek a better Countrey,</hi>
even that into which <hi>Christ the forerunner
is entred for us, that so where he is there we
may be also,</hi> receive the same Reward, and
be Crowned with the same Happiness;
that so as we have <hi>imitated</hi> his Ascension,
we may share in his Glory. <hi>Which God of
his infinite Mercy Grant.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words are part of our
Lord's Sermon upon the Mount,
which was directed to a mixed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Auditors, and treats altogether
of universal Duties incumbent upon all,
who receive the Doctrine, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Authority of him who spoke
it.</p>
            <p>Upon which Account we have just
reason to reject the Opinion of those,


<pb n="522" facs="tcp:34506:265"/>
who would restrain to the Apostles only
and their Successors, the Preachers of the
Gospel, the Duty prescribed in this and
the three foregoing Verses: which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
the Professors of Christianity,
not to confine the exercise of their Duty
to their single Breasts, or rest satisfied in
having discharged the Office of Piety in
secret; but to perform such eminent
Acts of Devotion, Temperance, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and so to direct them, as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Glory of God and Instruction
of Men.</p>
            <p>The whole preceding part of this
Sermon was directed to all Christians in
General, delivering the Promise of those
Beatitudes, in which all the Disciples of
Christ are equally concerned. What
follows, treats concerning the general
Laws of Justice, Temperance and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
so that with no good Reason can
these intermediate Verses be restrained to
the Apostles only. If they are here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>the Salt of the Earth,</hi> Verse 13. our
Lord addressed himself in the same
words <hi>to great multitudes,</hi> as we read,
<hi>Luk.</hi> XIV. 25. If they are stiled <hi>the
light of the World</hi> in the 14th. Verse;
St <hi>Paul</hi> applieth the same Expression
to the <hi>Philipians,</hi> II. 15. exhorting


<pb n="523" facs="tcp:34506:265"/>
them to be <hi>without rebuke in the midst of
a crooked and perverse Generation, shining
among them as Lights in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must be acknowledged indeed,
that the Apostles were, and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
in the ministerial Office ought to
be, more eminently, <hi>the Salt and Light
of the World,</hi> purging away the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
removing the darkness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
by Example and Instruction. To
effect this by their Doctrine, is peculiar
to them, not common to other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:
to promote it by their Example,
is a Duty common to them with all other
Christians.</p>
            <p>It is my present Purpose to treat of it
as an universal Duty; to which my
Text directs me, by placing the Light of
this Exemplariness, which is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not in verbal Instructions, but in
good Works, which are acknowledged
to be the Duty of all Christians. Of this
then I will Discourse under these four
Heads.
<list>
                  <item>I. The Duty imposed, such an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
Conduct, as may become <hi>a Light
of the World.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. The manner of being thus Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary,
<hi>by good Works.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="524" facs="tcp:34506:266"/>
III. The end, to which it ought to
be directed, <hi>the Glory of God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV. The good Effects of it, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Men, and Promotion of the
same <hi>good Works in others.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. Concerning the Duty, which is
that of an illustrious Example, to the
practice of which our Lord hath dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
us both by his Laws, and by his own
Example. He stiles himself, and truly
was, <hi>the Light of the World;</hi> he was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
under the Figure of <hi>the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi>
who should enlighten the
World with his Doctrines, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the Possibility of performing them
by his own Example. His Precepts
chiefly concern Moral Duties, which he
restored, first to their Primitive Notions
and Purity; and then urged the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of them upon his Followers, in a
more strict manner than had ever before
been done. What before was esteemed
an attempt fit only for great and noble
Minds, he made the Duty of all the
Members of Mankind: what others
thought a sufficient Glory to practise
singly, to excell in this or that single
Vertue, he required to be performed
conjunctly, without the Omission of any
thing which is justly to be accounted
laudable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="525" facs="tcp:34506:266"/>
For if we consider the great Lines
and main Parts of the Doctrine of
Christ, they will be found to direct
the Practice of those Actions, which
by all the World must be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be good and excellent, to be lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
and divine; such as are Justice,
Sobriety, Devotion and Charity. It
is not among Christians alone, that such.
Actions are esteemed Praise-worthy.
All Parties of sober Men, as well Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
as those professing revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
have agreed in this common
Sentiment, in the Veneration and Praise
of all such Vertues.</p>
            <p>From hence it was, that even when
the Heathens derided the Faith of
the Cross, they still acknowledged the
Excellency of those Persons, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
it. They also were convinced,
that all those moral Vertues were the
Perfection of Mankind: only in this
they disagreed; that whereas they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the uniform Practice of them
to be an undertaking possible only to
more exalted Minds, Christ had made
it the Duty of all his Followers. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
even this difference of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
could not but raise their Thoughts


<pb n="526" facs="tcp:34506:267"/>
to an extreme Veneration of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Person, who formed these Laws,
and even forced from them a Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Praise which was due to
such an Institution, and the Author
of it.</p>
            <p>Thus the very Nature of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Life, as it is directed by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of our Lord, fitteth it to be an
eminent Example to others. He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
his Religion from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by the Excellency of his Laws
and Precepts: so that whosoever
should observe them, must distinguish
themselves from the rest of the World,
by a more perfect exercise of Vertue
and Holiness. And hence it is, that
he naturally infers in the twentieth
Verse: <hi>Except your Righteousness ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the Righteousness of the Scribes and
Pharisees, ye shall in no Case enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Righteousness of the Scribes
and Pharisees was the exact perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of all the Legal Institutions of
the Mosaical Law, of Sacrifices, Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and other Ceremonies; which
(abstracting from the positive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God) had nothing excellent


<pb n="527" facs="tcp:34506:267"/>
in the Practice of them. To see the
Jews killing their Sacrificed Beasts,
washing their Bodies often or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
themselves, was no Motive of
Holiness, or giving Glory to God, to
those who were not of the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
They discerned nothing lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
in all this; and were rather
prompted to pity the Slavery, than to
imitate the Devotion of their Service.
Whereas the Practice of those good
Works, which Christianity imposeth
is amiable and lovely in the sight of all
Men, ever carrieth along with it the
Commendation and Approbation of
all Spectators.</p>
            <p>Thus our Lord fitted his Doctrine to
be a light to the World; and least it
should fail of its designed End, he hath
commanded us to improve it to its
right use, and therein hath led the way
by his own Example. He confined not
himself to a Desart, as did <hi>John</hi>
the <hi>Baptist;</hi> but conversed in their
Cities, and more frequented Meetings;
that all Men might see the constant
Piety, Goodness and Charity, which
attended all his Actions, be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by them, and drawn to the Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation


<pb n="528" facs="tcp:34506:268"/>
of them. He indulged his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
to Publicans and Sinners;
that he might gain them, first to a love
of his Person, and then to an imitation
of his Vertue. He disdained not the
Company of any, who might receive
advantage from his Doctrine or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>And that he might fit his Life for
an universal Pattern to all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
he engaged not in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Practice of extraordinary Auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
as did <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist;</hi> but
amidst the most severe and strict Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of all Vertues, allowed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the innocent Pleasures and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
of the World. He refused
not to sit down with those who invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to splendid Entertainments,
as with <hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Zacheus,</hi> nor to be
present at the Marriage-Feast. At
other times he was content to suffer
Hunger and Cold, Contempt and the
vilest Injuries, to undergo long watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Prayer and Fasting. For so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
him even in this Sense also, <hi>to
perform all Righteousness,</hi> who was to
be the grand Exemplar to all succeeding
Ages: Not to confine himself to any


<pb n="529" facs="tcp:34506:268"/>
one method of Life, least thereby his
Example should become deficient to
those who should be engaged in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but to pass through all the more
ordinary Actions and Varieties of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Life; that in all Cases we might
be able to approve and direct our
Actions, by conforming them to his
Practice, and if any doubt should arise
concerning them, might be able to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
them by the Authority of his
Example.</p>
            <p>Both the Observation therefore of the
Precepts, and the Imitation of the
Practice of Christ, which are equally
the Duty of every Christian, engageth
him to be exemplar in his Life and
Conduct. And thus first the whole
Body of Christians will become a light
to the rest of the World, and then
every Member of the Church to each
other. Our Lord describeth both in
this place very lively. <hi>Ye are the Salt
of the Earth,</hi> Verse 13. The rest of
the World will remain in Sin and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;
but in the numerous Society,
which I shall found and call by my
Name, Piety and Vertue, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is good and excellent, shall be


<pb n="530" facs="tcp:34506:269"/>
maintained: Yet not to be confined
to that Society alone, but to be
communicated to all who shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Instruction from it. <hi>Ye are the
light of the World,</hi> Verse 14. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of Mankind remain in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Ignorance; but I have placed
my Church, as a glorious Light to
dispel this Darkness, and remove this
Ignorance; that so all who do but lift
up their Eyes, have the least inclination
to Truth and Goodness, may there dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the light and repair to it. And
this cannot fail to take effect, while
the brightness of this Light shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
while the Church shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
glorious and unspotted, while the
Members of it shall all, or the more
part of them, perform their Duty. For,
as it followeth, <hi>a City placed on a Hill,</hi> or
a Light placed in a Room, <hi>cannot be hid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If indeed those Vertues, which I
command, be observed by those who
profess my Name; if Justice, Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Beneficence, and other Marks of
Goodness be indeed so eminently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
by so numerous a Body of Men;
it cannot be but the rest of Mankind
will take notice of it, and as many


<pb n="531" facs="tcp:34506:269"/>
as desire to be freed from Darkness,
will approach to this Light: Or if
thro' sloth and negligence they still
continue afar off, however they will
not be able to deny that they see the
Light; and must admire both it, and
the Author of it.</p>
            <p>Thus the meanest Christian may
make himself truly Exemplary, by
performing his Duty conscientiously in
the Station, in which God hath placed
him: Although his Understanding and
Abilities have not fitted him to be an
Example to others singly considered.
If he well dischargeth his single Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
although never so mean in the
Church, he contributeth to this great
Design of Christ, of making his
Church a light and example to the
unbelieving World; and, in so doing<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
performeth the Duty prescribed in this
place, and entituleth himself to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of it. Whereas every one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating
from this Rule, and violating
the Laws of Christ, concerning moral
or religious Actions, becometh a Spot
in this light, an Exception to the Plea
of the Church against Unbelievers. He
defeateth one of the chief Advantages,


<pb n="532" facs="tcp:34506:270"/>
which Christ proposed to produce in
founding of a Church; and thereby
becomes Guilty not only of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
of his own Soul, but also of
the miscarriage of all those Infidels or
prophane Persons, who miscarried for
want of discovering that Exemplari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Church, which was to have
convinced them.</p>
            <p>If the Institution of Christ herein
be in these latter Ages in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
defeated, and no such frequent or
sincere Effects of Conversion be to be
found; it may well be resolved into
this Cause, that by the disobedience
and vicious Lives of the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Members of the Church,
this once glorious Light is well nigh
covered with Spots, and almost turned
into Darkness.</p>
            <p>This Luminary of the Church, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
indeed was without Spots, even
in its greatest Vigour and Purity, in
the beginning of the Gospel: but
while the number of them was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
in Comparison of those who
performed their Duty, the Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Light which arose from thence
was scarce discernible. In succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="333" facs="tcp:34506:270"/>
times, as the number of wicked
Christians increased, the Light propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
diminished, until our days,
wherein the State of the first times of
Christianity is so far inverted, that the
number of pious Christians is very
small in respect of the others, and
thereby the Light of the Church is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
extinguished. Whosoever then
addeth to this remaining Light by his
own single Piety, doth the greater Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
and whoever detracts from it
by his ill Example, doth the greater
Mischief, because every Addition and
Diminution, is more sensible in a less
than a greater quantity of Light.</p>
            <p>Thus all Christians may become
Exemplar, in conspiring to complete the
Example of the Church to those who
are without it. For not every one is
fitted in particular, and singly to make
himself an Example to other Men.
Many things must concur to that,
which oftimes are not in the Power
of Man. The minds of other Men, on
whom his Example must be supposed
to have any influence, must be first
possessed with an opinion of his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or Authority, or any other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,


<pb n="534" facs="tcp:34506:271"/>
which may induce others to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Example. And where such Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
are found, the Obligation of being
Exemplar, becomes much more strict.
In that Case, he is not only to Act in
common as a Member of the Church,
but in particular also, as a Director
of all those, who may be influenced by
his Example. Such are Parents to
their Children, Masters to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
great Men to their Inferiors,
Kings to their Subjects, wise and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men, to those who have an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of their Wisdom and Learning.
All such are as Lights to those subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to them, whose Eyes are fixed
on them, and are wont to form Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
to themselves from their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <p>And this is what God particularly
requires of great and knowing Men, in
return for their Power and Wisdom,
that they employ it for the Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or Perswasion of others in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of their Duties; their Power
and their Knowledge, hath distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
them from the rest of Men, and
set them in an eminent Station, at least
in respect of those who are subjected,


<pb n="535" facs="tcp:34506:271"/>
or inferior to them; and therefore
every Action of them hath some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
but ordinarily every Habit
fixeth even a Rule to the Conduct
of Inferiors, of whom the most
part look no farther than to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
of those whom they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in Power or Knowledge to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
themselves. If <hi>they</hi> observe no
Rules of Order and Decency, <hi>these</hi>
cannot so much as know them. If
<hi>they</hi> practise forbidden Pleasures, or
give way to unlawful Passions; <hi>these</hi>
will lose even all Sense of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of them. They will not be
ashamed to practise what they see their
Superiors, the supposed Judges of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and Lawfulness, without fear to
pursue. If <hi>they</hi> conscientiously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Precepts of Religion, even
respect to their Persons, will engage
others in the same Course of Piety; as
being generally perswaded, that those
who are greater and wiser than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
are more enabled to discover
the means of attaining true Happiness.
Thus every good Man, fitted by the
Opinion of others concerning him for
being an Example to them, becomes a


<pb n="536" facs="tcp:34506:272"/>
publick Blessing. He enters not into
Heaven alone; but carrieth with him
the welcome Attendance of those,
whom his Example hath drawn thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with him.</p>
            <p>It is not indeed in the Power of all
Men to fit themselves for such Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars;
yet most Men are concerned in
this, as being Superior to some others,
who are ready to take Rules of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from them; and not a few are
placed in such eminent Stations, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
exceeding influence upon all those
who are seated under them. And
such, if careless of their Duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Snare, and the occasion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to all those, who by their
Example were betrayed into Sin.
They fall not alone, but like <hi>Lucifer</hi>
seated on an eminent Throne, draw
Legions of Apostate Angels with them
into Hell; for the miscarriage of all
whom they will be obliged to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
and cannot plead, as do those
Sinners who Act in the lowest Sphere,
that thereby they hurt themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
Rather the guilt of so many
Souls, ruined by their ill Example will
be laid to their Charge, and be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged


<pb n="537" facs="tcp:34506:272"/>
on them. It is frequently added
in Scripture to the Charge of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi>
as the utmost Aggravation of his
Crime, that <hi>he made Israel to sin.</hi> He
was not Guilty of a single Apostacy,
but drew the whole Nation into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
by his Power and Example.</p>
            <p>We need look no farther, than the
History of that and other Kings of the
Jews, to be convinced of the influence
of a great Example. For as often as
those introduced Idolatry, or restored
true Religion, so often did the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the People fall into Apostacy, or
return to the worship of the true God.
The Reward of those pious Princes
will receive infinite increase from the
blessed Effects of their Example; and the
Damnation of the others will be heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,
from the infection communicated
to others by their wickedness.</p>
            <p>And what Princes are in relation to
their Subjects in this matter, the same
are all Superiors in relation to their
Inferiors, whether in Authority, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
or Knowledge. The Piety of a
Master reformeth, or his Dissoluteness
corrupteth a whole Family. The
Exemplariness of a rich Man instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,


<pb n="538" facs="tcp:34506:273"/>
or his wickedness debaucheth all
his poorer Dependants. The religious
Conduct of a knowing Man corrects,
or his unwary Behaviour perverts all
his Admirers. And all such shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
receive the reward of the good
Effects of their exemplary Piety; or
if their Conduct be contrary, the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of their private Sins will
be much sharpened in Consideration
of the unhappy influence, which their
Actions had to dispose othen Men to
sin.</p>
            <p>The Duty of Exemplariness, and the
excellent Design of our Lord in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it of his Followers, being thus
cleared, I pass to the Second Head, to
consider the manner, which he hath
fixed, whereby to raise this Example,
that is, <hi>by good Works: Let your Light
so shine before Men, that they may see
your good Works.</hi> None but these will
have any influence upon the Minds of
those, who are without the Church,
or who judge rightly: and none but
these will avail such as are within the
Church, or make little use of their
Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="539" facs="tcp:34506:273"/>
To become a light and a glorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in the World, it is necessary to
be eminent in those Actions, which
are acknowledged by the World to be
good, excellent, and of intrinsick worth.
Such are all Actions of Moral Vertues,
but more especially such as are posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
as Justice, Truth, Zeal for the
Honour of God, Kindness and Charity
to Men. Such are in many places of
the New Testament, and in common
Speech also, called <hi>good Works;</hi> which
whosoever doth illustriously perform,
all other Men, although of a different
or no Religion, will bear him Witness,
that the Lawgiver, whose Precepts he
therein obeyeth, is good and just; that
his Example deserveth Praise and Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>And what Effect must we not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
this Example had upon the Jews
and Heathens, before the brightness
of it was obscured by the prevailing
wickedness of latter Ages? when the
Church could challenge her Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to produce from among her Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
an unclean or an injust, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
or a prophane Person; when
their Piety was so undeniable in the


<pb n="540" facs="tcp:34506:274"/>
constant frequenting of the publick
Prayers and Sacraments of the Church,
even in the midst of Persecutions:
when their Charity appeared so conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous,
not only in relation to their
own Members, but now even to their
Enemies, in feeding the Hungry, in
clothing the naked, in redeeming Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
in communicating to all: When
an Heathen Governour, and he the
most Learned Man of his Age, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Emperor to examine the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Conduct of the Christians,
made this report to him; <hi>That they were a
sort of men, who injured no Man, defrauded
none, abstained from Murder, Lust and
Perjury, gave frequent Demonstrations of
admirable Charity; and meeting once every
Week in the publick Service of God, bound
themselves by religious Ties and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to do all this.</hi> When a Learned
Adversary after a full Search could
make no other report than this; what
remained, but to conclude that God
was indeed among them? So wisely
Christianity contrived to draw in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing,
but unprejudiced Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
by the Beauty of its Example:
the force of which none could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,


<pb n="541" facs="tcp:34506:274"/>
while its greatest Adversaries
dared not to deny that the Exercise of
good Works, was the Primitive Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the World; and if not the
Duty, yet at least the Interest and the
Ornament of Mankind.</p>
            <p>Our Lord proposed not to form this
Example by extreme Austerities and
Macerations, by Paradoxes in Doctrine
or Practice, by Raptures or Extasies;
which might easily raise the Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but not the Reverence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men. Judicious Men would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
them Follies, if proposed as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of intrinsick Excellence, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
them with Scorn: and even ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Persons might be astonished at
them, yet could they never discover
any real worth in them, or the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of them.</p>
            <p>It is the unhappiness of latter Ages,
to have introduced such gross Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
instead of what our Lord dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
the Practice of good Works; and
thereby have in a great measure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
those excellent Ends, which he
intended. Thus the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
in her latter Saints hath chiefly respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
extravagant Austerities, and the


<pb n="542" facs="tcp:34506:275"/>
Report of foolish Miracles: and some
others have made the Indications or
Signs of Saint-ship to be unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Raptures, or internal pretended
Consolations, or union to God and
Christ, which have no necessary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Effect, or cannot be discovered
by unbelievers; or if discovered,
would not affect them. With them
no Example, but of such Actions as
are universally allowed to be Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
namely of <hi>good Works,</hi> will be of
any Power; and therefore our most
wise Saviour hath appointed no other:
and if this be not continued, all other
means of continuing the Glory of this
Light, which our Lord proposed, will
be found wholly ineffectual.</p>
            <p>And as to those without, so also
to those within the Church, but need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Direction of Example, no other
will be of any advantage. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
in relation to them consists in
leading the way to such, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to imitate the Actions of those
whom they admire or respect, or to
whom they are subject: which Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if they be such as are here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<hi>good Works,</hi> the Design of our


<pb n="543" facs="tcp:34506:275"/>
Lord is happily effected, the Duty of
such Persons promoted, their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
secured, the Reward of those, who
give the Example increased. But if
the Actions be of any other Nature;
they are either unlawful or indifferent,
not worthy Imitation, and without
any Promise of reward.</p>
            <p>In the third Place our Lord in the
Text proposeth the end, towards which
these exemplary <hi>good Works</hi> should be
directed; which is, that <hi>others may see
them, and glorifie your Father, which is
in Heaven,</hi> that is, in seeing them may
glorifie God. Least Men should be
betrayed into Pride or Arrogance,
through an Opinion of their own good
Works; they are commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all not to their own, but to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Glory. Least they should swell
with the Conceit of being a Light to
the World, of giving a Rule to the
Actions of other Men by their own
Conduct; they are taught, that all this
ought not to be employed to promote
their own Esteem in the World, but
to advance the Honour and Worship
of God. While good Works are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
directed to this end, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,


<pb n="544" facs="tcp:34506:276"/>
that any thing of Pride should
intervene. And if notwithstanding,
peevish and morose Men will detract
from them, as done for sinister Ends
and vain Glory; our Lord hath provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for this a Remedy in the 11th. Verse
of this Chapter, immediately preceding
this Exhortation to a good Example:
<hi>Blessed are you, when Men shall revile
you, and say all manner of evil against
you falsely for my sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing indeed is more odious and
distasteful, than Ostentation in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or more to be avoided. This raised
the Indignation of our Lord against
the Pharisees, and still exciteth the
Scorn of all judicious Men, when Acts
of Religion are formed on purpose to
be seen by Men; when their Praise and
Applause is thereby courted and studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
contrived. But in this Duty of
being exemplary in <hi>good Works,</hi> as there
is no Command of contriving the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
performance of them in such a
manner, as may be most taken notice
of by other Men; so there is for the
most part no necessity of it in Order to
their being observed by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="545" facs="tcp:34506:276"/>
Many of them are of such a Nature,
as cannot but be observed, whether he
who performs them intends it or not,
they cannot be concealed or pass unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.
Upon which account Christ
justly resembleth them to <hi>a City placed
on a Hill,</hi> and to <hi>a Candle set on a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick,</hi>
in the 14th. and 15th. Verses,
which naturally appear and give Light
to all round about them: as if he should
say: Do but you take care to perform
<hi>good Works;</hi> and the very Nature of
them will cause them to become Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar.
I do not require you to publish
and Blazon them abroad; nor is there
any need of it: For if they be indeed
performed, they cannot escape the
Knowledge and Observation of other
Men.</p>
            <p>Farther, not only the Nature of
<hi>good Works</hi> maketh the Ostentation
of them to be unnecessary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to become Exemplar; but also
they carry with them less Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Pride and Arrogance, than
any other Acts either of true or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Religion. If the grounds and
more ordinary Reasons of Pride and
Self-conceit in Religion be searched;


<pb n="546" facs="tcp:34506:277"/>
it will be found, that they are wont to
be grounded in the more easie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
in mistaken Points of Religion.
As of old among the Pharisees, in the
punctual performance of Washings and
other Ritual Observations; among the
more Ignorant of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
at this day in Pilgrimages, Beads, and
other Trifles; among their Saints in
extraordinary Austerities or unusual
Acts of Self-denial; among Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts
in Raptures and pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations.
All these naturally tend to
foment the Pride and Self-conceit of
Men; they draw the Eyes of others
on them; and serve to make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
People believe them extremely
Conscientious; and have this farther
advantage towards the Design of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
that they are cheaply perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
cross no Passion, restrain no Lust,
make a great shew, and cost them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And when they are performed;
not affording any inward Satisfaction
of Mind, as having no internal worth;
it is but natural for the Actors of them
to seek that Satisfaction from the Praises
and Applause of other Men, which
they reaped not from the Reflections
of their own Conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="547" facs="tcp:34506:277"/>
Whereas the performance of <hi>good
Works</hi> raiseth in the Soul of Man so
sweet a Complacency, when reflected
on, that external Commendations can
add nothing considerable to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Satisfaction of the Mind, and will be
neglected when compared with it.</p>
            <p>To which I may add, that the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of many <hi>good Works,</hi> and most
signally the greatest of them, that of
Charity towards the Poor, do natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dispose to Humility, accustoming
the Mind to consider and compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the Wants and Infirmities of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
Persons, and condescend to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of their Condition. It being most
certain, that Pride or an over-valuing
of their own Dignity, is in some Men
the Cause of uncharitableness; as well
as the love of Riches, betraying them
to imagine it beneath their Quality to
take into their Consideration the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of distressed Persons, and to be
aggrieved for them. Which sort of
Pride cannot consist with real Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and where this is to be found, the
former can have no place. At least it
is most certain, that Hypocrisie may
consist with all those mistaken Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions


<pb n="548" facs="tcp:34506:278"/>
of Holiness I before mentioned;
but with <hi>good Works,</hi> with Mercy, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
Truth, and Charity, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
it should consist. For that
whosoever performeth these, doth real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perform what he pretends to do,
that is, satisfieth the Obligation of the
Religion, which he professeth.</p>
            <p>However, although ordinarily it be
not necessary so to direct the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of <hi>good Works,</hi> that they may
not escape the Knowledge of Men,
and it be always unlawful to direct
them in that manner for this end alone,
to obtain the Praise of Men: Yet in
some extraordinary Cases, it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lawful to perform them publickly
with this Design, that they may be seen
of others, (not to obtain their Praise,
but to promote the Honour and Glory
of God;) but it is also highly accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God, and serviceable to his
Church. This is warranted by the
express words of our Lord in the Text,
which require his Disciples to cause
their <hi>Light so to shine before Men, that they
may see their good Works and glorifie God.</hi>
If this Design doth at last terminate in
the Honour of God, and be so intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,


<pb n="549" facs="tcp:34506:278"/>
it is not only warrantable, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable
by God, and will be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
rewarded by him.</p>
            <p>Only great Caution is to be used in
the Management of it, and a scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Care to be observed, least any
thing of vain Glory, any sinister End
should intervene; and is to be put in
Practise only in Cases of exceeding
moment. Such are, when any Age or
large Society of Men are especially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in any Duty. In which Case,
it is a laudable and noble Undertaking
for any private Persons, to give the
greatest and most publick Lustre to
their performance of that Duty, that
so, if it be possible, by their eminen:
Example therein they may retrieve the
publick Practice of it; and whensoever
any great and common Good, altho'
of another Nature, may be attained
or promoted thereby.</p>
            <p>Such was the Case more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Apostles, who were sent to
preach Faith and Repentance among
Jews and Heathens, generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
not only of Faith, but of all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Vertues. For this Reason it was
necessary, that those noble Acts of


<pb n="550" facs="tcp:34506:279"/>
Charity, which they exercised, in heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sick, and restoring the use of
their Limbs and Senses to those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wanted them, should be performed
publickly; that themselves should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
no opportunity of manifesting
the Excellency of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the deep Impression of it upon
their own Minds. For this Cause also
St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not ashamed to relate at
large, and to Glory in the many Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Hazards and Persecutions, which
he had undergone for the Testimony
of Christ; because the amplifying of
his Labour and Patience, tended to the
spiritual Good of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to
whom it is directed, and consequently
promoted the Honour of God. This
Design also justified the Bravery of
those ancient Christians, who volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
and unsought for, delivered up
themselves into the hands of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors,
when they observed a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Cowardize, and frequent Examples
of Apostacy among other Christians,
who were apprehended and brought
before the Heathen Tribunals: that so
by their Courage and Constancy they
might excite others to persist resolutely
in the Profession of their Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="551" facs="tcp:34506:279"/>
It must be acknowledged, that sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to throw themselves into Danger,
to expose themselves to the Fury of
their Persecutors, was unlawful. Our
Lord in <hi>Matth.</hi> X. 23. had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Disciples, <hi>When they should be
persecuted in one City, to fly into another:</hi>
And the Doctrine and Discipline of
the ancient Church had forbidden the
ordinary Practice of such rash Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.
Yet whensoever so great a
Good might be attained thereby, as to
raise the dejected Courage of other
Christians, and to assert the Honour of
Christ against the Heathens, boasting
in the subversion of many weaker Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
it was not only lawful to engage
in voluntary Martyrdom, but highly
meritorious, and rewarded as such by
God, if no vain Glory, or desire of
humane Praise were intermixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with;
but the sole Design was the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
and Vindication of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Glory.</p>
            <p>For far be it from us to censure or
condemn of Rashness all those noble
ancient Martyrs, who without any
Force confessed the Faith of Christ at
the Heathen Tribunals, and thereby


<pb n="552" facs="tcp:34506:280"/>
drew upon themselves Torments and
Death, that they might give an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Constancy to less couragious
Christians, who could not otherwise
withstand the force of Persecution. It
was found by Experience, that such
generous Examples did more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
raise the Courage of other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
labouring under Persecution, than
the Sense of their Duty, or the hope
of all those glorious Rewards proposed
by Christ, to those who should suffer
for his Name. And to justifie this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in such extraordinary Cases,
St <hi>Paul</hi> himself, as we read <hi>Acts</hi> XXI.
had resolved to go up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and
continued his Resolution; although it
was foretold to him by <hi>Agabus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prophets, and himself knew by
the Spirit, <hi>that Bonds and Imprisonment
did abide him;</hi> that he should there suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a grievous Persecution.</p>
            <p>Nor is this the only Case, wherein
it may be lawful or commendable to
perform <hi>good Works</hi> publickly, and
with this Design, that they may be
seen of Men. Many other such Cases
may be found. I will instance but in
two, Pennance and Charity. As for


<pb n="553" facs="tcp:34506:280"/>
the first, the Practice of publick Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
it must be confessed by all, who
know the State of the ancient and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
times of Christianity, that the use
of it was then the great Preserver of
unfeigned Piety among Christians, and
that the Discontinuance of it now is
the chief Cause of the want and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Religion in our times. They
very well knew formerly, as well as
we do now, that God chiefly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
inward Repentance, the Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Soul. That Admonition of
our Saviour was then, as well as now,
contained in the Gospel: <hi>But thou, when
thou fastest, anoint thy Head, and wash
thy Face, that thou appear not unto Men
to fast, but unto thy Father which is in
Heaven,</hi> where what is said of Fasting,
may be applied to all other Acts and
Indications of Repentance: Yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Benefit, which the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the publick performance
of Pennance, required the Institution,
and the great Advancement of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, which arose from thence,
justified the Practice of it.</p>
            <p>Then was Religion and Piety main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in its full Vigour, when Persons


<pb n="554" facs="tcp:34506:281"/>
guilty of any scandalous Crimes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
eminent by Birth or Station, were
put to open Pennance, secluded from
the rest of the Faithful, placed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a separate part of the Church,
and there appearing in Sackcloath, or
other penitential Dress begged the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of God with Tears, and desired
Reconciliation; and this not only for
many days, but oftimes for many years
together.</p>
            <p>Such Discipline could not but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in the Minds of all Christians,
who beheld it, an exceeding dread of
Sin, and Caution in abstaining from
such Scandals, as would certainly draw
upon them, either a total Separation
from the Church, and the Hopes of
Salvation, or the necessity of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
the same Severities. The sight
of those Penitents was more instructive
to ordinary Christians, than all the
most elaborate Invectives against Sin,
or Exhortations to Repentance; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to them at once the Guilt, the
Horror, the Shame, and the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Sin. Nor was their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to be accounted less real or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
because attended with such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward


<pb n="555" facs="tcp:34506:281"/>
Professions: rather these gave an
evident Argument of the reality and
sincerity of their Repentance; since
to take away the Guilt and remove
the Scandal of their Sin, and reconcile
themselves to God and his Church,
they refused not to undergo the long
and strict Severities of publick Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and which of all things is most
repugnant to the Inclinations of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, to put themselves to open
Shame.</p>
            <p>In like manner, however ordinarily
speaking, Charity ought to be done
in secret; and our Lord hath largely
warned us, <hi>To take heed, lest we do our
Alms before Men, to be seen of them:</hi> that
is, for this only Reason, that we may
be seen and praised by them; yet if
we do our Alms before Men, that they
may see them, and by seeing them
may be excited either to glorifie God,
or to practice the like Charity, then it
is not only lawful, not only secureth the
Rewards promised to Charity, but also
becometh of excellent advantage to the
Church, and the Honour of God, and
entitleth to the Rewards due to the
Propagation of Religion, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="556" facs="tcp:34506:282"/>
However it might be in ancient
Times or former Ages, when almost all
Christians exercised Charity even to
profuseness; certainly in our Age,
which is chiefly deficient in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of, this Duty, it would be a noble
Undertaking in any to restore the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it by the Lustre of any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and publick Example. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
very great Rewards be promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to secret Charity; it is not to be
doubted, but that to publick Charity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in such Cases much greater are
reserved, if it be not corrupted with
any mixture of vain Glory, or ignoble
Designs: because such hath not only
all the Effects of secret Charity, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the Wants of others, but, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
also, contributeth very much to
the Honour of God, the common good
of the Church, and the Edification of
other Men.</p>
            <p>In all these and other like Cases, the
advantage produced thereby to the
Church, consists not so much in exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
others by the force of Example,
to the Imitation and Practice of the
same <hi>good Works,</hi> although that be
very great, as in the Conviction of


<pb n="557" facs="tcp:34506:282"/>
the truth of Christianity, which it invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
formeth in the Minds of Men. To
Persons of ordinary Capacities and
Knowledge, such as constitute the far
greater part of the Church, there can
be no more certain Argument of the
Truth of that Religion which they
profess, than that the same is professed
by so great a number of eminent and
excellent Persons. If they believe the
Profession of others to be sincere and
real, themselves will Assent without
any Scruple: if they suspect their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
themselves will be tempted to
Infidelity.</p>
            <p>Now the publick and eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of <hi>good Works,</hi> give the only
evident Demonstration of the sincerity
of the perswasion of other Men; since
in a Countrey where any Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
by Custom and Education, a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
Profession of it may be only the
effect of either, and not to contradict
it, may be due only to common Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
But whoever publickly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>good Works,</hi> giveth an undeniable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
that he doth in earnest believe
the Truth of what he professeth, and
thereby disposing others to the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,


<pb n="558" facs="tcp:34506:283"/>
increaseth the number of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and advanceth the Glory of God;
performeth the Duty enjoyned in my
Text, and shall receive the Reward
of it.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the End, to which
exemplary Piety ought to be directed,
<hi>the Glory of God;</hi> and that this End will
really be obtained by it, I proceed in
the last place to shew. The Honour
of God is promoted by the Praises and
by the Service of Men. The Praise of
God is directly promoted by the <hi>good
Works</hi> of his own Servants, while other
Men viewing the Excellency of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
raise their Thoughts to God the
Fountain of them, and conceive some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
yet greater and more excellent in
him: Necessarily concluding, that if
that imperfect Light, which may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in the Soul of Man, be yet so
glorious, the Perfection of the Divine
Nature exceedeth all Imagination:
That if such eminent Acts of Goodness
be performed by frail Men in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his Will; in him devoid of
Frailty and Imperfection, the Fulness
of all Goodness dwells: if the Actions
of his Servants deserve Love and


<pb n="559" facs="tcp:34506:283"/>
Praise, much more will the Operations
of him their Lord and Master proclaim
him worthy of Honour and Adoration.</p>
            <p>But this manner of reflecting Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
upon God, from the <hi>good works</hi> of his
faithful Servants, is not so much respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by our Lord in this place, as the
Instruction and Conversion of other
Men, who by the good Example of true
Christians may be brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Truth, to the love of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and to the practice of their Duty:
to effect which, eminent Examples have
no less force than Reason or Arguments.
This giveth Authority to Vertue, and
taketh off the Reproach of being sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.
It relieveth the Modesty of new
Beginners; and encourageth to pursue
their Course, so well begun, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Scorn and Derision of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Men.</p>
            <p>To tender and unexperienced Minds,
there is no greater Obstacle of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
than the fear of being singular
thereby. The natural impressions of
Reason may incline to the Exercise of
Vertue; but yet they have not the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to swim against the Stream, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their single Example to the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling


<pb n="560" facs="tcp:34506:284"/>
Corruption of a sinful World, nor
bear up against the Contempt of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men, without the Patronage and
Assistance of other great and good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
whose practice they may plead
in their own behalf; and that defence,
which the weakness of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inableth them not to draw from
Reason, they may draw from their
Authority. Altho' not only weaker
Minds, but even more ingenuous and
understanding Persons, while unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
in the World, are not able to
shock the Power of a general Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
If they be convinced of their
Duty, they yet want Boldness to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
it; and dread nothing more than
the Suspicion of Affectation, or fear of
appearing singular. Whence it is, that
youth especially suffers by ill Examples;
who through a natural Modesty are
ever wont to accommodate themselves
to the prevailing Fashion.</p>
            <p>Further, a good Example instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the more ignorant part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
both in the Rules and the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of their Duty. Few are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
at least few take the pains, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Grounds of that Religion, into


<pb n="561" facs="tcp:34506:284"/>
which they were baptized, to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Truth, and convince them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of the Obligation of it. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
herein upon the Judgment of others,
whom they esteem wiser than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
whom they find to profess no
Religion, or (which is all one) to Act
as if they had none; they supercede
the Labour of any further Enquiry,
and dismiss all Resolutions of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, if it be found by
them, that wise Men, or so accounted,
who by their Learning were fully ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to discover the truth of things,
to find out the Cheat of Religion, if
it were indeed such, have after a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and accurate search been so fully
convinced of the truth of it, that they
have been content to hazard their Lives,
to restrain their Pleasures, to deny their
Passions, from the perswasion of it; if
great and illustrious Persons, who had
opportunity of improving all the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Life to the most exquisite satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
yet moderated and limited
them in Obedience to the Laws of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
To a vulgar Mind there can be
no greater assurance than the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of this; and if he finds this, he


<pb n="562" facs="tcp:34506:285"/>
there rests satisfied; if not, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
no farther. And from this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
also he draws the Rules of
his Conduct, even after a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of his Obligation. In all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Actions and Cases of Conscience
he consults the example of his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours;
and pursueth the way, which
they have marked out to him; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, as he supposeth them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the true Light.</p>
            <p>Nay to generous as well as vulgar
Minds, example is an effectual Motive
of Vertue. To such, Emulation is the
most powerful Argument, and a noble
disdain of being exceeded in any thing
that is Excellent and Praise-worthy.
To them the preference of any other
is a reproach of their own Sloth; and
when others have gone before with
Reward and Praise, it is uneasie to stay
behind. It was this Principle of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity,
which kept up Vertue among
the Heathens; it is this which gave
rise and increase to Arts and Sciences,
and which now maintaineth Valour.
Our Lord hath improved the use of it,
and directed it to a yet more noble
End; proposing the Excellency and
the Rewards of Obedience, holding out


<pb n="563" facs="tcp:34506:285"/>
the Crown of Victory, and encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to strive for the Mastery.</p>
            <p>He hath in this Precept concerning
Exemplariness, given to us a yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scope for the Exercise of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity;
not only proposing Rewards to
the Conquerors, to those of a more
elevated Vertue, but also to such, who
excited by their illustrious Example,
should follow them, altho' at a distance,
making them thereby the Instruments
of saving others, and that possibly in
great numbers. At least there is scarce
any one of us so inconsiderable, who
may not have so much Influence and
Authority upon some one or other, as
to move and direct him by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
which if he doth, he will for
ever enjoy this satisfaction, that he hath
been the occasion of infinite Happiness
to another: which to a good and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Mind, is a strong Argument of
the pursuit and practice of those Vertues
and Perfections, which may make him
Exemplary, that so he may promote
the Reformation of the World, and the
eternal Happiness of other Men.</p>
            <p>It may seem indeed past hope, that
in this degenerate Age, when so few
endeavour to obtain their own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,


<pb n="564" facs="tcp:34506:286"/>
or are good for their own sake
any should attempt it for the sake of
other Men. Yet I do not despair, that
there are yet such generous Minds left
in the World, who esteem it no small
Felicity to themselves to promote the
good of other Men; and acting upon
this perswasion, study to be good and
excellent, that by their Example others
may be drawn to the same Practice, and
thereby secure to themselves a state of
Happiness.</p>
            <p>To such exemplary Persons frequent
Praise is given, and eminent Rewards
promised, more particularly in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
XII. 3. <hi>They that be wise, shall shine as
the brightness of the Firmament; and they
that turn many to Righteousness, as the
Stars for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lustre of our Lord's Example is
compared to the brightness of the Sun,
the Example of wise and holy Men to the
fixed Stars, which however far inferior
to the Glory of the Sun, yet are seated
in Heaven, and communicate to the
Earth, a Light never to be extinguished,
and that at a great distance. The nearer
we approach to these luminous Bodies,
the greater Light we shall receive from
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="565" facs="tcp:34506:286"/>
The Examples of holy Men while alive
are so many shining and burning Lights
in their several Generations; and even
after their Deaths will derive exceeding
influence to succeeding Ages, so long
as the Memory of their eminent Piety
and good Works shall be continued.
Those excellent Graces, wherewith they
were endued, those noble Testimonies
of Vertue and Holiness, which they
gave, tended no less to the benefit of
the whole Church, and the instruction
of other Christians, than to their own
Salvation, and if they be not equally
beneficial to us at this distance of time,
it is because we either take no Care to
obtain the knowledge of them, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the remembrance of them to slip
out of our Minds.</p>
            <p>It is undeniable indeed, that in this
present Age, and among us especially,
the Memory of these things is almost
lost, which is not the least cause of the
prevailing wickedness of the Age; and
present Examples of equal Lustre are
very rare, or indeed scarce any: yet for
all that, those Holy Persons cease not
to retain their glorious Seat in Heaven,
and there as the Prophet saith, <hi>To shine
as the brightness of the Firmament,</hi> as the


<pb n="566" facs="tcp:34506:287"/>
fixed Stars always maintain their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and preserve their Light, altho'
at any time not seen by us. To this
glorious Station in Heaven our Lord
hath promised to advance all those, who
by extraordinary Piety and the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Exercise of <hi>good Works,</hi> shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
not only to save their own
Souls, but also to Profit the Church in
general, and to promote the Salvation
of any other in particular.</p>
            <p>May the hope of this glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
excite every one of you to the
performance of this Duty of Exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness;
<hi>And may God of his infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
accept and Crown your Endeavours, for
the sake and Merits of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Jesus Christ, to whom</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Manifestation of God in the Flesh, and

thereby, did <hi>this Day</hi> receive its Final
accomplishment by the Birth of our

of which is the occasion of this
<hi>present Solemnity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can we more fitly commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it, than by this admirable Hymn,
which the Angels and heavenly Host


<pb n="568" facs="tcp:34506:288"/>
upon this occasion sang before us;
and the Church hath in all Ages since
retained in her most Sacred Offices,
<hi>Glory be to God in the highest, and on
Earth Peace, Good-will towards Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Hymn seems to have been a
part of the publick Service of the Jews,
and to have been employed by them,
to express and celebrate the most illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Instances of the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to them. For we find Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
very like to it in several places of
Scripture; and particularly upon the
triumphant Entry of Christ, into <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
The Jews being perswaded,
that their long-looked for Messias was
now come, and all the temporal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which they fancied would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his Coming, cryed out, <hi>Peace in
Heaven, and Glory in the Highest.</hi> But sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon no occasion was it ever so justly
used, as by the Angels upon this <hi>Day,</hi>
in which the Divine Glory did so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
shine forth, and the eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of Mankind did commence.</p>
            <p>For from the Angels we receive this
Hymn, and are taught to sing it by
their Example; which is related in the
Verse preceding the Text: <hi>And sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
there was with the Angels a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the heavenly Host, praising God


<pb n="569" facs="tcp:34506:288"/>
and saying,</hi> &amp;c. One Angel declared to
the Shepherds the <hi>glad Tidings of great
joy which should be to all People,</hi> the Birth
of Christ: but the whole Quire of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
the Host of Heaven joyned to
sing Praise to God, and celebrate those
Benefits which were that day derived
down upon all Mankind. Themselves
received not like Benefits to Men from
the Incarnation of the Son of God;
yet returned Glory to God for it. The
Reasons of which it may not be amiss
to lay down, before I proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the parts of this Hymn singly.</p>
            <p>First then, the Angels were moved
to give Thanks to God by the increase
of the Divine Glory among Men, which
they foresaw would be consequent to
this Incarnation. Their Office is to
attend continually before the Throne of
God, and sing Praises without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to him; so that every new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the Divine Glory inflames
their Zeal in this Holy Office. The
primary Reasons indeed of that Glory
and Praise which they continually yield
to God, are eternal, being drawn from
his immutable Attributes of supreme
Power, Wisdom, Goodness and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty:
Yet every illustrious Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any of these glorious Attributes


<pb n="570" facs="tcp:34506:289"/>
by external Effects, becometh also
the Subject of their Praise. Thus in
in <hi>Revel.</hi> IV. 8. we find the Angels
celebrating the eternal Attributes of
God in that Hymn, <hi>Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and
is to come:</hi> And in many other places
celebrating the Effects of these Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
as Rev. XV. 3. <hi>Great and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
are thy Works Lord God Almighty,</hi>
and XIX. 7. <hi>Let us be glad and rejoyce,
and give Honour to him; for the marriage
of the Lamb is come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay as it should seem, by comparing
the several forms of Doxology to be
found in the Book of <hi>Revelations,</hi> the
Angels, since the Manifestation of the
Mystery of God incarnate, have in a
manner changed the Subject of their
Doxologies, and confined themselves
almost wholly to the Contemplation of
this Mystery, and the glorious Effects<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
of it. For in the beginning of that
Book, while the secrets of Heaven are
still supposed to be Sealed up, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Effects of this Mystery not yet
to be fully disclosed, all their Doxolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
insist upon the general Attributes
of the Divine Nature. But after the
full Declaration and Completion of
those glorious Events and Effects of


<pb n="571" facs="tcp:34506:289"/>
this Mystery, which are there describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Argument of the heavenly
Hymns is altered, and imployed in the
celebrating the Victories of the Lamb,
the overthrow of Satan, and the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Kingdom of the Messias.
That is, so eminent and admirable is the
Mystery of <hi>this Day,</hi> so much condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to the Divine Glory, that since the
Completion of it, it is become the chief
Subject of the Contemplation of those
Holy Spirits; who hereby best of all
discern, and are enabled to celebrate
that Power, Wisdom and Goodness,
which they before admired in God.</p>
            <p>Farther, the Angels celebrated the
Birth of Christ, as rejoycing at the
Salvation of Men which was to be
procured thereby. Those excellent
Spirits are inclined by their own
Goodness and Benignity to wish well
to their Fellow-creatures, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
at their welfare, and rejoyce in
it: Especially for those who are endued,
if not with equal, yet with like Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who possess Souls of the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Nature, and alike immortal. By
these, if by any means, the number of
the heavenly Host, formerly diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the fall of <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates,
was to be repaired: All which


<pb n="572" facs="tcp:34506:290"/>
would not permit them to be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Felicity of Mankind;
and that, although the Divine Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
had not obliged them to have
a peculiar regard of it. But when by
the Order of God, <hi>They are all mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
Spirits, sent forth to minister for
them, who shall be Heirs of Salvation,</hi> as we
read, <hi>Hebr.</hi> I. 14. there was abundant
Reason for this their Exultation; since
without the Incarnation of Christ, their
Labour had been wholly vain, and the
condition of Man not capable of relief.
But after they saw this, at once made
both possible and easie, in a Rapture of
Joy they broke forth into this Hymn of
Praise. For if <hi>there be joy among the
Angels of Heaven over one Sinner that
repenteth</hi> and is saved: How much
more when the whole Mass of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
was redeemed and made capable
of Salvation?</p>
            <p>Even the Angels themselves, altho'
not in the same Degree with Mankind,
received signal Benefits from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of this Mystery: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had reason to rejoyce upon the
Completion of it. Their Happiness
consists in contemplating and praising
the Nature, the Attributes, and the
Effects of God. Their knowledge of


<pb n="573" facs="tcp:34506:290"/>
all these things is Finite, as is their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and therefore every addition of
Knowledge is an encrease of Happiness:
and the Manifestation of this great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Heaven was the greatest Benefit,
which in their State they could receive.</p>
            <p>Of the Mysteries of the Gospel,
St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> I. 12. that <hi>the
Angels desired to look into them;</hi> and
that before this they were ignorant of
it, appears from those words of Christ,
<hi>Matth.</hi> XXIV. 36. <hi>But of that day, and
hour knoweth no Man, no not the Angels
of Heaven, but my Father only.</hi> When
therefore the Son of God took Flesh
upon him, and thereby began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
the wonderful Mystery of Man's
Salvation: Then clearly appeared to
these Blessed Spirits, what was before
obscure to them, the Reasons of the
Divine Conduct, in relation to Man in
all preceding Ages; the Mysterious Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of his Providence; the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Prophesies which went before;
the purport of the Divine Decrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the future State of other ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Beings. This new Knowledge
administred to them fresh Reasons, of
admiring the Goodness and the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, and thereby increased
their Happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="574" facs="tcp:34506:291"/>
Thus we find the Angels moved by
great Reasons, to joyn in the Solemnity
of <hi>this Day.</hi> But why they chose to
do it audibly, so as to be heard of the
Shepherds, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> relateth, we are
still to enquire. That Angel, which
was peculiarly designed to this Office,
had newly finished his Message of the
Birth of Christ, and that Happiness,
which would thence ensue to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
when immediately <hi>a multitude of
the heavenly Host</hi> was present with him,
and sang this Hymn. This without
doubt was to convince those who heard
it, and others who should know by their
Relation, of the Greatness and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Message; of the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Benefits to be derived to the
World from the Incarnation of Christ;
of the Dignity of his Person, whose
Birth was celebrated by the whole Host
of Heaven, that he could be no other
than the Son of God, on whom the
Angels so attended.</p>
            <p>We find not that the entrance of
any Prophet was ushered in by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of Angels: On the other side,
we read not of the immediate Presence
of God on Earth, as on <hi>Mount Sina</hi> to
<hi>Moses,</hi> on <hi>Mount Horeb</hi> to <hi>Elias;</hi> but it
was still attended with some other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible


<pb n="575" facs="tcp:34506:291"/>
Sign; as in both those places by
extraordinary Commotions in the Air,
which also represented the severity of
the old Law: And in this Mystery of
the Incarnation of our Lord, by which
God descended upon Earth, <hi>was made
Flesh, and dwelt among us,</hi> we find it fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
by one Angel, proclaimed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and celebrated <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> the whole Host
of Heaven. This declared his Majesty,
and was an evident Proof of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
if not of his Person, yet at
least of his Mission.</p>
            <p>Now least we should imagine our
selves unconcerned in the Reasons of the
Angels praising God upon this occasion,
and make no use of what hath been
hitherto said: I will shew that all those
Reasons, which might induce the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to break forth into this Hymn of
Praise, are common to Men, and ought
to be much more perswasive to them.</p>
            <p>If the Angels were affected with the
increase of Divine Glory wrought here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:
And are not we obliged to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the glorious Attributes of God,
and the several Emanations of them,
both as we are his Creatures, and as we
are endued with rational Souls? If the
Angels so far rejoyced in the Benefit
and Salvation of others; how much


<pb n="576" facs="tcp:34506:292"/>
doth it become us to be thankful, who
reap the advantage, upon whom the
Benefit is bestowed? If the Angels
were glad to see the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
accomplished; much more surely
should Men esteem themselves oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
who enjoy it. So that upon all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
if the Angels had Reason, Men
have much more, to celebrate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
of Christ with this Hymn,
<hi>Glory to God in the Highest, and on
Earth Peace, Good-will towards Men.</hi> I
will consider the several parts of this
Hymn singly. And first,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glory to God in the Highest,</hi> which
is not so much a desire of what hath
not, as an Approbation of what hath

where the same Phrase is used in the
Septuagint, <hi>The Lord is mighty in the


<pb n="577" facs="tcp:34506:292"/>
Highest,</hi> that is, mighty above all. And
surely with great Reason we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to give the highest Glory to God
which can be conceived, by reason of
the Incarnation of his Son, wherein the
Perfection of his eternal Attributes, is
more conspicuous than in any other effect
whatsoever; and from whence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the greatest Glory, which was
ever paid by Mankind to God.</p>
            <p>To pursue this in particular Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
The Love of God towards Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
did never appear so eminently as
in the completion of this Mystery.
Truly did St. <hi>John</hi> say, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> IV. 9.
<hi>In this was manifested the love of God
towards us, because that God sent his only
begotten Son into the World.</hi> He had
before employed sufficient means of
procuring universal Happiness to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
He had given to Man in his
first Creation a distinct Knowledge of
Good and Evil; left to him indeed the
Liberty of Choice, but deterred him
from the Choice of Evil, as well by
the Dictates of his own Conscience, as
by the Denunciation of extreme Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which should attend it. When
notwithstanding all this, Man embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Evil, God in his abundant
Mercy provided an Expiation for this
sin, which in after Ages should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished


<pb n="578" facs="tcp:34506:293"/>
by the Incarnation of his
own Son. Upon this he pardoned the
sin of Man, received him to Mercy, and
made him capable of eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
That this intended Happiness
might not be frustrated by the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Men, he allured them by
Promises, directed them by his Laws,
taught them by his Prophets, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
their Faith by the Expectation
of a Messias or a Saviour to come.</p>
            <p>So that upon the Incarnation of
Christ is founded, not only the Mercy,
the Grace and Bounty of God to the
Christian Church, but also all Acts of
Goodness and Favour vouchsafed to
Mankind since the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> All
these were conferred for the sake of
him, who in time should take humane
Nature upon him, and therein make
full satisfaction for the Sins of Men.</p>
            <p>The Benefit indeed was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World, but then the
Divine Glory became chiefly manifest,
when this Mystery was fulfilled, when
the Son of God was manifested in the
Flesh. Before, it lay hid in the secret
Purposes of God, but was now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to the whole World. Before, the
Divine Glory which should hence arise,
was darkly foretold in Types and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies,
but now set in a full Light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="579" facs="tcp:34506:293"/>
Now were all subsequent Ages obliged
to magnifie God, for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that Mystery in due time, which
had so long been the Hopes of preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ages, and was the Happiness of
both.</p>
            <p>Further, the Wisdom of God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
and effecting the Incarnation of
his Son was most illustrious. If Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
be taken for Excellency of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
what greater Argument can be
desired of the Divine Wisdom, than
that it foresaw this great Event so long
before; foretold it, and all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of it in the same manner as they
were effected? Or if Wisdom, which
is the truer Notion of it, be understood
to be the prudent direction of means
to obtain any end proposed; we can
no longer doubt of the perfection of the
Divine Wisdom, when we consider
the Blessing of <hi>this Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Mankind had committed that
foul Apostacy in their Fore-father <hi>Adam,</hi>
when succeeding Generations were
found no less Rebellious, the Laws
of God violated, and his Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
slighted; what seeming hope of
Salvation could remain to Man? To
have pardoned all these Sins simply,
and without any Condition was indeed
possible to God, but neither consistent


<pb n="580" facs="tcp:34506:294"/>
with his Honour nor his Justice. He
was Lord and Judge of the whole
Creation, and as such could not pass
by the Sins of Men without inflicting
any Punishment upon them. He had
threatned to punish them; and then
his Veracity obliged him to do it.</p>
            <p>Again, the Sins of Men were of such
Guilt, as could not be expiated by a
slight Punishment, being offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
an infinite Majesty, who called
for proportionable Punishment on the
Offenders. If they were indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted;
the whole Mass of Mankind,
inasmuch as all had sinned, was for
ever miserable. If they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
the Denunciations of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made by God would appear vain,
his Office of Judge must be disowned,
and his Justice called in Question. In
this seeming impossibility of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Salvation of Man to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God; the Divine Wisdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
to effect it by sending the ever
Blessed Jesus into the World, who being
partaker of the Divine Nature, should
take humane Flesh upon him, and in
that undergo the Punishment due to the
Sins of Men. This Mystery after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages was <hi>this Day</hi> made manifest,
and therewith the supreme Perfection
of the Divine Wisdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="581" facs="tcp:34506:294"/>
Lastly, The Power of God did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
receive a more evident Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that in effecting all those
Circumstances, which were long before
foretold, concerning the Birth of Christ.
These Circumstances having been so
often repeated by the Prophets to the
Jews, and so much enquired after by
them (as nearly concerning them) were
so fully known to them, so earnestly
expected by them; that the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them must of necessity become
the clearest and the strongest Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Divine Power, which ever
was exhibited.</p>
            <p>As first, That the Messias should be
Born of a pure Virgin, a Circumstance
which should effectually declare both
the Dignity of the Person to be Born,
and the Power of him, who should
produce it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Which should never be
conferred upon any other Member of
Mankind, and could be effected by no
other than the Author, and the Lord
of Nature; who at first formed all
things out of nothing, and ever after
directed them as himself pleased. That
the Mother of our Lord was indeed a
Virgin, could not ordinarily appear to
the Jews: yet this they were fully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of by the Prophets, that the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias
should be born of a Virgin. And


<pb n="582" facs="tcp:34506:295"/>
that the Prophesie took place in Jesus,
God provided abundant Arguments to
convince them, as the Apparition and
the Testimony of Angels; the Miracles
afterwards ensuing to the Affirmation of
his Disciples; the Testimony of <hi>Joseph</hi>
accounted by all a good and a just Man;
and he assured so by a Message from
Heaven.</p>
            <p>As to the Circumstance of place, it
was foretold that Christ should be born
in <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> To effect this, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power directed the Mind of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus
Caesar</hi> to command an universal
Tax, at that very time, (a thing before
not known in the Roman Empire) that
so the Mother of Christ, going from
<hi>Nazareth</hi> where she dwelt, to <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi>
the place whither the Descendants
of <hi>David</hi> resorted to be Taxed, might
be delivered of her Son in the place long
since foretold.</p>
            <p>As for the time, <hi>Jacob</hi> moved by the
Holy Ghost, had Prophesied, That
<hi>when the Scepter should fail from Judah,
then should Shiloh</hi> or Messias come.
And at this time the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
so ordered, that <hi>Herod</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Kingdom, who was the first
that being not a Jew obtained that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
<hi>Daniel</hi> had foretold, that
after seventy Weeks of Years, that


<pb n="583" facs="tcp:34506:295"/>
is seventy times seven Years, <hi>Messias should
be cut off for the sins of the people:</hi> And
exactly thirty three Years before the
Expiration of this time our Lord was
born, who is known to have suffered
in the thirty third Year of his Age.</p>
            <p>All these Completions of ancient
Prophesies concerning the Messias in
the Person of Jesus, are so many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Proofs of the Almighty Power
of God; who can dispose of Times
and Seasons, of the Hearts of Men,
and the Kingdoms of the World, and
can assuredly bring to pass whatsoever
himself proposeth. The Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Almighty Power contributes
greatly to the Divine Glory; when
all the Signs and Tokens which God
had given to Mankind to discover his
Power thereby, in the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Mystery are come to
pass.</p>
            <p>But not only is it just and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that from the Consideration of the
Incarnation of Christ, Glory should be
given to God; but also this effect
hath actually been produced, and
greater Glory hath thence ensued, than
from all other Causes whatsoever. I
will not insist upon the Praise which
the ancient Patriarchs, Prophets, and
good Men gave to God, when they


<pb n="584" facs="tcp:34506:296"/>
foresaw this Incarnation, altho' it all
ought to be resolved into this Cause. I
will only alledge the increase of Divine
Glory subsequent to the Birth of Christ:
And do that, by comparing the State
of the World at that time, with that
which followed to it.</p>
            <p>Before this <hi>Sun of Righteousness
arose,</hi> an universal darkness had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
the face of the Earth. The
worship of Idols and Devils had in
every place prevailed. The true God
so far from being honoured, that
he was not so much as known. No
Praises, Honour or Glory given to him,
but his Laws violated without Remorse,
his Authority not acknowledged, and
his Benefits wholly forgot. Indeed the
small Country of <hi>Judea</hi> is to be excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
altho' that was now possessed by a
Pagan Government, and was shortly
to be wholly destroyed by them. And
even of this small part of Mankind an
inconsiderable Proportion maintained
their Obedience to God entire. Their
Teachers had made void the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God by their Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
the most Sacred Offices of their
Religion were slighted and publickly
set to Sale; and what remained of true
Piety, just then expiring.</p>
            <p>Consider now the State of the World


<pb n="585" facs="tcp:34506:296"/>
in after times. We find this Darkness
dispelled, this impiety removed, Armies
of Saints, Martyrs and devout Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who should for ever continue to
sing that Hymn to God, which the
Host of Heaven began upon <hi>this day.</hi>
The knowledge of the true God was
introduced in all parts of the World;
vast numbers of Persons professing the
Worship of him converted in a few
Years; their number daily increased,
until after three hundred Years the
whole civilized World did in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
embrace the Christian Faith, and
joyn in offering up Praise to God, in
magnifying his glorious Attributes, in
confessing his Authority, in adoring
his Majesty, in obeying his Laws, if
not in reality, yet at least in Profession.</p>
            <p>These blessed Times indeed were not
for ever to continue; it was foretold,
That <hi>in the latter times Men,</hi> and that
the greatest number, <hi>should depart from
the</hi> true <hi>Faith, walking after their own
Lusts.</hi> And the effect of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
the Church hath now for many
Ages lamented. Yet after all, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worship of the true God is still
kept up, if not in the greater, yet in
the more understanding part of the
World; vast numbers of devout Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
yet remain; continual Praise is


<pb n="586" facs="tcp:34506:297"/>
daily offered up to God; and all this
is owing to the happy Incarnation of
our Lord <hi>as upon this day.</hi> And to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
this, and give Glory to God
for it, we are <hi>this day</hi> met together,
and so are all other true Members of
the Catholick Church, in their several
places.</p>
            <p>The second Branch of the Angelick
Hymn in the Text, is <hi>Peace on Earth.</hi>
By <hi>Peace</hi> according to the usual Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Jews, we may well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
all manner of Happiness, of which
Mankind is capable, to be inferred;
yet in considering it, I shall confine my
self to the strict Acception of it. <hi>This day</hi>
then were signally accomplished the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Prophesies concerning the peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Times of the Messias. Now was
God reconciled to Mankind, and those
Reasons founded, upon which Men
should for ever be reconciled one to
another. This was the greatest Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
which Men could possibly receive,
to be restored to the favour of their
Creator, and the Love of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
God could receive no other from
the Incarnation of his Son, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of Glory; and Man no greater
than the Gift of <hi>Peace;</hi> justly therefore,
after <hi>Glory to God in the highest,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
subjoyn, <hi>Peace on Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="587" facs="tcp:34506:297"/>
               <hi>Peace</hi> in the first Sense, as it is Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
to God, was foretold by <hi>Isaias</hi>
of the times of the Messias, LVII. 19.
And that to be granted to all Men who
should accept the Condition of it. <hi>Peace,
Peace to him that is far off, and to him
that is near, saith the Lord: and I will
heal them.</hi> This Reconciliation was
actually begun in the Incarnation of our
Lord, and finally compleated by his
Preaching and Suffering here on Earth;
upon which Account he is called <hi>the
Prince of Peace.</hi> And we are said,
<hi>Rom.</hi> V. 1. To <hi>have Peace with God,
through our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Before,
Men had by their Sins proclaimed
themselves Enemies to God, and more
eminently by putting themselves under
the Dominion of the grand Enemy of
God, the Devil, and the protection of
evil Spirits; which was notoriously
done among the Heathens. Christ by
taking our Flesh upon him, and doing
and suffering what afterwards he did,
brought a great part of Mankind, to
the acknowledgment and subjection of
the true God; and having done so, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
up his Life as a Ransom for their
Sins, obtained of his Father to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to them.</p>
            <p>In the Second Sense, <hi>Peace upon Earth</hi>
signifieth the mutual <hi>Peace</hi> of Men.


<pb n="588" facs="tcp:34506:298"/>
This also was foretold by the Prophets,
concerning the times of the Messias,
particularly by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> in XI. and LX.
Chapters, under the Representation of
that peaceable Temper which should
then be visible even in Beasts of Prey.
It cannot be denied, that the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Christianity do strangely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
Men to the Observation of this
excellent temper of Mind; that if the
Precepts of our Lord were indeed uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
regarded, Hatred, Malice and
Revenge would necessarily vanish out
of the World.</p>
            <p>And if Experience doth not justifie
this, it is to be ascribed to the Perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Men, not to the defect of the
Christian Laws. Our Lord reconciled
all Men to God, yet so as that he left
several Conditions to be performed by
Man in order to it; which if he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects,
he will receive no benefit by the
Incarnation of Christ, and be punished
as an Enemy of God. In like manner
Christ hath settled <hi>Peace on Earth,</hi> yet
not forced the Will of Men to observe
it, but hath given such Rules and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
as if observed, cannot but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an universal <hi>Peace.</hi> And so the
ancient Prophesies are to be understood,
not of the effect but of the Tendency
of the Religion of the Messias; altho'


<pb n="589" facs="tcp:34506:298"/>
it cannot be denied, that in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
they actually were accomplished,
and to have taken place wherever the
true Spirit of Christianity was retained.</p>
            <p>Our Lord was born in the most war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Empire, that ever the World saw;
which in more than seven hundred
Years had enjoyed no more than two
years <hi>Peace.</hi> Yet at the time of his
Birth the Wisdom of God directed that
an universal <hi>Peace</hi> should then obtain,
as well to typifie the Peaceableness of
his Doctrine and Gospel, as to facilitate
the Propagation of it. Afterwards for
several Ages the peaceable Principles of
the Gospel seldom wanted their effect in
private Christians: And even wrought
so far in publick Societies professing
Christianity, that for more than five
hundred years after Christ, it is certain
that Christians never warred against
others of the same Communion. Nor
is the blessed Effect of it wholly expired
in these degenerate times. Witness that
great number of Christians, which still
frequent the Holy Sacrament; of whom
it is charitably be to supposed, that none
presumes to approach this holy Table,
without an entire Resolution of forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Injuries, and maintaining <hi>Peace</hi> with
all Men.</p>
            <p>The last part of the Angels Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,


<pb n="590" facs="tcp:34506:299"/>
is <hi>Good-will towards Men:</hi> Which
expresseth much more than Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God to Man; implying no less
than his favour and kindness to them: u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the very same word in the Original,
which God did of his Son, when he said
of him, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom
I am well pleased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Incarnation of Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Assumption of the humane to the
Divine Nature, so far propitiated God
in regard to Men, that he not only
forgave their Sins, and was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to them, but also admitted them
to his Favour, made them capable of
even preter-natural Happiness, even of
enjoying himself in Heaven. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he who had once thro' abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their Sins repented himself that
he had made them, and resolved that
his Spirit should not always strive with
them, did now adopt them for the
Darlings of his Creation, and as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
word in the Text implieth, even
took Pleasure in them: vouchsafed to
Honour theirs by joyning it to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature in the Person of his Son,
and therein raised it to a degree even
above that of Angels; not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
them to that Pardon of past
Sins which was never vouchsafed to the
Angels, but also sending the Prince of


<pb n="591" facs="tcp:34506:299"/>
Angels, and the Lord of Glory, to take hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Flesh upon him, who afterwards ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with it into Heaven, should thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
the whole Mass of Mankind, of which
his Body was the first Fruits, and thereby
make it capable of the same Glory.</p>
            <p>And surely no greater Argument of the
<hi>Good will</hi> of God <hi>towards Men,</hi> or of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in Mankind, could be desired, than to
raise them to the Society of himself in Heaven.
This was the Effect of the delight which he
testified to take in his beloved Son, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Reward of his obedience, that he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
his Human Nature to his own right hand
in Heaven (for his Divine Nature was placed
there from all Ages) and for his Sake admitted
all those, who should imitate his Life and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
to the same Glory. The possession
of Heaven, wherewith the Human Body of
Christ is now invested, is an Argument that
our Nature is capable of it, and an Earnest
that we shall in due time be raised to the same
Honour: <hi>For Christ our forerunner is entred into
Heaven for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet are we not left without other visible
Pledges of the same hope; more particularly
this blessed Sacrament of the Body and Blood
of Christ, wherein is lively represented the
Truth of his Human Nature, and our rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it. The Bread declares his Body,
the Wine his Blood; the breaking of the
Bread the Mortality of his Body, the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the Wine, the shedding of his Blood
to purchase Redemption for Mankind. The
Distribution of both to every Communicant
manifests that they are peculiarly concerned
in all this; that they are Members of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical


<pb n="592" facs="tcp:34506:300"/>
Body of Christ; and by receiving his
Figurative Body, are assured of obtaining in
due time the same Happiness with his true
Body now in Heaven.</p>
            <p>By these Figures of his true Body we open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profess our Belief of his Incarnation, that
he really took Human Flesh upon him for our
Sakes, and not only in appearance, as was
the vain Imagination of ancient Hereticks,
for that cannot be so much as represented,
which is not real. We acknowledge his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature at the same time, by that Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
both of Mind and Body, which ought
to accompany this religious Action: We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
our Belief that he came in the fulness of
time, and that in time all the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
were fullfilled, in that we celebrate
the very time of his Coming; as the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Offices, of <hi>this Festival</hi> directs.</p>
            <p>Lastly, We secure to our selves the Benefits
of this wonderful Mystery; if we do all this
with sincere Faith, Repentance and Charity.
So shall we give occasion to the Holy Angels
to renew their Hymn, to sing <hi>Glory to God,</hi>
who is honoured by this Devotion and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of his Servants; <hi>Peace on Earth,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Men are hereby reconciled to God, and to
each other; and <hi>Good-will towards Men,</hi> who
are hereby admitted to the Favour of God,
and will be hereafter to the Fruition of him.
<hi>Which God of his infinite Mercy Grant.</hi>
