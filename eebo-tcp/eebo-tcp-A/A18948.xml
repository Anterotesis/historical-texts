         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing minded (Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Reader) to publiſh
in Print my Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made at Paules
croſſe, I thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
to make thee
priuie what occaſions
mooued me heereunto. Firſt therefore know
that the requeſt of a worſhipful frend of mine,
and his reaſon for the ſame alleged were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
and chiefe motiues in this matter: his
manifolde good turnes on the one ſide did ſo
greatly binde me, that by denying his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and godly demand, I ſhould haue ſpotted
and defiled my ſelfe with the ignominious, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
&amp; beaſtly ſtaine of ingratitude which
I haue alwayes in all men diſcommended and
hated, and in my ſelfe (to the vttermost of my
power) ſhunned and auoided: on the other ſide,
his reaſon propoſed did, as it were, command
me for my countries good, to bring to publike
view my weake and vndeſeruing labors. His
reaſon was, that as I had, in alienating the
faithfull children from the obedience of their
naturall mother, bin a publike hurt (the ſcar
whereof would long be a blemiſh in that faire
<pb facs="tcp:19597:4"/>
ſpouſe the Church of Chriſt) ſo I might hereby
vſe a publike meanes, both to heale the wound,
and alſo (if it were poſſible) to take away the
ſcarre. His demand ſeeming euery way both
reaſonable, neceſſary, &amp; not to be denied, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcended:
conſidering alſo with my ſelfe, that
as I had done great hurt in the church of God,
ſo I was in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience bound to make her all the
ſatiſfaction for the ſame that I could. To theſe
motiues I added further certein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations
of mine owne, why it was neceſſary that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing
ſhould be printed: which were theſe. First,
that I might ſhew a reaſon for the ſatiſfying of
euery man, why I did omit ſome things which
were thought neceſſary by diuers to haue bene
ſpoken of, as Tranſubſtantiation, Indulgences,
Seruice in an vnknowen tongue, &amp; ſuch like:
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I deſire to remaine ſatiſfied with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.
My purpoſe &amp; meaning was not at that
time to diſcourſe of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies, or particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one by one to confute euery error, for that (as
euery wiſe man knoweth) had bene impoſſible
for me as then to haue performed: for euery
error and controuerſie doth miniſter ſufficient
matter for a whole, yea, for many ſermons, but
my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thither was to no other purpoſe, but
to confeſſe &amp; acknowledge my fault, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to renounce and abiure all thoſe falſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
which I once held. Neither do I think
<pb facs="tcp:19597:4"/>
it greatly neceſſary to make any ſupply in this
Preface of thoſe ſuppoſed wants which before
I mentioned: onely I deſire thee (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
to haue this opinion of me, that, although
I haue but ſpoken of a few particulars, yet that
(according to my proteſtation made) I haue
a generall, and faithfull deteſtation of all the
reſt, as my future life and labours (by Gods
grace) ſhall ſufficiently witneſſe. Wherefore
reſt not diſcontented or vnſatiſfied in any
thing, but if haply thou be driuen to any doubt
through the malicious ſuggeſtion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
or thine owne infirmitie and weakeneſſe,
know that in ſuch caſes thou art bound both
in religious charitie and Chriſtian duetie to
reforme and remooue ſuch corrupt &amp; vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
opinions against thine euen Chriſtian,
or at the leaſt ſuspend thy iudgement in what
matter ſoeuer that is not too openly manifeſt
&amp; apparent. Carie not a ſuspicious &amp; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
iudgement of the trueth and ſinceritie of
my ſoule, for feare of iudging thine owne ſoule.

you iudge other men, you ſhalbe iudged: and
with what meaſure you mete, the ſame ſhalbe
meaſured to you againe. But thinke that I
am a Christian as thou art, and haue a care
<pb facs="tcp:19597:5"/>
to pleaſe God, as haply thou haſt, and haue fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowledge in spirituall matters then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one, to whom the peruſing of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
may come, &amp; therefore do know in more
ample ſort, that hypocriſie and double dealing
with God and his Church is a double wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
at whoſe girdle there hangeth a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſcourge and puniſhment. Remember that
thou art admoniſhed by the the Apoſtle Saint
Paul,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> not to iudge another mans ſeruant for
he doth either ſtand or fall to his master; that
is, to God, before whoſe tribunall we ſhall all
ſtand, and giue an account euery one for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
let vs not therefore, ſayth he, any more
iudge another, but iudge this rather, that no
man put a ſtumbling blocke, or an occaſion to
fall in his brothers way. My meaning here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou mayeſt eaſily gather, and God grant
thou may vſe it to the benefite of thine owne
ſoule, and Christes ſmall flocke.</p>
            <p>The ſecond cauſe that mooued me to the
publiſhing heereof, was the good that might
hereby grow to thoſe that be but lightly infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with Papiſtrie, that by my example, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my conuerſion, and reading my Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they may be mooued to conſider, for the
ſafetie of their ſoules, the great perill and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
danger wherein they doe continually
liue, and ſo they may call to God for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb facs="tcp:19597:5"/>
vnction of his holy spirit, and the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
gift of his grace, that may cure their
wounds, and leade them to the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his pure trueth. And thoſe that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
by my doctrine &amp; example haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or doe goe astray, may by theſe meanes
(which I heartily aske of God for his ſonne
Ieſus Christ his ſake) be reduced againe into
the right way: and for mine owne part I ſhall
for euer heereafter haue the teſtimonie of a
better conſcience, that I haue not bene negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
herein to performe the duetie of a good
Chriſtian, in putting ſuch in minde of their
estates, and ſhewing them the meanes (the
like wherof, if they aske it as they ſhould, God
doubtleſſe will not denie them) of my conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
If I had contented my ſelfe with the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
matter, and not haue proceeded any
further to publiſh the ſame, the world might
haue layed ſome blame on me, and reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me for lighting of a candle, and putting
it vnder a buſhell, but being put on a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke,
and left indifferently to giue light to all,
not preſently, but for posterity, I ſhall be, I
hope, in this behalfe, free from the calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any.</p>
            <p>Conſider I pray thee (deare Chriſtian) if
thou bee a Papist, or any thing addicted that
way, that thou canst not imagine any ſinister
<pb facs="tcp:19597:6"/>
cauſe for the which I ſhould (as they ſay) haue
turned my coat; the greateſt cauſe of all things
which thou canſt thinke of, is worldly wealth,
which on that ſide I neuer wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, nor any thing
els that was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient either for my pleaſures
or neceſſities, and therefore I had no cauſe for
that to forſake them, if I had not bene induced
thereto by further conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; means, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is the regard of worldly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe,
(as thou ſhalt more largely vnderſtand
in my recantation) they were the onely things
that for a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time withheld me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> embracing
the pure waters that ſpring to euerlaſting life.
But perchance thou wilt ſay, I hoped for better
then I had, beleeue me no, I neither hoped for
better, nor haue ſo good; notwithſtanding (if I
ſhould be driuen to beg my bread) let all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
in the world know, that I will not forſake
the kingdome of heauen for this worldes good,
neither doe I make my bodily life more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
then my ſoule: for what would it profite
me to winne the whole world, and to loſe my
ſoule? or what exchange ſhould I make
with God for my ſoule? I know they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
me againe, if I would like a dog returne
yet to my vomite, but farre be that from me:
better it were for me neuer to haue bin borne
then once to thinke on any ſuch matter, and I
hope, God that hath done thus mercifully by
<pb facs="tcp:19597:6"/>
me, and delt thus mightily with me, hath not,
nor will not beſtow his grace in vayne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me,
but will perfect his worke ſo effectually begun.
The laſt cauſe that moued me to publiſh theſe
preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, was, to aſſure the aduerſaries (to whoſe
hands I am ſure they wil come) that I neither
haue done, nor hereafter wil doe any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of malice, but in all my procedings I
haue, &amp; will deale as charitably as I can, not
betraying the trueth of God, which I preferre
before the eſtimation of the whole world: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would I haue any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to think, that I ſpeak
as though I did any thing at all relie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their
good opinions of me, for that I am aſſured they
hate me as the deuil, and will not ſticke to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
all the labour they can to deface and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite
both me and my calling. But let them
not ſpare, their enuious carping will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
in them the lying ſpirite that ouerru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them, and euery one that is not as blinde
as themſelues, will ſoone perceiue their <hi>legier
de maine:</hi> and although their buzzing will
obtaine place in the eares of their complices
and fautors, who are alwayes ready to bandie
the balls which their leaders toſſe, ſo farre as
the ſlanderous blaſtes of their wicked mouthes
will cary them, yet I hope the force of them
(flie they neuer ſo ſtiffely) ſhall not bee able to
make winke the leaſt child in Gods Church,
<pb facs="tcp:19597:7"/>
much leſſe ouerthrow him.</p>
            <p>Moreouer I doe heartily deſire euery
Chriſtian reader to weigh with good conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
theſe preſents. Yf thou be already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with error and blindneſſe, pray to God
that he will beſtow vpon thee the cleare light
of his truth: perſiſt not wilfully in wickednes,
but take occaſion hereby to ſift and try the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that is aſwell in thy ſelfe as in thy teachers,
if thou be ignorant and vnlearned, builde not
thy faith vpon the credite and good opinion of
other men, ſay not (as I know many haue and
doe ſay) I am not able to render an accompt
of this or that thing, but I know it is true, I
muſt beleeue ſo, becauſe this learned man, or
theſe diuines, and good men beleeue ſo: aſke,
them, they are able to giue you an anſwere
both for themſelues &amp; me: it is a weake buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that hath ſo ſhallowe, and vncertaine a
foundation, and a ſimple faith is it that is pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſo ſlenderly to other mens ſleaues: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
Saint Peter biddeth thee to bee able
and readie to render an account of thy faith
to euery one that ſhall demand it at thy hands,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note>
I meane not that thou art ſo exactly bound as
he that teacheth both thee and others, but in
ſome good meaſure according to thy abilitie,
and the talent that God hath lent thee, thou
art bound to knowe what thou beleeueſt, in
<pb facs="tcp:19597:7"/>
whom thou beleeueſt, &amp; what thou art bound
to beleeue. Build not therefore thy faith vpon
the faith of other men, for that foundation
cannot chuſe but faile thee, but erect thy buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vpon the immooueable rocke Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
of whom the ſcriptures doe moſt plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beare witneſſe.<note place="margin">Iohn 5.</note> Art thou learned? ſearch
the ſcriptures for in them ye thinke to haue
eternall life, and they are they that teſtifie of
me, &amp;c. Art thou vnlearned? goe to thy
Paſtor, goe to him that hath charge of thy
ſoule, and receiueth inſtruction from God for
thee, The Prieſtes lippes ſhall preſerue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
&amp; thou ſhalt ſeeke the law at his mouth,
for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſtes.<note place="margin">Mal. 2.</note>
So thou ſeeſt whether thou be learned or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
thou art without excuſe if thou be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
in thy duety, becauſe God of his great
goodneſſe and infinite mercy hath left thee
ſufficient meanes to come vnto him, for which
cauſe we were all created, I meane truly and
duetifully to ſerue God. God hath created all
things both in heauen and earth for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe
and benefite of man, but hee hath made
man onely for his owne ſelfe, for his owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
wherein to be negligent and ignorant, is
a hie contempt of God, &amp; meere ingratitude
for his manifold benefites. If hitherto there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou haſt beene negligent and blinde, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
<pb facs="tcp:19597:8"/>
thy time with thy future diligence.
What ſhall I ſay (deare Chriſtian) but onely
this, leaue the muddie and troubled waters,
which thou draweſt out of the durtie pits of
mens imaginations, and returne to pure
ſprings and welles of life, where thou mayeſt
freely without money or danger drinke thy
fill, and ſo ſatiate thy ſelfe, that thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thirſt againe.</p>
            <p>Thoſe whom God hath called in his feare,
I doe earneſtly wiſh to bee warie how they
walke, and carefull that they be not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
by any maner of falſe prophets: if at any
time thou conuerſe with them by chance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
God to giue thee ſtrength and grace not
to be tempted, if thou be tempted, that it be not
aboue thy ſtrength. <hi>Qui ſtat videat ne ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat,</hi>
hee that ſtandeth let him take heede hee
fall not: for wee carie this treaſure that God
hath giuen vs in veſſels more brittle then

of the holy Ghoſt) be ſubiect to pollution by
ſinne, and our ſoules to bee infected with falſe
doctrine, which will ſeeme in the mouth as
pleaſant as hony, but in the throate it will bee
more bitter then wormewood and gall. It is
like a canker which creepeth ſecretly, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

<pb facs="tcp:19597:8"/>
if thou wilt not be bitten with the ſnake, ſleepe
not neere the hedge: hee that toucheth pitch,
muſt needes cary away ſome ſtayne, and the

and therfore giue credence to me that knowes

            <p>Laſtly, I am to giue thee to vnderſtand
(good Reader) that for ſundry cauſes I haue

thee not to looke for any expreſſe methode

to ſome of my friendes, by way of declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what I had done, and nowe it is thought
meete to publiſh it in the ſame forme together
with this: whereby thou mayeſt conſider how
willing I am to make ſuch ſufficient ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Church of God as my abilitie may
extend vnto, and how glad I ſhal be if any one
doe take benefite by my labours. And for that
I knowe it a thing impoſſible that any one
<pb facs="tcp:19597:9"/>
worke ſhould pleaſe euery man, but that there
will be ſome fault fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; either the inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of the man, or the maner of his methode,
or the raggedneſſe of ſtile, or ſome ſuch like
matter will bee reprehended, becauſe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to the ſcanning of farre more ſufficient
perſons then the Author himſelfe commonly
is, (though one man ſometimes is as ſufficient
as another) ſome alſo are more ignorant, and
therefore can not iudge vprightly, and ſome
are curious, and ſeeke rather a fine and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

there remaineth a great corruption in

it neuer ſo conuenient and fit for them: for
my part I regard not the ſlanders of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious,
nor the ſcoffes of the curious, nor the

vndertooke theſe labours for the cauſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayde,
ſo in humilitie I offer them for the

            <p>Hauing with great danger, by reaſon of

being arriued in England, I fell buſtly to
worke in my profeſſion and calling, letting
paſſe no opportunitie, but vſing all meanes
that I could to become a worthy workman,
(in deede a waſtfull deſtroyer) in God his
vineyarde. I forbeare to ſpeake of the zeale
I had, the paines I tooke, my dayes labors,
my night watchings, &amp;c. In all which I
humbly confeſſe to Almightie God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
before this worthy aſſembly,
that I did nothing els but dayly more and
more offend God, impugne his trueth, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
his Church, and peruert his people, by
labouring to ſeduce them from his true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
into idolatry, and to bring them from
their naturall &amp; dutifull obedience towards
their Prince, vnto the ſeruile yoke and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of the Pope, I meane, in perſwading
them to acknowledge his Papall dignitie,
and vſurping ſupreme authoritie ouer all
Kings and Princes of the world. Whereby
beſide the hatred of God, I incurred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high

moſt gracious Queene, as alſo the penalties

of her godly and moſt iuſt lawes made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

proteſt before the dreadful ſeate of the moſt

of Religion of malice, as knowing and

it was of blinde zeale maſqued and
caried away with ignorance and error. And
although I ſayde before that I had ſome

was but afarre off, it was but a ſuperficiall

that a man knowes nothing (knowe

            <p>At the length, when God had brought
me to heare in ſome good meaſure, he
taught me to conſider of diuers things, the
which for breuities ſake I will omitte to
ſpeake of in this place: by conſideration he
bread in me a doubting of the eſtate of my

the cleare knowledge of his trueth, the
which as then I had no meanes to atteine,
but by the ſecret manuduction of his holy
ſpirite, and the reading of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
by bothe which, it pleaſed his
heauenly Maieſtie of his accuſtomed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
to reforme my ſtrayed iudgement, and
thus by little and little, he taught me as it
were, the firſt rudiments of his true faith,

of two woods, of life and of death. Firſt, he

               <pb facs="tcp:19597:14"/>
This part of his ſtumbling blocke being
but a little ſtirred, he aſſaulted me preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with a ſecond thing of no leſſe importance
then the firſt, which was mine owne eſtate
in this maner: That admit my life were
ſpared, yet I had not to looke for any liuing
or maintenance, and hauing of my ſelfe
none, I ſhould by recanting, bring my ſelfe
to pouertie and miſery, and be of none ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.
Whereas now I wanted nothing
I could wiſh for, and was reputed amongſt
the beſt. Againſt this I had nothing to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
but onely an vncertaine hope (as I
thought) of her Maieſties bountie, and the
wiſdome, and charitable care of her honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
counſaile, for the prouiding for of ſuch
manner of perſons. Briefely after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
had throughly wrought in me, the feare
and vncertaintie of both life and liuing,
therein he left me miſerablie deiected, and
wreſtling, in ſo much that for a great ſpace
after I remained here and there in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
for vpon this my reſolution, I quite
forſooke the chiefe place of my vſuall ſtaye
and abode: but could proceede no further,
till at the laſt in place where I was, in my
ſecrete chamber, word was brought me of
the taking of one of my coate, whom I wel
knew. Theſe newes bread in me ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb facs="tcp:19597:14"/>
feare, that from thenceforth I could
not be in quiet. Wherefore with as much
conuenient ſpeede as might be, I prouided
for my iourney towards London, whither
being come, becauſe I was in the place as
it were a meere ſtranger, and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with no one to whom I durſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
my minde in a matter ſo dangerous, I
was (by reaſon of my feares aforeſaid) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to deferre my ſubmiſſion, vntill it
would pleaſe God, either to offer me fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
thereto by ſome one or other, or
that he ſhould endue me with ſufficient cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and fortitude to peforme my determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
purpoſe, the which at the length of his
great goodnes he graunted me, but making
me to knowe withall, that his honour and
glory muſt alwayes be ſought of me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be for my temporall auaile, or diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.
Thus at the laſt he hath deliuered
me from all mine enemies, for which great
worke and mercie of his, what haue I, but
with the prophet Dauid to ſay,<note place="margin">Pſal. 123.</note> 
               <hi>Benedictus

<pb facs="tcp:19597:15"/>
euen as a birde out of the foulers ſnare
the ſnare is broken and we are deliuered.</p>
            <p>It followeth touching the a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iuration of
thoſe errors which once I held, but now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
that I ſpeake ſomewhat. To ſtand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
euery particular it is not my meaning, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe I purpoſe to make any long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
vpon thoſe poynts which I will
touch: alſo I meane to ſpeake but of a fewe
things, becauſe this time will not ſuffer me
to handle many, neither theſe fewe as I
would. If my order in placing the poynts
handled ſeeme prepoſterous to the learned,
I preferre their iudgements, and deſire
them to pardon my wants, and accept herein
my dutifull labours.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if at the firſt I ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to put the axe to the roote of the tree
whereon the reſt of the branches growe, I
ſhall at once ouerthrowe both the one and
the other, and becauſe I will leaue my ſelfe
more ſcope (though otherwiſe I could finde
ſufficient) I will beginne with ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
branches and ſo deſcend to the bodie
and roote: but whether I beginne at the
toppe or in the middle it is no great matter,
for my meaning is to deſtroy all, though not
in all, yet in my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore to ſpeake of the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb facs="tcp:19597:15"/>
of Images, which the aduerſe part
holdeth for great pietie and religion, I can
finde no warrant therefore in holy writ, but
contrarily I finde it expreſly forbidden,
with fearefull curſes therefore threatned:
as in the ſecond commandement of the firſt
table it is forbidden in theſe wordes,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Thou
ſhalt make thee no grauen Image, neither

               <note place="margin">Wiſd. 13.</note> Alſo in another place, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,</hi>
(which may import ſo much as to
ſay accurſed) <hi>are they, &amp; among the dead
is their hope, that call them gods which
are the works of mens hands, golde, and
ſiluer, and the thing that is inuented by
arte, &amp;c.</hi> Many other places I could alledge
againſt the making and worſhipping of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
but I will omit them, onely I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe
<pb facs="tcp:19597:16"/>
vnto you the wordes of <hi>Tertullian</hi>
vpon this matter,<note place="margin">Tert. de Idol.</note> &amp; ſo I will paſſe further.
<hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath forbidden an Image
aſwel to be made as to be worſhipped &amp;c.</hi>
And a little after hee goeth forward in this
ſort, <hi>Some one or other to mainteine ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie
will ſay, Why then did Moſes make
the Image of the braſen ſerpent in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes?</hi>
Which obiection he anſwereth in
this ſort. One and the ſelfe ſame God hath
by his eternall lawe forbidden any Image
to bee made, and alſo by his extraordinarie
and ſpeciall commandement the Image of
a ſerpent to be made: If thou be obedient to
the ſame God, thou haſt his lawe, make thou
no Image: but if thou haue a regard to the
Image of the ſerpent afterwards made by
Moyſes, then doe thou as Moyſes did, make
not any Image againſt the law, vnleſſe God
command thee as hee did Moyſes. What
neede we to ſtand vpon moe proofes herein?
theſe I take for this time ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the trueth of the matter: And herein
I aſſent and conſent to the true doctrine of
Chriſt his vniuerſall Church &amp; affirme the
doctrine of the Romane Church herein to be
falſe and erronious, and therefore I vtterly
renounce and abiure it.</p>
            <p>Touching prayer for the dead, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereth
<pb facs="tcp:19597:16"/>
to another abſurditie like to it ſelfe
which is Purgatorie, although out of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of Councels and olde Fathers many
profes ſeeme to be deducted for the maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
therof, yet in the whole proceſſe of holy
Scriptures, (which as the Prophet Dauid
ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.</note> 
               <hi>are lanternes vnto our feete, and
lights vnto our paths)</hi> I finde no warrant
for either of them, but contrariwiſe that they
are both vaine and friuolous. As for example
in the Reuelations it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Reuel. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Beati mortui
qui in Domino moriuntur. <hi>Bleſſed are the
dead that die in the Lord, for they reſt
from their labours, &amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> If euery ſoule that
dieth in the Lord bee bleſſed, then there are
none that die in the Lorde in Purgatorie,
where there is no bleſſedneſſe, (but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their opinion) all miſerie and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie
euen as in hell it ſelfe. Secondly
it is ſaid, that they reſt from their labours.
If then they reſt from their labours, it muſt
needes followe that they are not in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
where (as they themſelues ſay) are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
labours, though not actiue yet paſſiue.
Whereupon I inferre two things. Firſt,
that no ſaued ſoule goeth to Purgatorie,
which is meant by thoſe which die in the
Lord, for euery one that dieth in the Lord by
ſufficient teſtimonie of this place is bleſſed,
<pb facs="tcp:19597:17"/>
which cannot be but in poſſeſſing the viſion
and ſight of God in whome onely the dead
haue and enioy all bleſſedneſſe, the which
none can haue and enioy, but onely thoſe
which are ſaued, as alſo reſt from all, and all
maner of labours which cannot bee had nor
found in Purgatorie, being as I ſaid before
(according to the aduerſaries opinion) a
place of torment and vnreſt, and this place
of Scripture attributing both bleſſedneſſe
and reſt, and that immediately after their
death to all that die in the Lord, that is the
ſeruants of the Lord, it muſt needes be that
euery ſuch ſoule is in heauen &amp; not in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.
Secondly, I inferre that there is
no ſuch place as Purgatorie, becauſe there
is no vſe of nor for any ſuch place. For all the
creatures, things and places which God
made, hee made them for ſome ende, vſe and
purpoſe: for he made nothing in vaine, and
in all the Scriptures we neither finde men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of Purgatorie, nor vſe for any
ſuch place, which no doubt would haue bene
done if the place had bene, and of ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
as the aduerſaries affirme it to bee,
either by Chriſt himſelfe, or his Apoſtles
(who haue left vs written all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
for our ſaluation) therfore I may ſafely
conclude that there is no Purgatorie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19597:17"/>
That praiers auaile not the dead (becauſe
I haue bene ſo tedious before) I wil only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
one example out of Eccleſiaſtes.<note place="margin">Eccle. 9.</note> 
               <hi>The
dead</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>knowe nothing at all, and
they haue no more portion for euer in all
that is done vnder the ſunne.</hi> If it bee ſo,
then in praiers they haue no portion. If they
haue no portion in prayers, then in vaine doe
they pray for the dead. Thus wee ſee this
their doctrine, both of praier for the dead and
Purgatorie, to be falſe and ſuperſtitious, and
therefore I renounce and abiure it.</p>
            <p>Prayer to Saints as Mediatours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and vs, I finde to derogate
from the ſole mediation of Chriſt by theſe
teſtimonies of holy Scripture:<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Come vnto
me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>all ye that are laden and
wearie, and I will eaſe you.</hi> Alſo in another
place,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.</note> 
               <hi>I am the way, the trueth and the
life: no man commeth to the father but by
me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> And S. Paul to Timothie, <hi>There is
one God, and one Mediatour betweene
God and man: euen the man Chriſt Ieſus,
which gaue him ſelfe a ranſome for all
men, &amp;c.</hi> In all which places wee finde no
mention made of this or that Saint, but of
Chriſt himſelfe. Therefore this doctrine
alſo as falſe and erronious I abiure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19597:18"/>
Concerning the propitiatorie ſacrifice of
the Maſſe for the liuing and the dead, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that it is iniurious and derogatorie to
the death and paſſion of Chriſt: for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries
will haue Chriſt to be dayly offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
both for the liuing and the dead. But
S. Paul ſaith that Chriſt needed not to be
dayly offered, or often times to offer for the
peoples ſinnes, as the Prieſtes of the olde
law did,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.</note> for now ſaith he, <hi>In the end of the
world he hath appeared once to put away
ſinne by the ſacrifice of himſelfe &amp;c.</hi> And
in another place hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> 
               <hi>That with one
oblation hee hath conſecrated for euer
thoſe that are ſanctified &amp;c.</hi> And S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> that <hi>Chriſt hath once ſuffered for
ſinnes, the iuſt for the vniuſt, that he might
bring vs to God. &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore this one
oblation of Chriſt I confeſſe to bee ſolely
propitiatorie, and ſufficient for my ſinnes,
and for the ſinnes of ten thouſand worldes,
(if there were ſo many) and I abiure all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
propitiatorie ſacrifices and oblations
whatſoeuer as blaſphemous and iniurious
to this.</p>
            <p>Moreouer I find in the olde Teſtament
no mo Sacraments prefigured, and in the
new no mo inſtituted by our ſauiour Chriſt
(who onely had power to inſtitute them)
<pb facs="tcp:19597:18"/>
then two: that is to ſay, the ſacrament of
Baptiſme, and the Lordes ſupper: and the
other fiue I finde to be made ſacraments by
the preſumptious inuentions of men, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as their vaine inſtitutions and fantaſies
I abiure &amp; renounce them as ſacraments.</p>
            <p>Iuſtification is an other great poynt,
which the aduerſaries make to conſiſt of
two partes, that is to ſay, of Faith, and of
our owne woorkes and merites: but the
Scriptures allowe not workes as cauſes,
and reteine only faith as the inſtrumentall
cauſe of our iuſtification: for the Apoſtle
ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> 
               <hi>There is no difference, all haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and are depriued of the glory of God,
&amp; are iuſtified freely by his grace through
the redemption that is in Chriſt Ieſu &amp;c.</hi>
And it followeth in the ſame Chapter,
<hi>Therefore we conclude that a man is iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by faith without the woorkes of the
law &amp;c.</hi> And in another place he ſaith, <hi>By
grace ye are ſaued through faith, and that
not of your ſelues: it is the gift of God, not
of workes, leſt any man ſhould boaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:</hi>
whereby it is euident that mens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
auaile not to iuſtification, and therfore
this doctrine of the aduerſaries, together
with the reſt, I renounce and abiure.</p>
            <p>As for the authoritie of princes in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:19597:19"/>
Eccleſiaſticall, (for in Temporall I
knowe no doubt) had not Ioſua, Dauid,
Salomon, and other Kings and Rulers,
power to commaunde and intermeddle in
cauſes Eccleſiaſticall?<note place="margin">Ioſh. 3.</note> Did not Ioſua co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and appoint the Prieſts and Leuites
how and in what manner they ſhould carry
the Arke of God? and by warrant from
Gods owne mouth, direct and gouerne
them in the bearing thereof ouer the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Iordan? Did not God often times
manifeſt the diſpoſing of holy things to the
Kings rather then to the Prieſts? which in
no caſe he would haue done, if his will had
bene that they ſhould haue had no dealings
in ſuch kind of cauſes. As for the examples
of Dauid &amp; Salomon, becauſe the wordes
of text are too long to recite, I referre the
Chriſtian audience to the peruſing of theſe
places of ſcripture, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Chron. 13. 15. &amp;
16. chap. the 7. 8. and 9. Chap. of the third
booke of Kings according to ſome tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
according to other ſome, the firſt
booke. By theſe and diuers other teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
both of the olde and new Teſtament,
I haue ſufficient warrant to acknowledge
not onely the right and authoritie of my
dread ſoueraigne in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall
within all her Maieſties Dominions, but
<pb facs="tcp:19597:19"/>
alſo of all Chriſtian kings and Princes in
their proper landes and Realmes, and the
contrary doctrine (as ful of lurking poyſon)
I renounce and abiure.</p>
            <p>And here I will ende with the Pope, as
the roote and body from whence &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all branches of errors and ſuperſtitions
do grow: but becauſe I haue already plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared vnto you his groſſeneſſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impudencie in doctrine, I ſhall haue
leſſe occaſion to ſtand vpon himſelfe, for by
the fruite we are to iudge what the tree is.
It is impoſſible,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> ſaith Chriſt, that a man
ſhould gather grapes of thornes, or figs of
thiſtles: euen ſo it is impoſſible that a man
ſhould draw vertuous and wholeſome doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
forth of an infected fountaine, ſuch an
one as the Pope is, who ſeeketh his owne
glory, and mainteineth his glory by his
owne doctrine, neglecting or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
both the glory &amp; doctrine of Chriſt.
Whoſe inſolent pride and vſurping autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
ouer all Chriſtian kings and Princes,
as alſo his deuiliſh madneſſe in oppoſing
himſelfe againſt God and his Church, by
ſowing the ſeede of falſe doctrine in the
hearts of people, make me to confeſſe him
to be that abomination of deſolation ſitting
in the holy place, which was prophecied by
<pb facs="tcp:19597:20"/>
Daniel,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> and mentioned of our Sauiour
Chriſt himſelfe in S. Matthewes Goſpel.<note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note>
Wherefore, as an infectiue poyſon, and
creeping canker, I loath, deteſt and abiure
him, renounce his authoritie, &amp; from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth
vtterly reclayme from the whole
heape and maſſe of all his confuſed errors
and deuiliſh opinions whatſoeuer, aſwell
thoſe hereafter to bee inuented and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
as thoſe already by him &amp; his taught
and authoriſed.</p>
            <p>Alſo I denie that he hath any power, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
or iuriſdiction ouer our ſoueraigne
and gracious Queene Elizabeth, or ouer
any of her Highneſſe ſubiects and liege
people, either in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall or
Temporall, and in defence of this doctrine
in particular, as alſo of all the poyntes of
true religion taught in this Realme, and
by her gracious Maieſtie aucthoriſed, I
now my ſelfe and whatſoeuer from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
I ſhalbe able to performe. And I am
heartily ſorie that euer I offended (in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
the contrary) my merciful God, my
dread Soueraigne, &amp; my deare countrey.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore with penitent heart &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
ſoule before the tribunall of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie,
I deſire his diuine Maieſtie for his
mercies ſake, and for his onely ſome Ieſus
<pb facs="tcp:19597:20"/>
Chriſt his ſake, to regard mee at this preſent
with his merciful eyes, and from henceforth
to guide and protect mee with his mightie
hand, that I may alwaies reſt vnder the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

his iudgement, that he impute not vnto mee
my grieuous ſinnes and tranſgreſſions, but
that he wil burie them in the ſacred and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
wounds of his deare Sonne, and couer
them with the vaile of his holy mercies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I beſeech my ſoueraigne and
gracious Queene to pardon my ignorances,
preſumptions, and whatſoeuer beſides I
haue offended in, eyther againſt her or her
Maieſties godly lawes &amp; proceedings: with
bended knees beſeeching her Highneſſe to
accept of my humble and voluntarie ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and to admit me again into the number
of her Maieſties loyall ſubiects, and from
hencefoorth I vowe vnto her Maieſtie my
true ſeruice and duetifull obedience.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I craue pardon of all men
in generall, whom I haue any wayes ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized,

thoſe whome by erronious doctrine I haue

            <p>Laſtly, I humbly beſeech this honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

your deuout mindes are readily mooued
thereunto, I wil omit to vſe any further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation
therein, but will leaue the matter
wholy to the motion and working of Gods
holy ſpirit in all men.</p>
            <p>To conclude, for as much as I haue bene
credibly enfourmed by ſome, and haue fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
found it extant in writing, that ſome in
this our Realme and in other places haue
promiſed, ſworne, ſubſcribed, and for a time
vſed the holy Sacraments in the Church
deceitfully, againſt their owne conſcience,
minding hereby firſt vnder the externall
cloake of religion to corrupt and ſubuert
ſecretely Gods true religion within the
Church, and afterward when time hath ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
became open enemies and perſecutors
of the ſame, vnder vaine hope of the Popes
diſpenſation deuiſed againſt the worde of
God, to his great confuſion and their double
condemnation at the day of iudgement: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
willing for mine owne part, ſo farre
foorth as in me lieth, to take away all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſuch hypocriſie, diſſimulation and
double dealing with God and his Church, I
proteſt before the dreadfull Maieſtie of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
<pb facs="tcp:19597:21"/>
God, who is the ſearcher of all
hearts, that my heart and minde doe fully

to this preſent act by any conſtraint or

of gaine, or other ſiniſter cauſe whatſoeuer,
but onely by the meere perſwaſion of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
through the knowledge and loue of
Gods true religion begun in my heart by
the holy Ghoſt, the profection and perfection
whereof, I leaue to the mercifull working

            <head>THE RECANTATION
of THOMAS CLARKE, made in an
other publike aſſemblie and congregation after
the hearing of Diuine ſeruice, and a Sermon
made by M. MVNSEY, Preacher, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the holy Communion, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with others I there and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
on Eaſter day, being
the 15. of Aprill,
1593.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> There ſtanding before the
dreadfull throne of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
God and the face of the
preſent congregation hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
confeſſed my ſelfe to
haue bene for the ſpace of
theſe fiue yeres laſt paſt a traitour to God, an
enemie to his holy Church and Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
of the errors, and deuiliſh opinions of
papiſtrie, and conſequently a rebellious tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
to my Soueraigne prince and deare
countrie.</p>
            <p>Howe that about fiue yeres paſt I depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my natiue countrey, and went into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
landes beyonde the ſeas, without the
leaue or authoritie of any Magiſtrate: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I incurred the danger of the lawes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
and inſtituted for the ſame cauſe.</p>
            <p>How that being beyond the ſeas I ſuffred
my ſelfe to be perſwaded by the counſaile of
<pb facs="tcp:19597:22"/>
lewd and ſeditious men to take vpon me the
gawling yoke, and ouerſwaying burthen of
popiſh prieſt hoode: and for that cauſe I went
into the kingdome of France to the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
of Rhemes, where I ſtudied certaine
yeres, &amp; was then made prieſt, &amp; ſhortly after
was by the Preſident of the Engliſh Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
Colledge at Rhemes ſent into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
to the ende and intent to withdrawe the
peoples heartes from the true ſeruice of
God and their dutifull obedience towardes
their prince, vnto the pernicious and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
errors of papiſtrie, and the tyranical ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
and ſlauerie of the Pope: Whom to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with diuers of his anteceſſors &amp; ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
I acknowledged to be that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuate
whore of Babilon, and that antichriſt whom
Saint Iohn hath moſt liuely painted foorth
and deſcribed in his Reuelations.</p>
            <p>In this danable buſineſſe aforeſaid I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I had laboured for the ſpace of two
yeeres, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting dayly more and more high
treaſon againſt God, &amp; my Souerainge and
moſt gratious Queene: affirming that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out
all doubte I had obſtinatly died in that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
&amp; damnable eſtate (as many of my coate
and profeſſion had done before) if by Gods
will I had bene apprehended in any ſearch
or by any other meanes before the grace of
<pb facs="tcp:19597:23"/>
God had lightened the blindnes of my vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
which by his holy prouidence and
tender mercy was in due time powred, and
that aboundantly, into the feſtered woundes
of my gaſping ſoule. For being forcibly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with the diuine finger of Gods holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
I began to reuiue, and manifeſtly to ſee
my deſperate eſtate and deuiliſh madneſſe.</p>
            <p>Then was I taught by Gods holy ſpirite
and the reading of holy Scriptures, that I
ought to be ſubiect and obedient to my ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
prince.</p>
            <p>That mans iuſtification and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
commeth not of himſelfe by his owne
merits, but that it is the free gift of God
through faith in Ieſu Chriſt.</p>
            <p>That praying to Images is flat Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
            <p>That praying to Saintes, Purgatorie,
mens traditions and ſuch like, are damnable
errors, and derogatorie to the honor of God.</p>
            <p>That in Chriſts holy ſupper we doe eate
his fleſh and drinke his blood ſpiritually
through faith, not groſly and carnally as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I helde.</p>
            <p>That the dayly offering vp of Chriſt in
the maſſe is damnable, and derogatorie to the
death and paſſion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I confeſſed my ſelfe to be heartily
<pb facs="tcp:19597:23"/>
ſory for hauing herein ſo highly offended
God, my Soueraigne, and the world, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
crauing pardon for the ſame.</p>
            <p>And there I did from the bottome of my
heart &amp; ſoule abiure and renounce the Pope
and al his tyrannicall power &amp; iuriſdiction,
abhorre and deteſt the maſſe, and al the heape
of his wicked errors and damnable opinions
whatſoeuer, as wel thoſe which I haue not
here mentioned, as thoſe which I haue here
touched, &amp; by teſtimonies of holy ſcriptures
briefly confuted. And with all reuerence of
ſoule and ſinceritie of conſcience, I then did,
now doe, and for euer (by Gods grace) will
embrace the true faith and wholſome doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This done, I deſired the people to ſay for
me the Lords prayer (which they did) to the
ende I might eaſely obtaine of God truely
to bee inſerted into his myſticall body, and
made a liuely member of his holy Church,
that I might bee a woorthy partaker of his
heauenly table, and that I might hereafter
faithfully walke all the dayes of my life in
the true light of his holy Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Moreouer I then certified the aſſembly,
&amp; do now by theſe preſents verifie, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke
not this preſent matter either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned,
or for feare of torture, (the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb facs="tcp:19597:24"/>
well knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mans faith is not to
be wreſted by violence) or for the auoiding of
any diſpleaſure, or for hope of fauour, or for
any ſiniſter cauſe whatſoeuer, but ſimply and
ſincerly for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> honor of God (who hath wroght
in me this wonderfull worke) for the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Church, &amp; ſatiſfying of the world.</p>
            <p>This clauſe I openly proteſted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
after my ſpeech, being demanded by the
preacher aforeſaid in the pulpit thereof, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of this, viz. that I had receiued neither fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pope, nor fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any of his agents nor any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
no diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, licence, bull, or facultie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
my conuerſion, neither that I euer (as
yet) heard of any ſuch thing to haue bin gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
&amp; if there were, I acknowledged my ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie
to be ſuch, that I was not accompted
a man ſufficient to haue ſo prodigious a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
committed to my truſt and charge.</p>
            <p>This is the ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me &amp; effect of my ſpeaches
to the people. And whatſoeuer I then ſaid,
I do preſently confirme in and vnder myne
owne hand writing: And if this my preſent
acte, and that which I haue already perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ſeeme not ſufficient to the eies and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the wiſe to teſtifie the ſinceritie and
true meaning of my inward repentant ſoule,
I am further readie dutifully to perfourme
whatſoeuer (within my power) ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<pb facs="tcp:19597:24"/>
at my handes, and am willing to
ſpende my life for my Soueraignes
ſafety and my countries good,
againſt whome I haue ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duetifully
and vnnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rebelled.</p>
