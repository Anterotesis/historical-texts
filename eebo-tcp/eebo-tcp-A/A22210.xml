         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas diuers good and necessarie prouisions haue beene
heretofore made, aswell by Act of Parliament, as otherwise, for the well
garbling of Spices and Drugges, to the intent the Subiects of this Our Realme
should not bee occasioned to vse any vnwholsome Spices or Drugges, to the
impay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to buy the bad instead of the good, to the
impairing of their substance. And for as much as the Drugge called Tobacco,
being of late yeeres growne frequent in this Our Realme &amp; other Our
Dominions, is daily sold vngarbled, whereby more inconuenience groweth and
ariseth to Our louing Subiects, then by any other Drugge whatsoeuer. And for
that also by the manie and sundrie abuses practised and committed by
Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Masters of Ships and others, in concealing and vttering the said
Tobacco without paying any Impost or Custome for the same, great losse and
dammage accrueth to Us, notwithstanding any Lawes, Statutes or other course
heretofore taken for preuenting thereof: For remedie of all which
Inconueniences, Wee, by our Letters Patents vnder our great Seale of England,
bearing Date, at Westmynster the fiue and twentieth day of May now last past,
did prohibite and forbid, That no person or persons should at any time after
the day of the Date of our said Letters patents within Our Realme of England,
the Dominion of Wales, and Port and Towne of Barwicke, or any of them; or
within Our Realme of Ireland, or any part of them or any of them, by himselfe
or themselues, or his or their seruants or factours, or any others, directly or
indirectly sell or put to sale; or attempt, presume or goe about any manner of
way to sell or put to sale, either in grosse or by retaile, any Tobacco, of
what sort, kind or growth soeuer, before the Custome and Impost thereof due,
were paid; and the same Tobacco were viewed, distinguished and sealed by the
Officer or Officers of Us, Our Heires and Successours, in that behalfe to be
constituted and appointed; For whose labour, trauell, charges and expences in
that behalfe to be sustained and taken in the execution of the said Office: Wee
did by the said Letters Patents, constitute and appoint, That they should and
might from time to time, demand, take and receiue to their owne vse, of euery
person and persons whose Tobacco they should so garble, viewe and seale, the
summe of foure pence of currant English money, for euery pound weight thereof
so viewed and sealed.</p>
            <p>And Wee did also by Our said Letters Patents (for the
considerations therein mentioned) giue and grant the said Office, with the
powers, fees and authorities before mentioned to Our welbeloued Subiects,
<hi>Francis Nichols, Iasper Leake</hi> and <hi>Philip Eden,</hi> Gentlemen, to
be executed by them or their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties or Assignes for thirtie and one yeeres
next ensuing the Date of the said Letters Patents.</p>
            <p>And Wee did further by Our said Letters, for Us, Our Heires and

per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and persons, which by them or any of them, by writing vnder their or
any of their hands and Seales, should bee in that behalfe deputed and assigned,
full power and authoritie during the terme aforesaide, aswell to bee present
and to haue place in all manner of Custome-houses, Ports, Hauens, Creeks and

Waiters, and other Officers and Ministers hauing charge for or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the

executing of all and euery thing and things thereby appointed, and for their
better receiuing and enioying of the benefit of Our said Grant at all times and
places, where the said Officers and Ministers or any of them, should by reason
of their said seuerall Offices haue cause or occasion to be: And also in all
and euery place or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, aswell in Ships arriued with Tobacco, and riding in
any Port, Roade or Riuer, as on the Land, to make and appoint such and so many

euery time and times during the terme aforesaid, in lawfull and conuenient
maner, with a Constable or other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the place, aswell to goe on board,

into any House<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Celler, Uault, Warehouse, Shop, or other place within the
said Realmes and Dominion, and Port, or Towne of Barwicke, or any part of them,
or any of them to search and view if there be any Tobacco vttered, sold, or put
to sale, or offered to be sold, or put to sale before the same be viewed,
distinguished, and sealed contrary to the true meaning of the said Letters
patents.</p>
            <p>And We did also by the said Letters for Us, Our Heires and

Iustices of Peace, Bailiffes, Constables, Headboroughes, Customers,
