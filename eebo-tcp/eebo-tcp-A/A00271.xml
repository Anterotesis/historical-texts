         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

you herein, thus much may I ſay, that albeit a
man do vtterly refuſe to belieue them, I dare
warrant him, he ſhall neuer be damned, for that
incredulitie: but by the way I could wiſhe you to
note, that yf they did not thinke they had framed
the people to belieue what they liſt they would
neuer feede them with ſuch palpable vntruthes,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17138:10"/>
and yf therefore you ſhall thinke them, to haue
as litle honeſty, as they thinke you to haue witt,
you ſhall do them no iniury at all.</p>
                  <p>That your goods ſhould be robbed and taken

that now of late, more then here-tofore, her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties

order to take it from you, to ſaue it from vs: that
they haue ſent it oute of England to Zealand, and

not feare this miſery: but rather haue hoped, that
Spaniſh piſtolets, ſhould haue bin more comon

To the other ridiculous, and friuolous forgeries,
that we broughte halters to hange you, and whips

very ſory, that in all this ample prouiſion, we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat

                  <p>But to leaue all ſuch abſurd lies, to the wiſdomes

may thereby be made manifeſt. The truthe is, and
eaſely it dothe appere, that they were not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented,
to make them moſte odious, that ment

which moſte concerneth your owne comon wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:

of aſſociation, that none may once moue, or call

Queene, after her deathe: as thoughe it were
treaſon to ſay ſhe ſhould die, or an inſufferable

leaue, and relief: Yet they now ſeeing the Engliſh
to approche, in a manner muche different from
other pilgrimes, haue accordingly giuen them a
farr other kynde of entertaiment, inſomuch (that
as my freind writeth) thoſe that lately ſo arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
boaſted, of ſome detrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ours: which all
rhe world knoweth, came not throughe engliſhe
power or puiſance, but by the very wyndes, and
ſeas, which it pleaſed God to permitt to our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment:
Haue now receyued ſuch a check, for
that inſolencie, that they may ſee our ſelues are
made the inſtruments, by our owne armes, to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
them. Touching the manner and particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
I cannot at this preſent fully certify you. Thoſe
your ſelf may there, better vnderſtand, yf you haue
any ſecrett freind in courte, otherwiſe you ſhall
hardly come by the certainty, for I feare it wilbe
made treaſon to talke thereof, among the comon
ſorte of men.</p>
            <p>Yf you can come by the names of thoſe men of
marke: number of ſoldiers, ſhipps, and artillery,
that you haue loſt: I pray you vſe ſome meanes, to
ſend them ouer, becauſe I wold gladly ſee, how
our aduiſes ſhall differ. The author of the late
pamphlet, printed at <hi>London</hi> in Engliſh, &amp; frenche,
and entituled. <hi>The copie of a letter ſent from England to
don Bernardine de Mendoza, Ambaſſador in Fraunce for
the Kyng of Spaine,</hi> no doubte, yf he will take the
paines, can very well pen it to the print, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I knowe, he will cary a great care, aboute
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17138:20"/>
the putting downe of euery particuler.</p>
            <p>And wheras in the beginning of that letter, the
author ſeemeth to be very ſad and ſorowfull:<note place="margin">A counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</note> after
ſo late, and long expected comforte, to haue an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to ſignify the lamentable loſſe, and vtter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
of all hope. Now I can aſſure him, he may
make a peece of amends, in ſending ouer at this
tyme ſuch good newes, as can ſomwhat counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
the former ill: And yf it ſhall pleaſe him to
make an eſtimate, of the one &amp; the others loſſes, to
ſee who hathe ſuſtayned the greater: he muſt alſo
ſett downe ſome reaſons, to ſhewe which of bothe
is beſt able to beare it, &amp; the moſte lyke, ſooneſt to
recouer it: for by theaſe conſiderations, a man ſhall
ſureſt come to the certainety. Thus good Sir, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of this bearers preſent occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte,
who now attendeth the cloſing vp of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I am enforced heere to conclude. Once
more committing you to God, &amp; wiſhing
you moſt hartely well to fare.
