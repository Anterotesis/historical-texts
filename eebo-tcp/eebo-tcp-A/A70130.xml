            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

It may be that all have not that day in ſo high account as I have, and that if another had performed that duty, he would have over-ſlipt it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mention made thereof. Length of time makes memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable matters to be forgotten; and it is now above fourſcore and ſix yeares ſince that <hi>ſeventeenth of November.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>England</hi> firſt received ſuch a bleſsing as never ought to ſlip out of the heart of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man. That <hi>ſeventeenth of November</hi> was the day when unparallel'd <hi>Queene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52114:3"/>
firſt came to the Crowne. Thorough Gods bleſsing, I ſpent eight and twenty yeares of my dayes under her raigne; and I have oft bleſsed God that I was borne, and ſo long brought up in that bleſsed time. I have been called in my younger yeares to performe publike Scholaſticall duties on a <hi>ſeventeenth of November,</hi> and me thought, I never performed any more cheerfully. The very ſubject matter put life and ſpirit into me. Since I was called to the miniſteriall Function, I have many yeares on the <hi>ſeventeenth of November</hi> made the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance that I could of that dayes bleſsing. Being by you called to the moſt publike place of <hi>London,</hi> I could not, I durſt not paſſe over the mention of that bleſsing. I did the more willingly publiſh it to the view of all ſorts, that I may provoke others to be more mindfull of that day. And to your Honour in ſpeciall, I dedicate theſe my poore labours, becauſe you were the firſt mover thereunto. And now, my good <hi>Lord,</hi> having this occaſion in publike to ſpeake to you, give me leave, I beſeech you, to ſtirre up your honourable mind unto ſuch faithfull cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as, to the joy and benefit of many, you tooke, when you were Alderman of <hi>Farrington</hi> within. I have been now thirty ſeven yeares (to the praiſe of Gods good Providence and mercy I ſpeake it) a Miniſter of Gods Word in a <hi>Precinct</hi> within that <hi>Ward:</hi> in which time, there have been ſundry ſeverall <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen.</hi> But (to your praiſe, but not to the diſpraiſe of any of the reſt, I doe here publikely attest it) I never obſerved any more carefull of the good of their charge, more inquiſitive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame, more industrious in ſearching out diſorders to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe them, more pitifull over the poore, more ſollicitous about ſuch as were infected with the ſickneſſe, and that which ſets the crowne upon all, more pious in preventing all manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe on the <hi>Lords Dayes,</hi> and procuring people (ſo farre as in you lay) to obſerve the holy Ordinances thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52114:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Right honourable, the Lord hath now advanced you to a higher place, given you a larger juriſdiction, and put more power into your hand.

Before, the fiſh in the water were deſtroyed: here, the cattell in the field: to ſhew how farre they had provoked the Lord; even to deprive them of the uſe of all his creatures, both in the waters and alſo in the dry land.

               <hi>The Magicians could not avoid this plague: for the Boyle was upon the Magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.</hi> Exod. 9.10, 11.

As this was a terrible judgement in it ſelfe; ſo the more terrible to the Egyptians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Egypt which was neere to the hot middle Zone, there uſed not to be any haile, or raine at all. They were herein juſtly dealt withall, for their terrible threatnings to, and cruell dealings with the Iſraelites.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Locusts.</hi> Exod. 10.5, 14. This was a grievous plague,<note place="margin">8. Locuſts.</note> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the kind and multitude of the creatures which annoyed them. Locuſts were of that kind which they call <hi>Inſecta,</hi> divided betwixt the head and the belly. They were winged, and able to fly over ſeas from Country to Country. They devoured all kind of graſſe, herbs and fruits. They were ſo pernicious that in the Countries where they abode, all the meanes that could be inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted were uſed to deſtroy them. In their multitude they were as hurtfull as in their kind; for they uſed ſo to flock together, as like a thick dark cloud they overſhadowed the face of the skie, and obſcured the light of the Sunne.

that it was an extreme Miſt or Fog which utterly obſcured all the celeſtiall Lights, as Sunne, Moone and Starres: and put out all artificiall lights, as fires, torches, candles, and ſuch like. Idolatry and ſuperſtition had obſcured the light of Gods truth to their minds, and this darkneſſe obſcured other lights to their bodies. As the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had many wayes terrified the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and denied all comfort and ſuccour to them; ſo with this darkneſſe are they much affrighted and deprived of all comfort and ſuccour one from another.</p>

So great was this plague as it forced them to let the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with all that they had to depart out of their land. This judgement of all the reſt did moſt properly meet with them in their kind: for they ſought to deſtroy the ſtrength of Iſrael, even all their male-children, and here God takes away their ſtrength, the heires and ſupporters of their families; yea, he extendeth it to their beaſts and gods. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.12.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt drowned.</note>Theſe were the ten plagues. There was an other judgement as fearefull as any of theſe, if not more fearfull, the utter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his hoaſt in the red ſea. It is ſaid that <hi>he took ſix hundred choſen Chariots, and all the Chariots of Egypt, and Captains over every one of them</hi> (<hi>Exod.</hi> 14.7.) which implyeth a very huge hoſt. God ſaw it not enough to deſtroy their fiſhes in the water, but alſo in juſt revenge of their ſeeking to drown the Iſraelites children, drowned <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his hoſt.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee what wonders the Lord wrought in executing vengeance on his enemies.</p>

But I will inſtance it only in this faculty of memory, which we have now in hand. You have heard of what ſingular uſe it is being rightly uſed, for laying up, faſt holding, recalling and thinking on time after time, that which is once conceived as a truth, and yeelded unto as good. But through corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is made in good things like a riven diſh, or a <hi>Colender</hi> full of holes, which let out what is put into them as faſt as it is let in; but it is too too tenacious of evill.

Even ſo ſolid divine truths ſoone ſlip out of a mans memory, but the chaffe of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fables and groſſe errours remaine too faſt fixed therein; and the wholſome directions of Gods Word quickly paſſe away, when the bran of a mans owne fooliſh conceits ſtick faſt: yea, and the ſweet conſolations of the Goſpell are ſoone forgotten, when the dregs of filthy luſt, revenge, and other evils are too long remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.

Great workes at their firſt doing moſt affect mens hearts, and mollifie the ſame. Thus will they be like new Wax which is ſoft and ſit to receive a deep impreſſion. Now we know that the print of a Seale being at firſt deeply ſet in, laſteth the longer. To work ſuch deep impreſſions in mens hearts, holy men of God were wont to uſe patheticall inſinuations before remarkeable matters, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 32.1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>Give eare, O ye heavens, and I will ſpeake; And heare, O earth, the words of my mouth. My do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhall drop as the raine: my ſpeech ſhall diſtill as the dew, as the ſmall raine upon the tender herbe, and as the ſhowres upon the graſſe,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt himſelfe before his excellent Parables premiſed this Preface, <hi>Hearken, Behold,</hi> (Mark 4.3.) to worke upon both the learned ſenſes, and at the end thereof he addeth this Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. Much medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thereon.</note>2. Often meditate on that which once you conceive to be an uſefull truth. Frequent meditation addes much to a faſt retention of that which is judged to be uſefull.

This is the reaſon that Schoole-maſters ſo well retaine the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar rules and ſentences of Orators and Poets, becauſe they oft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate them upon their Schollars.

               <hi>The very day wherein God doth memorable matters is duly to be noted.</hi> This very point is with ſomewhat more emphaſis thus ſet downe. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.2. <hi>Sonne of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this ſame day.</hi> On this ground the Jewes obſerved ſundry faſts all the time of their Captivitie on ſet dayes, <hi>as the faſt of the fourth month, the faſt of the fift, the faſt of the ſeventh, and the faſt of the tenth, Zech.</hi> 8.19. For on the ninth day of the fourth month was Jeruſalem broken up, and the Chaldeans entered thereinto. <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.6, 7. On the tenth day of the fifth month, the Houſe of the Lord, the Kings houſe, and all the houſes of Jeruſalem were burnt with fire. <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.12, 13. On the ſeventh month <hi>Gedaliah</hi> (the Protectour of the remnant of the Jewes, after their King was carried away captive) was ſlaine. <hi>Jer.</hi> 41.1. On the tenth day of the tenth month <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> firſt laid ſiege to Jeruſalem. <hi>Ier.</hi> 52.4. This is that day which was commanded to be written downe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.2. Theſe are remarkeable dayes for judgement. Now if dayes of judgement were ſo preciſely to be remembred, how much more ought diſtinct dayes of bleſſing to be obſerved? The former were evidences of Gods diſpleaſure; and ſo meanes to keep down the ſoule, and occaſions of continuing to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled time after time. The latter were evidences of Gods ſpeciall favour, and ſo meanes of upholding our ſpirits, and occaſions of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52114:12"/>
continuing to quicken them up to thankfulneſſe from time to time. Therefore when God had removed away the cloud of his diſpleaſure from his people, after their ſeventy yeares captivity, and cauſed the bright and comfortable ſunne-beames of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhine upon them, he commanded that thoſe ſet dayes of Faſt ſhould be turned into dayes of cheerefull Feaſt, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.19.

Celebration of ſet dayes, wherein men of note and name were borne; or advanced to high place, have

been very ancient. I paſſe by that which the Scripture noteth of celebrating <hi>Pharaohs</hi> birth-day (<hi>Gen.</hi> 40.20.) and <hi>Herods</hi> birth-day (<hi>Matth.</hi> 14.6.) That which the Prophet (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.5.) upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> may be more pertinent to our purpoſe. It is this, <hi>In the day of our King, the Princes have made him ſick with bottles of wine:</hi> By mentioning the Kings day he aggravates their ſinne, as if he had thus ſaid, In that day wherein God beſtowed a King upon you, for which your hearts ſhould have been enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and your mouthes opened to bleſſe God, you gave your ſelves to all manner of exceſſive riot. Whether this were the Kings birth-day or Coronation-day it makes no great matter to the point in hand.

            <p>Is not the envy and malice of <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> farre greater? doe they not fret and fume, rage and rave at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Proteſtants? and is not Gods bleſſing on our Miniſtery an eye-ſore unto them, becauſe ſo many children, profeſſors of the true Proteſtant faith are begotten thereby?

            <p>Farre greater cruelty have <hi>Papiſts</hi> executed on <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> That inſtance of taking a babe that was new-borne, and caſting it into the fire, becauſe it was (as they ſaid) an Hereticks brat, is a ſtrong evidence of their more then ſavage inhumanity. They have ſpared neither young nor old, male nor female, great nor meane: but ſought to deſtroy all of all ages, ſexes, degrees and conditions whatſoever, not forbearing the moſt exquiſite tortures that ever were heard of.</p>
