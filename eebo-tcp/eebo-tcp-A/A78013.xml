            <title>An individuall letter to every man that calls himselfe a minister of Jesus Christ. Penned more particularly for Mr. Christopher Love, upon some observations from his sermon, preached Jan. 29. 1644. at Windsor, and re-preached at Uxbridge, Jan. 30. 1644. upon Jer. 33. 6. Whereby the author doth examine and enquire, whether Master Love were ever called by God, and Jesus Christ, or directed by the spirit of truth to preach the said sermon: or ever sent forth by Jesus Christ to be his minister. Being also for a caveat or memento to all others who call themselves Christs ministers, to examine whether ever they had a mission or commission from Jesus Christ so to doe, the having embroyled the land of our nativity in an unnaturall warre formerly one with another, contrary to any command, precept, or practises of Christ and his apostles, or word of truth: by whose evill practises they have caused the gospel of truth and peace to be evill spoken of, and have opened a torrent of blood, which none but the heavenly physitian can stop and cure; to whom the author intreateth the people to looke, and pray, and waite for help, for vain is the help of man. Written by an English man, Christs servant, for Englands remembrance.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AN INDIVIDUALL LETTER To every man that calls himſelfe a Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Penned more particularly for Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Love,</hi> upon ſome Obſervations from his Sermon, preached <hi>Jan.</hi> 29. 1644. at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and re-preached at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge,</hi> Jan. 30. 1644. upon Jer. 33.6. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Author doth examine and enquire, whether Maſter <hi>Love</hi> were ever called by God, and Jeſus Chriſt, or directed by the Spirit of Truth to preach the ſaid Sermon: Or ever ſent forth by Jeſus Chriſt to be his Miniſter. Being alſo for a <hi>Caveat</hi> or <hi>Memento</hi> to all others who call themſelves Chriſts Miniſters, to examine whether ever they had a Miſſion or Commiſſion from Jeſus Chriſt ſo to doe, they having embroyled the Land of our Nativity in an unnaturall Warre formerly one with another, contrary to any command, precept, or practiſes of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or word of Truth: By whoſe evill practiſes they have cauſed the Goſpel of Truth and Peace to be evill ſpoken of, and have opened a torrent of Blood, which none but the Heavenly Phyſician can ſtop and cure; To whom the Author intreateth the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to looke, and pray, and waite for help, <hi>for vain is the help of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Behold the Lords hand is not ſhortned, that it cannot ſave: neither is his care heavy, that he cannot heare, <bibl>Iſa. 59.1, 2, 3.</bibl>
            </q>
            <q>But your iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God, and your ſins have hidd his face from you, that he will not heare, <bibl>verſ. 2.</bibl>
            </q>
            <q>For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity: your lips have ſpoken lies, and your tongue hath murmured iniquity, <bibl>verſ. 3.</bibl>
            </q>
            <q>My people are deſtroyed for lack of knowledg: Becauſe thou haſt refuſed Knowledge, I will alſo refuſe thee, that thou ſhalt be no Prieſt to me: and ſeeing thou haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the law of thy God, I will alſo forget thy children, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 
               <bibl>4.6.9.</bibl>
            </q>
            <q>And there ſhall be like people, like Prieſt, for I will viſit their wais upon them, and reward their deeds, <bibl>verſ. 9.</bibl>
            </q>
            <q>God is our hope and ſtrength, and help in troubles, ready to be found: He maketh warrs to ceaſe unto the end of the world, <bibl>Pſal. 46.1.9.</bibl>
            </q>
            <q>He appeaſeth the noiſe of the Seas, and the tumults of the People, <bibl>

            </q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rends, however I have ſet upon this work, know that I do not do it out of envy to any of your perſons, honors preferments, or profits, or eſteemes which you have &amp; enjoy by any of your Miniſteriall employments by the ſtate or people that accrew unto you thereby. Neither do I deſpiſe or triumph in my Honoured <hi>Chriſt: Love's</hi> miſery, lying under a heavy anſwer, but deſire to be a mourner with any of you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in really and ſincerely: Neither would I have any to whoſe hand this ſhall come, to mis-conſter me in my deſires herein; but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreat God who is the giver of all wiſdome, and reproacheth no man <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. to reveale it to him who hath commaned me to write it, &amp; is my witneſs how greatly I long for all your ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as my brethren Engliſh men, and for the glory of his great Name who is able to reſtore <hi>England,</hi> and every Engliſh man, and to guide our feet into his feare, to write his law in our inner parts, to unite us in love, to give us abundantly the truth as it is in Jeſus; to ſettle us in peace and purity; to keep us in peace, and to preſerve us to his own glorious preſence, where we ſhall ſee even as wee are ſeene which if we pleaſe him here always as his Son did, or ſo endeavour, or delight to doe; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.29. <hi>For he that ſent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone, becauſe I do always thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi> And what thoſe things were, the word ſets forth: which, when God ſhall ſend you forth as his Miniſters, he will enable you and the Elders alſo (if there ſhall be need of you) as formerly his Apoſtles, &amp; hold a Fatherly union with you, if you do always thoſe things that pleaſe him: wherefore, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I Cor.</hi> 6.20. Let us learn, that no man preſume above that which is written, that one ſwell not againſt another for any mans cauſe: <hi>for the Kingdome of God is not in word but in power.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165897:3"/>
For this is the Teſtament that God will make with us, if we be Iſraels houſe: After thoſe days faith the Lord, I wil put my lawes in their minds, and in their heart I will write them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people. And they ſhall not teach every man his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and every man his Brother, ſaying, know the Lord. For all ſhall know me, from the leaſt of them to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of them, for I will be mercifull to their unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and I will remember their ſins and their inniquities no more,</hi> Heb. 8.10, 11, 12. This is new Teſtament; this is Goſpll although it may not pleaſe men, this is not another Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, Gal. 1.6, 7. Twice though the Authors name be not to it: and this is not mans Doctrine, but Gods which I have received from God, and his word. <hi>Peace be with the Brethren, and love, with faith from God the Father, and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Grace be with all them which love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to their immortality. Amen.</hi> Epheſ. 6.23, 24.</p>

            <p>I Write to you Maſter <hi>Love,</hi> and to every one that calleth himſelf Chiſts Miniſter, not out of Arrogancy, or vain Glory, but out of Conſcience, and tender affection, to your ſelf and others, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you all in Chriſts name, to be reconciled to him, and to read my lines, and to let me have your anſwer really as the truth is in Jeſus. For I hope you have the ſpirit, and are one of Chiſts. It may be you beleeved better of the laſt Parliament of Lords, and Commons, the Lands Phiſitians, as you call them, who are ſince caſt out and thrown down, then they deſerved, experience ſheweth it. Let us truſt in the living God, theſe aretituler Gods. I have ſaid you are Gods, but you shall die like men. Mr <hi>Love</hi> I reade in your booke called <hi>Englands</hi> Diſtemper, Page 38. Truth may be adulterated as well as peace, in that booke you have delivered wholeſome truthes, but again you have ſet forth ſome Errours which queſtions your Miſſions as Chriſts Miniſters, and favours much of man pleaſing, and of Worldly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is earthly, ſenſuall and deviliſh. For though, I honour Presbitery, it muſt keep to the word, cloſer in practiſe having the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, as well the Prophets, then <hi>Engliſh</hi> Presbitry hath done. It muſt be more Heavenly wiſe, more ſelf deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and leſſe Carnall, leſſe politique, though as wiſe as Serpents, yet innocent as Doves. I would neither have them or any other ſay the Lord faith it, when it is only their own ſayings and inventions, for (thereby is the Gospel evill ſpoken off) and there is not ſeverall Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells, and though a man pervert the Goſpell, yea were it an Angell, I dare not hold him bleſſed in that as preaching mans Doctrine to pleaſe men; I cannot in that hold him Chriſts Servant, as faithfull <hi>Paul</hi> hath handled, and God by Chriſt and the ſpirit, the Comforter, and his Word hath taught me, for which I deſire ever to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>I read, <hi>David</hi> by the ſpirit of the Lord ſpake, his word being in his tongue. The God of <hi>Israell</hi> ſpake to me, the ſtrength of <hi>Iſraell</hi> ſaid, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And theſe are called the laſt words, of <hi>David.</hi> As <hi>Davids</hi> are called his laſt words having ſeen divers Temptations, and evills for the righteouſneſſe of them, ſo would I have yours for the truth. Again, though <hi>Paul</hi> through Gods grace given him, laid a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, 1. <hi>cor.</hi> 3.10. But faith he, let every man take heed how he buildeth upon it, for there is no other foundation then Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165897:4"/>
and if any man build on this foundation, Gold, Silver, pretious Stones, timber, hay, or ſtubble. Every mans work ſhall be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt for the day ſhall declare it, and the fire ſhall try every mans work of what ſort it is, and every man ſhall receive his wages according to his labour, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 3.8.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. In the twenty eighth and twenty ninth page of your <hi>Uxbridge</hi> Sermon, you ſay, did they who made their footing to be <hi>Jure Devino,</hi> which we have rather found to be <hi>Jure Diabolico</hi> (the Biſhops is there meant by you) thinke thus to be caſt down before the People upon the Dunghill, and made vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible; Did they ever thinke to lie under ſo much diſgrace (and others to be countenanced by the Nobles and Commons of the Land) when themſelves are an abhorring to all fleſh, and their names a reproach to all people, and are not theſe Dagons, Nobles, &amp; Commons become ſo likewiſe, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> though you ſought then to pleaſe them. I fear <hi>Col. Von,</hi> once my Captain ſubtilty corrupted your young yaars. I intreat you and your Brethren to theſe enſuing, to anſwer without reſervation or guile which concerne the Goſpel of Gods glory ſo much, though it croſſe mans affection, or ſelf-intereſts, yet as (God is truth) let every man ſpeak truth unto his Neighbour, though the Miniſtry ſay they have Ordination &amp; ſucceſſion. Yet their lives, qualifications, or corruptions, or ſelf-intereſts, gives the Goſpel a Check or lie, they following the whoriſh world; for they ought nor to be men-pleaſers, ſtrikers, or fighters, or given to filthy Lucre, or Novices: neither crafty and deceitfull dealers in their lives, and rhetoricall ſpeakings contrary to found and wholeſome Doctrine; yea, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> faith, I think that God hath ſet forth us the laſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as men appointed to Death; for we are made a Gaſing ſtock unto the World, and to the Angells, and to men: <hi>we hunger, are naked, we have no certain dwelling place, are buffeted, reviled, evill ſpoken of, and yet we bleſſe, and pray, and ſuffer perſecution, and labour working with our own hands,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.9.11.12.13. The marginall notes, faith, He that will take right view, how like <hi>Paul</hi> and the Pope ſuch are, who lyingly boaſteth he is his Succeſſor, let him compare the Delicates of the Popiſh Court, and St <hi>Pauls</hi> ſtate, as we ſee it here (and how far was Chriſts ſtate ſhort of this I pray you) who ſaith, the Servant is not greater then his maſter: and ſince the Pope is granted to be that Whore, and the Biſhops their Succeſſors with him to be none of the Apoſtles ſucceſſors: And neither of them are <hi>Jure Devino,</hi> but rather <hi>Jure Diobolico,</hi> and as you obſerve, abhorred of all fleſh, and a reproach to all people: And as amongſt other things, for corrupt Ceremonies in ſervice and Doctrine for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching up Tyranny and that People muſt obey the Kings luſt in all, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their necks to the block, and not defend themſelves by force of Armes in any cafe, your <hi>Uxbridg</hi> Sermon, Page 16, 17. Now ſince both theſe have loſt ordination, and ſucceſſion, by your own confeſſions, who upon earth I pray declare can give it. For loe they that withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from thee ſhall periſh, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith. <hi>Thou deſtroyeſt all that go a whoring from thee,</hi> Pſal. 73.27. This (all grant) and your ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, who then hath I pray you, power to ſend out or ordain Miniſters for Chriſt. Is it from Heaven or from men, as Chriſt asketh the Phariſes

            <p>Q. Do you think in your Heart, that you be truly called, according to the will of our Lord Jeſus Cſtriſt and the order of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter anſw. <hi>I think it; now did not he anſwer I think it, he could not be made a Miniſter.</hi>

            <p>You ſay in the Appeale with your Sermon, by way of Apology, Page 8. ſome ſay I intruded my ſelf on the work, when divers can teſtify how earneſtly Captain <hi>Hampton,</hi> the Governour of the Towne did ſolicite me, with many others. Again page, 9. 1. Objection, what ever your call was to preach, yet the matter was unſeaſonable, 2. Objection. Why did you not write this vindication ſooner, theſe things by you are verbally anſwered, but your anſwer therein (is your ſhame, and others like you) for though you preacht the ſaid Sermon in <hi>Winſor</hi> Caſtle the day before; all this proves not your miſſion from Chriſt, or your Brethrens, or your works to be ſpirituall, but carnall, or literall, or both: It is not others report hath corrupted your name, but the flies of your own practiſes, and Doctrine, and (almoſt all of you preacht another Goſpel.) You ſay in Page 14. of your Booke, Priſons are many times or oft times th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> greateſt inlets to many divine ſpeculations, or the Servants of God in a ſuffering condition, have ordinarily the moſt cleer diſcoveries of the will of God, a worthy Doctrine conſonant with the Scripture: but then as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, He <hi>that ſuffereth as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed, but let none of you ſuffer as a Murtherer, or a Theife, or an evill doer, or as a buſie body in other mens matters,</hi> 1 Pet. 4, 14.15.16. But if ye be rayled on for the name of Chriſt, bleſſed are ye, for the ſpirit of glory and of God reſteth upon you, which on their part is evill ſpoken of; but on your part is glorified. Note, whereas you ſay in your Sermon-Book, page 20. The Lord demands of the men of this generation, <hi>will yee have the Goſpell in power,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>A reformation in purity? your Aſſemblies refined? your Polutions removed? and the Government of my Son eſtabliſht in the midſt of you.</hi> Will you own my cauſe? fight my Battails? avenge the wrongs &amp; affronts which have beene offered to my great name? wil you jeopard your lives for my ſake? will you cleave to my Parliament in truth and full purpoſe of heart? Certainly this is no Goſpel Doctrine to provoke to blood, and that blood ſhould touch blood, which is reproved by <hi>Hoſea</hi> from the Lord, chap. 4 1, 2, 3. And for which our Land mourns, as is there declared Neither was it ever any of Chriſts Doctrine, or any of the Apoſtles, as will plainly appear by Gods booke, the Goſpell of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt which faith alſo <hi>John</hi> 18, 36. Jeſus anſwered <hi>Pilate,</hi> as oft times he had anſwered the learned Scribes and Phariſees, who fained themſelves juſt men Luke 20.20. In other caſes: <hi>My Kingdome is not of this world: If my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were of this world then would my Servants fight. that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews: But now is my Kingdome not from hence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I feare you, as many alſo of your Brethren, have impudently belied the Lord, as <hi>Hananiah</hi> did, Jer. 18.10, 11. and other falſe Prophets, when he contradicteth <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the true Prophet, which in the 15. and 16. verse,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:165897:5"/>
               <hi>Jeremiah</hi> reproves again, ſaying, <hi>Then ſaid the Prophet</hi> Jeremiah <hi>unto the Prophet</hi> Hananiah: <hi>Heare now</hi> Hananiah, <hi>the Lord hath not ſent thee, but thou makeſt this people te truſt in a lie;</hi> therefore thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Behold, I will caſt thee from off the earth: this yeare thou ſhalt die, because thou haſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken rebelliouſly againſt the Lord</hi> And in the 26. page of your Rhetoricall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which ſeems to be peſtilent witty, as many of your Brethrens, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. <hi>I eſteemed not to know any thing but Chriſt crucified. Neither flood my preaching in the enticing ſpeech of mans wiſdome, that your faith ſhould not be in the wiſdome of men, but in the power of God: And wee ſpeake wiſdome among them that are perfect; Not the wiſdome of this world, neither, of the Princes, of this world, which come to nought,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2.4, 5, 6. Here is not a world of State-phyſitians and avengement, as in your 26. <hi>page,</hi> but giving God all power and glory, to avenge to whom it belongs. But <hi>lleſs, rejoyce, love without diffimulation. Be of like affection one towards another: Be not high-minded: Recompence no man evill for evill. If it be poſſible, as much as in you is, have peace with all men,</hi> Rom. 12.9.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Yet ſay you, much innocent blood hath been ſpilt, which muſt be avenged on us, or by us. Is this not another Goſpell then <hi>Paul</hi> taught? who ſaith, <hi>Dearly beloved, avenge not your ſelves, but give place unto wrath: For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, vengeance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord.</hi> I deſire you, if you have time in this life, other wiſe any that call themselves Miniſters in any place of <hi>England,</hi> to anſwer theſe things faithfully herein mentioned, that God may receive glory thereby, the people edification, and your ſouls the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which is the humble and hearty deſire of</p>
