            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Oh! you dear and tender Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who love not your Lives unto Death this day, that you may finish a good Testimony for the Glory of my <hi>Name,</hi> saith the Lord God; lift up your heads in the Light of my Covenant, and believe in my <hi>Name,</hi> for I am near unto you, saith the mighty God of Safety; and let not any weight or burden lie upon you; for I will be more than Husband to Wife, and more than Wife to Husband, or Parents to Children, or Children to Parents; yea, I will be a Husband to the Widdow, and a Father to the Children who are deprived of their tender Parents

            <p>Therefore you dear Children, who drink the deepest in Sufferings, think it not hard, for it is my purpose unto you all that have not any Eye to Self, but alone seek my Glory in all you do; I will make you more and more Honourable in the Glory of my Life, and double my Blessings upon you and yours; for I have beheld your Integrity, and my Bowels are mightily moved with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion towards you; therefore am I risen for your sakes this day, to declare unto you, my suffering People, That not an Hair of your Head shall perish, neither shall you be detained in Prisons and desolate Holes any longer than I have determined shall be for your eternal <hi>Good,</hi> and the <hi>Glory</hi> of my Name forever; Therefore in my Life stand faithful, in resistance of every evil Thought, or whatever would cause you to murmer, or desire any thing but what you know will advance the Glory of my Name, and the Exaltation of my Truth, over all that riseth up against it in your being truly subject to the measure of my Light and Life, that will not let any seek a Pre-eminence or esteem amongst men; neither let Self-striving nor Self-serving have power in any; but in true Humility, Love and Meekness watch one over another; and let the strong take the weak by the hand, that you may all gently in Love, Meekness and holy Fear dread my Name, and serve one another, that your Love may be manifest unto me, saith the Lord your God, and one unto another

I will go before you through all the Waters and Floods of Afflictions; and I will appear with you before all the Councils of the Sons of men; and my saving Power shall compass you about in your hot and sharp Afflictions, all you who have your Confidence alone in me, the LORD your GOD.
