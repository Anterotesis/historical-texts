            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Blessed be God who gave such a shelter to our <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aarons,</hi> at the <hi>Tabernacle of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> when the factious multitude were destroyed.

                  <p>The first term that clothes their sin is that of <hi>spoiling;</hi> which is all one with <hi>plundering:</hi> a word (God help us) of which we know the meaning too well. A thing that our <hi>English laws</hi> never dream'd of: for who could imagine that the sword of <hi>oppression</hi> and the sword of <hi>authority</hi> should ever be fitted to one scabbard?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42990:8"/>
that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> that <hi>beareth not the sword in vain,</hi> hath either vainly <hi>worn</hi> the <hi>sword,</hi> which he durst not <hi>draw;</hi> or <hi>drawn</hi> it to be a terror to <hi>good works</hi> and not to evil? whilst <hi>loyalty</hi> onely made up a <hi>traitor;</hi> and the sincere practise of the <hi>establish'd religion,</hi> hath been onely branded for <hi>superstition,</hi> and <hi>prophaneness:</hi> Which watch-word once given, there's work enough for the <hi>spoiler</hi> then. The report of an <hi>Idol</hi> in <hi>Micah</hi>'s house, (though raised on purpose by a poor hireling <hi>Levite,)</hi> is cause enough for the <hi>Danites</hi> to fall upon him, and to <hi>rifle</hi> his house and to <hi>plunder</hi> him of his whole estate. This makes our Prophet. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. 2. call it a <hi>grievous vision, when the treacherous dealer dealeth treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and the spoiler spoileth:</hi> And how <hi>grievous</hi> this is, may best be discovered from the three companions of it, <hi>Violence, Injury,</hi> and <hi>Rapine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First <hi>Violence</hi> seems to be a Sister twin, 'tis so often coupled with <hi>spoil</hi> in the holy Scripture: as <hi>God</hi> cries out to the <hi>Tyrannical usurpers</hi> over <hi>Israel,</hi> Ezech, 45. 9. <hi>remove violence and spoil, and take away your exactions from my people.</hi> For <hi>violence</hi> indeed is nothing else, but <hi>armed force</hi> that dares to act whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it lists to fancy; and so properly belongs to those <hi>men in buff</hi> which are <hi>rib'd with iron.</hi> For we can too well remember, when the name of a <hi>Souldier</hi> was grown so terrible, that the news of a <hi>redcoat</hi> at the door, was enough to fright a man
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42990:8"/>
out of his <hi>house</hi> and <hi>estate</hi> too. The <hi>Satyrist</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily admires how one eye durst weep for the loss of another if a <hi>Souldier</hi> beat it out. A <hi>Souldier</hi> I say, who must onely be call'd to account before his <hi>Bardiacus judex,</hi> before a <hi>Court Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi> for all his insolencies. Hereupon our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> gives this counsel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 14. to the <hi>Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> that ask'd of him what their duty was, <hi>Do no violence says he, and accuse no man falsely, but be content with your wages.</hi> An unusual piece of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> this, for <hi>Souldiers</hi> to go to <hi>Christ</hi> for a <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Command,</hi> and as great boldness in him to bid them <hi>do no violence.</hi> Who dares call <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous treason</hi> by any other name but vertue? who dares call <hi>Marshal violence</hi> by any thing but <hi>valour</hi> and <hi>courage?</hi> But these were <hi>Souldiers</hi> in <hi>Christ's</hi> School; they must <hi>do no violence. AnnonÃ¢ suÃ¢ contenti sint, non de lachrymis provincialium vivant,</hi> says <hi>Vopiscus:</hi> Let them not <hi>oppress</hi> their <hi>quarters,</hi> and drink up the <hi>tears</hi> of the <hi>fatherless</hi> and the <hi>widow</hi> whom they <hi>plunder:</hi> should a poor woman of <hi>Zarephath</hi> meet such an one, as she did <hi>Elijah 1 King.</hi> and 17. it is not a <hi>morsel of bread</hi> would serve his turn; no, let her <hi>bake him</hi> a cake of her <hi>handfull</hi> of <hi>meal</hi> and <hi>cruse</hi> of <hi>oyl,</hi> though <hi>she</hi> and <hi>her son</hi> have nothing to eat, but die. And this makes <hi>Ieremy</hi> threaten the people with <hi>Spoilers that come from the North, Ier.</hi> 51. 43. we all have felt those <hi>North-winds</hi> which have swept away all before them. But as

after a <hi>storm,</hi> many times a <hi>gentler blast</hi> from the same <hi>climate, breaks</hi> the <hi>clouds</hi> and <hi>fans</hi> the <hi>air.</hi> God hath now brought <hi>good out of the North:</hi> he hath shewen a <hi>serene skie,</hi> and <hi>Charle's-wain</hi> most radiant there; the <hi>drums</hi> beat a <hi>Loyal march,</hi> and the noise of the <hi>trumpets,</hi> do no longer drown the <hi>law,</hi> but <hi>sound</hi> a <hi>triumph</hi> (as upon mount <hi>Sinai)</hi> this day at the promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. So that <hi>violence</hi> alone is not <hi>spoiling:</hi> there may be a good <hi>violence: heaven</hi> must be taken by <hi>violence;</hi> but <hi>violence</hi> mixt with <hi>injury;</hi> and that's the Second.</p>
                  <p>And thus the <hi>vulgar</hi> reads it, <hi>vae tibi qui prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daris,</hi> wo to thee who makest a <hi>prey</hi> of others: a proper <hi>Metaphor,</hi> fetch'd from those <hi>Beasts</hi> of <hi>prey,</hi> which leave nothing <hi>unworried</hi> which they can master: Not a <hi>fearfull Hare,</hi> nor an <hi>innocent Lamb,</hi> which can escape their <hi>ravenous</hi> appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou art here presented with the</hi> Essays <hi>of some broken hours: the happiest means in those unhappy times (when they were meditated) to</hi> break <hi>our</hi> griefs, <hi>and</hi> refresh <hi>us in our</hi> languishments. <hi>For they were composed</hi> by the waters of Babylon, <hi>where we</hi> sate down <hi>and</hi> wept, <hi>to</hi> remember Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons captivity: Our harps were hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the willows in the midst thereof: <hi>For when the</hi> Sanctuary <hi>was shut up against the establish'd</hi> service of God, <hi>it is not to be imagined that we could sing one of the Lords songs there. That were say (our enemies) to</hi> prophane Gods worship, <hi>with the</hi> Imagery of musick,
<pb facs="tcp:42990:64"/>
                     <hi>and to introduce</hi> Heathenish usages <hi>into our</hi> Christian Temples. <hi>I have always thought holy</hi> David <hi>as great a hater of</hi> Superstitious vanities <hi>as themselves: and yet I have learned, that it was his daily practise to</hi> worship God <hi>this way: And if any think that the burden of the</hi> Jewish rites <hi>was so heavy, that they had need of</hi> musick, <hi>to cheat the wearisomeness of their</hi> service, <hi>(as we use to hang</hi> bells <hi>in the ears of our loaden horses:) let them know, that the</hi> simplicity <hi>of our</hi> Evangelical worship <hi>admits of</hi> singing <hi>too, if two</hi> Apostles <hi>be not mistaken; And if any should pretend to the</hi> Spirit of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>to say that this was meant of</hi> Hopkins <hi>and</hi> Sternholds Psalms, <hi>I would not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit him.</hi>

                     <hi>I have often admired at the</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>soul of our learned</hi> Hooker, <hi>who many years since fore-told, that if</hi> Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanism <hi>should prevail, it would bring in</hi> Anabaptism <hi>with it. We have seen his

words made good, with the advantage of some score of</hi> sects <hi>besides, which like young</hi> adders <hi>(fearing some danger) are crept back into the mouth of the</hi> old one <hi>and hid themselves. And may they there finde an everlasting tomb, and never come out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to</hi> bite venemously <hi>or so much as to hiss at those which are farther off from</hi> Images, <hi>then they are from worshipping of</hi> Imaginations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These</hi> odes <hi>were prepared for</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-musick, <hi>which was admirably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by that rare</hi> son of Art, <hi>and</hi> Master <hi>in his</hi> faculty M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
