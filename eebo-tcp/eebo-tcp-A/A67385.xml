            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
DOCTRINE
OF THE
Blessed Trinity
Briefly Explained,
In a Letter to a Friend.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Doctrine of the <hi>Arrians, Socinians,</hi>
or <hi>Anti-Trinitarians,</hi> (call them as you
please, provided you call them not
<hi>Orthodox Christians</hi>) in opposition to those who
believe (according to the Word of God), That
the Sacred <hi>Trinity,</hi> of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi>
are so <hi>distinguished</hi> each from other,
as that the <hi>Father</hi> is not the <hi>Son,</hi> or <hi>Holy-Ghost;</hi>
the <hi>Son</hi> not the <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Holy-Ghost;</hi> the
<hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> not the <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Son;</hi> yet so <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56799:2"/>
as that they are all <hi>One God;</hi> (which, in
the <hi>Athanasian Creed,</hi> is called <hi>Trinity in Unity,
and Unity in Trinity;</hi> or, in common speaking,
<hi>Three Persons and One God;</hi>) is what you were
lately discoursing with me, and of which
I shall give you some of my present
Thoughts.</p>
            <p>The Scripture tells us plainly, <hi>There are
Three that bear record in Heaven; the Father, the
Word, and the Holy-Ghost: and these Three are
One,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 7. And the Form of <hi>Baptism</hi>
(Matt. 28. 19.) is, <hi>In the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy-Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Christian Church, from the time of
Christ and his Apostles downwards hitherto,
as well before as since the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>
have ever held the <hi>Divinity</hi> of those <hi>Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
(as they are commonly called;) and that
these <hi>Three</hi> are but <hi>One God.</hi> And, that they
have so held, hath been, by divers, sufficiently
proved from the most ancient christian Writers,
which are now extant. Which, therefore, I
take for granted, as sufficiently proved by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
without spending time, at present,
to prove it a-new.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56799:2"/>
That these are <hi>Three,</hi> distinguished each
from other, is manifest: And, that this Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
amongst themselves, is wont to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Personality.</hi> By which word, we mean,
that Distinction (what ever it be) whereby
they are distinguished each from other, and
thence called <hi>Three Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the word <hi>Person</hi> do not please, we need
not be fond of Words, so the Thing be agreed:
Yet is it a good Word, and warranted by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. where the <hi>Son</hi> is called, <hi>the
express image of his</hi> Father's <hi>Person:</hi> (For so we
render the Word <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> which is there u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
and mean by it, what I think to be there
meant) And we have no reason to wave the
Word, since we know no better to put in the
Place of it.</p>
            <p>If it be asked, what these <hi>Personalities</hi> or
<hi>Characteristicks</hi> are, whereby each <hi>Person</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from other; I think we have little
more thereof in Scripture, than that the <hi>Father</hi>
is said to <hi>Beget;</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> to be <hi>Begotten;</hi> and
the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> to <hi>Proceed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be further asked, what is the full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of these Words (which are but Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical),
and what is the adequate Meaning
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56799:3"/>
of them) I think we need not trouble our
selves about it: For, since it is a matter purely
of Revelation (not of natural Knowledge,)
and we know no more of it than what is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Scripture, where the Scripture is silent,
we may be content to be ignorant. And we
who know so little of the Essence of any thing,
especially of Spiritual Beings, though finite,
need not think it strange that we are not able
to comprehend all the Particularities of what
concerns that of God, and the <hi>Blessed Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know that the Fathers, and School-men,
and some after them, have imployed their
Wits to find out some faint Resemblances, from
natural things, whereby to express their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Conceptions of the <hi>Sacred Trinity:</hi> But
they do not pretend to give an adequate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it; but only some conjectural <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses,</hi>
rather of what May be, than of what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Is. Nor need we be concerned, to be
curiously inquisitive into it, beyond what God
hath been pleased to reveal concerning it.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Three Persons</hi> are distinguished, is
evident; (though we do not perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what those Distinctions are:) That to
each of these, the Scripture ascribes Divinity,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56799:3"/>
is abundantly shewed by those who have
written on this Subject: That there is but <hi>One
God,</hi> is agreed on all hands: That the <hi>Father</hi>
is said to <hi>Beget;</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> to be <hi>Begotten;</hi> and
the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> to <hi>Proceed;</hi> is agreed also;
though we do not perfectly understand the
full Import of these Words.</p>
            <p>And here we might quietly acquiesce
(without troubling our selves further,) did not
the clamorous <hi>Socinians</hi> importunely suggest
the <hi>Impossibility</hi> and <hi>Inconsistence</hi> of these things,
insomuch as to tell us, That, how clear so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Expressions of Scripture <hi>be,</hi> or <hi>can be,</hi>
to this purpose, they will not believe it, as
being inconsistent with natural Reason. And
therefore, though they do not yet think fit to
give us a bare-fac'd Rejection of Scripture;
yet they do (and must, they tell us,) put
such a forced Sence on the words of it (be they
never so plain) as to make them signify some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
else.</p>
            <p>There is, therefore, in this Doctrine of the
<hi>Trinity,</hi> as in that of the <hi>Resurrection from the
Dead,</hi> a double Inquiry: First, whether it be
<hi>Possible;</hi> and then, whether it be <hi>True.</hi> And
these to be argued (in both Cases) from a very
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56799:4"/>
different Topick: The one from Natural
Reason; the other from Revelation. Yet
so, that this latter doth certainly conclude the
former, if rightly understood. And though
we should not be able to solve all Difficulties;
yet must we believe the thing, if revealed;
unless we will deny the Authority of such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>
            <p>Thus our Saviour, against the <hi>Sadducees,</hi>
who denied the Resurrection, <hi>Matth. 22. 29.
Ye erre</hi> (saith he) <hi>not knowing the Scriptures, nor
the Power of God.</hi> The <hi>Power of God,</hi> if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood, was enough (from the Light
of Reason) to prove it <hi>not impossible:</hi> But,
whether or no it <hi>will be so</hi> (which natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
could not determine,) was to be argued
from Scripture-Revelation.</p>
            <p>In like manner, St. <hi>Paul</hi> before <hi>Agrippa, Act.</hi>
26. first argues the <hi>Possibility</hi> of it; <hi>Why
should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that
God should raise the Dead?</hi> ver. 8. For if <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi>
did believe the Creation of the World, (as
many even of the Heathen did, from the light
of Nature) he could not think it <hi>Impossible</hi>
for that God (who had at first made all things
of nothing) to recollect, out of its Dust or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56799:4"/>
Ashes, a Body which once had been. But
whether or no he <hi>would</hi> do so, depended upon
another Question, to be after asked, <hi>ver. 27.
King Agrippa, believest thou the Prophets?</hi> For this
was purely matter of Revelation, and could
not otherwise be known: For, as to the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the Sou<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and a future state hereafter,
many of the Heathens went very far, by
the Light of Nature; but as to the <hi>Resurrection
of the Body,</hi> I do not find they had any Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
about it (or but very faint, if any:)
And if they had, it may well be supposed to
be the remainder of some ancient Tradition
from the Jews, or their Predecessors. Nor do
I see any foundation in Nature, which should
make them think of it (before it was revealed)
any more, than of the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
by Christ, (which we should never have
thought of, had not God himself contrived and
declared it to us.) But, when that of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
was once suggested, there was no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Reason to think it a thing <hi>Impossible,</hi>
and therefore no reason to doubt the <hi>Truth</hi> of
it, when Declared, if we believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
wherein it is revealed; especially those
of the New Testament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56799:5"/>
It is much the same as to the Doctrine of
the <hi>Trinity.</hi> It is a thing we should not have
thought of, if it had not been suggested by
Divine Writers; but, when suggested, there
is nothing in natural Reason (that we know of,
or can know of) why it should be thought
<hi>Impossible;</hi> but whether or no it <hi>be so,</hi> depends
only upon Revelation.</p>
            <p>And in this case the Revelation seems so
clear (to those who believe the Scriptures)
that we have not reason to doubt of it, unless
the thing be found to be really <hi>Impossible,</hi> and
inconsistent with Reason. Nor do the <hi>Anti-Trinitarians</hi>
insist on any other ground why
they deny it, save only, That it seems to them
absolutely <hi>Impossible;</hi> and therefore think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
bound to put another Sence on all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture (how clear soever they be, or
can be) which prove or favour it.</p>
            <p>So that the Controversie is now reduced to
this single Point, Whether it be <hi>Possible</hi> or <hi>not
Possible:</hi> Whether it be consistent or inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with Natural Light or Reason. (And to
that point therefore I shall confine my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.)
For it seems agreed on all hands (as
to those who believe the Scriptures) that, if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56799:5"/>
it be not <hi>Impossible,</hi> it is sufficiently revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>Now for us who understand so little of
God's infinite Essence, and which it is impossible
for us fully to comprehend, who are our selves
but finite, and mostly conversant with mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Objects; in so much that we cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to understand the Essence of our own
Souls; and, when we attempt to explain it,
must do it rather by saying what it is not, than
what it is; (so hard a matter is it for us to fix
in our Mind or Fancy, a Notion, Idea, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of a spiritual Being, which falls not
under our Senses:) 'Tis hard, I say, for us
(who understand so little of a Spirit) to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
(of what God is pleased to reveal) that
it is <hi>Impossible,</hi> or inconsistent with his Essence,
which Essence we cannot understand.</p>
            <p>But what is it that is thus pretended to be
<hi>Impossible?</hi> 'Tis but this, That <hi>there be Three
Somewhats, which are but One God:</hi> (and these
<hi>Somewhats</hi> we commonly call <hi>Persons.</hi>) Now
what Inconsistence is there in all this? That
<hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> are <hi>Three,</hi> is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest;
and are in Scripture-Language distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.
That there is but <hi>One God</hi> is manifest
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56799:6"/>
also, and all those <hi>Three</hi> are this <hi>God:</hi> That
the name <hi>Person</hi> is no incongruous Word, is
evident from <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. where it is used. If
it be said, It doth not agree to them exactly in
the same Sence in which it is commonly used
amongst men; we say so too, nor doth any
Word, when applyed to God, signifie just the
same as when applyed to men, but only some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
analogous thereunto.</p>
            <p>What kind or degree of Distinction (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our Metaphysicks) this is, we need
not be very sollicitous to enquire; or, whether
in our Metaphysicks (accommodated to our
Notions of Finite Beings) there be any Name
for it: 'Tis enough for us if these <hi>Three</hi> may
truly be so distinguished, as that one be not the
other, and yet all but <hi>One God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that there is no <hi>Inconsistence</hi> or <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>
that, what in one regard are <hi>Three,</hi> may
in another regard be <hi>One,</hi> is very manifest from
many Instances that may be given even in Finite
Beings, such as we converse with; which, though
they do not adequately agree with this of the
<hi>Sacred Trinity,</hi> (nor is it to be expected that they
should; Finite, with what is Infinite;) yet there
is enough in them to shew, there is no such <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence</hi>
as is pretended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56799:6"/>
I shall spare to instance in many Resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which have been given long since by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Schoolmen, or by later Writers.
Which though they are not pretended to be
adequately the same with that of the <hi>Sacred
Trinity,</hi> (as neither will any thing else be that
we can take from finite Beings;) yet are they
sufficient to shew that there is no <hi>Inconsistence</hi> in
it. (Which is all that is here incumbent on us
to prove.) I shall only name a few.</p>
            <p>I will begin with what concerns the most
gross of Finite Beings, that is, Material Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>Suppose we then a Cubical Body, (which
what it is, every one knows, that knows a Dy.)
In this are <hi>Three Dimensions,</hi> (Length, Breadth,
and Heighth) and yet but <hi>One
Cube.</hi> Its Length (suppose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<figure/>
East and West) <hi>A. B.</hi>
Its Breadth (suppose between
North and South) <hi>C. D.</hi> Its
Heighth (between Bottom and
Top) <hi>E. F.</hi> Here are <hi>Three</hi> Local Dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
truly Distinguished each from other,
(not only imaginarily:) The distance between
East and West (whether we think or think not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56799:7"/>
of it) is not that between North and South;
nor be either of these that between Top and
Bottom. The Length is not the Breadth, or
Heighth; the Breadth is not the Length, or
Heighth; and the Heighth is not the Length,
or Breadth: But they are <hi>Three</hi> Divisions, truly
distinct each from other: Yet are all these but
<hi>One</hi> Cube: And if any one of the <hi>Three</hi> were
wanting it were not a Cube. There is no
Inconsistence therefore, that what in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
are <hi>Three</hi> (three Dimensions) may, in
another regard, be so united as to be but <hi>One,</hi>
(one Cube.) And if it may be so in Corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
much more in Spirituals.</p>
            <p>Suppose we further, Each of these Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
infinitely continued; the Length infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
Eastward and Westward, the Breadth
infinitely Northward and Southward, the
Heighth infinitely Upward and Downward:
Here are <hi>Three</hi> infinite Dimensions, and but
<hi>One</hi> infinite Cube; and these <hi>Three</hi> Dimensions
(though distinct) are equal each to other (else
it were not a Cube;) and though we should
allow, that a Cube cannot be infinite (because
a Body, and therefore a finite Creature:) Yet
a Spirit may; such as is the Infinite God. And
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56799:7"/>
therefore no Inconsistence; that there be <hi>Three</hi>
Personalities (each infinite, and all equal),
and yet but <hi>One</hi> Infinite God, essentially the
same with those <hi>Three Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I add further, That such Infinite Cube,
can therefore be but <hi>One,</hi> and those <hi>Three</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions
can be but Three, (not more nor few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:)
For, if Infinite as to its Length (Eastward
and Westward), and as to its Breadth (North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and Southward), and as to its Heighth
(Upward and Downward); it will take up all i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary
space possible, and leave no room ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for more Cubes or more Dimensions: And
if this infinite Cube were (and shall be) Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
so, its Dimensions also must be Infinite
and Co-eternal.</p>
            <p>I say further, If in this (supposed) Cube,
(we suppose in Order, not in Time) its first
Dimension, that of Length, as <hi>A. B.,</hi> and
to this Length be given an equal Breadth
(which is the true generation of a Square) as
<hi>C. D.,</hi> which compleats the square Basis of this
Cube; and to this Basis (of Length and
Breadth) be given (as by a further Procession
from Both) an equal Heighth <hi>E. F.,</hi> which
compleats the Cube; and all this eternally,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56799:8"/>
(for such is the Cube supposed to be,) here is
a fair Resemblance (if we may <hi>parvis componere
magna</hi>) of the <hi>Father,</hi> (as the Fountain or Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal;)
of the <hi>Son,</hi> (as generated of him from
all Eternity;) and of the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> (as eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
Proceeding from Both:) And all this
without any Inconsistence. This <hi>longum, latum,
profundum,</hi> (Long, Broad, and Tall,) is but
<hi>One</hi> Cube; of <hi>Three Dimensions,</hi> and yet but <hi>One
Body:</hi> And this <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghost;
Three Persons,</hi> and yet but <hi>One God.</hi> And as,
there, the Dimensions are not (in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract)
predicated or affirmed each of other,
or the Cube of either, (the Length is not the
Breadth or Heighth, nor either of these a Cube;)
but (in the Concrete) Cube is affirmed of
all; this <hi>longum, latum, profundum,</hi> is a <hi>Cube,</hi> and
the <hi>same Cube:</hi> So here, (in the Abstract) the
Personality of the <hi>Father</hi> is not that of the <hi>Son,</hi>
nor either of these that of the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> nor
the <hi>Deity</hi> or <hi>Godhead</hi> any of these; but (in the
Concrete) though the Personalities are not,
yet the Persons are, each of them <hi>God</hi> and the
<hi>same God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be objected, that those Concretes are
Affirmed or Predicated each of other; (that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56799:8"/>
               <hi>longum</hi> is also <hi>latum</hi> and <hi>profundum,</hi> (this <hi>Long</hi> is
<hi>Broad</hi> and <hi>Tall;</hi>) but not so here, the <hi>Father</hi>
is not the <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Holy-Ghost:</hi> I answer, That,
if the words be rightly considered, the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
holds here also: For when we say, this
<hi>Long</hi> is <hi>Broad</hi> and <hi>Tall</hi> (where <hi>Cube</hi> or <hi>Body</hi> is
understood) the full meaning is plainly thus;
This Body, which, as to one Dimension (that
of <hi>Length</hi>), is said to be a <hi>long</hi> Body, is the
same Body, which, as to another Dimension
(that of Breadth), is said to be a <hi>broad</hi> Body,
and which, as to a third Dimension (that of
Heighth), is said to be a <hi>tall</hi> Body. So here,
That God, which (as to one Personality) is
<hi>God the Father,</hi> is the same God, which (as to
another Personality) is <hi>God the Son,</hi> and which
(as to a third Personality) is <hi>God the Holy-Ghost.</hi>
So the Analogy holds every way, nor is there
any Inconsistence in either Case.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the Consideration of somewhat
more Spiritual, and less Material than that of
a Body locally extended.</p>
            <p>Suppose we then a Created Angel, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Soul: at least if those who deny the
<hi>Blessed Trinity</hi> will allow that there are such Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
but if they be <hi>Sadducees,</hi> who do not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56799:9"/>
acknowledge either Angel or Spirit, or that
the Holy Scriptures are the word of God,
which testifie both, (which I doubt is the case
of some of them) let them speak out, that so
we may know whom we have to deal with;
and not pretend to nibble only at the <hi>Athanasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Creed,</hi> or some Expressions therein, while
the quarrel is indeed at somewhat higher,
(though, <hi>ad amoliendam invidiam,</hi> they think fit
to dissemble it,) and that they do but faintly
believe (if at all) that the Holy Scriptures)
are the Word of God, or the Doctrines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contained to be such. And we have reason
to suspect it, when they spare not to let us
know, that, were this Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi>
therein delivered in Words as express as could
be, they would not believe it.</p>
            <p>But suppose we, (what they would seem
to grant, and what I am so charitable as to
think divers of them do believe) That there
are Spiritual <hi>Beings,</hi> such as Angels and the
Souls of Men; and that these Spiritual <hi>Beings</hi>
are endued with <hi>Knowledge</hi> (or <hi>Wisdom</hi>) and
<hi>Force</hi> (or an executive Power) to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that <hi>Knowledge.</hi> That there is some
such thing, at least in Man, (whether Body
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56799:9"/>
or Soul) they cannot but acknowledge; for
themselves <hi>be,</hi> and <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>do.</hi> And though
we cannot fully comprehend, much less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
in Words, how all this is so; (for we
are here at a loss, as well as in higher things:)
Yet, <hi>that it is,</hi> they cannot deny, though they
do not know <hi>How.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, to <hi>Be,</hi> and to <hi>Know,</hi> and to <hi>Do,</hi> are
certainly distinct each from other, (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
we are not all agreed, of what kind, or
in what degree this Distinction is:) <hi>To be</hi> is not
the same as <hi>to know,</hi> for that may be were this
is not; and <hi>to do</hi> is (for the same reason) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
different from both those, for a Man may
<hi>Be</hi> and may <hi>Know</hi> what he doth not <hi>Do;</hi> yet
'tis one and the same Soul (at least one and
the same Man) which <hi>Is,</hi> and <hi>Knows,</hi> and <hi>Does.</hi>
There is therefore no Impossibility or Inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
in it, That what in one regard are <hi>Three,</hi>
may in another regard be <hi>One.</hi> Thus in the
<hi>Sacred Trinity,</hi> if we conceive of the <hi>Father</hi> as
the Original or First <hi>Person,</hi> who <hi>begets</hi> the <hi>Son;</hi>
the <hi>Son</hi> as the Wisdom of the <hi>Father, begotten</hi> of
Him; and the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> as the Spirit of the
<hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> as <hi>proceeding</hi> from Both, and
yet the same God with both; (or what other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56799:10"/>
there may be of these <hi>Three Persons,</hi>
who are but <hi>One God,</hi> that we do not know;)
there is no Inconsistence in it, that these <hi>Three</hi>
may be <hi>One; Three</hi> in one regard, and <hi>One</hi> in
another.</p>
            <p>I might shew the same as to the <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Will,</hi> and <hi>Meaning,</hi> which are all the same
<hi>Soul:</hi> And the known Metaphysical Terms of
<hi>Unum, Verum, Bonum,</hi> which are all but the
same <hi>Ens.</hi> And many other Instances of like
Nature.</p>
            <p>But we hold (it will be said) a greater Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
(than that of <hi>Unum, Verum, Bonum</hi>)
between the <hi>Three Persons</hi> in the <hi>Sacred Trinity.</hi>
Be it so. (But what that greater Distinction
is, we do not pretend to comprehend.) How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it is from all these Instances evident, that
there is no Impossibility, or Inconsistence with
Reason, that what in one regard are <hi>Three,</hi>
may in another Regard be <hi>One.</hi> Which is
what we undertook to shew.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that not any, nor all of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
nor any of those given by other Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Mendo adequately express the Distinction
and Unity of the <hi>Persons</hi> in the <hi>Sacred Trinity,</hi>
(for neither hath God distinctly declared it to us,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56799:10"/>
nor are we able fully to comprehend it, nor is
it necessary for us to know.) But because we
do not know<note n="a" place="margin">Eccles. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note> 
               <hi>How the bones grow in

Or, because<note n="b" place="margin">Job 11. 7.</note> 
               <hi>We cannot by searching

shall we say, Not so, only becaue we cannot
tell <hi>How?</hi> It is safer to say It is, when God says
It is, though we know not (in particular)
How it is. Especially when there be so many
Instances in Nature, to shew it not to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
or Inconsistent with Reason. The

to the Revelation, but the Impossibility of
