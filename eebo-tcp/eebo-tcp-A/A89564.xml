         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In a few words, The condition of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time which this Text ſpeaketh of) was this. They had indured a long peregrination in the wilderneſſe, for forty yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, God had viſited former rebellions upon them, and now their wandrings were well-nigh accompliſhed, they were come almoſt to the skirt of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> God had begun to deliver the promiſed inheritance unto them, by overthrowing, and rooting out <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:118056:4"/>
and <hi>Og</hi> the King of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> and had given their Country into the hand of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and had told them hee would goe on, and root out all the reſt of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> before them, that there ſhould not a man be able to ſtand <note place="margin">Deut. 3. 21. 22.</note> in their way, <hi>As the Lord your God hath done unto theſe two Kings, ſo ſhall hee do unto the other Kingdoms, whither they paſſed, they need not feare them, the Lord their God would fight for them:</hi> and would very ſhortly place them in that land which hee had long before promiſed to their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; And now when they were juſt upon entring into the Land, they had like to have made ſhip wrack in the very Harbour, and had brought down ſuch a new Plague upon them, that if there had not been a timely remedy put in, they had periſhed every Mothers childe of them, without any forain enemy ſtriking a ſtroake at them. And thus it was when <hi>Balaam</hi> could not obtaine leave from God to <note place="margin">Numb 31. 16.</note> curſe the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> hee taught <hi>Balak</hi> the King of <hi>Moab</hi> a trick, how hee might make God himſelfe curſe them, <hi>viz. If hee could by any wayes draw them to rebell againſt God.</hi> Hee had told him plainly, that while they kept cloſe to God, all the world would bee too weak for them, but could hee but deviſe any way to make them fall out with God, God would take a courſe with them himſelfe, hee would deſtroy them to <hi>Balak</hi> his hand. <hi>Balak</hi> according to this counſell, goeth and maketh all the Courtſhip that hee could to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſendeth them all kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, ſendeth them the handſomeſt women, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever might allure them unto wantonneſſe, and thereby draweth them firſt to commit fornication, and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and then (as one ſin draweth on another) they got them to feaſt in their Idoll Temples, and ſo to eate the <note place="margin">Numb. 25. 2.</note> ſacrifices that were offered to <hi>Baal Peor, And the Iſraelites did eate, and bowed down unto their Gods;</hi> and God knowes how many thouſands of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> on a ſuddain were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118056:4"/>
taken in the ſtrength of this luſt: which ſo extreamly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God, that without any more adoe, he ſendeth the Plague among them, ſuch a plague which in the ſpace of foure and twenty houres, deſtroyed twenty foure thouſand men, many of the prime of their ſtrength, and it was grown ſo hot, that a few twenty foure houres more, were like to have made an end of all this great company: Now they ſeeing the anger of God ſo hot, fall down on their knees, and lament their ſinnes and caſt about to ſee which way they might procure their peace.</p>
            <p>While they were about it, there commeth one <hi>Zimri,</hi> one of the chiefe Princes of one of their Tribes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of all the people, leadeth a Lady who was Daughter to one of the chiefe Noblemen of <hi>Moab,</hi> leads her into his Tent, and there goeth and committeth the ſame villany with her that had thus provoked God to ſend this plague among them, <hi>Phinehas</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the High Prieſt, ſeeing this high and audacious boldneſſe of this wretched Nobleman, was ſo filled by the Spirit of God with holy indignation, <hi>That hee taketh his Javelin, followeth them into their Tent,</hi> taketh them, probably, in the very act of their filthineſſe, <hi>ſtriketh the man through the body, and the woman through the belly,</hi> and nayled them both to the ground, and out he went againe: And God took this part of <hi>Phinchas</hi> ſo kindly, to ſee him ſo inflamed with the zeale of juſtice, that he preſently commanded the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell to put up his Sword, and not to kill a man more, <hi>Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi</hi> were the two laſt that dyed, at that time not one more periſhed. And that all the world might know, what had ſtopped the Plague ſo ſuddainly, he telleth <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in the words that I have read.</p>
            <p>Phineas <hi>the Son of</hi> Eleazar <hi>the Prieſt hath pacified my wrath, while hee was zealous for my ſake among them.</hi>

            <p>The cure of this diſeaſe you have in the words I have read, and upon which I ſhall ſpend the houre (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;) onely obſerve a few things from their diſeaſe, both their ſin, which was <hi>bodily uncleanneſſe,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> Fornication, and Idolatry; And their puniſhment the anger of God, hot kindled againſt them, and poured out in a devouring Peſtilence, and ſuch a one as was like ſuddenly to devour them all.</p>
            <p>This fearefull ſin and Plague betyding them immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after ſuch great deliverances, mercies, victories, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſuch is the power of corruption, remaining <note place="margin">Obſerv. 1.</note> even in Gods own people, that no mercies are able to keep them from preſent running into moſt foule rebellions, if but left unto themſelves: as appeares by innumerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Gods people in Covenant with him, <hi>David, Hezekiah,</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe ſuddain and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fals, even after greateſt mercies, aſſure us, that no tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or gun-powder is more prone to take fire, no unbridled horſe more prone to run, no Eagle more ready to fly unto the prey, then we are to run into the fouleſt evils, even preſently after the greateſt, moſt precious favours recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if God but take off the bridle of his reſtraining grace. Which may teach us, 1. as to be tender to others in their <note place="margin">Application.</note>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118056:5"/>
fals, 2. ſo to conſider our ſelves, and to walke with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie and godly feare, and thirdly, to intreate the Lord daily, not to lead us into temptation, not to permit us to bee ſolicited by Satans temptations, or outward objects, or our owne concupiſcence; or if it bee his good pleaſure to permit us to bee tryed, that by his owne grace hee would preſerve us, that hee would not ſuffer us to bee foiled or overcome, who elſe ſhall infallibly yeeld to any temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether on the right hand or the left.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the nearer God takes a people to himſelf &amp; the <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> greater mercies he beſtowes upon them, the more ſevere and fierce are his judgements againſt them; hee had but newly delivered up <hi>Sihon</hi> King of <hi>Heſhbon</hi> and <hi>Og</hi> the King of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> and given their land for an inheritance unto them, and compelled <hi>Balaam</hi> to preach that no ſorcerie or inchantment, no force or fraud could prevaile againſt them, and they rebelling againſt him, hee preſently turnes upon them in extremity of wrath and fury.</p>
            <p>And this is according to his word, that if they who are <note place="margin">I evit 26. 4. to 41.</note> owned by him as his people walke contrary to him, hee will walke contrary to them, and plague them ſeven times and ſeven times, and yet ſeven times, and ſeven times, with ſickneſſes, famine, peſtilence, ſword, captivitie, yea more ſeverely then to the heathen. Heare yet this word that the <note place="margin">Amos 3. 1, 2.</note> Lord hath ſpoken againſt you O children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> againſt the whole family which I brought up from the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> you onely have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>And this is alſo according to his practiſe; after hee had brought them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> hee bare with their murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings untill hee had taken them into a Covenant with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <note place="margin">Amos 3. 12. Ezek. 16. Dan. 9. 12.</note> at <hi>Horeb,</hi> and after that every new ſinne had a new plague: No murmurings puniſhed like <hi>Iſraels</hi> murmurings,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118056:6"/>
Idolatries plagued like <hi>Iudahs</hi> Idolatries, the like wrath and fury not powred out any where in the world, as was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out upon <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this manner of his dealing is moſt agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and equitie, becauſe theſe kind of ſinnes are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt more knowledge, and ſo deſerve the more and ſmarter ſtripes: There is alſo more ingratitude and unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them; when <hi>Jeſurun</hi> is growne fat with mercies, with the kidnies of wheat and the pure blood of the grape, then to kicke with the heel, to bee unmindfull of his rock, this exceedingly provokes the Lord to anger: Yea, God is more diſhonoured by their ſins then by any others, as a husband by the filthy converſation of his Wife, or a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Children. <hi>Behold, thou art called a Jew, inſtructed in the Law, makeſt thy boaſt of God, &amp;c. Doſt thou commit</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This ſerves firſt to acquit God in theſe his ſevere judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">

Sun hath ſhined upon us, the more like a filthy dunghill, have we putrifyed and ſtunke in his noſtrils. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humbly acquit him, and ſay with <hi>Daniel, The Lord our God is righteous in all his judgements, for we obeyed not his</hi>

               <hi>voyce:</hi> And with <hi>Ezra, What ſhall we ſay after this, O our God? for we have for ſaken thy Commandements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Yea let us tremble and be deeply abaſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him for our great rebellions, leſt he proceed and <note place="margin">3.</note> make us drink the very dregges of his cup of indignations. He was pleaſed publickly in calling his people out from ſpirituall <hi>Babylon,</hi> to take <hi>Germany,</hi> the firſt of all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and now in his day of viſitation he hath firſt begun with them, and theſe ſix and twenty yeares he hath moſt heavily afflicted them, and ſtill his hand is ſtretched out againſt them: long time hath he ſpared us, and ſeemed to ſay of us as once he did of <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem, I have cut off other Nations, and deſtroyed their Cities, I ſaid ſurely,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 17, 18.</note> England <hi>will receive inſtruction, that their dwelling ſhould not bee cut off, but they roſe early and corrupted all their doings:</hi> And now the cup is come over unto us, we are laſt taken in hand; Oh let us timely meet him, leſt he proceed to make our plagues proportionable to his former mercies, and our wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And for time to come let us beware that with <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>Jeſurun</hi> we kick not at him, when he hath fatted us: the uſuall courſe of the world is this, the more mercies God gives them, the more liberty they take to ſin againſt him; the more learned, the more honored, the more rich men are, the more bold they make with Gods Law, to break it and caſt it out; and the more ſpirituall helps we have, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therances many injoy, the more ſecure, proud, and wanton they are before him, but know for certain, he keeps a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of all his Mercies, and thy account muſt be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, he remembers how long thou haſt lived upon him,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118056:7"/>
how neare he hath taken thee unto himſelfe, how oft he hath ſpared thee, how accommodated thee with wealth, yokefellow, children, credit, friends, but above all, how long thou haſt ſate under his heavenly droppings, what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Miniſters, &amp;c. Hee furniſheth thee with all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let thy care be to bethink thy ſelf how thou mayeſt lift up thy head, when he will come to reckon for all thy Talents, and when at any time the fleſh begins to take liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he inlargeth thee, check it thus, and ſay, Many a mercy hath the Lord given me, for which of them do I thus abuſe him? <hi>Shall I thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and unwiſe? is not hee thy Father, that brought thee; &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that this betided them juſt when God was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 6. Obſer. 3.</note> them poſſeſſion of the promiſed Land, when hee was marching in the greatneſſe of his ſtrength to deſtroy all their enemies, that not a man might bee able to reſiſt them, yet then hee himſelfe with his owne hands for their ſinnes turneth upon them, ready to deſtroy them all: Learne this leſſon from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That when the Lord is beſtowing the greateſt mercy, working the greateſt deliverance, deſtroying the potenteſt enemies, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe, ſo that all the world ſhall not bee able to hinder a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from receiving the greateſt and moſt deſirable mercy, yet their owne wickedneſſe breaking out, may deprive them of all, and utterly undoe them when they are neareſt the injoying of their happineſſe:</hi> Now the 40. yeares were ended, and <hi>Og</hi> and <hi>Sihon</hi> both kild, and God ingaged by Covenant that no enemie ſhould ſtand before them, had renewed his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant againe with them, put them into a way that there needeth no more but meerely to enter in the Land; a new rebellion breaketh out on their part, which bringeth in a Plague that kild more of them then they had loſt in all the warres that ever they had had. This is juſt like that which the Lord ſpake by the Prophet <hi>Jeremie: That at what time <note place="margin">Ier. 18. 10.</note>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:118056:7"/>
hee ſpeaketh concerning a nation, to build it and to plant it, if</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ier. 18. 10.</note> 
               <hi>that nation doe evill in his ſight, hee will repent him of all the good that hee promiſed, and hee will roote them up and breake them downe:</hi> not that God changeth his mind, but that theſe wickedneſſes did change the ſtate and condition of this people, and put them out of a capacitie of receiving what God elſe would bee willing to conferre upon them. Beloved I dare not ſtay you on this, neither durſt I paſſe it over without mentioning, and I mention it to this end, that wee may not bee too forward to promiſe our ſelves too <note place="margin">Application.</note> much of our preſent proſperous condition which we ſeeme to bee in. I confeſſe the Lord hath not onely by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hand upheld us in the midſt of all our tryalls theſe two or three laſt yeares, but hath of late ſince wee have owned him in a Covenant and ſworne for reformation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Councells of ſuch as ſeeke our ruine have more apparently owned Idolatry by joyning with the bloody Rebels of <hi>Ireland</hi> that are ſetting up popery, and rooting out our Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and indeavouring the like againſt us, ſince that day I ſay the Lord hath moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably gone on and owned us, and beene with our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and hardly (unleſſe it were once) given us any check, but all hath gone on very proſperouſly and through the goodneſſe of God, to mans eye wee are in a better poſture now then ever wee were ſince the beginning of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like troubles.</p>
            <p>But for all that doe not promiſe your ſelves too much out of the preſent condition of things, they may bee all well to mans eye, but I tell you brethren, there are ſuch things found in every corner of the Land; that impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie for our old villanies, both of Idolatry and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and blood, the blood of Prophets, and the blood of juſt men, and the unprofitableneſſe under great meanes, that unthankfulneſſe for late mercies, that breaking out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

new rebellion, ſuch terrible diviſions in Church matters, in State-matters, in Parliament, in Citie, every where, as if we were divided <hi>in minutula fruſtula,</hi> into the leaſt bits that we could be cut into, ſo many new crying ſinnes found in every corner of the Land, that if a man could with a ſpirituall eye looke upon them, hee would with <hi>Ezra</hi> ſit him downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed, and with renting his heart as well as his haire cry, Lord, though thou haſt wrought all ſorts of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances for us, wee deale ſo with thee, that wee feare thy wrath will breake out ſo hot that there will bee no recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for Gods ſake, bee not too confident, that you may the better with feare and reverence attend to the helpes that I ſhall give you afterward. Hee that would have ſaid three yeares agoe to England, that before two yeares at an end, they ſhall ſee England in the miſerableſt condition that ever had beene in theſe 100. yeares, hardly a man could have imagined whence the plague ſhould come, our land in peace, flouriſhing with wealth, a Parliament called, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors broken, all our neighbouring kingdomes either our friends, or elſe themſelves plunged in warre and blood; whence ſhould the enemy come that ſhould bee able to miſchiefe us? yet you ſee that from above God hath ſent a fire downe, and kindled it in our owne bowells, which hath eaten and devoured into every corner of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and beloved God hath new Magazines, new trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries of judgements ſtill, that if hee pleaſe to take us in hand, and deale ſeverely with us, when wee are taking poſſeſſion of all the mercie that our ſoules could deſire, our owne wickedneſſe may find us out and ruine us: you ſee had it not beene prevented, it had beene the condition of this people at this time.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I onely name, it is the remedy of this evill which I deſire to ſpend an houre in, and there are three things in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:118056:8"/>
Firſt, who the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> was that cured them, and that you <note place="margin">2. Part of the Text.</note> have in theſe words, <hi>Phinehas the ſonne of Eleazar, the ſonne of Aaron the Prieſt,</hi> hee was the man that did it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what the cure was that he wrought for them, that you have in theſe words: <hi>Phinehas</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Prieſt <hi>hath pacified my wrath;</hi> that was the cure hee wrought, <hi>hee did pacifie Gods wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the meanes whereby hee did it, and that you have in theſe words: <hi>While hee was zealous among them for my ſake ſake: Phinehas the ſonne of Eleazar hath pacified my wrath while hee was zealous for my ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will begin with the firſt of them, and that I will onely name, becauſe there are but two leſſons that chiefly I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who it was? It was <hi>Phinehas</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Prieſt, this man did it, God telleth all the world, hee was the onely man that did it, here were a million of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or more who ſeemed to bee condemned to deſtruction, and ſome 24. thouſand of them executed in one day, and the reſt going on as faſt as might bee, <hi>one man</hi> doth <hi>one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent act,</hi> that ſaveth all the reſt of them from ruine: the leſſon that I commend to your thoughts from it is <note place="margin">Whence, firſt obſerve. <hi>Doct.</hi>
               </note> this.</p>
            <p>That as it is poſſible for one man to deſtroy a great deale <note place="margin">One man may ſave a whole kingdome. Eccleſ. 9. 18. Ioſhua 7.</note> of good; As <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.</hi> One <hi>Jonah</hi> may helpe to ſinke a whole Ship, one <hi>Achan</hi> indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a whole Army; So <hi>one man may ſave a whole Kingdome,</hi> one man, one <hi>Phinehas</hi> is the onely viſible meanes which God owneth to pacifie his wrath, ſo as to ſave a whole kingdome frome ruine, a million of people had died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and you have a great many of examples of the like in the Scripture what one man hath beene able to doe in that kind: how often did <hi>Moſes</hi> ſave them all, that when the Lord had even ſeemed to ſweare that hee would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118056:9"/>
them, <hi>Moſes</hi> hath come and tried it out hand to hand, body to body with God, and turned him backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that hee could not deſtroy them, as you have it in the 106. <hi>Pſalme, v.</hi> 23. ſo hee ſaid, <hi>hee would deſtroy them had not Moſes his choſen ſtood in the gap, and turned away his wrath,</hi> driven it back againe. And <hi>one innocent man may deliver a whole Iland;</hi> a whole Iland as big as England may <note place="margin">Iob 22. 30.</note> bee delivered by one man: and the Lord himſelfe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the fifth of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> when hee came downe with a purpoſe to deſtroy them, <hi>Runne</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>through the</hi>

               <hi>Land and find mee one man,</hi> there hee deſcribeth him, and I ſhall deſcribe him afterwards what kind of man hee ſhall bee, but finde me out ſuch a man, <hi>and I will ſpare all the Citie for him.</hi> And in the 22. of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> toward the latter end, when the Lord ſaid that hee wondred that the people were ſo ſet on ruine: <hi>I ſought for a man that might have ſtood in the breach:</hi> if hee could have found but <hi>one</hi> hedg-ſtake left, the Lords wrath would have kept out ſtill. This I onely name, and I name it to this end, that it might bee <note place="margin">Application.</note> an incouragement to every one who hath a good heart to the cauſe of God and to the ſafetie of England, that hee would prepare himſelfe to receive the inſtructions that ſhall bee given him, and reſolve, (the grace of God aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting him) that hee will follow it: for I am confident, if the Lord helpe mee to open what I have prepared for you, when the Sermon is done you will bee ready to ſay, could all England bee ſuch as you ſpeake of, or could you find a great number of ſuch men, then indeed wee ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bee ſaved, and God would not deſtroy us; In the meane time doe thou learne for one, for thou canſt not tell what one man or woman may doe, one <hi>Paul</hi> ſaved all the ſhip, and though thou ſhouldeſt bee alone, as <hi>Elias</hi> thought hee was alone, or as one time <hi>Moſes</hi> was alone, thou canſt not tell how farre the Lord may looke upon many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118056:9"/>
of thouſands for thy ſake; the Lord himſelfe hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you an evidence of it here, and told all the world it was <hi>one</hi> man reſcued them; much more when thou art not alone, but many thouſands joyne with thee, there may bee hope: if ten men might have reſcued <hi>Sodome</hi> and the reſt of thoſe abominable Cities of the plaine, why ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou not hope that the land may bee ſpared for your ſakes? however if the worſt come, <hi>thou ſhalt deliver thy owne ſoule.</hi> But this I dare not handle, I onely named it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what was the cure that he wrought? <hi>Phinehas</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Eleazar hath pacified my wrath,</hi> hath pacified my wrath; Indeed the Plague ceaſed, there was not a man died of the Peſtilence after <hi>Phinehas</hi> had done that excellent act, but God taketh no notice of that, but the thing hee plainly layd downe was this, that <hi>Phinehas</hi> had pacified his wrath, hee had quenched and cooled his revenged ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice which was kindled againſt them. That was the cure; And from this the leſſon that I obſerve is this, <hi>v<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And I deſire you that you would firſt ſee how plaine it is in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then I hope it will bee a profitable leſſon for this great Aſſembly; That the pacifying of Gods wrath is the removall of every plague.

            <p>I ſay there is nothing that is worthy the name of a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118056:10"/>
plague, or that is a plague which can come from any other fountaine or ſtorehouſe, but onely from Gods wrath: from God it muſt come, that is without all queſtion: Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doth not riſe out of the duſt, nor originally from any creature, all the devils in hell are not able to inflict one plague without God, not kill a poore hog, &amp;c. This no man who is not an Atheiſt doubteth of; now if they come from God they muſt either come from his favour or from his wrath, there are but theſe two Well-heads, they are indeed acts of his power and providence, but are done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counſels of his will, either his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or his diſpleaſure; If they come from Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, there is wrath; if not from that, they all come from his love: Now this I propound to your ſerious thoughts; that whatſoever betideth any man in the world, thoſe ſelf-ſame things that are unſufferable, intolerable hard things, when they come not in Gods diſpleaſure, they are all good things, things to bee reſted in, to bee ſatisfied in, if they come but from the good will of God.</p>
            <p>As for example, take m<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a man to be hanged upon a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, hee is a curſed man, Curſed is every one that hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on a Tree.</p>
            <p>Yet take that man that ſhall die the death of the croſſe, and let it bee out of Gods love and good will, the croſſe is the greateſt bleſſing to him. The Lord never loved his owne Sonne better then when he hanged upon the Croſſe. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I will hang on the Croſſe</hi> for my people. And though it were a curſe in the eye of the world, it was the greateſt mercie that ever God ſhewed to the Church, to take his Son and hang him on the Croſſe.</p>
            <p>Take a Lions Den, let but <hi>Daniel</hi> bee put into a Lyons <note place="margin">Dan. 6.</note> Den, let there nor wrath goe with it, the Lyons Dens is a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:118056:11"/>
Take <hi>Paul</hi> in all his whippings, his povertie, his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his ſhipwracks, his buffetings, and all that ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tided him, let there be no wrath in it, ſet him in the ſtocks, doe what you will, let there be no wrath, and there is no plague in any of them.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions, let the fire come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and burne up his cattell, let the wind come from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and ſtrike the houſe at the foure corners, and knock out the braines of ten children all at a time, let there be no wrath in it, and there is no plague in it.</p>
            <p>There is no plague where there is no wrath. I could give you a hundred evidences of this; beleeve it, the ſelfe ſame thing which to others are plagues, though they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, yet (as one calleth them wittily and truely) they are ſilken afflictions; plundering, povertie, plague ſores, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of outward eſtates, they are all ſilken afflictions, as they come from love, and there is no hurt in them. There is an imagination of ſome men (but the world ſhall never ſee the truth of it) of a certaine ſtone they call the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſtone, which will, as theſe men fancy, turne Iron into Gold: Gods love doth it; That will turne Iron in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gold, all croſſes into bleſſings, Iron chaines into gold chaines, it will turne death, plagues, povertie, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, baniſhments, it will turne any of theſe, all of them into invalluable mercies; let them but onely come from Gods love, and well enough; let but God ſay to the man whoſe houſe hee burneth, I burne thy houſe but I love thee, let him ſay to him whoſe child hee kocketh in the head, I take thy child away in my love, there is no plague then. In a word, the thing I would have you beleeve from this firſt branch of my proofe is this.</p>
            <p>That as things that are <hi>ſeeming mercies,</hi> are in truth <hi>reall plagues</hi> when they come from wrath: So things that are <hi>ſeeming plagues,</hi> are <hi>reall mercies</hi> when they doe not come
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118056:11"/>
from wrath. I ſay, ſeeming mercies are plagues, if they come from wrath. Let God ſpread a table in the Wilderneſſe to a people, and feed them with Quailes, and Manna from heaven, let it bee in wrath, let the Iſraelites come and <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 23. 27. 31.</note> beg a King, and let him give them the propereſt man in all the land, and give him in wrath; hee doth undoe them in giving them a King.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, let it ſeeme never ſuch a croſſe, if there bee no wrath in it, there is no plague in it; therefore whatſoever plague any lie under, doe but pacifie Gods wrath, and you end the plague. And that is the firſt ground that I gave you of it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is that all <hi>plagues,</hi> the things themſelves that are plagues, all of them come and goe at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement <note place="margin">2.</note> and word of God onely. That as they can come from none but him, ſo with the infiniteſt eaſe that can bee imagined, doth God, as ſend, ſo remove any of them, how heavy or ſtrange ſoever it bee. Therefore paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie but his Spirit and you end the plague immediatly. As for example;</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a Citie brought to that paſſe by famine, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie, that they are faine to eate one another, that there is nothing to keepe them one day longer from ſtarving, and that to all humane imagination, it muſt bee a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever the Citie can recover the blow againe; God with ſpeaking one word in an houre or two maketh it all up: as you ſhall have one example of it in <hi>Samaria,</hi> when they <note place="margin">2 Kings <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118056:12"/>
could imagine how yet, God made it good, you know the ſtorie.</p>
            <p>Let a plague come to bee ſo hot that in a matter of two dayes or little more, three or foureſcore thouſand men are <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.</note> cut off with it, if God ſpeake but one word, the Angell puts up his Sword, and there is not a man dieth more. I will reſtore to you, ſaith God, all the yeares that the Caterpillers <note place="margin">Ioel 2. 25.</note> have taken from you, all the Caterpillers that have beene devouring <hi>England</hi> thus long, and all that they have plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſpoiled; (attend to this any of you that are here, who are daily plundered in many parts of the kingdome, in your lands, in your wares and in your ſtates;) If God ſpeak but the word, it is all made up in the twinckling of an eye. If you will therefore pacifie God, you end the plague. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, this is not the maine leſſon I would ſtay upon, yet give me leave to make ſome application of it, and it ſhall bee but one onely uſe.</p>
            <p>And that is a direction from Heaven of the readieſt way, the ſhorteſt cut, to obtain an eſtabliſhment for this <note place="margin">Application. Therefore our greateſt buſines is to pacifie Gods wrath.</note> poore diſtreſſed Land at this day. I dare ſay all you who are Publique-ſpirited men, are very thoughtfull to thinke how, and which way it might be brought about; that, if God ſee it fit, this Summer at the furtheſt might end theſe bloody warres, theſe uncomfortable diviſions that are amongſt us; And he that could ſuddainlyeſt procure it, would be one of the bleſſed'ſt men that ever trod on <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground. Now ſhall I from Almighty God give you a little information about it: Know then for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</p>
            <p>That there is never any ſword drawn on earth, till it bee firſt drawn in heaven. You ſhall read, <hi>Eſay</hi> 34. 5. <hi>My ſword ſhall bee bathed in Heaven, it ſhall come downe upon Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea, and upon the people of my curſe to judgement.</hi> A ſword was to come upon <hi>Idumea,</hi> to drinke their blood, to be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118056:12"/>
made fat with their fleſh, but firſt this ſword was bathed in heaven. Never doth warre come in any Country, till God bathes his ſword in Heaven, draweth it out and brandiſheth it in heaven, and then ſaith, Sword, Goe into ſuch a Land: And if once God hath given the Sword a Commiſſion, all the world can never quiet it againe, till God ſpeake to it; <hi>Oh thou Sword of the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Prophet in the 47 Chapter of the Propheſie of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> at the 6 Verſe. <hi>when wilt thou bee quiet? put up thy ſelſe againe into thy ſcabbard, reſt and bee ſtill.</hi> But there is an Anſwer made. <hi>How can it bee quiet, when God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it a charge; againſt Aſhkelon, and againſt the Sea ſhore, there hath he appointed it.</hi> Can all the world quiet that, that God giveth a charge to? It is God who ſtrengtheneth one part and weakneth the other part, and ſeemeth to make <note place="margin">Eſa. 13. 41. 54. ult.</note> one victorious, and then when he hath a mind to bring <note place="margin">Ezek. 30. 24.</note> it down againe; he will down with that part, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the other part, and till the Lord pleaſe to ſay, Sword be thou quiet, all the world cannot pacifie it.</p>
            <p>And therefore Brethren, were we never ſo ſucceſſefull, as through Gods mercy we ſeeme now to be in a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way; But had we all the Lord <hi>Hoptons</hi> Army in the Weſt wholly broken, the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> in the North, though all the Cavaliers about <hi>Oxford,</hi> were they all of them broke all in pieces, had you a blanke paper for Propoſitions ſent you; A blank paper, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and City, write what they would have, let his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſigne all, let him ſweare to all, let him and the reſt cordially intend to performe all; if the God of Heaven ſay, My quarrell with <hi>England</hi> is not ended, all the world ſhall not make peace for you. Conſider what the Prophet told them, when they ſaw the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> was riſen from the ſiege of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> upon <hi>Pharaohs</hi> comming to help them, they were jocund: But the Prophet commeth,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118056:13"/>
tels them a ſad ſtory to this effect; flatter not your ſelves <note place="margin">Ier. 37. 56. 7. &amp;c.</note> with it, <hi>Had you deſtroyed all the Armies of the Chaldeans, that there were none left but a few wounded men, thoſe few wounded men ſhall return and burn your City:</hi> when God will have the City burnt, it ſhall be burnt. Therefore till God be pacified, <hi>England</hi> ſhall never be quiet: but <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillus Deut tranquillat omnia,</hi> pacifie God and you end all: Oh! could this enter into your hearts, (Right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and beloved) could you all beleeve this really, and could wee bring it about that the Lord might once be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, there were an end of our troubles, and never till then. There is a caſe in <hi>Iſay</hi> 22. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> very like to ours, <hi>Jeruſalem ſaw ae day of trouble, and perplexity, their enemies brake in upon them, their choyceſt vallies were full of enemies, full of chariots and horſemen, which ſet themſelves in array at their very gates,</hi> now what courſe tooke they for their ſafety? why, <hi>They locked to the armour of the Houſe of the Foreſt, they repaired the breaches of the Citie of David, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the waters of the lower poole, they made a ditch between the two walls, they pulled down ſome houſes to fortifie the wall,</hi> made all warlike preparation, and this God chid them for, what was their errour I pray you? why, they begun at the wrong end, their maine worke lay with God againſt whom they had ſinned, and hee expected weeping and mourning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to regaine his favour, and that they neglected, and for that hee was more incenſed againſt them; and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus deale many of us, our worke lieth with God, and we looke to men, wee looke to Armies and aſſociations, and in the meane time let the wrath of God kindled by our ſinnes grow more hot againſt us; but Oh that wee could now ſet upon this which is our moſt needfull and ſafeſt worke, to pacifie his indignation and prevaile with him to cauſe his face to ſhine upon us, and wee ſhould ſoone bee ſafe: But you will ſay, How ſhall wee doe that? The third
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118056:13"/>
leſſon I chiefely reſerve for that, to ſhew you what <hi>Phine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>has</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Wayes how it may bee done.</note> did: But in the meane time let mee mention but three things to you, and ſo I will paſſe on to the next.</p>
            <p>The one is this, there is a great deale of evidence in the <note place="margin">1.</note> Scripture, That when God once findeth his people mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully lying downe under his hand, accepting the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their ſinnes, taking ſhame to themſelves, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting him, and accounting him righteous in all his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veritie, this hath a marvellous influence upon the cooling and quenching of Gods wrath.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath promiſed that if hee had ſcattered them into the ſeverall parts of the world, yet if their uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed hearts bee but humbled, and if they doe but accept of the puniſhment of their ſinnes, <hi>If they ſhall in the land of their captivitie confeſſe their ſinnes, and the iniquitie of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Levit. 26. 40.</note> 
               <hi>with their treſpaſſe which they have committed againſt me, and that alſo they have walked contrary to me, and that I alſo have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into their enemies land, if then their uncircumciſed heart bee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and they then accept of the puniſhment of their ſinnes,</hi> then (ſaith hee) will I turne my favour toward them, hee ſaith it expreſſely; ſo then, would you all helpe to pacifie God, I beſeech you often ſtudy how righteous the Lord is in al his ſeveritie toward England, that wee may ſtand amazed and ſay, <hi>Lord in ſtead of quarrelling with thee,</hi> and ſaying, why is it thus ſevere? why is thy indignation thus hot? wee confeſſe thou haſt puniſhed us leſſe then our iniquities have deſerved, it is thy mercy wee are not utterly conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, This is a marvellous meanes to pacifie God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, another is, the Lord loveth to have his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">2.</note> ſeeke him by prayer in the midſt of all his wrath and indignation againſt them, hee loveth to heare their <hi>mourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prayers:</hi> as hee would have their humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements of his juſtice, ſo hee loveth their mournefull
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118056:14"/>
ſuites for his compaſſion. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> ingaged God, and this God promiſed him to grant, That if they were ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with <hi>peſtilence, famine, ſword</hi> of the enemy, carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captivitie, in what kind ſoever his anger were kindled <note place="margin">1 King. 8. 33. 35. 47. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>6.</note> againſt them, when they ſhould <hi>mourne and pray unto him, that hee would forgive their ſinnes and give them compaſsion:</hi> Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> ſought God in captivitie, <hi>O Lord I beſeech thee let thine anger and thy fury bee turned away from thy City</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Dan 9 16.</note> 
               <hi>Ieruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> and ſuch prayers have prevailed with him.</p>
            <p>There are no ſuch Orators in all the world, next to the blood of Chriſt, in heaven or earth, there is not the like of a mournefull heart wreſtling with God by prayers and teares.</p>
            <p>And goe on with it (you beloved in the Lord that uſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to lie in the duſt before God, and to bee humbled before him) goe on, and let him fill his bottle, if hee will fill one veſſell with our bloods, let him fill a great many bottles with our teares; let us inceſſantly ſtrive with him, and intreat him to bee propitious and gratious, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is then <hi>when you call upon mee I will anſwer you, when you ſeeke mee with your whole heart, you ſhall finde me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thirdly, (and that will indeed make way for the next part.) The great means of all, that which one ſaith tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">3.</note> hath the key of all the bowels of mercy and that can let out all the floodgates of Gods mercie, to quench the heate of his wrath is <hi>unfeigned repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I ſay hath the key of all the bowels of God, and nothing but repentance will doe it; All acknowledgements of Gods juſtice, all our mournefull callings upon him for compaſſion, if it bee accompanied with a ſtubborne go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in a wicked way; the Lord may preſerve them from one judgement, but hee will reſerve them to another, there will never bee a pacifying of Gods wrath to the purpoſe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118056:14"/>
unleſſe there bee a laying downe the armes of Rebellion that are taken up againſt him. And therefore brethren let me commend this to you.</p>
            <p>Labour every ſoule of you, firſt for your owne parts, to inquire what the ſinnes are that you are guiltie of, and find out what the ſinnes are that England is guiltie of, I meane eſpecially in relation to this judgement that lieth upon us: what the ſword-procuring ſinnes are; what the ſinnes are for which God doth uſe to ſend a ſword to avenge his quarrell; labour to find them out, to reforme them, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that repentance may doe his worke on them, and then the Lords wrath will ceaſe quickly. But unleſſe wee obtaine grace to doe this, although all other things were granted to us, the end of all would prove nothing but ruine and miſery: The blood, the Idolatry, the whoredome, the contemning of the Goſpell, the prophaning of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, the ſcorning of Gods Miniſters, the hating of Gods children; theſe are all of them ſinnes that God uſeth to viſit with the Sword; And untill the land bee humbled for theſe ſinnes and doe repent of them, there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation that it can long bee free from one devouring plague or another; ſtrike in with all your might, and not onely to doe it your ſelves, but every one in your places, labour to expiate that in others, roote them out, puniſh them, weed them out, pluck them up by the rootes, what ever lieth in your power: And how that ſhall be done, and the way of it will beſt of all appeare in the example, and inſtance that you have in the Text; Hee did it while hee was <hi>zealous</hi> among them for the Lords ſake: And ſo I paſſe unto the third and laſt part of my Text. You have heard who was the Phyſitian, <hi>Phinehas;</hi> ſecondly you have heard what was the cure, <hi>hee paciſied Gods wrath;</hi> now wee are to inquire what was the balme which recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their hurt, the medicine which cured their ſickneſſe,

it was <hi>Zeale,</hi> hee was zealous among them for the Lords ſake, wherein (although time will allow me to handle but onel leſſon) I ſhall briefly inquire into two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what the thing was that <hi>Phinehas</hi> did as a meanes to pacific Gods wrath.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the manner how hee did it.</p>
            <p>The thing that hee did, was the execution of juſtice and judgement, taking away ſome grand delinquents, whom God would not have to live: ſo the Pſalmiſt ſaith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God ſaith here, <hi>Phinehas the ſonne of Eleazar pacifieth</hi>

               <hi>his wrath,</hi> the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>then ſtood up Phinehas and executed judgement,</hi> and that ſtayed the plague, hee did an act of juſtice, in cutting off ſome notorious Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And the <hi>manner</hi> how hee did it, <hi>zealouſly,</hi> hee did it fervently; And both theſe together doe afford this leſſon, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That zeale for God againſt ſinne, is the greateſt meanes to pacific Gods anger againſt ſinners;</hi> I ſay our zeale for God againſt ſinne is the greateſt meanes to pacific the fire of Gods wrath againſt ſinners; as one fire will draw out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo the fire of our zeale may extinguiſh the fire of Gods wrath. And for the clearing of it, I ſhall indeavour <note place="margin">The maine doctrine. Zeale againſt ſinne pacifyeth Gods wrath againſt ſinners.</note> theſe three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I will ſhew you plainely out of the Scripture, that ſo it is, <hi>That zeale againſt ſinne will extinguiſh Gods wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I will indeavour to open what I meane by this; <hi>What this zeale againſt ſinne is,</hi> and how it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I will ſhew you whence it commeth, or what reaſon there is, that mans zeale ſhould have ſuch an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the extinguiſhing of Gods wrath: And then make ſome application of it.</p>

For the firſt, The Lord ſaith it here in expreſſe words; <note place="margin">VVhich is proved by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> 
               <hi>Phinehas</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Eleazar</hi> hath pacified my wrath; how? <hi>while he was zealous for my ſake among them.

               <note place="margin">Read verſ. 1. 2, 3. 6. 2<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Up, make us Gods which may go before us: and all the people brake off the golden ear-rings which were in their eares, and brought them to Aaron,</hi> to make a Calfe; And when it was made, <hi>They roſe up early on the morning and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and roſe up to play,</hi> and they <hi>were ſet upon this miſchiefe,</hi> there the people were on fire inflamed with their luſt.</p>
            <p>And in the next place you have <hi>God</hi> all on a flame too, hee ſaith to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Let mee alone, I will deſtroy eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man of them; and ſpake it very bitterly againſt them; <hi>They have corrupted themſelves, they have made them a golden Calfe, it is a ſtiff-necked people, let mee alone that my wrath</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>may wax hot againſt them, and that I may conſume them;</hi> there is the ſecond fire.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, you have <hi>Moſes</hi> on a fire too, and hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth downe, and there hee ſheweth his zeale in two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in being Gods <hi>Champion againſt ſinne:</hi> for when he ſaw the Golden Calfe, hee ſtampeth it to powder, made <note place="margin">Verſ. 20. 27, 28, &amp;c.</note> the Iſraelites drinke of it, calleth the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> to him, biddeth every one goe and ſheath his Sword in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118056:16"/>
bowels of his neareſt kinſman, that had a hand in this ſin, as if hee had beene diſtracted: and when hee had plaid Gods <hi>Champion</hi> againſt theſe their ſins, and the ring-leaders of the ſinners, hee then playeth their advocate to God, and prayeth him to blot his name out of the booke of life, rather then to deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>And <hi>this</hi> heate cooled both the other heates, this heate brought <hi>them to repentance,</hi> and <hi>pacified the Lords wrath,</hi> that hee would not cut them off as hee did otherwiſe proteſt hee would have done. There you ſee zeale for God againſt ſinne will pacifie God againſt ſinners, though hee bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo angry.</p>
            <p>The like you find in <hi>Eliah,</hi> though it did not take ſo well, becauſe they were paſt cure, <hi>Eliah</hi> hee riſeth in an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall time, when the people had deſperately forſaken God, and hee doth all that hee could, and was like a man on fire, when hee came to God hee ſaith, I have beene ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zealous for thy ſake; <hi>and ſo hee had,</hi> for hee had ſlaine I know not how many hundreds of <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets, and had pulled downe <hi>Baals</hi> houſe, and had made the people in a manner enter into Covenant with God: O Lord! ſaith hee, <hi>I have beene very zealous for thy ſake,</hi> though I have beene left all alone, as if hee had ſaid, Lord I have done what I could to ſave them, I confeſſe my great Sheat Anchor is come home, I now deſpaire of it, but my zeale, if it could have had any effect at all, would have done it; yea the Lord profeſſeth it ſo. Bee pleaſed alſo to note theſe two places I told you of in the beginning, in the <note place="margin">And ſeverall promiſes.</note> fift of <hi>Jeremiah, Runne,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>through the ſtreets of Jeruſalem, and ſee now, and know, and ſeeke in the broad place thereof, if you can find a man, &amp;c.</hi> What meaneth hee by a man? Firſt, hee meaneth a good man; that no man doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of. But every good man would not ſerve the turne, find mee a man that <hi>executeth judgement and juſtice:</hi> In a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118056:16"/>
word hee deſcribeth a <hi>Phinehas;</hi> find mee but that man, <hi>and I will ſpare all the Citie for his ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So in the 22. of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> at the latter end, when the Lord had ſpoke of all the villany that the people had lived in, their blood, their Idolatry, uncleanneſſe, a conſpiracie of the Prophets, Prieſts, and Princes in all kind of ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo that the fire of his wrath was kindled againſt them, then ſaith hee, <hi>I doe looke for a man,</hi> what man? <hi>A man that might have ſtood in the gap to have made it up,</hi> (allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Moſes)</hi> another <hi>Moſes;</hi> If I could have found but a <hi>Moſes</hi> or a <hi>Samuel,</hi> I would have ſpared them all. Thus you ſee God profeſſeth, when hee can but finde zealous men, that ſhall burne againſt ſinne, it ſhall quench Gods wrath, that it ſhall no longer burne againſt the ſinners. But beloved, <note place="margin">Which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhewing what zeale is.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt in the ſecond place a little come and diſcover to you, what this grace is. It is a thing of mighty conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that I have undertooke to make good; <hi>That this grace of zeale may ſave a Kingdome,</hi> that it may reach to heaven and extinguiſh the fire that is kindled in Gods breſt; wee had need therefore know what it is, and have it rightly diſcovered: To this end conſider this deſcription; Some deſcribe it to bee an intenſe degree of love; ſome a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of love, anger and indignation, others call it <hi>imenſus gradus purae affectionis.</hi> But a little more largely take it thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zeale it is a ſpirituall heat kindled by the Spirit of God, whereby all the affections are drawne out to the utmoſt for God,</hi> this is zeale.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I call it a worke of the Spirit, the holy Ghoſt is the author of it, it is named among the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 18. Be not drunken with wine, wherein is exceſſe, an exceſſe of heat is wrought by wine, avoyd that, but <hi>be yee filled with the Spirit,</hi> and ſuch are ſaid to bee baptized with the holy Ghoſt and with fire, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 34.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:118056:17"/>
Secondly, I adde it is a ſpirituall <hi>heat;</hi> The word in the originall, is to burne, or hiſſe as burning coales when water falls on them; and zealous men are ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. to <hi>bee fervent in ſpirit.</hi> And zealous <hi>Apollos</hi> was ſaid to bee fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in ſpirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 25. Moreover the ſinnes oppoſed to zeale, <hi>luke-warmeneſſe</hi> and <hi>key-coldneſſe, Revel.</hi> 3. <hi>Thou art lukewarme, I would thou wert either hot or cold,</hi> doe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſhew that the nature of zeale is a <hi>ſpirituall heate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ſeate or ſubject of this grace you have in theſe words, <hi>all the affections;</hi> the affections are the motions of the will, the outgoings of the ſoule: a mans ſoule moves little or nothing in proſecuting of good, or avoyding of evill, but as the affections ſtirre: now all the affections are the proper ſeate and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of zeale, See all of them in <hi>David</hi> whom the zeale of Gods houſe had eaten up; his <hi>love, Oh how I love thy Law!</hi> more then hony, more then thouſands of gold and ſilver; his <hi>hatred, Doe not I hate them that hate thee? yea I hate them ſore, I count them my enemies,</hi> it made him flie in their faces; his <hi>joy, My ſoule is ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſſe;</hi> his <hi>deſire, My ſoule is raviſhed with deſire;</hi> his <hi>griefe, Rivers of waters run downe my eyes;</hi> his <hi>hope, My eyes are dim with waiting;</hi> his <hi>feare, I tremble at thy judgements, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, I adde that which is indeed the <hi>formalis ratio,</hi> the very ſoule of zeale, it drawes out all the affections to the <hi>uttermoſt, ſets them on worke to the uttermoſt,</hi> and therefore they are ſaid to doe it with all their ſoule, all their ſtrength, all their might; <hi>The twelve Tribes with intention of ſpirit ſerved God night and day, Acts</hi> 26. 7. What <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did for God, <hi>hee did it with all his might.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. 21. So did <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. 25. <hi>he did it with all his heart, and with all his ſoule,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118056:17"/>
and with all his might.</hi> In a word, looke what pitch of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction a worldling beſtowes upon Mammon, an ambitious man upon honour, a voluptuous man upon pleaſure, that doth zeale draw out for God.</p>
            <p>Yea, looke what an edge is to a Razor, look what wine is to a mans ſpirit, what the ſoule is to the body, wings to a bird, winde to ſayles, what mettle is to a horſe, looke what vivacity and vigour is to any creature; that is zeale to a Chriſtian. It is that that acts his ſoule, the vigour, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, the fervency of his affections; that is zeale.</p>
            <p>Then I adde, that all this muſt be <hi>for God,</hi> as they are drawne out to the utmoſt, ſo they are drawne out for God, that is, for ſome thing or other that belongeth to God, in order, in relation to God, and Gods <hi>Glory,</hi> Gods <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi> Gods <hi>Sacraments,</hi> Gods <hi>Worſhip,</hi> Gods <hi>Children,</hi> or againſt Gods <hi>Enemies,</hi> thoſe that riſe up againſt him, things that God hateth, his owne word. If you will carry it all away in a ſhort Sentence: A zealous man <hi>is a man of mettle for God:</hi> As we ſay of a man that is all ſpirit, he is a man of mettle; ſo that man that is a zealous man, is a man of mettle and ſpirit for God.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I have not yet ſatisfied my ſelfe, in making <note place="margin">And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and e<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fects of it.</note> it ſo cleere as I would, before I come to any application, or to make you underſtand why it ſhould have that influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon Gods wrath to pacifie it, give me leave to open five remarkeable properties and effects that doe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more accompany this grace of holy zeale.</p>
            <p>The firſt is this, I pray know that zeale is not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <note place="margin">1.</note> of a Chriſtian, it's onely the <hi>edge;</hi> And therefore if you know rightly where zeale is to be found, you muſt enquire what the mettle is upon which this edge is moſt to be ſet. As for example, bring me an Inſtrument that hath never ſo delicate an edge, that will cut an haire off the back of a mans hand, if the mettle be Lead or Iron, if it bee
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118056:18"/>
not Steele, the edge is not worth any thing; enquire we therefore what the mettle is upon which the edge is ſet; Know then that the mettle of the heart, that is, for God, is <hi>ſincerity;</hi> ſincerity and uprightneſſe is the ſubſtance and ground-worke of a ſervant of God, and zeale is but the edge of his ſincerity; Now then here I lay downe my firſt concluſion, That no man can ever be zealous for God, that is not ſincere unto God; This ſincerity is the apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a mans heart to God for Gods end: zeale is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this fervently, with ſtrength of affection: &amp; take but away ſincerity, that the heart be not upright to God, what zeale ſoever you find in any of them, it will either prove <hi>blind zeale,</hi> like mettle in a blind horſe, that will never doe any good; or you will finde it <hi>corrupt zeale,</hi> counterfeit zeale, that a man may come and appeare mightily as if for God; but this is but a vizard; and in the meane while his owne <hi>gaine,</hi> his owne <hi>preferment,</hi> his owne <hi>eaſe,</hi> or ſome other carnall thing is that which he aimeth at: Like <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his company, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 22. who pretended great zeale for <hi>Diana,</hi> went up and downe crying, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians,</hi> but this was but a vizard, the true cauſe of all their heat was nothing but this, <hi>Sirs, you know that by this craft we have our living,</hi> and now <hi>this craft is like to be ſet at naught.</hi> Such a zealot was <hi>Jehu,</hi> who was fierce againſt <hi>Baal,</hi> and pretended much for <hi>Jehuvah, Come ſee my zeale for the Lord,</hi> but the bottome of all was the ſetling the Crowne upon himſelfe. Further then that <hi>hee tooke no heed to walke in the wayes of God,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. And ſuch another was <hi>Judas, John</hi> 12. 56. who pretended zeale for the poore, <hi>Quorſum haec perditio? This oyntment might have beene ſold for much money, and given to the poore:</hi> But it was the ſatisfaction of his covetouſneſſe he aimed at. Thus <hi>Doeg</hi> would be detained a whole day before the Lord, with a miſchievous intent againſt <hi>David</hi> and the Prieſts. This
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118056:18"/>
zeale which thus maskes it ſelfe, and makes Gods honour but a ſtale and lure, is ſo farre from pacifying Gods wrath, that it is the moſt devilliſh villany, and double iniquity: With <hi>Jeſabel</hi> to proclaime a Faſt to get a Vineyard, to ſtrike in zealouſly with the right ſide, that wee might cruſh ſome enemy of ours, which appeares on the other ſide, is a zeale which the Lord abhorreth.</p>
            <p>But if it be be true zeale for God, that zeale whereof the Lord ſaith, <hi>He was zealous for my ſake,</hi> the heart muſt be <hi>upright</hi> toward him. There muſt be ſincerity within, the coale of ſincerity muſt glow within, before ever the flame of it will ſhine abroad in zeale. That is the firſt thing. That true zeale is alway the edge of a gracious ſpirit of a man who is <hi>upright to God,</hi> in the truth and ſincerity of whoſe heart, <hi>the Lord and his wayes are ſet us as their greateſt good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing which you ſhall alwaies find in true zeale is this, it's prodigall of doing good, for any cauſe of God, it's I ſay, a <hi>prodigall</hi> grace, it ſpares for no coſt, to their ſtrength, and above their ſtrength, any thing ſhall goe, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing ſhal go, if God, Chriſt Jeſus, or his cauſe have need of it. You never knew a zealous man a good husband in all your life time. <hi>Jeſabel</hi> in her zeale for <hi>Baal</hi> will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine 400. of his Prophets at her Table. I mean that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a mans heart is zealous for, hee ever doth his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the proſecution of it: never commeth to ſay, I hope here is enough done for my ſhare, if he can doe any more. Let a voluptuous man have his heart ſet on his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; let an earthly man have his heart ſet upon Mammon; Let an ambitious man have his heart ſet upon preferment, or honor, he never ſaith I have done enough for it, if he can doe any more. If <hi>David</hi> have 1300. Cart load of ſilver &amp; gold, he can joyfully part with every penny of it toward the building of Gods houſe, and bleſſeth God that hee had it to give, if Gods Tabernacle be to be built; The women bring their Jewels, their Lawnes and Looking-glaſſes,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118056:19"/>
and all other materials ſo willingly, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was faine to make a Proclamation that they ſhould bring no more, <hi>Exod.</hi> 36. 6. 38. 8. And in the Primitive Church when the exigents of Gods people required it, they who had houſes, lands, or other poſſeſſions, ſold them all, and put them in the common Treaſury. This is a ſecond proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of zeale, it is <hi>liberall, bountifull,</hi> for God. You all know that if a man have the vanity of his heart let out about any thing; Take a Gentleman, that is otherwiſe a good husband, and a provident man, (I meane penurious) if his heart be ſet on the building of an houſe, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon two thouſand pound, it is ten to one if he grutch the laying out three or foure or five thouſand pound to make it fit to his minde; or if a mans heart be ſet upon his garden and flowers, it is little queſtion but hee will bee waſtfull upon it; the like may be ſaid of Hawkes and Dogs; and ſo is the zealous man for God, whatſoever coſt it puts him to he doth not ſticke at.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Zeale, where ever it is true for God, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth moſt of all <hi>in greateſt diſſiculties;</hi> It cannot be taken off, with, There is a Lyon in the way, and I ſhall be kil'd, if I goe out into the ſtreets; goe you firſt, and I will ſee how ſafely you ſpeed, and I ſhall come in my due time after you; neither doe you heare a zealous man talke ſo, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Cravens and Cowards hang backe, but the beſt horſe ever leads the way. You ſhall have a very <hi>Samaritan,</hi> if there be no danger in it, if Authority be on their ſide, he will be a <hi>Jew,</hi> and be a kin to him, and come and build with him; but if there be danger in it, <hi>Jew</hi> ſtand on your legs for all the <hi>Samaritan;</hi> Juſt ſo now in the cauſe of God, if there be eaſe and profit by it, if it goeth well, and no diſpleaſure incurred, many well appear as forward, and frolike for a good cauſe as the forwardeſt; but if any danger appeare, a baſe heart preſently tackes about, or draws backe, I promiſe you <hi>I have a great charge, I have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118056:19"/>
ſomewhat to loſe,</hi> I ſhall incurre ſuch a great mans diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I know not in what blacke booke I may be written; but a zealous man diſdains difficulties, &amp; anſwers with <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> when they would have him flie into the Temple, <hi>Shall ſuch a man as I flie into the Temple?</hi> no not I, I profeſſe, if I might ſave my life by it; So when they would have <hi>Luther</hi> goe, Thinke any thing of <hi>Luther,</hi> ſaid he, but running from Gods cauſe, or recanting, but never imagin, if they were all devils, as many devils as Tyles on the houſe, I will refuſe to goe, when God bids me goe, That is a third, difficulty and danger and oppoſition taketh not off the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man that is zealous for God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, another companion of true zeale is this, <hi>Zeale for God</hi> alwayes maketh a man <hi>coole for himſelfe,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4.</note> a zealous man cannot trade in both <hi>Indies</hi> to any purpoſe, he doth not trade for God &amp; himſelfe too, becauſe there can be but one chiefe, one that is moſt highly regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in his bed, in his cloſet, in his family, in all his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in his office, where ever hee hath any thing to doe hee hath but one, that is his chiefe, and that is God, and becauſe the whole of his heart is given to God, hee muſt by conſequence be a man that doth not greatly proſecute his owne buſineſſe: You ſhall find this old obſervation to bee a very true one, that in all the world there cannot bee found a man that is eager, truely eager in Gods cauſe, and in his owne cauſe too; indeed cholerick and hot ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men whatſoever they doe <hi>velle,</hi> they doe <hi>valde velle,</hi> they are very eager upon it from the temper of their nature: But if it be a gracious frame, where the grace of God hath the predominancie, it layeth out all the ſtrength and mettle ſo for God, that there is little left for themfelves: thus <hi>Moſes</hi> that is ſtarke mad almoſt in Gods cauſe, is the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt man in his owne cauſe: <hi>Nehemiah</hi> hee that can teare the haire of his head, and profeſſeth he will lay hands on any man that will prophane the Sabbath, hee can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118056:20"/>
any man ſhall jeere and ſcorne him if it be his owne cauſe. I would have you remember that Gods fire doth roſt, or boyle, or bake a ſacrifice, but never doth hee allow it to roſt our meate in our owne Kitchin, no that cannot bee: find me the man that drives any ſelf end in any high degree of his owne, and I will ſhew you the man that hath no true zeale for God.</p>
            <p>It is an obſervation that one hath of <hi>Solomon,</hi> That <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> built an houſe for God, the ſtatelieſt houſe that ever was thought to bee in the world, the Temple; and hee was ſeven yeares building of it: and hee built a houſe for himſelfe, that was not in the tenth degree comparable to the Temple, and was 14. yeares building of it, and why? hee did Gods houſe with all his heart and with all his might, and ſet foureſcore thouſand men on worke, to have Gods houſe up, but as for his owne houſe did it at leaſure; hee had Gods buſineſſe to follow, and that hee followed to the purpoſe, and lets his owne houſe goe up by degrees as it would, 14. yeares about that which is but a Cottage in compariſon of Gods.</p>
            <p>So is every man whoſe heart is truely zealous, who in truth ſtands out for God, hee reſolves for himſelfe or things that concernes himſelfe to bee very moderate, let the Lord diſpoſe of him and his how he will.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſt of all, the laſt propertie of true zeale (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is conceived by many to be the very <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of zeale, to be the very quinteſſence of it) is this; That it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes carries vindictive ſpirits againſt ſinne and ſinfull men, becauſe they are againſt God; it is a grace that is full of vengeance, and therefore ſome define zeale to bee <hi>affectus ad dei injuriam vindicandam, affectus ad extermina dos Dei inimi cos, vel zelotypia perſequens ſponſarum Chriſti adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria, vel eorum ſigna &amp; occaſiones,</hi> an affection that will take vengeance of injuries that are offered to God, a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ſpirit, that would extirpate or exterminate all Gods
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118056:20"/>
enemies: and ordinarily in the Scripture where any mans zeale is taken notice of, it is in exacting vengeance againſt ſinne and ſinners; and ſome Criticks obſerve that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall word though it ſignifie heat, yet it is ſuch a heat as ſhewes it ſelfe in oppoſition to its enemy, as when hot Iron hiſſeth when you ſpit upon it, or ſuch a heat as makes water play and boyle in the pot; ſuch a heat zeale ſheweth it ſelfe, when it commeth to oppoſition, and therefore <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas</hi> zeale made him ſtab this noble man, ſtrike him through with his Javelin; <hi>Moſes</hi> when hee was zealous <note place="margin">Numb. 25. 4. Exod 32.</note> 
               <hi>hangs</hi> them up, <hi>cuts off the heads,</hi> maketh the Levites runne their kindred through: So every where zealous men, ſo farre as their authority reacheth, ſo farre doe they flie in the face of their ſinnes without any exception of perſons: <hi>Aſa,</hi> if his owne mother be the Queene Regent and have an Idoll, hee puts her downe from her regencie, ſhee ſhall have no regencie in his kingdome if ſhee will have an Idol: <hi>Levi</hi> in the day of his zeale, if his brother have a golden Calfe, runnes his Sword through him, he is no brother of his, if he have an Idol; and every where the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer they are in the fleſh, the more abominable in the heart of a zealous man is their ſinne againſt God; He begins firſt with them if it be true zeale, and what their authoritie reacheth not to extirpate, that doth a zealous heart mourne for; As <hi>Nehemiah</hi> when he had done all hee could, teares the haire of theit heads and taketh on againſt them, and <note place="margin">Nehem. 13.</note> when hee hath done all he can, he prayes the Lord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them who defiled the Prieſthood; And ſo <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth hee would not leave a wicked man about his court, or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when he was King, and yet when he had done all he could he ſits him downe and weeps, <hi>Rivers of teares runne downe my cheekes, becauſe men kept not thy Law,</hi> hee had a heart full of ſorrow for what his authoritie did not reach to extirpate.

you the man that is worth his weight in gold, the man that may ſave a kingdome, ſuch a people, a conſiderable number whereof will reſcue a land wherein they live, ſuch a people are zealous for God, whoſe hearts are <hi>ſincere,</hi> that doe to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> paſſe all difficulties, without ſelfe <hi>reſpects,</hi> doe all that they can for the rooting out of that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh the Lord to wrath and indignation, and ſo I have done with the firſt thing to ſhew you what this grace is, and how it may be knowne.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing conſiderable is, whence it comes that this grace of zeale ſhould bee able to pacifie the wrath of <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd why reale able to doe</note> God? whence it is? I anſwer you in a word, zeale doth not pacifie or quench Gods wrath meritoriouſly, by any vertue that it hath, that it may plead with God to doe it, as if it had deſerved it, as if it could give him any propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; No, no, It doth it onely by way of inſtrument, the Lord bleſſing it, and crowning it, it is Gods free grace doth it, onely you muſt know that the Lord is ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his owne workes, in the hearts of his people, that hee loveth to ſet ſome crowne or other on the head of his grace, as if the grace did doe that, which hee himſelfe worketh alone; Thus hee crowneth the grace of faith, that that ſhall juſtifie the ſinner when it onely receiveth the pardon, thus hee crowneth Humilitie, that it ſhall bee a Temple where God will dwell, whereas alas it is but a poore ſtie, if God did not beautifie it; And thus God crowneth the grace of zeale, accepting of it, gives this publike teſtimony of his delight in it, that hee will put the glory of his owne worke on zeale, as if it had done that, which indeed God onely doth of his owne free grace, zeale ſhall have the glory among men, that people might learne to bee in love with it.</p>
            <p>If you aske but why zeale hath this glory put upon it: I anſwer, zeale doth ſo much honour God, therefore hee
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118056:21"/>
honours it, and that it doth in three particulars; Firſt, it is moſt like to himſelfe, moſt agreeable to his owne nature, who is a Spirit, a pure act, all life; to a man of ſpirit a ſloathfull meſſenger is as Vineger to the Teeth, hatefull and troubleſome; much more to God is a dull, ſlothfull, luke-warme, cold ſervant, which hee hath ſhewed by refuſing to have the firſtling of an Aſſe devoted to him, hee abhorrs to have ſuch a dull creature conſecrated to his ſervice, hee had rather have the necke of it broken; but on the contrary hee delights in active, lively, quicke and zealous inſtruments, ſuch ſhall ſtand about him, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are ſpirits and his miniſters flames of fire.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This grace of zeale is not onely ſutable to his nature, but it ſets him up in his owne place: for what ever wee lay out all the ſtrength of our affections, to that doe wee (in ſo doing) aſcribe the height of all excellency: wee know God deſerves to have not onely ſome revolets, or ſtreames, but the whole Ocean of our thoughts, affections, indeavours, &amp;c. Now zeale thus carrying the ſoule, doth evidently declare that hee alone (as hee ought to bee) is greateſt in our hearts; and in truth God can bee no more acknowledged in his owne place without zeale, then a man can bee without reaſon, but give him this and you exalt him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And beſide it doth the worke that Gods vengeance ſhould doe, I ſay, zeale in its place and for its part doth that which Gods vengeance came to doe; What need God come in vengeance to cut off ſinners? Zeale is doing it to his hand, <hi>Phinehas</hi> is <hi>ſlaying</hi> of them, <hi>Moſes</hi> is <hi>thruſting</hi> them through, zealous men are endeavouring to exterminate all things that are evill, and when the Lord ſeeth ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his cauſe, and doing his worke, hee will gratifie them to ſpare the reſt for their ſake; As when <hi>David</hi> thought all of <hi>Nabals</hi> family againſt him, hee would cut them all off, and not a man of them ſhould live, but when
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118056:22"/>
hee findeth there was an <hi>Abigail</hi> that was of his ſide, and pleaded his cauſe, this cooleth <hi>Davids</hi> heate; So is it with the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Run,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>finde out a man who executeth juſtice, and judgement, and I will ſpare it,</hi> finde mee a man who is doing the worke my juſtice and vengeance comes to doe, and I will forbeare doing it my ſelfe: and elſe-where, <hi>I looked for a man to have ſtood in the breach,</hi> to have ſaved mee a labour, and when I could finde none, I did it my ſelfe, I then poured out my wrath upon them.</p>
            <p>Give mee leave to make two or three uſes of this leſſon, and I ſhall diſmiſſe you.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, if this bee ſo, what wonderfull cauſe have wee to mourne and tremble before God, to thinke how few are to bee found in any place, or any ranke or ſocietie of <note place="margin">Application. Firſt to lament the want of it.</note> men, who are to bee numbred among them whom God will make ſaviours unto a people, who elſe are like to bee deſtroyed? Verily it is a ſad thing to thinke how few can any where bee found in whoſe hearts there is this grace of zeale kindled, of whom the Lord may, Say ſuch and ſuch are zealous for my ſake. In your owne thoughts ſurvey al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all publike places, or orders of men, and think among the Nobles, or the Commons, in the Citie among the Aldermen, among the Common Councell men, among the ſeverall Wards, goe into the Miniſtrie, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall degrees of men, and doe but thinke how few there are whoſe hearts are truely zealous for the Lord, if this bee zeale that I have opened unto you; truely if I ſhould enter or put my finger into this Ulcer, I might make your hearts ſad and tremble; have wee not abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance that live this day in <hi>London</hi> and about <hi>London,</hi> if not in the Parliament, not onely thoſe that are at <hi>Oxford,</hi> that turne Cavaliers, who pretend to bee our friends, <hi>who have a zeale againſt zeale,</hi> who are with all the heat that can be kindled in them ſet on fire <hi>againſt</hi> zealous men, caſting all the opprobrious nicknames on them that can be; bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118056:22"/>
zeale for God with <hi>madneſſe,</hi> with <hi>turbulencie,</hi> with <hi>indiſcretion,</hi> with <hi>haire-braindneſſe;</hi> who with <hi>Feſtus, thinke men beſide themſelves, Act.</hi> 26. 24. who with <hi>Ahab</hi> count every zealous <hi>Eliah a troubler of Iſrael,</hi> and eſteeme of them as they did of the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 6. to bee men <hi>who turn the world upſide downward,</hi> who brand them to bee Puritans, Preciſians, factious, any thing which a vile heart can thinke and foule mouth utter. Yea how many are ſad to ſee men lay out their ſtrength and ſtate for a good cauſe, and with <hi>Tobia</hi> and <hi>Sanballat</hi> are grieved to thinke, that any goe about to build up the walls of Gods houſe, or any <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Elijah</hi> take vengeance on Gods enemies? A ſad thing there ſhould bee any ſuch among us, but more ſad that any among us ſhould bee like <hi>Catiline,</hi> who was all fire, <hi>perdere rempublicam,</hi> to undoe the Commonwealth where hee lived, drive deſignes, make factions, doe any thing in the earth that Religion might not thrive. Theſe are miſerable and accurſed men, theſe men are factors for hell, Satans Boutefeus, and as the true zealots are ſet on fire from heaven, ſo theſe mens fire is kindled from hell, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo it carries them.</p>
            <p>What abundance are there that are wholly lukewarm, if not key-cold, that have no mettle, no heate in the world for God? Ah deare friends, how many others are there that are ingaged in Gods cauſe, who make Religion a and the publike cauſe a meere vizard to ſerve their owne ends, who lay out the heat of their zeale all their ſtrength to feather their owne neſts, by getting ſome imployment in an Army, in a Navie, in a Commitree, in ſuch a place in the Citie; And the thing they drive at is to advance themſelves or their friends, to provide for this child, to ſtop ſuch a gap. &amp;c. And ſo out of the publike preſſure of Gods people, draw out that which may inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and further then that, let become of Gods cauſe what will; how little ſuch mens zeale is like to helpe us, yea
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118056:23"/>
how abominable they and their zeale is to God you heard before; And how many are there among our ſelves, that proteſt they owne this great cauſe that is now in hand, will vow, and take the Covenant, and ſweare too, (if you will give it them) an hundred times over, that they will adhere to this cauſe with all their might, and yet doe no more for it then honeſt men may doe with a good conſcience, who live under the <hi>enemies</hi> quarters, that is, let their goods bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it is in vaine for them to make an head, if an officer come hee muſt have it, &amp;c. part with what is laid upon them, and there's an end: But to bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſay, Let me go, let my child goe; here is my money, my ſpirit, my life; let all goe rather then this cauſe ſinke; you had as good wring water out of a Pumice ſtone, you may as ſoone wring water out of a Flint ſtone, as bring men to that: as if they were yet to ſeek where the truth lay, or which the true cauſe were that God would own. God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there are abundance of ſuch that with the Samaritanes, if the cauſe thrive well on the Parliaments ſide, they are cordiall for them; but if it goe on the other ſide, then they are caſting about how they may ſave themſelves, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they could <hi>but ſettle their owne eſtates,</hi> whether Religion ſhould be ſetled, whether Idolatry ſhall bee extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, whether there ſhould be any reliques of them left, whether any of them ſhould bee puniſhed, whom if wee puniſh not, God will puniſh us for them, and our life ſhall go for theirs, whether juſtice ſhould be executed upon any <hi>Achans,</hi> or <hi>Zimries,</hi> or any ſuch ſhould be made examples; theſe are things they never trouble their thoughts about, all matters wherin the glory of God is concerned, are to them as indifferent, as that Controverſie, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. whether <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, or the <hi>Jewes</hi> blaſphemy prevailed, whether the Greeks beat <hi>Soſthenes,</hi> or <hi>Soſthenes</hi> beat the Greeks, whether, as the Proverbe is, the Dog catch the Hare, or the Hare the Dog, he was indifferent, <hi>Gallio cared for none of theſe</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:118056:23"/>
things; and ſo verily is it with moſt men; ſo their owne houſes bee furniſhed, it matters not what becomes of Gods houſe; So that <hi>Reuben</hi> may heare his owne flocks bleat, and <hi>Aſher</hi> keepe his owne Coaſts ſafe, let <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barack</hi> ſhift for themſelves, private intereſts, and ſelfe-reſpects, care of themſelves and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, have the whole of their ſoules, and in theſe things they are in good earneſt, but no heart, no ſpirit appeares in them for any cauſe of God; they are like <hi>David</hi> in his old age, no cloathes can warme them, no motives worke upon them, they drive, like <hi>Jehu,</hi> furiouſly in their owne buſineſſe, but in Gods, like the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the red Sea, when their Chariot Wheeles were broken: Ah beloved, ſearch and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether there be not ſuch among your ſelves, ſuch lukewarme <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> ſuch cold profeſſors, and if any of you be ſuch, give mee leave to tell you, that your condition is wofull, you not onely will be no Saviours to us in our diſtreſſes, but for you, and ſuch as you are, doth the Lord thus bitterly contend againſt us; and be you aſſured, that (what ever he meane to doe with this ſinfull Nation) without ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy awaking and warming your hearts, he will ſpue you out of his mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p>The other uſe (and ſo I will have done) is for exhortation, where I would provoke this City, this Honourable City of <hi>London,</hi> the Lord <note place="margin">Exhortation to it.</note> Maior, Court of Aldermen, Common Councell, &amp; the reſidue, that are here gathered together, by your zeale for God, to quench Gods wrath againſt us. I confeſſe we have great cauſe to praiſe God for your zeale, (though I thinke you and others have had cauſe to bemoane the want of it,) for ſurely your zeale hath provoked many in the Kingdome, and you have in great meaſure ſaved the Kingdome hitherto, and it ſhall be a glory and a Crowne to you while this world ſtandeth; That in all this deplorable and forlorne condition we have beene in, the zeale of the City of <hi>London,</hi> for the more conſiderable part of it, hath held up when others hearts have fallen, and have ſtood for the Lord and his cauſe, and we humbly bleſſe the Lord for it; Let God have the glory; It is Honour enough for you, that God will accept any ſervice fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, or kindle anything good in your hearts: but I beſeech you that you would abound more and more: you who have done thus much already, I hope are willing to ſave us if it lye in your power. Now you heare what may ſave the Kingdome, what may extinguiſh the fire of Gods wrath: Zeale will doe it, the laying out and drawing out the heart and affections to the uttermoſt for God, will doe it. O then lay out all your hearts and ſtrength and affections for the Lord, goe on
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118056:24"/>
with all your might, with all your eſtates, with all your treaſure, with what ever you have, let God have it all, in his cauſe if he need it, and be you ſorry that you have no more to part with, doe it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, ſhew your ſelves zealous in it, and extend your zeale more againſt evill, ſo farre as you can reach. And you (my Lord, and Honourable Court, and Gentlemen of the Common Councell) may reach a great way this day; your prayers, your Counſels, your Petitions and your purſes, may under God have any good thing done that you will put your hands to, I ſay any thing that is good. And therefore put to all your ſtrength, that <hi>Achans</hi> may be removed, that all Idolatry may be rooted out, that thoſe delinquents upon whom God would have juſtice executed, may be proceeded againſt, doe you it upon ſuch as are under your owne juriſdiction. And by your humble Petitions, if need be, intreat juſtice may be done wherever God will have it done. I am a Miniſter of Gods mercy, and take no pleaſure in preſſing to ſuch a worke as judgement and ſeverity, were it not that I am aſſured that if we ſhould not doe juſtice where God requireth it to be done, he will doe it without us, and he will doe it upon us: when <hi>Saul</hi> executed not Gods fierce wrath upon the <hi>Amalekltes,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. he brought Gods fierce wrath upon himſelf: when the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> let goe a man whom God had appointed to dye, his life went for the others life, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 42. And certainly the Idolatry, and blood and other crying abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſome are guilty of in this Land, I meane ſome of the chief Ringleaders in theſe evills, who have made theſe wofull breaches be tween our Soveraigne and his people, and thus violently promoted Idolatry and ſpoyle, the Lord will have them reckoned with: and let your zeale be laid out that way: Doe it cordially, and ſo as God may ſee it. And to ſtirre you in all theſe things to be zealous for the Lord, take theſe few Motives.</p>
            <p>Bee you ſo againſt their ſinnes, I pray you, though not againſt their perſons. Firſt, let me tell you, That it is for a God that hath been very zealous for you: So zealous, that when he had but one onely ſonne, hee <note place="margin">Motives to zeale.</note> did not ſpare him, but ſent him, purpoſely to be hanged upon a Croſſe to ſave you: it is for a Saviour who zealouſly redeemed you, how zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly he prayed, preached, lived, died for you, to purchaſe you to be a people for himſelfe zealous of good workes? and his zeale hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved you, and all yours all this while, and all the good you have, or hope for, the zeale of God hath holpen you to it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the cauſe you contend for is ſuch a cauſe, that loſe this cauſe, and you ſhall never have ſuch another as long as you live, loſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118056:24"/>
your eſtate loſe your wives, loſe your children, loſe your lives, God can give you as good and better, but loſe this cauſe, and never ſhall you bee tryed in ſuch a cauſe againe while this world ſtandeth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let me aſſure you your enemies want no zeale againſt you, they have followed it, what all the Popiſh party in Chriſtendome could do againſt you, hath bin done to deſtroy you, and they want no ill wil at this day; and I beleeve ſhould the Lord for our ſins but deliver <hi>London</hi> up to their hands, ſince <hi>England</hi> was a Kingdome, never was ſo ſad a day knowne, as they would make <hi>London</hi> to know, ſuch is their zeale againſt you. <note place="margin">See Matth. 19 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſider (as this doctrine makes it plaine) this is the moſt certaine way to ſave this famous City, this will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>London,</hi> this will keepe it as a Citie of God, yea a few zealous men may doe it, Oh that you could all be as <hi>Phinehas</hi> zealous for the Lord, but if all ſhould not, the zeale of a few may doe it, ſome Aldermen if all will not, ſome Common Councell men if all will not, a conſiderable number will prevaile with God, yea who knowes, how far the zeale of one man may prevaile, therefore goe on in it to the utmoſt, without any ſelf-ſeeking; Let offices goe, let wife and children goe, let eſtate goe, be wholly for the Lord and ſay, What may I doe? wherein may I be imployed and laid out? what is there in my head or heart, in my ſoule or body, in my treaſury, ſhop or houſe, which may be of any uſe for the Lord? moſt gladly will I ſpend and be ſpent, for ſuch a God, in ſuch a cauſe; for ſuch an end; verily ſuch a frame of heart is invaluable, verily ſuch a man to the State is more worth then his weight in Gold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhall we get it? what <hi>Prometheus</hi> may wee ſend to heaven to fetch downe this ſacred fire? <note place="margin">Meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it. 1 King 8. Act. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is true, that from heaven, and from heaven alone it muſt be fetched, and thence wee may fetch it as <hi>Eliah</hi> did his fire, by <hi>prayer.</hi> When <hi>Solomon</hi> prayed, the Temple was filled with ſmoake: and the Apoſtles men of like infirmities to us, while they were praying were baptized with this fire; ſo let us pray for this holy heate, and that God who breathed our ſoules into our bodies will breath this grace into our ſoule, prayer and zeale mutually produce one another, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Ice doe: God hath promiſed to give his Spirit (whoſe onely worke this is) to them who aske it, the meditation of the former mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives will provoke to pray, and the earneſt and humble prayers of faith will obtaine it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When this fire is come from heaven, wee muſt bee carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118056:25"/>
it; the fire of the Tabernacle was firſt ſent from heaven, but was nouriſhed and maintained by fewell on earth; ſo muſt wee doe, This coale muſt bee fetched onely from Gods Altar, but we muſt preſerve it with fewell, ſuch as are, <hi>reading, hearing,</hi> and <hi>meditating</hi> on <hi>Gods Word;</hi> Gods Word is both fire and fewell, let it dwell in our hearts, lay it in our boſomes and it will warme and inflame us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sermons alſo are bellowes for this purpoſe, and are of great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſtirre up theſe coales; experience ſhewes us that zealous preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes zealous people, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> who are compared to men of fire walking among ſtraw made the people fervent in ſpirit who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under their Miniſtry: <hi>Deſpiſe not propheſying,</hi> and <hi>Quench not the Spirit,</hi> are joyned together, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 20. flie therefore like Doves to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 16. 20.</note> of Gods houſe, waite at Wiſedomes gate, and the ſparkes of grace will be blowne up into a flame.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Communion</hi> with ſuch as are zealous.

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, beware of ſuch things as extinguiſh zeale, ſuch as are <hi>ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting</hi> the fewell which ſhould feed it, neglecting attendance upon publicke ordinances, omitting of family and cloſet duties, or letting <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 25.</note> out our hearts after ſuch things as are meere quench-coles, as the ſtudy of ſuch things as tend <hi>not to edification in truth and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> or <hi>letting out the affections after worldly things,</hi> this <hi>outward heat</hi>
