            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst so many Writers Antient and Modern, who have added glory to the Muses, their number is few that have advanced Heroick Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; in which the Antients imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the best talents of their Muses, and like some wonderful Fabricks, had their Structures raised by the greatest Princes of this Science, which has so much elevated the esteem of its first Authors, that there has been little allow'd of merit to succeeding Poets, and does reasonably require some acknowledgement in me, in respect of my own undertaking, since it is hard for a Modern Poem of this kind to find a Reception in the world, so much devoted to the praise of precedent Writers;
<pb facs="tcp:49787:5"/>
nor can it be denyed, but that an Heroick Poem (whose perfections were task enough for the best pen of the Antients) is rendred to our age far more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be accomplished, while both the Greek and Latin Poets had the advantage of those more concise and sublime Languages, to maintain the glory of their Epick works, (which above all kinds of writing disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the power and weight of a tongue) besides they had no small helps by introducing their Gods and Goddesses, whereby they could vary their Dialogues and Descriptions whensoever they wanted other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But this sacred Priviledge allowed to the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Poets, (when the Muses were a part of their Divinity) will hardly give a like concession to us, who are Subjects to Heaven by different Letters-Patents, to which purpose, as I have avoided in my Poem any fabulous converse of that kind, so have I not introduced any practice of Christian Religion (not but the times of which I write may be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unprincipled enough to allow it) But rather taken for my <hi>Brittish</hi> Heroes a Religion from the results of nature, as more proper to Poesie; and which in point of morality, might not be ungrateful to the Reader of whatsoever perswasion.</p>
            <p>The worth of Heroick Poesie is so well known to the Judicious, that it may seem impertinent in me to give any argument for its esteem; yet since I have made it the subject of my pen, I will presume to say
<pb facs="tcp:49787:5"/>
something of its excellency in general; as one that, beholding some antient famous Structure, endeavors to model in some proportion a meaner of his own: Nor did <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> (with some other of the Antients) in their Epick works shew us only the greatness of their buildings, but the state and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their contrivance, in which they erected their own Monuments to be everlasting with their Heroes, for whom they raised their glorious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, with sublime instructions of humane life, that by them, the Prince is taught greatness, the States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Prudence, the Polititian Craft, the Souldier Stratagem, the Philosopher Ethicks (with other high reflections on that excellent Science,) the Lover nobleness of passion from the bright flames of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassus,</hi> and even the Gold of nature universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd in the Poets Mint, from whose vast treasure of thoughts, and actions, the most fam'd Dramaticks, drew the noble vein of Dialogue, and taught the Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to renown the Stage, while from the glory of Epike Contrivance and Action, the deepness of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue and Plot was probably first dignified: No less does it honor the famous Pencils, whose highest art is to delineate Images; from hence, and by their power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful imaginations, express representations of all passions of the mind, with other noble endowments of nature from those poetical figures of glory. Thus much concerning the excellency of this Subject in general.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49787:6"/>
And now to pay a due esteem to such Poets of our own Country, who are justly dignified by the Heroick Muse, of whom though the Catalogue be small (and <hi>Rome</hi> the once Mistress of Arms and Wit, scarcely numbers Three that are allowed the honor of Enrollment, though she make her claim from the glory of <hi>Virgil, Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Statius)</hi> yet have these our Native Poets deservedly merited esteem, perhaps above those any other Nation has produced in the times they lived; and of these the most considerable, I think may be granted our famous <hi>Spencer,</hi> and the late Sir <hi>William Davenant,</hi> (not considering <hi>Daniel, Drayton,</hi> and the like, rather Historians than Epicke Poets) the first of whom is by many granted a Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to most of the Antients, whose Genius was in all degrees proportion'd for the work he accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or for whatsoever structures his Muse had thought fit to raise, whose thoughts were like so many nerves and sinews ready with due motion and strength to actuate the body he produced; nor was the success of his Poem less worthy of Admiration, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it be frequent in words of obsolete sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, had the good fortune to have a Reception suitable to its desert, which tells us the age he writ in, had a value for sense above words, though perhaps he may have received deservedly some censure in that particular, since our Language (when he writ) was held much improved, that it has been the wonder as
<pb facs="tcp:49787:6"/>
well as pity of some, that so famous a Poet should so much obscure the glory of his thoughts, wrapt up in words and expressions, which time and use had well nigh exploded: And though words serve our uses but like Counters or numbers to summe our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Products, yet they must be currant as the money of the Age, or they will hardly pass: Nor is it less ridiculous to see a man confidently walk in the antiquated and mothy Garments of his Predecessors, out of an obstinate contempt of the present Mode, than to imitate the expressions of obsolete Authors, which renders even Wit barbarous, and looks like some affront to the present Age, which expects from Writers due esteem of the tongue they speak. But this objection which I have presumed to mention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Renowned <hi>Spencer,</hi> (though it be a Common one, and the most is laid to his charge,) shews us that his building was rather mighty than curious, and like the Pyramids of Egypt, may expect to be a long Companion of times.</p>
            <p>His next most remarkable Successor in the Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Way, I suppose there are few will deny the late Sir <hi>William Davenant</hi> a merit I judge he may claim in his work of <hi>Gondibert,</hi> in which there are many remote and excellent thoughts, with apt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous expressions, the essential dignities of the Muses, whose chiefest beauties flow from the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of words, and delightful variety of imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:49787:7"/>
from which choice productions of nature, the Muses are most desirous to adopt their Children, and in no small degree are justly acknowledged to the honor of his pen: Notwithstanding which, his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Poem of <hi>Gondibert</hi> (coming into the world in a capricious time of censure) perhaps did not meet with a deserved reception, though the severest of his Judges, I doubt not are forced to grant, that there is in that work more to be praised than pardoned. I wish I could affirm as much of what I have now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. To compare the excellencies of these two Authors were not convenient in this place, since it would be little advantage to either, their works being of different natures; besides it must joyn some censure to their applause, or the Criticks, and Censorious, will not think themselves righted, if their objections pass unmentioned, who have somewhat broader eyes, to perceive the errors and mistakes of Writers, than to behold any thing which deserves their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The truth is, the latter more obliged the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his Country than the former, who either out of affected singularity, or thinking it fit to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the Dialects of ages past, seemed so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to them, as if he would be an example against all that should innovate words that had not an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient tradition from our tongue: Nor do I think it would easily be resolved if put to the test, whether it had not more commendably spoke our diligence, if our
<pb facs="tcp:49787:7"/>
native words &amp; Dialects, had been better cultivated for use than a perpetual transplanting so many from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign soils, while the state of our language seems not unlike a greedy kind of prodigality, which contracts variety of debts to make a large purchase, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering he ruines in the mean time his antient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.</p>
            <p>I know there are many amongst us who allow much to the improving of wit from the enlarging of our tongue, as if there were a Reciprocation in both; and for the same reason must judge we are alwayes on the mending hand, since we are still like to continue, introducing of words. But when shall wit and its Refiner Language after this rate receive their ultimate perfection, since as <hi>Horace</hi> sayes
<q>
                  <l>Si meliora dies ut vina poemata reddat,</l>
                  <l>Scire velim pretium Chartis quetus arroget annus.</l>
               </q>
But neither these eminent persons, nor any other of our own Writers, whose pens might doubtless have winged their Muses to their higest pitch of Heroick glory, have handled this Subject; or for the honor of our Nation, laid the Scene at home after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who brought his <hi>Aeneas</hi> from <hi>Troy</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and there made him encounter as famous Heroes as that Story could relate, though written by the immortal pen of <hi>Homer,</hi> while our antient
<pb facs="tcp:49787:8"/>
and often Revolution of State, with the darkness of Story, (the best time for a Poet to kindle his flame) gives as much happy occasion to feign, and for the dignity of the Muses, to render truth (were it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) more considerable from fiction, as is to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd from any other in the World: <hi>I</hi> shall onely presume to give this reason for my design in model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this Poem, which <hi>I</hi> have some cause to expect will not be less grateful, since the foundation is laid with our own Materials, and rais'd at home, though it be a Work I could wish had been perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above my abilities. The time I have pitched on, is near upon the departure of the <hi>Romans</hi> out of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany;</hi> An Age, that certainly rendred this Countrey famous in Warr, which cannot reasonably be doubted from their Conflicts five hundred years, with so formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable an Enemy as <hi>Rome;</hi> Nor less acquainted with their best Moralls, which from the repute of so great an Empire, gave Discipline to the World in Manners, as well as Armes: And, could not but add much to the Civilizing of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> a People they had so long been acquainted with, and by them nobly sought: To which purpose the famous Historian, <hi>Cornclius Tacitus,</hi> who Wrote in the time of <hi>Domitian,</hi> speaks them to have received the Habits, Manners, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Romans.</hi> And though Histories are too silent of the Glorious Actions of our Predecessors; yet the deep Scratches on our Countreys Face, from
<pb facs="tcp:49787:8"/>
those numerous Relicks of Camps and Fortifications, at this day beheld, speak enough, without other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, the famous encounters of our Ancestors: For this reason the <hi>Reader</hi> must be so ingenious, as not to look upon my Poem as a <hi>History,</hi> but rather hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self obliged to my Muse, that has provided Heroes, and Princes, who, for ought he knowes, had then a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or, from a reasonable Concession, might be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have. Their Representations likewise, in point of Government in my <hi>Poem,</hi> I conceive not unnatural, to what was then practised, in this Isle, which is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by all Historians, to have had several Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the wisdome of whose Princes, could not but unite them, against their Common Enemy, whensoe'r their Concerne requires it, of which we have Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Story: And, whereas I have raised a Son to the most famous King <hi>Arthur,</hi> in my Character of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bianus,</hi> not known to our Histories. I may say thus much in behalfe of my Muses Records; That, since so little, and that darkely, is discover'd to us from Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of that Heroick Prince, or the certain time of his Raign, it is possible the being of so glorious a Son, (though true) may be at this day (with other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of him) equally unknown. While this Island, receiving so many Alterations in State, from <hi>Romans, Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans;</hi> who, with the Ruines of Warr, have been even fatal to the very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of our Predecessors, by almost a total suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

of our most antient Records (as if it had been the sole ambition of their Power and Success, to make Posterity believe they had a being from their Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, have ecclipsed, with those Presidents of Fame, the High Renown of Royal <hi>Arthur;</hi> whose Deeds Authors are forced to deliver but as their best Fables. For the Character of <hi>Vortiger,</hi> our Stories of this Age (though very obscure and imperfect) mention him a Prince of this Nation; and possibly I have taken his Figure, more resembling what he truely was, or ought to be supposed, than had I endeavoured to produce his Life (as it stands imperfectly framed in Story) which considering the difference of Writers in the occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that Age, must render much of the Truth they pretend to deliver, little better than mistake or ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>As to the Queen, whom I mention by the name of <hi>Bonduca,</hi> the strictness of some may be apt to call me to an Account; because there was a <hi>Brittish</hi> Queen called <hi>Voadicia, Boadicia,</hi> or <hi>Bonduca,</hi> in the time of <hi>Nero,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Historians,</hi> which is granted to precede the Age I take for my <hi>Poem,</hi> for whose satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, I desire they will be contented to believe (as my Muse presumes to verifie) that this was another Person, though as Heroick and Glorious a Queen as the former: It being not at all impossible (since as I have already expressed) there were so few of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of those times faithfully delivered to us from <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49787:9"/>
That there is not seldome the difference of an Age, or more, in Writers, as to their times, of being in the World: But however, this to the Judicious can appear no fault, when <hi>Virgil</hi> (allow'd to be the Prince of <hi>Poets)</hi> makes <hi>Dido</hi> and his <hi>Aeneas</hi> contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, which according to the strictness of Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, could not be by some hundreds of years.</p>
            <p>For introducing the <hi>Roman</hi> Consul into my <hi>Poem,</hi> I suppose there cannot be any ground for exception, there being at that time a Consull called by the name of <hi>Aetius,</hi> or <hi>Ennius,</hi> who Commanded botli in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Brittany:</hi> And, for my Character of <hi>Alvatrix,</hi> he may well be allowed to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals Martial associate, since <hi>Gaul</hi> had not then freed it self from the Tallons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle, being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what later than <hi>Brittany</hi> discharged from that Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and consequently obliged to bear Armes in their Quarrel; which is so possible to be true, that it cannot prejudice my introducing him here: With like plausible liberty have I framed the Character of <hi>Merlinus</hi> (in imitation of our famous <hi>Merlin,</hi> supposed to be living about the age I have taken for my <hi>Poem)</hi> and the rest: But, I fear I have given the Reader a needless trouble in behalfe of my Characters, since I have little reason to doubt he will not willingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the liberty I have taken.</p>
            <p>Having thus given an account of the quality of my <hi>Poem, I</hi> cannot but give him this short one of the
<pb facs="tcp:49787:10"/>
Quantity of it, which is, that these two Books are not my intended end, as may be judged from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of my second; My Original design being to introduce our famous Progenitors the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and so Body in the end both Nations together; who, after many bloody Conflicts united themselves into one People: But, I find it is time to bid my <hi>Reader</hi> fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, though, before I part with him, I must oblige him not to misconster my sense, in what I have written concerning Religion, which, as is already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I thought most proper in a Poem, to raise meerly from the Principles of Nature: As likewise where <hi>I</hi> have expressed any thing concerning Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Practises and Priests (who originally must be supposed to be the Grand <hi>Introducers</hi> of those <hi>Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> which have so missed, and abused Mankind.) The <hi>Reader</hi> is desired to take all expressions of this kind (as they are really meant,) not against any perswasion of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and the Holy Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions appertaining to it; But, in General, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed against False, and Erroneous Worships and Beliefes; which, least there should be any impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation charged on me, or those Reflections <hi>I</hi> have made, Wrested to a contrary Sense, <hi>I</hi> could not but instance this my defence, Concluding, that as this <hi>Poem</hi> was writ for my Diversion, so it now comes to be published; having received incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Judgments of some Friends, who
<pb facs="tcp:49787:10"/>
thought it might not be unwelcome to the World, (A Motive, powerful enough, to incline my Consent;) nor did <hi>I</hi> Judge it unreasonable for me to expect it, since no less a Novelty, than any this Age hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: Yet, <hi>I</hi> am not so fond, as to believe, there is much got, from entertaining the World in Print; it being too much good Fortune, to hope, that any thing can pass so currant, as not to meet with Detraction, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, or Envy (which never want darts to wound a Merit farr Superior than I pretend to) there being few who are Candid, and truely discerning, whose Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have any sway, or not descry'd by the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Malevolent, or weaker apprehensions. But, since I have sent this Poem abroad to shift for it self, <hi>I</hi> must submit to what Reception the World will please to allow it; not doubting, but the impartially Judicious may receive no very inconsiderable satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

the morning. What is it? or, Who can tell whether it be better to have it, or be without it, especially if it be a pointed Wit? I will take my liberty to praise what I like, as well as they do to reprehend what they do not like. Your Poem, Sir, contains a well and judiciously contrived Story, full of admirable and Heroick actions, set forth in noble and perspicuous language, such as becomes the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the persons you introduce, which two things of themselves are the height of Poetry. I know, that vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of story, true, or feigned, is the thing wherewith the Reader is entertain'd most delightfully: And this also, to the smallness of the Vollume is not wanting. Yours is but one small piece, whereas the Poets that are with us, so much admir'd, have taken larger Subjects.

Do <hi>Painters,</hi> when they Paint the Face of the Earth, leave a blanck beyond what they know?

I commend your <hi>Poem</hi> for judgment, not for bulk; and am assured it will be wellcome to the World with its own confidence; though if it come forth armed with Verses and Epistles I cannot tell what to think of it. For, the great Wits will think themselves threatned, and rebel. Unusual Fortifications upon the borders car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them a suspition of Hostility. And <hi>Poets</hi> will think such Letters of Commendation a kind of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy and league, tending to usurp upon their liberty. I need say no more, but rest,</p>

                  <l>Least by his mighty love, and strength they dye.</l>
                  <l>And Age, (the Worlds Experience) made him wise,</l>
                  <l>That he declines us'd Pathes by Forrest-spies,</l>
                  <l>Frequenting shades more dark than cloudy night;</l>

Which, as this Royal presence now surrounds,</l>

                  <l>Where Nightingales did charming requiems sing,</l>

And through the wood with wondrous swiftness breaks,</l>

                  <l>Thus to th'adjoyning Lawn, does take his flight,</l>
