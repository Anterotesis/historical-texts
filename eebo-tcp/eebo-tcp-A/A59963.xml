         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>PResuming it is thy desire, to answer the holy &amp;
honourable designation I accost thee with, I shall
take the Confidence to assure thee, it is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to answer in some measure the expectation,
which the Title of this Treatise would offer; in
the hope, that, wherein I come short (as I indeed confess not
only my jealous fears, but my sensible conviction of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency
for such a great undertaking) thy Christian ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
will impute it to my weakness, and not to any want
of worth in the Cause I manage; which is truly worthy,
weighty, noble, &amp; honourable, in the esteem of all the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Christ, that have Zeal for his Honour in exercise:
And therefore as it gives me all the encouragement I have,
in dependance on his furniture, whose Cause it is, to make
such an Essay; So it animates my ambition, albeit I cannot
manage it with any proportion to its merit, yet to move the
Christian Reader to make enquiry about it, and then sure I
am he will find it is Truth I plead for, though my plea be
weak. All I shall further say by way of Preface is to declare
the Reason of the Title and the design of the work.</p>
            <p>Though Books use not to be required to render a reason
of their names, which often are arbitrarly imposed, more
for the Authors fancy, and the times fashion than for the
readers Instruction: yet, seing the times injuries do oblige
the Author to conceal his name, the Title will not obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
notify it to some, for whose satisfaction this is mainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and signify also the Scope of the subject; which
aims at <hi>giving goodly words,</hi> not suggared with Parasitick
sweetness, nor painted with affected pedantry, but fairly
brought forth in unhampered freedom, for the beauty of the
blessing of humane &amp; Christian Liberty, in its due &amp; true
boundaries. This was the subject of a discourse, as some
may remember, on that Text whence this Title is taken
<hi>Gen. 49. 21. Naphtali is a hind let loose:</hi> In prosecuting of
which, the Speaker with several others, falling at the same
time into the hands of the <hi>hunters,</hi> to learn the worth of that
interrupted subject from the experience of the want of it; an
<pb facs="tcp:41139:3"/>
occasion was given, and interpreted by the Author to be a
Call, to study more the preciousness of that priviledge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
of <hi>Naphtali,</hi> which is the right an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> property of the
wrestling Tribe of <hi>Israel,</hi> the persecuted witnesses of Christ
now every where preyed upon: And now, providence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
opened a door, for <hi>delivering himself as a roe from the hand
of the hunter,</hi> he thought it his duty, and as necessary a piece
of service as he could do to the Generation, to bring to light
his Lucubrations thereupon: With an endeavour to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
to all that are free born, and are not contented slaves
mancipated in a stupid subjection to Tyrants absoluteness;
that, this Character of <hi>Naphtali, satisfied with favour and full
with the blessing of the Lord,</hi> that he is a <hi>hind let loose</hi> from the
yoke of Tyrannical slaverie, is far preferable, in the account
of all that understand to be Christians or men, to that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Stigma of <hi>Issachar</hi> (the sin, shame, &amp; miserie of this age)
to be <hi>a strong Ass couching under two burdens, and he saw that rest
was good, and the Land that it was pleasant, and bowed his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.</hi> But to all that are
not altogether strangers in <hi>our Israel</hi> it will appear, that this
Title is not ineptly applied to the subject and design of this
Treatise. The party, whose Case and Cause and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
are here treated of, being known to have the same
situation of residence in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that <hi>Naphtali</hi> had in <hi>Israel,</hi>
viz. <hi>the West and the South (Deut.</hi> 33. 23.) will be found,
among all our <hi>Tribes,</hi> most appositely to bear the signature
of <hi>Naphtali,</hi> who, in their <hi>wrestlings</hi> for the Interest of Christ
and the Liberties of his <hi>Israel,</hi> have mostly <hi>jeoparded their lives
in the high places of the fields;</hi> and chiefly to deserve his Elogy,
being <hi>a hind</hi> (called <hi>wild</hi> by nick-name in the scorn of them
that are at ease, but) truly <hi>weak</hi> in their present wilderness
Condition, to <hi>wrestle</hi> against the force &amp; fraud of their Cruel
&amp; cunning <hi>hunters,</hi> who cease not (when they have now got
the rest of the <hi>Roes and hinds of the field</hi> made fast asleep, under
the bondage of the <hi>Lions dens &amp; Mountains of Leopards,</hi> by a
pretence of a falsely so called <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi>) to seek
and pursue the chase of them for a prey; Yet, really they are
<hi>let loose,</hi> and not only suffered to run loose, as a prey to the
hunters by the unwatchfullness of their keepers, but made
to escape loose, by the mercy of the <hi>Mighty one of Iacob,</hi> from
<pb facs="tcp:41139:3"/>
the nets of the hunters, and snares of the foulers, and from
the yoke of the bondage of these beasts of prey, to whose
<hi>Authority</hi> they will not <hi>oune</hi> a willing subjection: And being
such <hi>hinds,</hi> so <hi>let loose,</hi> they make it their work, to <hi>give goodly
words,</hi> for the worth and honour and Royalties of their
Princely Master, and for the precious Liberties wherewith
he hath endoted and entrusted his Spouse and Children, and
to keep the <hi>goodly words</hi> of his patience, untill he return <hi>as a
Roe or a young Hart upon the Mountains of</hi> Bether. This being
the party, who are represented as the Wild folk of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
the design of this Treatise is to hold forth the History of their
manifold <hi>Chases,</hi> the Craft, keenness, &amp; Cruelty of their
<hi>hunters,</hi> and the <hi>goodlyness</hi> of the <hi>words</hi> of their <hi>Testimony:</hi>
Which, by reason of the likeness of the Testimony of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Periods with the present, and that the latter may be
vindicated by the former, is resumed from the beginning of
the Church of Scotlands wrestlings against the Enemies of
Christ, and deduced through all the most signal steps of this
long propagated and hereditary War. And lest my <hi>words</hi>
should not be <hi>goodly</hi> enough, nor my notions grateful to the
Criticks of this age, who cast every thing as new and nice,
which is someway singular and not suited to their senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
that it may appear the Cause here cleared and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
is not of yesterday, but older than their Grandfathers
who oppose it, I dare avouch without vanity, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
here but what is confirmed by Authors of greatest note
&amp; repute in our Church, both ancient &amp; modern, namely,
<hi>Buchanan, Knox, Calderwood, Acts of General Assemblies, Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Wrath, Lex Rex, Apologetical Relation, Napthali, Ius Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli,
History of the Indulgence, Banders disbanded, Rectius In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struendum,</hi>
and some other Authors much respected: whose
Authority, more alwayes repelled by rage than ever yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by reason, though I value more, than all the vain
oblatrations of the Opposers of this Testimony, and think
it sufficient to confute all imputations of its Novelty, and
to counterballance the weight that may be laid on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
of the greatest that treat on this subject: Yet I do
not lay so much stress on the reason of their Authority, as
on the Authority of their reason; which is here represented
with that Candor and Care, that, lest any should cavil that
<pb facs="tcp:41139:4"/>
they are wrested or wronged, when made to speak so patly
to the present Controversies, I have chosen rather to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
their words, than to borrow their matter dressed up
in my own; except where the prolixity &amp; multiplicity of
their Arguments, as clearly demonstrating that which I
adduce them for as that for which they were primarly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
did impose the necessity of abridging them; which
yet is mostly in their oun words, though reduced into a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logistical
forme. But this obloquie of Novelty being antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
when I reflect on the helps I have collected from so
many hands, I am rather afraid, the Truths here delivered
be comtemned as obsolete and antiquate, than cast at for
new speculations. However I am content, yea it is my am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
that nothing here be looked upon as mine, but that
it may appear, this is an old Plea; and that the party here
pleaded for, who are stigmatized with many singularities,
are a people, who <hi>ask the old paths and the good way, that they
may walk therein;</hi> and though their paths be not now much
paved, by the frequency of passengers, and multitude of
Professors walking therein; and albeit it must indeed be
confessed, the word of their Testimony is some way singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
that the same things were never the word of Christs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
stated as heads of suffering before; yet they are not
untroden paths, but the same way of Truth, which hath
been maintained by the witnesses of Christ in all the Periods
of our Church, and asserted by the greatest Confessors,
though never before sealed by Martyrs. As for the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I bring to clear &amp; confirm them, whether they be
accounted mine or borrowed from others, I am very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
if they prove the point they are brought for, which
I hope they will be sound to do: But of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> am confident,
there is nothing here can be condemned, untill some one or
more of those grave Authors be confuted, and when that is
done (which will be <hi>ad Calendas Graecas,</hi> or against the 30.
of February) there is something besides here which will
challenge Consideration.</p>
            <p>The design then of this work is of great importance: even
no less than to essay, the discussing the difficulties of all our
Conflicts with open Enemies, about the present state of
the Testimony; the vindicating of all the heads of sufferings
<pb facs="tcp:41139:4"/>
sustained thereupon, these 27 years past; the proposing of
the right state of the Testimony for the Interest of Christ,
not only of this but of all former Periods; with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the propagation &amp; prosecution of the witnessings,
wrestlings, and sufferings for it from time to time; to the
end it may appear, not only how great the sufferings have
been, since this fatal Catastrophe and overturning of the
Covenanted Reformation, and unhappie restauration of
Tyrannie and Prelacie; but that the grounds, upon which
they have been stated, are not niceties and novelties (as they
are reproached and reputed by many) but worthie and
weighty Truths of great value and validity, and of near affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
unto &amp; Conformity with the continued series and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Testimonies in all former Periods. So that in
this litle Treatise must be contained, a Compendious Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> her Testimony in all ages, a
vindication of the present state of it, yea in effect a short
Epitome of the substance of those famous forecited Authors,
as far as we need to consult them concerning the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
of the present time with Adversaries: Which is
much, and perhaps too much, to be undertaken in so small
a volume. But considering, that many who are concerned
in this Cause, yea the most part who concern themselves
about it, are such who have neither access nor time nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
to revolve the voluminous Labours of these Learned
men, for light in this Case; I have done my best, to bring
them into one body of a portable bulk, with as great brevity
as could consist well with any measure of perspicuity; Not
medling with any thing, but what I thought might some
way conduce to clear some part of the present Testimony.</p>
            <p>Every undertaking of this nature, cannot but be lyable to
several disadvantages that are unavoidable, this hath many
discouraging and difficult. <hi>One</hi> is, that it shall be exposed to
the Common fate of such representations, to be stigmatized
as a seditious Libel, and so may be sent to the flames to be
confuted; and to enflame the fury of these firebrands, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
hell-hot, into the utmost extremity of rage against the
Author, that ever Cruelty it self at its fullest freedom did
exert, against Truth and reason arraigned and cast for Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Treason: The only Sanctuary in such a Case is, in
<pb facs="tcp:41139:5"/>
prospect of this, to have the greater care, that nothing be
spoken, but what the Speaker may dare to affirm in the face
of Cruelty it self. A <hi>Second</hi> common disadvantage is obvious
from the Consideration of the humor of the Age, wherein
fancy hath greater force than faith, and nothing is pleasing
but what is parasitical, or attempered to the palat of the
Greatest not of the best; And naked Truth, without the
fairdings of flatterie, or paintings of that pâkiness which is
commonly applauded as prudence now adayes, is either
bogled at or exposed to scorn &amp; Contempt; and reason, if
roundly written, except it meet with an honest heart, is
commonly read with a stammering mouth, which puts a T
before it, and then it is stumbled at as <hi>Treason:</hi> This Essay
does expect no Entertainment from any, but such who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to harbour Truth be the hazard what will, even when
the world raises the <hi>Hue</hi> &amp; <hi>Cry</hi> after it, and from such who
are really groaning, either by suffering or Sympathie, under
the same grievances here represented. There is a <hi>Third</hi>
which makes it not a litle difficult, the quality, quantity,
&amp; intricacy of the matter, here to be confined to such a
Compend. All which together considered, do infer a <hi>fourth</hi>
difficulty, that hardly can it get a <hi>pass</hi> through the <hi>Press;</hi>
which is blocked up against all such books, that may offer a
manifestation of the innocency of that people, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
&amp; inhumanity of their enemies; which is their only
hope of preventing the worlds knowledge &amp; condemnation
of their actings. Yea there is <hi>a fifth,</hi> that wants not its own
difficulty, that though the <hi>Press</hi> were patent, yet an empty
<hi>Purse,</hi> from a poor impoverished people, will as readily
preclude all access to it, as if it were locked up by Law; but
both together make it hard. But there is a <hi>sixth</hi> disadvantage
yet more discouraging, that the <hi>man</hi> as well as the <hi>money</hi> is
wanting to manage the business: And this needs no other
proof, than the necessity of my poor pen to undertake it,
instead of a better. It must needs be very low with that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that stand in need of such a pitiful patrociny as mine is.
Our persecuted brethren elsewhere, have this advantage of
us, that they have Champions to espouse their quarrel,
which we have not; but only such, who, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
in the world, so in their own sense, owne themselves
<pb facs="tcp:41139:5"/>
to be very unaccomplished for such work; and under this
invincible disadvantage also, that, being forced to a wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and unsetled life, they have no conveniency, nor can
be accommodated with time nor helps to performe it; and
so circumstantiated, that either it must be done at this time,
and in this manner, or not at all. In the <hi>seventh</hi> place, we
are at a greater loss than any suffering people, in that among
all other bitter ingredients we have this Gall also in our
Cup, that they that suffer most among us have not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
&amp; benefit of the Sympathie of others, that sufferers use
to have from good people. The reason of this makes an
<hi>Eight</hi> discouragement, besides what is said above; that not
only is the Case &amp; Cause of that poor persecuted &amp; wasted
Witnessing Remnant obscure in it self, and not known in
the world, nay not so much as in the very neighbouring
Churches of <hi>England &amp; Ireland;</hi> but also more obscured by
the malice of Enemies, traducing, calumniating, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
that righteous Remnant whom they intend to
ruine; not indeed as Hereticks (which is the case of other
suffering Churches, wherein they have the advantage of us
also, that thô the name be more odious, yet it makes the
notion of their Cause and the nature of their enemies more
notour, and is more effectual to conciliate Sympathie from
all that know, that Protestants are persecuted by Papists
under the notion of Hereticks; But we are at a loss in this,
that our Persecuters, at least the most part of the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Persecution, will not as yet avouch that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testanism
is Heresie, though we want not this Nick-name
likewise from the Chief of them, that are professed Papists)
but as <hi>Schismaticks, Seditious, Rebells, Traitors, Murderers, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Principles inconsistent with Government</hi> (to wit, their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny)
and <hi>the peace of humane Society</hi> (to wit, their Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against Religion and liberty) and therefore to be exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
out of the world. And this Imposture covering all
their mischiefs, hath prevailed so far with the blinded world,
that under this brand the Consideration of their Case &amp;
Cause is buried, without farther inquirie. This were yet
more tolerable from open enemies; if there were not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more pressing discouragement in the <hi>Ninth</hi> place, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to them in <hi>Scotland;</hi> that having to do with treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb facs="tcp:41139:6"/>
as well as Truculent Enemies, as they have been much
destroyed by open force, so much more by fraud: while by
ensnaring favours some have been flattered from the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
others disdaining &amp; suspecting, as well as deprived
of and secluded from, these favours, have s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uck to it; hence
Defection brought on Division, and Division Confusion,
which hath reduced the Reformation to a ruinous heap. In
the <hi>next</hi> place, as the Consequent of the former, while the
purer Remnant have been resolutely prosecuting the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and not only keeping themselves free of, and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the surthest distance from, all degrees of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance,
but also witnessing against their Brethren involved
in them, and thinking it their duty to discountenance them
in these Corruptions &amp; backslidings; they have been there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reproached and misrepresented very industriously, as
<hi>Ignorant, imprudent, transported with blind Zeal, Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
wild, Separatists, espousing new &amp; nice notions, Rejecters
of the Ministry, Imposers on the Ministry, Denyers of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
Usurpers of an imaginary Government of their oun, that
died as fools, and as guilty of their oun blood.</hi> By which odious
&amp; invidious obloquies, they have easily prevailed with many,
both at home &amp; abroad, that are more credulous than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate,
to beleeve these things of them: Hence, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate
people a contrary Representation will find difficult
acceptance. However this <hi>Moreover</hi> is another great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and renders an Essay to vindicate their sufferings
very uneasie, that they are thrust at &amp; tosted on both hands,
by Enemies &amp; professed friends: And by Enemies, that are
not all <hi>Papists:</hi> but professed <hi>Protestants,</hi> ouning the same
fundamentalls in opinion, though in practice not holding
the same Head: And by friends, that not only are <hi>Protestants,</hi>
but <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> under the bonds of the same Solemn &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<hi>Covenants,</hi> the obligation whereof they still oune; And
not only so, but such, whose Piety &amp; Godliness cannot be
doubted. This is a <hi>Gravamen</hi> grievous to bear, &amp; greatly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates
the difficultie. <hi>Finally,</hi> the greatest of all is, that not
only their Cause is rendered <hi>odious,</hi> but must be confessed
truly to be <hi>odd</hi> &amp; someway <hi>singular;</hi> and therefore will seem
strange &amp; surprising to Strangers, to hear an account of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
sufferings for &amp; upon extraordinary Causes,
<pb facs="tcp:41139:6"/>
which never were formerly stated as heads of suffering. For
now it is the Dragons chiefest stratagem with us, like to be
the most subtil, ensnaring, &amp; successful of any, that ever
he set on work since ever he began this War with the Lamb,
(which yet I hope will prove as fatal to his Interest as the
former) to bring the sufferings of Christs witnesses to such
a state, that may seem to spectators litle or nothing relative
to Religion, that so he may destroy both them and their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
unlamented, and by that Trick divert others from
concerting that same necessary witness in the season thereof.
And for this end he will change both matter &amp; manner, in
managing the War. He will not now persecute for the old
Controverted heads of Poperie, with fire &amp; faggot as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
for refusing to <hi>worship Our Lady,</hi> or the <hi>blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Altar.</hi> These weapons &amp; Engines are so worn
out of use, that they will not work now as they did before.
And that old Baud of <hi>Babylon</hi> is become so ugly and out of
date, that he does not believe her beauty can be so bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
except she put on a new busk. But her Eldest Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the <hi>Prelatical Church,</hi> of the same Complexion with her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
except that she is coloured with <hi>Protestant</hi> paint, is fitter
for his service, to allure our Land into fornication; And
who will not be entyced, must be forced to Communion
with her, by finings, confynings, exactions, extortions,
&amp; impositions of Oaths &amp;c. Religion must be litle concerned
here: for there is Preaching enough, and of Protestant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
too, and without the Monkie-Tricks, &amp; Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank
showes, &amp; fopperies of <hi>English-Popish Ceremonies,</hi> &amp;
Lyturgical services: What would they be at? Is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to yeeld to this, than to fall into the hand of the <hi>Scotish-Spanish-Inquisition,</hi>
that will rack the Purse, the Body, &amp;
Conscience, and all? This is one Complex head of suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and thought a very small one by many. But now find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this would not do his business yet, it looked too like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
still: He hath therefore invented a new Machin: He
will not now Persecute, nor force the Conscience at all (so
good natur'd is the Devil and his Lievetenant grown, in
their old age) for <hi>matters of meer Religion.</hi> Nay (if we may
believe him, who when he speaketh a lie speaketh it of his
own) he hath not done it this long time, but only, in all the
<pb facs="tcp:41139:7"/>
violent Courses exercised against these Sufferers, he hath
been Magistratically chastising the disobedience &amp; rebellion,
of a few turbulent Traitors, who would not oune the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
And thus under the notion of Rebellion, &amp;
disouning Authority, he hath had access &amp; success to destroy
almost an innumerable number of honest &amp; innocent, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
&amp; fruitful, lovers of Christ; who though indeed they
have had their sufferings stated upon those points, yet I
doubt not shall be found among the followers of the Lamb,
and Confessors and Martyrs of Christ, who haue overcome
by the blood of the Lamb &amp; the word of their Testimony,
not loving their lives unto the Death, whose blood is crying
for vengeance against the shedders thereof, And He will
make inquisition for it, when He comes to <hi>overturn, overturn,</hi>
&amp; take His own <hi>right,</hi> for which they have been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending.
Nevertheless this is a prejudice too prevalent with
many, to misregard the Case &amp; Cause of these Contenders,
or any thing that can be said to represent them favourablie.
And all these disadvantages, difficulties, &amp; discouragements
together considered, would soon cool my Courage, and
at first blush make me leave off before I begin, were I not
persuaded that it is the Cause of Christ these reproached
people are suffering for, and that their great sufferings &amp;
reproaches are both alike unjust, from both which the Lord
vvill vindicate them, &amp; bring forth their righteousness as
the light &amp; their judgment as the noon day, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n His oun time.
In confidence of vvhich, depending on his Conduct, I shall
undertake, as briefly as is possible for me, to represent their
case, and clear the Cause, so far at least as concerns their
Contest vvith their pesecuting Enemies, vvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h vvhom I only
deal at present; it not being my purpose to descend particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
into their necessitated Contendings vvith Complying
Brethren, partly because they vvould make the volume to
excresce unto too great a bulk, &amp; because they are to be
seen elsevvhere; yet in effect these also are not only here
narratively deduced, but vvhatever is odious in them is vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,
&amp; vvhat is difficult in some measure enodated.</p>
            <p>But it may be expected and desiderated, that I should give
a distinct deduction of all the Steps of this woful defection,
against which a great part of the Testimony hath been stated:
<pb facs="tcp:41139:7"/>
but I would have the Reader advertised, I touch only that
part of the Testimony which hath been sealed by severe suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
from enemies. It were a Task transcending my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
and a Theme wherein I have no pleasure, besides
that it is inconsistent with my Leasure, to inlarge upon such
a sad and shameful subject: Though the world indeed is at a
loss, that they that would do it cannot, and they that
would &amp; should do it will not; And it is a greater loss, not
only to <hi>Scotland,</hi> but also to the whole Christian world, that
what hath been done in this kind already cannot see the light,
or rather that the Church of Christ is deprived of its light,
which through the injury of the times, &amp; the disingenuous
Prudence of some, who suffer themselves to be imposed
upon by the Patrons of Defection, is embezilled &amp; suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
I mean that excellent &amp; faithful <hi>History of Defection,</hi> the
posthumous work of famous <hi>Mr. M'ward,</hi> whose praise is
in the Churches: which if they that have it in keeping, would
do themselves the honour, and the world the happiness, of
publishing it, there would be no more need to discover, from
whence, to what, and how, that Church hath fallen &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate;
nor so great dissicultie in that indisputable &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable
duty that such a day calls for, in searching &amp;
trying our wayes to the end we may turn again to the Lord;
Nor any necessity for my poor essay, to invite &amp; incite the
people of the lord to take Cognizance &amp; Compassion of
poor perishing <hi>Scotland.</hi> I wish that they who have it, may
consult more their oun duty and credit, and what they owe
to the memory of the dead, the Churches edification, the
dayes Testimony, and the honour of Christ, than to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
robbing the world of such a Treasure; wich I doubt not
to call Treason against Christ, &amp; Sacriledge against the
Church, &amp; stick not to tell them, if they will not publish it,
the world must knovv there was such a thing done. But it
not being my design now, to detect or reflect upon all the
defections of that declining, &amp; by declensions divided, &amp;
by divisions almost (only not) destroyed Church; I shall
medle with them no further, than what is necessary to clear
the cause; refering the knowledge and account of them,
either to the Notoriety of the grossest of them, or to the
more particular enarration of them, to be found in papers
<pb facs="tcp:41139:8"/>
emitted &amp; published by the Contenders against them: Of
vvhich one is of this same years edition, entituled, <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatory
vindication of a poor, wasted, misrepresented Remnant,
&amp;c.</hi> In vvhich may be evident, that notvvithstanding of all
this darkness &amp; distress, defection &amp; division, under vvhich
the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath been so long &amp; is still labouring,
there is yet a poor vvasted, vvounded, rent &amp; almost rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but still vvrestling &amp; vvitnessing Remnant, of Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
&amp; Confessors of Christ there, vvho though they have
not only had their soulls exceedingly filled vvith the scorning
of those that are at ease &amp; vvith the contempt of the proud,
but their bodies also killed all day long and counted as sheep
for the slaughter, have yet through grace endeavoured to
overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the vvord of their
Testimony, &amp; have not loved their lives dear unto the death,
&amp; have continued to this day contending both against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Enemies, &amp; also declining friends, sustaining from
both the utmost of rage &amp; reproach. And since that litle
book gives an account, vvhat their Conten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ings have been
against their backdravving brethren on the right &amp; left hand,
I shall spare labour to offer a discussion of them, only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make it not difficult to decide &amp; determine, on
vvhose side Truth lies, by vvhat is here hinted.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude, vvith advertising the Reader of one thing
further; that, as this Reproached people, for vvhose Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
I am pleading, is novv the only party that is persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>Scotland</hi> (some fevv excepted; vvho are exempted
from the pretended favour of the current Indemnities) &amp;
their persecution still continues, notvvithstanding of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
as wel as insnaring Declarations of Universal Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to all Dissenters, vvhich they look upon as their honour
&amp; happiness, to be thought incapable of Tyrannical &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
favours; So their past &amp; present oppressions &amp;
sufferings are only here in general agregated described as to
their kinds, &amp; vindicated as to their causes: the particular
deduction of their number, vveight, &amp; measure; of their
names that have been martyred &amp; murdered, both by forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Lavv &amp; vvithout all formality of Lavv, by Sea &amp;
Land, City &amp; Countrey, on Scaffolds &amp; in the fields; of the
manner of their sufferings; &amp; of the forme of their Trialls &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:41139:8"/>
Testimonies, being intended shortly (if the Lord vvill) to
be emitted &amp; published in a book by it self; vvhich vvil disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the vvorld as rare instances of the injustice, illegali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp; inhumanity of the <hi>Scotish Inquisition,</hi> &amp; of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
zeal, ingenuity, &amp; patience of the vvitnesses of
Christ, as readily can be instanced in these latter ages. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here is a taste till more come: vvhich if the Lord shall
bless for its designed end, the Glory of God, the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Truth, the information &amp; satisfaction of all Serious
Sympathisers vvith <hi>Zions</hi> sorrovves, &amp; the Conviction or
Confutation of Reproachers, so far at least as to make them
surcease from their invidious charges of things vvhereof the
innocency is here vindicated, I have obtained all my design,
&amp; shall desire to give the Lord the praise.</p>

Powers of Hell, the Principalities of Earth, &amp; the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Heaven, overruling all things for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
or the Divine purpose, &amp; purchase, &amp; prediction,
seem to conspire to produce that prodigious Period, and
<hi>ultimus Conatus</hi> of the Churches Enemie. And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
is so far advanced, that, now in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Europe,</hi> either the Witnesses of Christ are <hi>a killing,</hi>
or the witness for Christ is in a great measure <hi>killed;</hi> either
the followers of the Lamb, who are cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

faithful, are <hi>killed</hi> for their Testimony, or fainting in their
Zeal, and falling from their first Love, they are cooled or
cajoled from their Testimony. Some are indulging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their ease, settleing on their Lees, &amp; sleeping in
a stupid security; And, while the Lord is roaring from
above, &amp; His &amp; their Enemies raging about them, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
to raze them after they have ruined their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
they are rotting away under the destructive Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of detestable Neutrality, loathsom lul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>warmness, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
&amp; decaying in Corruptions, defections, divisions,
distractions, confusions, &amp; so judicially infatuated with
darkness &amp; delusions, that they forget &amp; forgo the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Testimony of the day. Others again, outwearied with
the length &amp; weight of the Tryal, under the tentation of
Antichrists formidable strength on the one hand, &amp; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
prospect of an insnaring Liberty on the other, are
overcome either to be hectored or flattered from their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony.
And so in these Churches, comprehending all
that are free from Persecution at this time, the Witness for
Christ is in a great measure killed. Other Churches, which
are keeping &amp; contending for the word of Christs patience,
are so wasted. &amp; almost worn out, with Persecutions,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41139:10"/>
afflictions, &amp; calamities, that, after they have been &amp; are
(so much) daylie killed for the Word of God, &amp; the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Jesus, it may well be said, there hath been &amp; is a
great slaughter of the Witnesses. And it were hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
which of them can give the largest &amp; most lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
account of their sufferings, or which of them have
had the greatest &amp; most grievous experiences, of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
&amp; Truculency, Violence &amp; Villanie, of Atheistical
&amp; Papistical Enemies: whether the Reformed Church of
<hi>France,</hi> howling under the paw of that devouring Lyon, the
<hi>French</hi> Tyrant; or the Protestants of <hi>Hungary,</hi> under the
tearing Clawes of that ravenous Eagle the Tyrant of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria;</hi>
or those of <hi>Piedemont,</hi> under the grassant Tyranny of
that litle Ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the reports they bring with them in their flight from their
respective Countreyes, &amp; the litle Hints we have in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zetts</hi>
&amp; News Letters, must needs enforce a conviction, if
not extort a Compassion, of the greatness of their pressures;
&amp; that with such a parity, that it is doubtful which prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derats.
I shall not make comparisons, nor aggravate nor
extenuate the sufferings of any of the Churches of Christ,
beyond or below their due measures: But will presume to
plead, that <hi>Scotland,</hi> another Ancient &amp; sometimes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Reformed Church, be enrolled in the Catalogue of
suffering Churches, besides these mentioned; and crave,
that she may have a share of that Charity &amp; Sympathy,
which is the demand &amp; desire of afflicted Churches of
Christ, from all the fellow members of that same body:
And so much the rather is this her due; that, whereas
among all the rest of the Churches, Christs witnesses are
killed in some particular respect, &amp; each of them have their
own proper complaint of it; some upon the account of
Persecution, some of defection, division &amp;c. Of this it
may be said, in all respects, both the witnesses of Christ,
and a witness for Christ, are killed with a witness. This is
the Case of the sometimes Renouned, famous, faithful,
&amp; fruitful, Reformed, Covenanted Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
famous for unity, faithful for verity, fruitful in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, &amp; Government;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41139:11"/>
which now, for these 27 years past, under the Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the late Tyrant &amp; present Usurper of <hi>Brittain,</hi> hath
been so wasted with oppression, wounded with Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
rent with Division, ruined with defection, that now
she is as much despised, as she was before admired: And
her Witness &amp; Testimony for Reformation, is now as far
depressed &amp; suppressed in obscuritie as it was formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
&amp; depredicated in glory &amp; honour. And yet, which
should move the greater commiseration, her witnessings
&amp; wrestlings, Tryalls &amp; Tentations, have not been infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
in manner or measure, quality or continuance, to
any of the forementioned Churches, thô in extent not so
great, because her precinct is not so large, whereby the
number of her oppressed &amp; murdered Children could not
be so multiplyed, though her <hi>Martyrs</hi> be more, and the
manner of their Murder more illegal, than can be instanced
in any of them, during that time. A particular enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or enarration whereof, cannot be here exhibited, but
is referred &amp; reserved to a peculiar Treatise of that Subject,
which ere long the world may see. Only I shall give a
compendious account of the kinds &amp; causes, grounds and
Heads, of their sufferings, who have been most slighted
&amp; least sympathised with, though they have sustained the
greatest severities of any; and inend endeavour to vindicate
the Merit of their Cause, in the most principal heads upon
which their sufferings have been stated: Whereby it will
appear to impartial men, that will not be imposed upon,
there hath been, &amp; yet is, a great &amp; grievous, &amp; some
way uparalleled, Persecution in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at least inferiour
to none: Which hath not hitherto been culy considered,
with any proportion to the importance thereof.</p>
            <p>But thô this be the Scope, it is not the summe of what is
intended in this Discourse. The Method I have proposed
to prosecute it withall, will discover it: Which is. 1. To
give a brief &amp; summary account, of the Series &amp; Succession,
success &amp; result, of the several Contendings of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of Christ, against His Enemies in <hi>Scotland</hi> from time
to time; that it may appear; whether or not the present
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41139:11"/>
sufferings as now stated can be condemned, if the former be
approven. 2. To rehearse some of the chief means, methods,
&amp; measures, that the Popish, Prelatical, &amp; Malignant saction,
have managed, for the ruin of this witnessing Remnant,
&amp; some of the most signal steps of sufferings sustained
by &amp; from these within these 27 years; by which it will
appear, that the Persecution in <hi>Scotland</hi> hath been very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
(though litle regarded) both in respect of the
injustice, illegality, &amp; inhumanity of the Persecutors, &amp;
in respect of the innocency, Zeal, &amp; ingenuity of the
Persecuted. 3. To clear the state &amp; vindicate the merit of
the cause of their sufferings, as to the most material heads
of it, that are most controverted at this time. In the <hi>first</hi> of
these, I must study all compendious brevity, as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with the clearing of my Scope: which is not to enlarge
an Historical deduction, of the rise &amp; result, progress &amp;
prosecution, occasion &amp; continuation, of every Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
the Church hath had with her several Adversaries in
several Periods; But only to hint at the chief Heads of
their contendings, with a design to make it appear; that
the most material Heads of sufferings that are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
as new &amp; nice notions, have been transmitted
from age to age, from the beginning even to this present
time, through all the Periods of this Church.</p>

               <p>IT is not without reason reckoned among the peculiar
prerogatives of the renouned Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that
Christs conquest in the conversion of that Nation, is
one of the most eminent Accomplishments of Scripture
Prophecies, of the propagation of His Kingdom in the
New Testament Dispensation: Not only because it was,
when called out of Gentile Paganisme, among the rudest
of <hi>Heathen</hi> Nations, &amp; in the ackowledgment of all, among
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41139:12"/>
the <hi>uttermost parts of the Earth,</hi> which were given to Christ
for His inheritance &amp; possession; Whereunto He had, &amp;
hath still, undoubted right, by His Fathers grant, &amp; by
His oun purchase; and took Infeofment of it by a glorious
conquest, of that Land which the Roman Armes could
never subdue, &amp; erected His victorious Trophees there,
whither their Triumphs could never penetrate, obtaining
&amp; thereby accomplishing that predicted Song of praise,

however Christs Interest there be now very low, and like
to be lost as a prey in the Dragons Mouth, Yet Christ, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such undoubted &amp; manifold right to it, will not so easily
quit or forego His possession: But also because, He hath
so constantly continued His possession, &amp; maintained His
Title, by a long course of Contendings, by the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of His witnesses, against the Invaders thereof, through
all the Periods of the Church, from the very infancy of
this new Dispensation: And because, <hi>Scotlands</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
into the Christian Faith was among the first fruits of
the Gentiles, of the oldest date, that any standing Church
holding the head Christ this day can deduce its original
from. For it is clear from Ancient Records, the Christian
Faith was imbraced here, a few years after the Ascension
of our Saviour, being taught by the Disciples of <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Apostle; &amp; received afterwards great increment from the
<hi>Brittons,</hi> flying to <hi>Scotland</hi> to escape the Persecution of the
Emperour <hi>Domitian,</hi> &amp; was long promoted by the ancient
<hi>Culdees</hi> or <hi>Cultores Dei;</hi> men whose memory is still fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant,
for piety &amp; purity of faith &amp; life, who continued
some hundreds of years, under various vicissitudes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
before either <hi>Prelacy</hi> or <hi>Poperie</hi> was known in
<hi>Scotland.</hi> They were first universally encouraged by King
<hi>Cratilinth,</hi> in the time of the last Persecution under <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi>
which brought many of Christs witnesses hither for
Shelter, who were very helpful for the setling of Truth,
&amp; the total extirpation of the Idolatry of the <hi>Druides,</hi> the
Heathen Priests; whereby the pure Doctrine, Worship,
&amp; Government also of Christs Institution, was established
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41139:12"/>
&amp; continued many years, while these Witnesses of Christ
had no other emulation but of well doing &amp; to advance
Pietie. In this Period, these ancient &amp; first Confessors &amp;
Witnesses of Christ, did wrestle strenously, according to
their strength &amp; light, for the Truths &amp; words of Christs
patience, controverted in their day, both against professed

               <p>I. They maintained the verity of the Christian Doctrine,
against both Pagan Persecutors, &amp; Heretical perverters;
And the purity of His instituted worship, without the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of humane inventions, or conformity with, either
the <hi>Druides</hi> on the one hand, or the Hereticks on the other:
with which, sometime befor the end of that Period, they
were in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would have no communion, but abstracted themselves
in a Monastical life, liveing &amp; exercising their Religion
in Cells, from whence many places in the Countrey yet
retain the name, as <hi>Kilmarnock, Kil-Patrick</hi> &amp;c. that is the
Cells of these eminent men among the <hi>Culdees.</hi> And their
Government also, was that of the primitive order without
<hi>Bishops,</hi> with litle vanity, but great simplicity &amp; holyness.
Many Authors do testity, that near about 400 years the
Church of Scotland knew nothing of the Episcopal Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,
untill <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

opposition.</p>
               <p>II. In these Recesses, they had the advantage, both of
outward peace when others were in trouble, &amp; of inward
peace of conscience, when others were debauched with
many conjurations, &amp; abjurations, combinations &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies,
imposed &amp; exacted by them that prevailed for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41139:13"/>
the time: whereby they might both keep themselves free
of insnaring <hi>Oaths,</hi> perfidious complyances, &amp; <hi>Associations</hi>
with the wicked, &amp; also intertain &amp; incourage the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for equity, who fled unto their sanctuary for safety.
We find they refused to enter into League with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant

(though strictly it belong not to this <hi>Period,</hi> as I distinguish
it, yet falling out, within 80 years thereafter, in the time
of the <hi>Culdees,</hi> it will not obscurely evidence the truth of
this) <hi>Goranus</hi> the 45 King of <hi>Scots,</hi> earnestly dissuaded <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi>

               <p>III. Though they were not for partaking in wicked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
Wars, without authority or against it; yet we have
ground to conclude, they were for War, &amp; did maintain
the principle of resisting Tyrannie: since there was never
more of the pactice of it, nor more happy resistances in any
age, than in that. Where we find, that, as their Ancestors
had frequently done before, so they also followed their
footsteps, in resisting, reduceing to order. repressing, &amp;
bringing to condign punishment, Tyrant; &amp; Usurpers;
And thought those actions, which their Fathers did by the
light of nature &amp; dictates of reason, worthy of imitation,
when they had the advantage of the light of Revelation &amp;
dictates of Faith; the one being indeed moderate &amp; directed
but no ways contradicted by the other. Therefore we read;
that, as their Predecessors had done with <hi>Thereus</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whom they banished in the year before
Christs Incarnation 173. With <hi>Durstus</hi> the II King, whom
they slew in Battel, in the year befor Christ 107. <hi>Evenus</hi> 3.
who was imprisoned &amp; dyed there, in the year befor

Mockage, &amp; his body cast into a sink, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 72.
<hi>Luctatus</hi> the 22. King, who was slain for his Leachery &amp;
Tyranny, <hi>anno 110. Mogaldus</hi> the 23. King, slain <hi>anno</hi> 113.
<hi>Conarus</hi> the 24. King, a Leacherous tyrant, dyed in Prison,

after the Christian Faith was publickly professed, they
pursued <hi>Athirco,</hi> the 29. King, when degenerate into
Tyranny, who was forced to kill himself <hi>anno</hi> 231. They
slew <hi>Nathalocus,</hi> the 30. King, &amp; cast him into a privy
<hi>anno</hi> 242. They beheaded <hi>Romachus,</hi> the 36. King, and
caryed about his head for a show, <hi>anno</hi> 348. As they did

               <p>IV. Whence it is evident, that as they attained, even in
these primitive times, &amp; maintained the purity &amp; freedom
of their Ministery, independent on Pope, Prelate, or
any humane Supremacy (that Antichristian Hierarchy, &amp;
Erastian blasphemie, not being known in those dayes) so
they contended for the order &amp; boundaries of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy,
according to Gods appointment &amp; the fundamental
constitutions of their Government; &amp; thought it their duty
to shake off the yoke, &amp; disoune the Authority of these
Tyrants that destroyed the same. Yea we find that even
for incapacity, stupidity, &amp; folly, they disouned the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of a Magistrate, &amp; disposed of the Government
another way, as they did with <hi>Ethodius</hi> 2. whose authority
they did oune, but <hi>Titulo tenus.</hi> See <hi>Buchan. loco Citato,</hi>

was with the first corrupted with Antichristianisme: For
that <hi>Mystorie of iniquity</hi> that had been long working, till

for it when it came: which, while the Dragon did persecute

but when the Beast did arise, to whom he gave his

difficulty Authors do make, in calculating the Epocha of
the 42 <hi>moneths</hi> of Antichrists duration in the world, because
of the obscurity of his first rise; yet there needs not be much
perplexity in finding out that Epocha in <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor so
much discouragment from the fancyed permanency of that
Kingdom of wickedness. For if it be certain, as it will not

Priestly Office, which was transmitted from the <hi>Culdees</hi>
to the <hi>Lollards,</hi> And by them handed doun to the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Reformation, in the following Period. Their
Testimony indeed was not <hi>Active,</hi> by way of forcible
resistance, against the Soveraign Powers; but <hi>passive,</hi> by
way of Confession &amp; Martyrdom, &amp; sufferings &amp; verbal
contendings, &amp; witnessings against the prevailing corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the time. And no wonder it should be so, &amp; in this
some way different from ours, because that was a dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of suffering, when Antichrist was on the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
&amp; they had no call nor capacity to oppose him any
other way, and were novv spirited for this passive Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
in which circumstances they are an excellent pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
for imitation, but not an example for confutation of
that principle of defensive resistence which they never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted,
&amp; had never occasion to confirm by their practice.
But as in their manageing their Testimony, their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was somevvay different from ours on this respect; so
they had far the advantage of us, that their cause was so
clearly stated upon the greatest of heads of sufferings, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the clearest connexion with the fundamentals of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Yet we shall find in this Period our Heads of suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
someway homologated, if we consider.</p>
               <p>I. That as they did faithfully keep &amp; contend for the word
of Christs patience under that dispensation, in asserting &amp;
maintani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g both the verity of Christs Doctrin, &amp; the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of His Worship, by testifieing against the corruptions,
errors, Idolatries, &amp; Superstitions of Popery; so they did
constantly bear witness against the usurpation &amp; Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
domination of the Antichristian Prelats. And as the
<hi>Culdees</hi> did vigorously oppose their first introduction, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41139:15"/>
after aspiring domination, as well as the corruptions of
their Doctrine, As we have the contendings of Eminent
witnesses recorded from age to age; in the fourth &amp; fifth
Age, <hi>Columbe, Libthac, Ethernan, Kintogerne</hi> or <hi>Mungo;</hi>
in the Sexth &amp; seventh Age, <hi>Colmanus, C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emens,</hi> &amp; <hi>Samson</hi>
with others, in the Eight &amp; ninth Age, <hi>Alcuin, Rabanus
Maurus, Ioannes Scotus Acrigena,</hi> are noted in Historie;
And the <hi>Lollards,</hi> by their Examinations &amp; Testimonies,
are found to have witnessed against the exercise of their
power, &amp; sometimes against the very Nature of their power
it selfe: so in their practise, they condemned Prelacy as well
as Popery, in that their Ministers did in much painfullness,
poverty, simplicity, Humility, &amp; Equality, observe the
Institution of our Lord. And so far as their light served,
&amp; had occasion to inquire into this point, they acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
no officer in the House of God superior to a preaching
Minister, &amp; according to this standart they rejected &amp; cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Reformation of exorbitant Prelacy. And it is plain that
they were frequently discovered, by discountinanceing &amp;
withdrawing from their superstitions &amp; Idolatrous worship:
for all which, when they could not escape nor repell their
violence, they cheerfuly embraced &amp; endured the flames.</p>
               <p>II. That their Adversaries did manage their cruel craft,
&amp; crafty cruelty, in murdering those Servants of God,
much after the same methods that ours do; except that they
are many stages outdone by their successors, as much as
perfect Artists do outstrip the rude beginings of Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But on the other hand, the Suffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers in our day,
that would follow the example of those Worthyes under
Popery, would be much condemned by this generation,
even by them that commend the matter of their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
though they will not allow the manner of it to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
in this day. The Adversaries of Christ in this &amp; that
generation, are more like then his Confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sors &amp; witnesses
are. The Adversaries then, when constrained by diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the times troubles, or when their designes were
not ripe, pretended more moderation &amp; aversation from
severity, but no sooner got they opportunity (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
they sought) but so soon they renewed the Battel
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41139:15"/>
against Jesus Christ; so now: when they had seven abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
in their hearts, &amp; many cursed designes in their
heads, they always spoke fairest; so now: when they had
a mind to execute their cruelty, they would resolve befor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
whom to pitch upon before conviction; so now: And
when so resolved, the least pretence of a fault, obnoxious
to their wicked Law, would serve their design; so now:
They used then to forge Articles, &amp; falsly misrepresent
their answers, &amp; declarations of their principles; so now.
Yet on the other hand, if now poor sufferers should glory
in that they are counted worthy to suffer shame for the
name of Christ, as they did then; If now they should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with as great cheerfullnesse, for the smallest points as
for the greatest heads, as they did then, who endured the
flames as gallantly, for eating a Goose upon Friday, as
others did for the Doctrin of Justification, or Purgatory,
or Indulgences, or worshipping of Images &amp; Saints; If
now they should speak for every truth in question, with all
simplicity &amp; plainness, without reserves or shifts declining
a Testimony, as they did; If they should supersede from
all applications to their Enemies for savour, &amp; not medle
with either petitioning or bonding with them, as they did;
nay not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a
better resurrection: Then they might expect the severe
Censure of ignorant &amp; precise fools, as the most part who
suffer now are counted.</p>
               <p>III. That they stood aloof from every appearance of a
base <hi>Complyance</hi> with them; not so much as to give them an
interpretative sign of it, which in their meaning might be
thought a recantation, though abstractly consideredit might
be capable of a more favourable construction: As the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<hi>burning of their Bill</hi> was; which might have been
thought a condemning of their accusations: but because
that was not their Adversaries sense of it, they durst not do
it. Not like many now a dayes, who will not be solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
to consult that. Neither would they take any of their
<hi>Oaths,</hi> nor pay any of their Eccllesiastical Exactions, as
we find in the Articles brought in against the <hi>Lollards</hi> of
<hi>Kyle. Knox Hist. of Reform.</hi> These things are easily complyed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41139:16"/>
with now: and such as will suffer upon such things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p>IV. That while the Love of God and his blessed Truth,
and the precepts, promise, &amp; presence of our Lord Jesus
Christ, did enable them into all patience with joy, in a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Testimony, being by the call of a clear 8: necessary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
sent &amp; sett forth to behis witnesses; they did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
endeavour any resistence: yet we find they never
resigned nor abandoned that first &amp; most just priviledge of
<hi>resistence;</hi> nay, nor bringing publick <hi>beasts of prey</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne
punishment, in an extraordinary way of vindictive
Justice, for the Murder of the Saints. As, upon the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>George Wishchard,</hi> was done with Cardinal <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
who was slain in the tower of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> by <hi>Iames
Melvin:</hi> who perceiving his consorts in the interprise mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with passion, withdrew them &amp; said; <hi>this work &amp; judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, although it be secret,</hi> ought to be <hi>done with greater
gravity,</hi> And, presenting the point of the sword to the
Cardinal, said, <hi>Repent thee of thy former wicked life, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the shedding of the blood of that notable instrument of God,</hi>
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. George Wishchard, <hi>which albeit the flame of fire consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
before men, yet it cryes for vengeance upon the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; we from God
are sent to revenge it; for here, before my God, I protest, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the hatred of thy person, the love of thy riches, nor the fear of
any trouble thow couldst have d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me to me in particular, moved or
moveth me to strike thee, but only because thow hast been &amp; remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
an obstinate Enemy against Christ Iesus, &amp; His holy Gospel.</hi>
Of which fact, the famous &amp; faithful Historian <hi>Mr Knox</hi>
speaks very honorably, and was so far from condemning it,
that while after the slaughter they kept out the Castle, he
with other Godly men went to them &amp; stayed with them,
till they were together caryed captives to <hi>Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce.</hi> Yet now
such a fact, committed upon such another bloody &amp; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
Beast, the Cardinal <hi>Prelat</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> eight years
agone, is generally condemned as horrid Murther.</p>
               <p>V. However, tho in this dark Period there be no noted
instances of these witnesses resisting the Superior powers,
for reasons above hinted: yet in this Period, we find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
instances of noble &amp; vertuous Patriots, their not only
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41139:16"/>
resisting, but also revenging to the utmost of severity rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
&amp; raging Tyrants. As may be seen in Histories. For
before the corruption of Antichrist came to its hight, we find
<hi>Ferchardus</hi> I. the 52. K. was drawen to judgment against his
will, great crimes were layd to his charge, &amp; among others
the <hi>Pelagian</hi> heresie, &amp; contempt of Baptisme, for which
he was cast into Prison, where he killed himself; <hi>anno
636. Eugenius</hi> 8. the 62. King degenerating into wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
&amp; rejecting the Admonitious of his friends &amp; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the Ministers, was killed in a convention of his
nobles, with the consent of all, <hi>anno 765. Donaldus</hi> 7. was
imprisoned, where he killed himself, <hi>anno 859. Ethus,</hi>
surnamed <hi>Alipes,</hi> the 72. King was apprehended, &amp; his
wicked life layd out befor the people, &amp; then compelled
to resigne the Government, &amp; dyed in Prison, <hi>anno</hi> 875.
Afterwards when the Government was transmitted to the
<hi>Stewarts, Iames</hi> the 2. the 103. King, who killed <hi>William</hi> E.
of <hi>Douglas</hi> in the Castle of <hi>Sterling,</hi> most treacherously after
he had pretended a civil treatment, was publickly defyed by
the Earles friends; who took the Kings publick writ &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
made to the said Earle, &amp; tyed it to a horse tail,
dragging it through the streets, &amp; when they came to the
Mercat place they Proclaimed <hi>both King &amp; Nobles perjured
Covenant-breakers:</hi> And thereafter when E. <hi>Iames</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was desired to submit, he answered, <hi>he would never
put himself in their reverence, who had no regard to shame, nor to
the lawes of God or man, and who had so perfidiously &amp; treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
killed his Brother &amp; his Cousins. Iames</hi> 3. the 104. King
for his Treachery &amp; Tyranny was opposed &amp; purswed by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
by his oun subjects; who finding himself under disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
sent to the rebells (as he thought them &amp; called
them) <q>an offer of peace, &amp; received this answer; that seeing
the King did nothing honestly, a certain war seemed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to them then a peace not to be trusted, that there
was no other hope of agreement but one, that he should
quite the Government, otherwise it was to no purpose
to trouble themselves with treaties.</q> Thereafter in a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
he was slain at <hi>Bannockburn,</hi> by <hi>Gray, Ker,</hi> &amp; <hi>Borthwick.
Iames</hi> the 4. the 105. King was also constrained, by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41139:17"/>
of <hi>Archibald Douglas</hi> E. of <hi>Angus</hi> called <hi>Bell the Cat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
to reforme the Court, and put away some wicked Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
from his Counsel, and give way tho against his will
to the execution of judgement upon others: which was the
occasion of that foresaid <hi>Agnomen</hi> to the Earle. For, he
with other Nobles, in a meeting at <hi>Lawder,</hi> consulting how
to reform &amp; repress the insolency of the Court, had the
Apologue of the <hi>Mice</hi> laid out before them; that the Mice
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell upon deliberating how to be rid of the Cat, &amp; concluded
the best way was to put a bell about her neck, but when it
came to be put in execution, never a Mouse durst under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it: The Earle quickly made application, saying, <hi>I will
bell the Cat;</hi> &amp; forthwith went out &amp; meeting <hi>Cochran,</hi> one
of these wicked Consellours, took hold of him, &amp; hanged
him with a horse halter over the bridge of <hi>Lawder,</hi> &amp; ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
in to the Kings presence proceeded to snatch <hi>Ramsey,</hi>
another of the countreyes Enemies, out of the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
but that he yeelded at length to the Kings earnest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
to spare him. However we see how generously
zealous these noble Patriots were for the countries good,
against Tyrannie, thô they were ignorant of Religion: Yet
this all alongs was still the character of the <hi>Scots</hi> in these
dayes, none more terrible to Tyrants, none more Loyal
to Kings then they.</p>

               <p>AS in the former the Testimony was mostly <hi>Passive,</hi>
so in the following Period, when they were increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in number &amp; strength that embraced the Gospel,
the Lord called &amp; spirited to an <hi>Active</hi> Testimony, for
these two <hi>Twins, Religion &amp; Liberty,</hi> that were then
sought to be stifled in the birth, &amp; are now designed more

declaredly to be destroyed, after they have growen up to

destroyers the more grassant &amp; grievous, so it rubs the
more indeleble Infamie, on the shamfull security &amp; Ass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
stupidity of this generation, that have received such an
excellent Testimony deposited to their trust, transmitted
to them through a continued tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ct of the witnessings &amp;
wrestlings of their worthy Ancestors, and now let it slip
&amp; slide through their feeble fingers; And does the more
justify, yea magnify, the poor endeavours of the present
Sufferers, who at least, when they cannot react these
mighty works in defending Religion &amp; Liberty, do choose
rather to die than to resign the Testimony, or quite the
least Priviledge that their Progenitors possessed them of:
And though they be superciliously despised, as litle insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
nothings, in the eyes of the bulk of the big boasters
of this blind age; yet, if these valiant Heroes who did such
exploits for their God, in commenceing &amp; carying on the
work of Reformation, were now to see the dull Dotages
of this dreaming generation (not only suffering &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to, but congratulating &amp; applauding, the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
&amp; reestablishment of Idolatry &amp; Tyranny, Popery

Children, who disdain &amp; disoune such dishonorable &amp;
dastardly yeeldings, and are therefore most despised with
disdain &amp; despight. A brief Rehearsal of their Contendings
will clear the Case.</p>
               <p>While the <hi>Queen Dowager</hi> Regent reigned by the curse of

Gospel in <hi>Scotland;</hi> God so Counteracted her, that the

as well as commons, began to abhor the Tyranny
of the Bishops: yea men almost universally began to doubt,

suppressing Christs Truth! or whether they might suffer
their Brethren to be murdered in their presence, without
any declaration that such Tyrannie displeased them?</q> And
from the Scriptures they were resolved, that <hi>a lively Faith
required a plain Confession, when Christs Truth is impugned;</hi>
And that <hi>not only they be guilty that do evil, but also they that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to evil, and this they should do, if seeing such things openly
committed, they should be silent, and so allow whatsoever was
done.</hi> From doubts they came to determinations, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
that <hi>Christ Iesus His glorious Gospel should be Preached,
His holy Sacraments truely ministred, Superstition, Idolatry, &amp;
Tyranny should be suppressed in this Realme;</hi> And that <hi>both as to

                  </gap> this, famous
and faithfull Mr <hi>Knox,</hi> and other Servants of the Lord, did
Preach diligently in <hi>Private Meetings.</hi> And for that, when
they were summoned before the Queen; several zealous
&amp; bold men repaired to her, &amp; plainly in the hearing of
the Prelats, did charge them with the cruel device in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
&amp; told her with a vow, <hi>they should make a day of
it, because they oppressed them &amp; their tennents, for feeding
of their idle bellies, they troubled the Preachers, and would
murder all; should they suffer this any longer? No, it should
not be.</hi> Thereafter, the more effectually to prosecute the
Reformation begun, they entered into <hi>Covenants, to
maintain &amp; advance that work of Reformation,</hi> And to <hi>stand
to the Desence thereof; and of one another, against all wicked
Power, that might intend Tyranny or trouble against them,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41139:18"/>
and to resent any injury done to any of their Brerhren, upon
the account of the Common Cause, as done to all.</hi> Of which
Covenants they entered into many very solemnly: one
was at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> anno 1557. Another at <hi>Perth,</hi> 1559.
Another at <hi>Sterling</hi> 1559. binding, that none should have
any correspondence with the Queen, without notifieing it
to one another, And that nothing should proceed therein,
without <hi>common Consent</hi> of them all. Another at <hi>Leith,</hi>
anno 1560. Another at <hi>Air,</hi> anno 1562. of the same tenor.
By which Covenants, as their Conjunction was the more
firme among themselves, so was it the more fearful to
their Adversaries; when according to the tenor of them
they kept their Conventions, &amp; held Counsells with such
gravity &amp; clossness, that the enemies trembled. I mention
these things more particularly, because these same very
things commended in our Fathers, are now condemned
in a poor handful, that wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ld aim at imitating their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in renewing &amp; reiterating such Covenants of the
same Nature &amp; Tenor, &amp; binding to the same very duties,
and prosecute in the same methods of keeping <hi>General
Meetings</hi> for Correspondence, &amp; consultation about com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
mutual Duties in common danger; whereunto they
have not only present necessity to urge them, but also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terite
examples of these Worthies to encourage them, and
their experience of comfort &amp; tranquillity they reaped,
<hi>by these Christian Assemblies &amp; Godly Conferences, as ost as
any danger appeared to any member or members of their body.</hi>
These beginings the zealous Covenanted Reformers left
no means unessayed to promote, by Protestations to the
Parliament, &amp; Petitions, &amp; many reiterated Addresses to
the Queen <hi>Dowager:</hi> From whom they received many
renewed fair promises; which she had never mind to keep,
and wanted not the impudence, when challenged for
breaking them, to declare, <hi>It becomes not Subjects to
burthen their Princes with promises, further then it pleased
them to keep the same:</hi> And at another time, that <hi>she
was bound to keep no Faith to Hereticks:</hi> And again, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41139:19"/>
                  <hi>Princes must not be strictly bound to keep their promises;</hi>
And that <hi>her self would make litle Conscience to take from
all that sort their Lives &amp; Inheritance, if she might do it
with an honest excuse.</hi> Wherein she spoke not only the
venome of her oun heart, but the very soul &amp; sense, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
&amp; project, of all Popish Princes: Whereby we may
see what security we have for Religion &amp; Liberty this day,
though the most part make such a pretence a pillow to sleep
on. But after many Discoveries in this kind of the Queens
Treachery, at length they would no more be bribed by
promises, blinded by pretences, nor boasted by her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
(slandering their interprise, as if it pertained
nothing to Religion) from their endeavours to prosecute
the same: but finding themselves compelled to take the
Sword of Just defence, against all that should persue them
for the matter of Religion, they first signified unto her;
That they would notifie to the King of <hi>France;</hi> &amp; all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Princes,<q> that her cruel unjust &amp; most Tyrannieal
murther intended against Touns &amp; Mnltitudes, was &amp; is
the only Cause of their revolt from their accustomed
obedience, which they ouned &amp; promised to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign;
provided they might live in Peace &amp; Liberty,
and enjoy Christs Gospel, <hi>without which they firmly
purpose never to be subject to mortal man;</hi> And that better
it were to expose their bodies to a thousand deaths, than
to deny Christ; which thing not only do they, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
open Idolatry, but also all such, as, seeing their
Brethren purswed for the Cause of Religion, and haveing
sufficient means to comfort &amp; assist them, do neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
withdraw from them their dutiful support.</q> And
thereafter, they published a <hi>Declaration</hi> to the generation

to escape just punishment, after that they in their blind
fury had caused the blood of many to be shed, but if they
proceeded in this their malicious Cruelty, they should be
dealt with all, wheresoever they should be apprehended,
as Murderers, &amp; open Enemies to God &amp; to Mankind.

And that with the same measure they had measured, &amp;
intended to measure to others, it should be measured
to them—that is, they should, with all force &amp;
power they had, execute just vengeance &amp; punishment
upon them; yea begin that same War which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
<hi>Israel</hi> to execute against the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> that is,
Contract of Peace should never be made, till they desist
from their open Idolatry &amp; cruel Persecution of Gods
Children.</q> I rehearse this Declaration the more expresly,
because in our day <hi>Declarations</hi> of this stile &amp; strain, and
aiming at the same Scope, is hideously hissed &amp; houted at
as unheard of novelties. Finally, when by all their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Warnings, Admonitions &amp; Protestations, they
could obtain no redress, but rather an increase of insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
violence; they proponed the Question in a General
Meeting: <hi>Whether she, whose pretences threatened the bondage
of the whole Commonwealth, ought to be suffered so Tyrannically
to domineer over them?</hi> Unto which the Ministers, being
required to give their judgment, answered, that she ought
not. And accordingly they declared her <hi>deposed,</hi> from all
Government over them; because of her persecuting the
<q>Professors of the true Religion, and oppressing the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the true Lieges, never being called nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of any Crime; because of her intrusion of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats
against all order of Election; because of her bringing
in strangers to suppress the Liberty of the Countrey, and
placing them in greatest Offices of Credite, because of her
altering and subverting the old Laws of the Realme &amp;c.</q>
Which I mention, because hence we may see what things
our Fathers judged, did dissolve the relation between
the people &amp; their Rulers: And when applyed to our Case,
will justify their reasons that have renounced the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Tyranny: This was done at <hi>Edinburgh, anno</hi> 1559.
And thereafter, while they vindicated themselves, &amp;
went on with the work of Reformation, throwing doun all
monuments of Idolatry, &amp; propogateing the Reformed
Religion; God so blessed their endeavours that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of faith, and all Articles of the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
was Read &amp; Ratified by the three Estates of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41139:20"/>
at <hi>Edinburgh Iulij</hi> 1560. And the same year the
Book of Discipline, containing the forme &amp; order of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial
Government, was subscribed by a great part of the
Nobility. Thus through the wisdom &amp; power of God
alone, even by the weaknesse of very mean Instr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

against the rage &amp; fury of the devil, and of all the powers
of Hell, was this work of Reformation advanced &amp; effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuated;
And came to the establishment of a Law, which

for the Professors &amp; promoters thereof. Which Law,
often confirmed &amp; ratified afterwards, though it be now
cassed &amp; rescinded by the Prerogative of the present Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,

enjoying Religion upon, than the perfidious promises of a
Popish Usurper, pretending a Liberty to dissenting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
by takeing away the Penal Statuts, the Legal
Bulwark against Popery: All which yet, to the reproach
of all Protestants, some are applauding &amp; Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in this time by their Addresses &amp; Petitions, to this
destroyer of Law &amp; Religion. I wish they would look
back to see what the building of this Bulwark cost our
Fathers, before they sell it at such a rate: And compare
the present Addresses, Courting &amp; Carressing the Papists,
with the Addresses of these worthy builders of what they
are destroying. There is one dated <hi>Edinb.</hi> May. 27. 1561.

God assure themselves, that if their Counsell put not
order unto them, that they should shortly take such order,
that they shall neither be able to do what they list, neither
yet to live upon the sweat of the browes of such as are no

Seeing the one is much more abominable in the sight of
God then the other. But that it may be Lawful to inflict

The words of <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> upon the folowing sabbath
may be added. That <hi>one Masse was more fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then if ten thousand armed Enemies, were Landed in any
part of the realme, of purpose to suppress the whole Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
for (said he) in our God there is strength to resist &amp;
confound Multitudes, if we unfeignedly depend upon Him;
but when we joine hands with Idolatry, it is no doubt, but
both Gods amiable Presence &amp; comfortable defence, will
leave us and what shall then become of us?</hi> Yea when it was
voted in the General Assembly, whether they might take
the Queens Mass from her? Many frankly affirmed; that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41139:21"/>
                  <q>as the Mass is abominable, so it is just &amp; right, that it
should be suppressed: And that in so doing, men did no
more hurt to the Queens Majestie, than they that should
by force take from her a Poisoned Cup, when she were
going to drink it.</q> Thus we have some Specimen of the
Zeal of our fathers against Idolatry. But in a litle time,
Court favours blunted it in many. And then had the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God a double Battel, fighting or the one hand
against Idolatrie, and the rest of the abominations main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Court. And upon the other hand, against
the unfaithfullness of false brethren, and Treachery of
Sycophants, who informed the Court against the Ministers
for their free &amp; faithful Preaching and warning on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions;
yet they sustained the brunt of all these assaults,
and came off with honour. At length to be short, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of time, this <hi>Mary</hi> a woman of a proud &amp; crafty wit,
and an indured heart against God &amp; His Truth, insisted in
the same steps of Tyranny &amp; Treachery (but with greater
Aggravations) that her Mother walked in, and was served
according to her desert. For after that her Darling <hi>Davie
Rizio,</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> Fidler (whom most men then supposed,
and do still suspect, to be the Father of King <hi>Iames,</hi> this
mans Grandfather; and some do think it not unlikly that
his Successors have derived from this stock the <hi>Italian</hi>

rested, till she &amp; <hi>Bothwel</hi> contrived &amp; executed his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And then she married that Murdering Adulterer, the

pursueing the Murther, took her &amp; sent her Prisoner
to <hi>Lochlevin;</hi> where they made her resigne the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to her Son <hi>Iames,</hi> then an Infant. And afterwards
she was beheaded by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England.</hi> We see
now by this deduction what was the Testimony of this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
and how in many things it confirmes the Heads of the

               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41139:21"/>
I. The Reformation of <hi>Scotland</hi> had this common with
all other <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches, that it was carried on by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
the opposing powers: But it had this peculiar advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
above all, that at once &amp; from the begining, both
Doctrine &amp; Worship, Discipline &amp; Government, were
Reformed: as <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> witnesseth, that there was no
Realme upon the face of the Earth at that time that had
Religion in greater Purity. <hi>Yea,</hi> sayes he, <hi>we must speak
the Truth whomsoever we offend, there is no Realme that
hath the like Purity; for all others, how sincere soever the
Doctrine be, retain in their Churches and the Ministery
thereof some footsteps of Antichrist &amp; dregs of Popery, But
we (praise to God alone) have nothing in our Churches
that ever flowed from that Man of Sin.</hi> The Doctrine was
purely Reformed, according to the Rule of Christ, both
as to Matter &amp; Manner of Delivery. As to the <hi>Matter</hi> of it,
what it was, the Confession of Faith ratified in Parliament
<hi>anno</hi> 1560. Doth witness. In the <hi>Manner</hi> of it, they study<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
not the smooth &amp; pâkie prudence that is now so much
applauded, for not observeing which, such as would fain
be honest in this duty, are so much condemned; but they
cryed aloud against &amp; did not spare the sins of the time, with
application to every degree of men: as we have it published
&amp; vindicated in <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> his History. They cryed that the
<q>same God who plagued <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> repulsed <hi>Sennacherib,</hi>
struck <hi>Herod</hi> with wormes, and made the bellies of dogs
the Grave &amp; Sepulcher of the Spiteful <hi>Iezabel,</hi> will not
spare misled Princes, who authorise the Murtherers of
Christs members in this our time: Many now a dayes
will have no other Religion than the <hi>Qween;</hi> the Queen,
no other than the <hi>Cardinal;</hi> the Cardinal, no other than
the <hi>Pope;</hi> the Pope, no other than the <hi>Devil:</hi> Let men
therefore consider what danger they stand in, if their
Salvation shall depend upon the Queens faith.</q> And
they used to defend such manner of free dealing, from the
examples of the Prophets reproving Kings Personally:
<q>Now if the like &amp; greater corruptions be in the World
this day, who dare interprise, to put to silence the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41139:22"/>
of God, whih will not be subject to the apetites of
misled Princes.</q> 
                  <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> his defence befor the Queen,
when rebuked for speaking of her Mariage in the pulpit,
was: The Evangel, sayth he, hath two points, <q>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
&amp; Faith; in preaching Repentance, of necessity it
is that the sins of men be noted, that they way know
wherein they offend.</q> And in his dispate with <hi>Lithing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun,</hi>
requiring where any of the Prophets did so use Kings
&amp; Rulers; he gave the example of <hi>Elias.</hi> reproveing <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab
&amp; Iezebel,</hi> that <q>
                     <hi>dogs shall lick the blood of</hi> Achab <hi>and eat
the flesh of</hi> Jezebel; which was not whispered in their ears,
but so as the People understood: well enough, for so
witnessed <hi>Iehu</hi> after the accomplishment; <hi>Elizeiu</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Iehoram,</hi> saying, <hi>what have I to do with thee, if it were
not for</hi> Jehoshaphat, <hi>I would not have looked toward thee;</hi>
though a subject yet he gave litle reverence to the King.</q>
These were their Arguments for faithfullness then which
are now exploded with contempt. Their <hi>worship</hi> was also
Reformed from all Dregs of Popery, &amp; fopperies of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Ceremonies, retained in many other Churches;
especially in <hi>England.</hi> To whose Bishops, in Queen
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, the Assembly wrote; <q>That if <hi>Surplice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Corner cap, Tippet</hi> &amp;c. have been the badges of Idolaters
in the very act of Idolatry, what have Preachers to do
with the dregs of that Romish Beast? Yea what is he that
ought not to fear to take, either in his hand or fore head,
the mark of that odious Beast?—We think yow should
boldly oppose your selves to all power, that will dare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll
it self against God, and against all such as do bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the Conscience of the faithful, further then God hath
burdened them by His oun word.</q> The <hi>Disclpline</hi> &amp; <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
was from the begining <hi>Presbyterial,</hi> even before the
establishment; both in <hi>practice,</hi> among the Persecuted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
who kept their <hi>private Meetings:</hi> And in their <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
This was one of <hi>Mr Knox's</hi> Articles, he sustained at
<hi>St Andrews,</hi> upon his first entry unto the Ministery, <hi>Art.</hi>
S. <hi>There is no Bishop except he preach even by himself wiihout any

vertue of that Intrinsick Power, granted by the Lord to
His Church; nor did they so much as petition for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
of the then Authority; But upon Christs warrant,
they kept &amp; held their Courts in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ only, and in His sole Authority, by direction of
His Word &amp; Spirit, concluded all their Counsels, Votes,
&amp; Acts. And as they knew nothing of an Exotick <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi>
so they put out &amp; held out <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and kept a perfect
<hi>Parity;</hi> which was nothing infringed by the extraordinary
Imployments &amp; Commissions delegated to some <hi>Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents,</hi>
upon the account of the particular exigence of
these times.</p>
               <p>II. Next we find in the Practice of these renouned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,
many demonstrations of pure zeal, worthy of all
imitation: which I remark the rather, because poor Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
that would now imitate it, are condemned as blind &amp;
ignorant zelots. But why are not the Reformers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for the same things? We find in the first place, that
they were so far from <hi>complying</hi> with, or conniving at, or
countenancing publick sins, that they could not contain
themselves from declaring their Detestation of the sight of
them: yea the very boyes did abominate it, as at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of <hi>St Iohnstoun,</hi> a boy cryed with a bold voice,
<hi>This is intolerable, that when God by His Word hath plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Idolatry, we shall stand &amp; see it used in despight.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he &amp; others throw doun all the monuments of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in the place. But if now any should enterprise such a
thing, when the Idol of the Masse is set up in every City,
they might expect <hi>Ierubbaals</hi> censure of the <hi>Abiezrites;</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
it is true they might have the same encouragement, because
they have the same Command as he had, to wit, the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
precept of throwing doun Idolatrous Altars. Next they
were so far from complying with the Enemies, in <hi>keeping the
peace</hi> with them, that they thought it a great sin not to oppose
them, when their brethren were forced to take the sword
of self defence, being perswaded by these arguments:
<q>That by their fainting &amp; abstracting their support, the
Enemies would be encouraged; And thereby they should
declare themselves both Traitors to the Truth once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41139:23"/>
and Murderers of their Brethren, whom their
presence &amp; Concurrence might preserve; And that if
they should deny their Brethren suffering for His Names
sake, they should also deny Christ, and be denyed of
Him; And that God hath often punished subjects with
their Princes, for winking at and not resisting their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
iniquity; And therefore, as He is immutable in
nature, so would He not Pardon them in that which He
hath punished in others &amp;c.</q> Which Arguments prevailed
with the noble Earle of <hi>Glencarn,</hi> in zeal to burst forth in
these words—<hi>Albeit never man should accompany me, yet I
will go to my Brethren, and if it were but a Pike upon my shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
I had rather die with that company then Live after them.</hi>
But now professors cannot only sit at home in their shops
&amp; ceiled houses, when the Lords people are pursued &amp;
murdered in the fields, but also can hire their Murderers,
&amp; strengthen their hands, by paying them <hi>Cesses</hi> &amp; <hi>Locali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
and what they require for help to do their work,
and maintaining them in their iniquity. Which famous
<hi>Mr Knox</hi> disproveth very much in his day; Arguing that <q>if
people thought they were innocent, because they were
not the actors of such iniquity, they were utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
for God doth not only punish the chief offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but the Consenters to such iniquity, And all are
judged to consent, who give not Testimony against it;
As the Rulers &amp; Bishops are Criminal of all the innocent
blood, thats shed for the Testimony of Christs Truth,
so are all who assist &amp; maintain them in their blind rage,
and give no declaration that their Tyranny displeaseth
them; This doctrine is strange to the blind world, but
the verity of it hath been declared in all notable punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from the begining; when the old world was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by water, <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were destroyed,
were all alike wicked? yet all perished; why? All kept
silence, or did not resist, by which al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> approved ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and joined hands with the Tyrants, as it had been
in one Battel against the Omnipotent.</q> Which words if
impartially applyed, will condemn &amp; confute the dull
Daubings of the present Complyances, in maintaining
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41139:23"/>
Tyrants &amp; their Emissaries, by Emoluments which they
require &amp; exact, and that professedly, for promoting their
accursed projects; And will justify Consciencious suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
for refuseing to pay these impositions. And this will
the more appear, if we adde some more of his pithie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
in the same place, clearing the subject he is upon,
and answering an objection, what poor people might do,
when compelled to give obedience to all their Rulers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded?
<q>Ye may saith that Author, without sedition
withhold the fruits &amp; profits, which your false Bishops &amp;
Clergy most unjustly received of yow: Upon which he
subjoins the preceeding Arguments.</q> Yet now a dayes
these have no weight, but such as refuse either to pay Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors
exactions, or <hi>Curats</hi> stipends, are condemned
for giddy fools. Again we find, that when they were
challenged for duty, they would never decline a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its righteousness, nor do any thing directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly
which might seem a condemning of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they wold receive no <hi>pardons</hi> for these things which
they could not confess to be <hi>offences. Iohn Knox,</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
for offending the Queen, had her promise, that
if he would confess an offence, his greatest punishment
should be, but to go within the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
and immediatly to return to his own house; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
absolutely. But now, if our <hi>Pardon-mongers</hi> &amp; pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
men had been so circumstantiate, surely they could
have helped themselves with their distinctions, they might
confess &amp; be pardoned for offending the Queen, thô not
confess it to be a fault in their Conscience: But <hi>Mr Knox</hi>
had not learned that then. When they were pursuing the
Murder of King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Darnely,</hi> the Queen finding her
self not strong enough, offers to forgive &amp; pardon that
insurection: The Earle of <hi>Morton,</hi> in name of all the rest,
did not only refuse a Cessation, but told her they would
not ask a pardon. But now sufferers, for refusing of these
base &amp; unmanly aswell as unchristian Complyances, are
much condemned. Finally, because this strictness, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in their severity against their Enemies, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of <hi>Iewish rigidity,</hi> inconsistent with a Gospel Spirit
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41139:24"/>
of <hi>Lenity;</hi> which also is imputed to the much condemned
sufferers of <hi>Scotland</hi> at this time, for their Testimonies against
<hi>Toleration</hi> &amp; <hi>Liberty of Conscience:</hi> Let us hear what <hi>Knox</hi>
sayes; <q>whatsoever God required of the Civil Magistrate
in <hi>Israel</hi> or <hi>Juda,</hi> concerning the observation of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
during the time of the Law, the same doth He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of Lawful Magistrates, professing Christ Jesus, in
the time of the Gospel: And Cites a large Testimony out
of <hi>Augustine</hi> to this purpose.</q> And afterward objecting to
himself the practice of the Apostles, who did not punish
the Idolatrous <hi>Gentiles;</hi> he answers, <q>That the Gentiles,
being never avowed to be Gods people before, had never
received his Law, and therefore were not to be punished
according to the rigor of it, to which they were never
subject, being strangers from the Commonwealth of
<hi>Israel;</hi> But if any think, after the Gentiles were received
in the number of <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, and so made one
people with the <hi>Jewes</hi> beleeving, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hey were not
bound to the same obedience of <hi>Israels</hi> Covenant, the
same seems to make <hi>Christ</hi> inferior to <hi>Moses,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare
to the Law of His heavenly Father; for if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and transgression of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law was worthy of
death, what judge we the contempt of Christs ordinance
to be? And if Christ be not come to dissolve, but to fulfill
the Law of His Heavenly Father, shall the Liberty of
His Gospel be an occasion that the special glory of His
Father be troden under foot, and regarded of no man?
God forbid; And therefore I fear not to affirme, that the
Gentiles be bound by the same Covenant that God made
with His people <hi>Israel,</hi> in these words; <hi>Beware that thou
make not any Covenant with the Inhabitants of the Land but
thou shalt destroy their Altars &amp;c.</hi> When therefore the Lord
puteth the Sword in the hand of a people, they are no
less bound to purge their Cities &amp; Countreyes from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,
then were the <hi>Israelites,</hi> what time they received
the Possession of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>III. For the head of <hi>Resistence</hi> of Superior powers, we
have no clearer instances in any Period then in this, where
of the above mentioned hints give some account, to which in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41139:24"/>
their sentiments &amp; arguments may be here subjoined. They
prised and improved this principle so much, that they put
it in their <hi>Confession of faith Art. 14. To save the Life of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
to repress Tyranny, to defend the oppressed,</hi> are among
the good works of the Second Table, which are most
pleasing &amp; acceptable to God, as these works are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Himself; And <hi>to suffer innocent blood to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hed if
we may withstand it,</hi> is affirmed to be sin, by which Gods hot
Displeasure is kindled against the proud &amp; unthankful
world. And if there were no more to render the late. <hi>Test</hi>
of <hi>Scotland</hi> detestable, that condemns all resistence of Kings
upon any pretence whatsoever, this may make all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
&amp; all men abhor the contrivance of it; that that same
<hi>Test</hi> that confirms this <hi>Thesis,</hi> doth also impose the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>
upon Conscience. It obliges to this Confession in the
first part of it, and to deny it in the Latter. But no wonder,
that men of feared Consciences can receive any thing, thô
never so contradictory to it self; And that men who deny
sense and that principle irradicated in humane nature, may
also deny Conscience, &amp; make a fool of it in sowdering
Contradictories. But not only did our Reformers assert this
Truth for which now their children adhering to their
Testimony suffer both rage and reproach, but also gave
their reasons for it. As (1) <hi>Mr Knox,</hi> in his first Conference
with the Queen, argues thus: <q>There is neither greater
honour nor obedience to be given to Princes than Parents;
but so it is that the father may be stricken with a phrensie,
in the which he would slay his oun children; now if the
children arise, take his weapon from him, bind his
hands, do the children any wrong? It is even so with
Princes, that would murder the Children of God subject
to them, their blind zeal is nothing but a very mad phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
and therefore to take the sword from them, and
cast them into prison till they be brought to a more sober
mind, is no disobedience against Princes. (2) In his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with <hi>Lithingtoun,</hi> he proves the same point, from
the consideration of the justice of God, punishing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for not resisting the Prince. The Scripture of God
teacheth me (saith he) <hi>Ierusalem</hi> &amp; <hi>Iuda</hi> were punished
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41139:25"/>
for the sins of <hi>Manassoh;</hi> If you alledge they were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
because they were wicked, and not because the
King was wicked, the Scripture sayes expressly, <hi>for the
sins of Manasseh;</hi> yet will I not absolve the people, I will
grant the whole people offended with their King, but
how? to affirme that all <hi>Iuda</hi> committee the acts of his
impiety, hath no certainty; who can think, that all <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
should turn Idolaters immediatly after <hi>Hezekias</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Reformation? One part therefore willingly followed
him in his Idolatry, the other suffered him, &amp; so were
criminal of his sin, even as <hi>Scotland</hi> is guilty of the Queens
Idolatry this day.</q> In the same Discourse he makes it plain,
that all are guilty of Innocents murder who do not oppose
it, from <hi>Ieremies</hi> words in his defence before the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
—<hi>Know ye for certain if ye put me to death ye shall surely
bring innocent blood upon your selves and upon the City and upon
the Inhabitants thereof;</hi> Now if the Princes &amp; the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
should have been guilty of the Prophets blood, how
shall others be judged innocent before God, if they suffer
the blood of Innocents to be shed when they may save it?
(3) <hi>Ibid.</hi> he argues from the distinction between the person
placed in Authority, and the ordinance of God, the one
may be resisted the other cannot. The plain words of the
Apostle makes the difference: <q>The ordinance is of God,
for preservation of mankind, punishment o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vice, which
is holy &amp; constant; Persons commonly are profane &amp;
unjust: He that resisteth the power there, is only meant
of the just power wherewith God hath armed His Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats,
which who so resists, resists Gods or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inance; But
if men in the fear of God, oppose themselves to the fury
of Princes, they then resist not God, but the Devil who
abuses the sword &amp; Authority of God: It is evident the
people resisted <hi>Saul,</hi> when he had sworn <hi>Ionathan</hi>
should dye, whom they delivered: The Spirit of God
accuses them not of any crime, but praises them &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
the King: This same <hi>Saul</hi> again commanded the
Priests of the Lord to be slain, his guard would not obey,
but <hi>Doeg</hi> put the Kings cruelty in execution; I will not
ask, whether the Kings servants not obeying resisted the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41139:25"/>
ordinance of God, or whether <hi>Doeg</hi> murthering gave obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to just Authority? The Spirit of God condemns
that fact <hi>Psal.</hi> 52. that God would not only punish the
Commander, but also the merciless executer; There<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
they who gainstood his command, resisted not the
ordinance of God. (4). <hi>Ibid.</hi> He argues from exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
not only of resisting but of punishing Tyrants: chiefly
the example of <hi>Uzziah</hi> is pertinent to this purpose, 2 <hi>Chon.</hi>
26. who after his usurping the Priests Office, was put
out of the Temple. When it was replyed, that they
were the Priests that with stood the King, not simple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
He answered, The Priests were subjects, as <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>athar</hi>
was deposed by <hi>Solomon</hi> &amp;c. yet they made him go
out of the Temple for his Leprosie, and the people put
him from the Kingdom.</q>  It is noted also that <hi>Mr Knox,</hi> in
that discourse, adduces examples of those, who use to be
brought in as objections against defensive Armes, even the
<hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> before that Passage last cited: what
precepts, sayes he, the Apostles gave, I will not affirme;
But I find two things the faithful did, the one was
they assisted their Preachers even against the rulers, the
other was they suppressed Idolatrie wheresoever God
gave unto them force, asking no leave of the Emperour
nor of his deputies: Read the Ecclesiastical Histories, and
ye shall find examples sufficient.</p>
               <p>IV. In the next place we may inquire into the judgment
of these Reformers, concerning that Question that is now
so pusling to many; which indeed was never started before
this time as a head of suffering, but now, when it is star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
we may gather from our Ancestors Actings &amp; Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
about it, how it ought to be answered. They
were indeed in capacity, and accordingly did improve it,
for <hi>disouning the Authority</hi> of both the Queens: but their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
was not the thing that made it duty, if it had not
been so before. Capacity makes a thing possible, but not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
It does indeed make a duty seasonable, and clears the
Call to it, and regulates the timing of Affirmative duties,
but the want of it can never dispense with negative Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts:
And a duty, negative especially, may become ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41139:26"/>
when it hath not the advantage of seasonableness
or capacity; certainly it were duty to depose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he <hi>Pope</hi> from
his usurped authority, and to disoune it even in <hi>Rome</hi> it self,
but there it would not be thought very feasible or seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for twenty or thirty people to avouch such a thing
there, yet at all times it is a duty never to oune it. It is
thought unseasonable &amp; unfeasable to disoune the Tyrants
authority, but it is made necessary, when u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ged never to
oune it. And for this we have the grounds of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
shewing who may be disouned, and must not be
ouned. I shall first insert here <hi>John Knox</hi> his propositions,
prosecuted in his <hi>second blast,</hi> extant at the end of <hi>Anton.
Gilbies</hi> Admonition to <hi>England &amp; Scotland. 1. It is not
birth only nor propinquity of bloodh that maketh, a King
lawfully to Reign over a people, professing Christ Iesus and
His Eternal verity, but in his Election, the ordinance which
God hath established in the election of inferior judges, must
be observed. 2. No manifest Idolater, nor notorious trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor
of Gods holy precepts, ought to be promo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed to any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
regiment, honour, or dignity, in any realme, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
or Citie, that hath subjected themselves to Christ
Iesus and His blessed Evangel. 3. Neither can Oath, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
bind any such people to obey &amp; maintain Tyrants, against
God and His Truth known. 4. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t if rashly they have promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any manifest wicked person, or yet ignorantly have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
such an one, as after Declareth himself unworthy of regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
above the people of God (and such be all Idolaters &amp;
Cruel Presecuters) most justly may the same men depose &amp;
punish him, that unadvisedly before they did nominate, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
&amp; elect.</hi> Accordingly this was done in deposing
both the Queens: wich is fully vindicated by the Earle of
<hi>Morton,</hi> in his discourse to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi>
Relates it, <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Lib. 20. Pag.</hi> 746.</bibl> The deed it self,
neither the Custom of our Ancestors of taking a Course
with their Governour, will suffer it to be accounted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41139:26"/>
new, nor the moderation of the punishment to be odious:
for it were not needful to recount so many Kings puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by death, bonds, &amp; exile by our Progenitors. For
the <hi>Scotish</hi> nation, being from the begining alwise free,
hath created Kings upon these conditions, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
entrusted to them by the peoples suffrages,
might be also (if the matter required) removed by the
same suffrages: Of which Law there are many footsteps
remaining even to our day; for both in the Isles about,
and in many places of the continent, in which the old
Language &amp; institutions have any abode, this Custom is
kept, in creating their Governours of Clanns: And the
Ceremonies, used at the entering into Government,
do yet retain the express representation of this Law.
Whence it is evident, that the Government is nothing
else but a mutual stipulation between Kings &amp; people:
which further appears, from the inviolated tenor of the
Ancient Law, since the begining of the Scotish Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
reserved even unto our memory, without the
least essay either to abrogate it, or disable, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
it. Yea even when our fathers have deposed, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
&amp; more severely punished so many Kings, yet
never was any mention or motion made, of relaxing the
rigor of that Law: And not without reason, seeing it
was not of that kind of Constitutions, that change with
the times, but of those which are engraven in the minds
of men from the first original, and approved by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
consent of all Nations, and by natures Sanction
continued inviolable and perpetual, which being subject
to no other Lawes do Command &amp; rule all. This,
which in every action doth offer it self to our eyes &amp;
minds, and whether we will or not abides in our breasts,
our Predecessors followed; being alwayes armed against
violence, and ready to suppress Tyrants—And
now for the present, what have we done, but insisting
in the footsteps of so many Kingdoms &amp; free Nations,
suppressed Tyrannical Licentiousness, extolling it self
above all order of Laws, not indeed so severely as our
Predicessors in like cases; if we had imitated them, not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41139:27"/>
only wold we have been far from all fear of danger, but
also have escaped the trouble of Calumnies—What
would our Adversaries be at? Is it that we should arm with
Authority Tyrants convicted of grievous Crimes, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the spoils of the subjects, having hands em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued
in royal blood, and hearts gaping for the oppression
of all good men? And shall we put them upon our head,
who are infamously suspected of Parricide, both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
&amp; perpetrated?</q> To which we may adde, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
conclusion indeed, but adduced &amp; maintained by
<hi>Mr Craig,</hi> in the Assembly <hi>anno</hi> 1564. which had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by Learned men in <hi>Bononia, Principes omnes,
tam supremi quam inferiores, possunt &amp; debent Reformari,
vel deponi per cos per quos eriguntur, confirmantur, vel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittuntur
ad officium, quoties a side praestita subditis per
juramentum desiciant, quoniam relatio juramenti subdito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
&amp; principum mutua est, &amp; utrinque aequo jure ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanda
&amp; resormanda, juxta Legem &amp; conditionem jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti
ab utraque parte sacti.</hi> That is, all Rulers be they
supreme or inferior, may &amp; ought to be reformed, or
bridled (to speak moderatly) by them by whom they are
chosen, confirmed, or admitted to their office, so oft as
they break that promise made by Oath to their subjects,
because that the Prince is no less bound by Oath to their
subjects, then are the subjects to their Princes, And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
ought it to be kept &amp; reformed equally, according to
Law &amp; condition of the Oath that is made of either Party.
By comparing which two Testimonyes together, we may
see the reasons, why neither of the two <hi>Royal Brothers,</hi> that
have ruled in our day, could be conscienciously ouned
as Magistrates, in the Case they have been in for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years past: The first testimony is for the second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Brother, the Latter is for he first thats gone. But as
for <hi>Mr Knox</hi> his opinion, it is evident he had written a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
a book <hi>against the Government of women:</hi> which though he
did not intend it particularly against <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it did invalidate her authority as well as other womens.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41139:27"/>
This book he ounes and maintains, in his first conference
with her, and consequently could not oune her authority as
of the Lord, though he gave her common respect, as the title
of Majestie &amp;c. yet when he was particularly urged by the
Queens question, <hi>yow think,</hi> said she, <hi>that I have no just
authority;</hi> He would not answer in the affirmative, but
shifted it, by telling her; That <q>learned men in all ages,
have had their judgment free, and most commonly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing
from the Common judgment of the world. And
tho, he sayes, he could live under her government (so
may &amp; would the greatest disouners of Tyranny, if they
be not troubled with questions about ovvneing it) yet he
affirms that with the Testimony of a good Conscience,
he had communicate his judgment to the world, and that
if the realme found no inconveniences in her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he would no further disallow than within his oun
breast.</q> Certainly then in his Conscience he did not &amp;
could not oune her, as the Magistrate of God; And that
thô many things which before were holden stable, had
been called in doubt, yet neither Protestant nor Papist
could prove, that any such question was at any time moved
in publick or private, Neither could ever such a question
be moved, if the Conscience were not posed, and then
when it must speak, it must of necessity be unpleasant to
Tyrants. Thus we have heard both the positions &amp; scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of this witness, let us also hear his arguings that People
may punish Princes for their Idolatry &amp; murther &amp;c. And
therefore much more may disoune them: And therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
much more may they forbear to oune them, when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
for can a dead man by Law be ouned to be a Magistrate,
&amp; <hi>Custos</hi> of the Law. <q>
                     <hi>Idolatry</hi> (sayth he in his conference
with <hi>Lithington</hi>) ought not only to be suppressed, but the
Idolater ought to die the death: but by whom? by the
people of God, for the Commandment was given to
<hi>Israel;</hi> yea a Command, that if it be heard that Idolatry
is committed in any one City, that then the whole body
of the people arise and destroy that City, sparing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man woman nor child. But shall the King also
be punished? If he be an Idolater, I find no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41139:28"/>
granted unto Kings more then unto people,
to offend Gods Majestie. But the people may not be
Judges to their King.—God is the universal Judge; so
that what His Word commands to be punished in the
one, is not to be absolved in the other; And that the
people, yea or a part of the people, may not execute Gods
judgments against their King being an offender, I am sure
you have no other warrant, except your own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the opinion of such as more fear to offend
their Princes than God.</q> In the same Conference we have
the instance of <hi>Iehu</hi> adduced to prove that Subjects may
execute Gods judgments upon their Princes. It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
<hi>Iehu</hi> was a King before he executed judgment
upon <hi>Ahabs</hi> house, and the fact was extraordinary, and
not to be imitated. He answered, he was a meer Subject;
<q>No doubt <hi>Iezabel</hi> both thought &amp; said he was a Traitor,
and so did many others in <hi>Israel &amp; Samaria.</hi> And whereas
it was said, that the fact was extraordinary; I say, it
had the ground of Gods ordinary judgment, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
the Idolater to die the death; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>herefore I yet
again affirme, it is to be imitated of all those that prefer
the true honour of the true Worship &amp; Glory of God to
the affection of flesh &amp; wicked Princes. We are not
bound, said <hi>Lithingtoun</hi> to follow extraordinary exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
unless we have the like Comman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ment &amp; assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
I grant, said the other, if the example repugne to
the Law, but where the example aggrees with the Law, &amp;
is as it were the execution of Gods judgment expressed
within the same, I say that the example approved of God
stands to us in place of a Commandment; for as God in
His Nature is Constant &amp; Immutable, so cannot He
condemne in the ages subsequent that which He hath
approved in His Servants before us. Then he brings ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Argument from <hi>Amaziah</hi> who fled to <hi>Lachish,</hi> but
the people sent thither and flew him there.</q> 
                  <hi>Lethingtoun</hi>
doubted, whether they did well or not: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e answered,
<q>where I find execution according to Gods Law, and God
Himself not accuse the doers, I dare not doubt of the
equity of their Cause: And it appears. God gave them
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41139:28"/>
sufficient evidence of His approving the fact, for He
blessed them with peace and prosperity. But prosperity
does not alwise prove that God approves the fact: yes,
when the acts of men agree with the Law, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
according to the promise in that Law, then the
prosperity succeeding the fact is a most infallible assurance
that God hath approved it; but so it is, that there is a
promise of lengthening out prosperity to them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
Idolatry. And again, concluding <hi>Uzziahs</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he sayes there, The people ought to execute Gods
Law, even against their Princes, when that their open
Crimes by Gods Law deserve punishment, especially
when they are such as may infect the rest of the multitude.</q>
               </p>
               <p>V. There is another thing for which people have suffered
much in our day of blasphemy rebuke &amp; trouble, which yet
we find was not so odious in our Reformers eyes as this dull
&amp; degenerate age would represent it. That in some cases
it is Lawfull &amp; laudable for private persons, touched with
the zeal of God &amp; love to their Countrey, &amp; respect to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
trampled upon by Tyrants, to put forth their hand to
execute righteous judgment upon the Enemies of God &amp;
mankind, intollerable Traitors, Murderers, Idolaters;
when the ruine of the Countrey, Destruction of Religion
&amp; Liberty, and the wrath of God is threatened, in &amp; for
the impunity of that vermin of villains, and may be averted
by their destruction, always supposed, that these whose
office it is to do it decline their duty. The mind of our
Reformers as to this is manifest, both in their practice &amp;
opinion. We heard before of the slaughter of Cardinal
<hi>Beaton,</hi> and of the fidler <hi>Rizio:</hi> we shall find both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by <hi>Mr Knox,</hi> giving account how these that were
caryed Captives to <hi>France</hi> for this Cause from <hi>St Andrews</hi>
were delivered. <q>This (saith he) we write, to let the
posterity to come to understand, how potently God
wrought in preserving &amp; delivering of those, that had
but a small knowledge of His Truth, and for the love
of the same hazarded all; That if we in our days, or our
posterity that shall follow, shall see a dispersion of such
as oppose themselves to impiety, or take upon them to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41139:29"/>
punish the same otherwise then Laws of men will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
if such shall be left of men, yea as it were despised
&amp; punished of God: yet let us not damn the persons that
punish vice (and that for just cause) nor ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the same God that dejects will raise up again the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

&amp; vile Knave <hi>Davio</hi> was justly punished <hi>March</hi> 9. 1565.
by the Counsel &amp; hands of <hi>Iames Douglas</hi> Earle of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun,

most worthy of all praise, are now unworthily left of all
their Brethren.</q> This is not only commended by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
alone, but we find it concluded by all the Brethren at
that time, when the Queen brought in the Idol of the
Masse again, and the proud Papists began to avow it: then
<q>let it be marked that, The Brethren universally offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and espying that the Queen by Proclamation did but
delude them, determined to put to their own hands, and
to punish for example of others; And so some Priests in
the <hi>West</hi> Land were apprehended, Intimation was made
to others, as to the Abbot of <hi>Cosragnel,</hi> the Parson of
<hi>Sanquhar,</hi> and such, that they should neither complain
to the Queen nor Council, but should execute the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
that God has appointed to Idolaters in His
Law, by such means as they might, wherever they
should be apprehended.</q> Upon this the Queen sent for
<hi>Mr Knox,</hi> and dealt with him earnestly, that he would be
the instrument to perswade the people not to put hand to
punish. He perceiving her craft, willed her Maj. to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Malefactors according to Law, and he durst promise
quietness, upon the part of all them that professed Christ
within <hi>Scotland,</hi> but if her Maj. thought to delude the
Laws, he feared some would let the Papists understand,
that without punishment they should not be suffered so
manifestly to offend Gods Majestie. Will ye (quoth she)
allow they shall take my Sword in their hand? <q>The Sword
of Justice (said he) Madam is Gods, and is given to
Princes &amp; Rulers for one end; which if they transgress,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41139:29"/>
sparing the wicked &amp; oppressing the Innocents, they that
in the fear of God execute judgment, where God hath
commanded, offend not God, although Kings do it not:
the examples are evident, for <hi>Samuel</hi> spared not to slay
<hi>Agag</hi> the fat &amp; delicate King of <hi>Amalek,</hi> whom King
<hi>Saul</hi> had saved; Neither spared <hi>Elias Iezabels</hi> false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
&amp; <hi>Baals</hi> Priests, albeit that King <hi>Ahab</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
<hi>Phineas</hi> was no Magistrate, and yet feared he not
to strike <hi>Zimri</hi> &amp; <hi>Cozbi</hi> in the very act of filthy fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And so Madam your Maj. may see that others then
Magistrates may Lawfully punish, &amp; have punished the
vice &amp; crimes that God commands to be punished. He
proved it also at more length in his <hi>Appellation,</hi> from
<hi>Deut. 13. If thy Brother solicite thee secretly saying, let us go
serve other Gods, consent not to him, let not thine eye spare him
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> him; let thy hand be first upon him, and afterward the hand
of the whole people.</hi> Of these words of <hi>Moses,</hi> two things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to our purpose are to be noted: The first is,
that such as solicitate only to Idolatrie ought to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
to death, without favour or respect of person;
for He that will not suffer man to spare his son, wife, &amp;c.
will not wink at the Idolatry of others, of what state or
condition soever they be: It is not unknown that the
Prophets had Revelations of God, which were not
common to the people; Now if any man might have
claimed any priviledge from the rigor of the Law, or
might have justified his fact, it should have been the
Prophet, but God commands, that the Prophet that
shall so solicitate the people to serve strange Gods, shall
dye the death, notwithstanding that he alleadge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
dream, vision, or Revelation, because he teacheth
Apostacy from God: hereby it may be seen, that none
provoking the people to Idolatry ought to be exempted
from the punishment of death. Evident it is that no state,
condition, nor honour can exempt the Idolater from
the hands of God, when He shall call him to an account:
How shall it then excuse the people, that they, according
to Gods command, punish not to death such as shall
solicitate or violently draw the people to Idolatrie? The
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41139:30"/>
second, is that the punishment of such Crimes, as Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,
blasphemy, &amp; others that touch the Majestie of
God, doth not appertain to Kings &amp; chief Rulers only,
but also to the whole body of the people, and to every
member of the same, according to the vocation of every
man, and according to that possibility &amp; occasion which
God doth minister, to revenge the injury done against
His Glory: And that doth <hi>Moses</hi> more plainly speak in
these words of the same Chapter, <hi>If in any Citie which the
Lord thy God giveth thee, thou shalt hear this bruite, there are
some men sons of Belial</hi>—Plain it is that <hi>Moses</hi> speaks not
nor giveth charge to Kings, Rulers, &amp; Judges only; but
he commands the whole body of the people, yea and
every member of the same, according to their possibility.
And who dare be so impudent as to deny <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>his to be most
reasonable &amp; just? For seeing God had delivered the
whole body from bondage, and to the whole multitude
had given His Law, and to the twelve tribes had
distributed the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> was not the whole &amp;
every member addebted to confess the benefits of God,
and to study to keep the possession received? which they
could not do, except they kept the Religion established,
&amp; put out iniquity from amongst them. To the carnal
man this may seem to be a rigorous &amp; severe judgement,
that even the Infants there should be appointed to the
cruel death: and as concerning the City, and spoill of
the same, mans reason cannot think but that it might
have been better bestowed, than to be consumed. But
in such cases let all creatures stoup, and desist from
reasoning, when Commandment is given to execute
His Judgment. I will search no other reasons, than the
Holy Ghost hath assigned; first, that all <hi>Israel</hi> should
<hi>fear to commit the like abomination;</hi> And secondly, <hi>that the
Lord might turn from the fury of His anger:</hi> Which plainly
doth signifie, that by the defection &amp; Idolatry of a few,
Gods wrath is kindled against the whole, which is never
quenched, till such punishment be taken upon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
that whatsoever served them in their Idolatry
be brought to destruction &amp;c.</q> I have inlarged so far upon
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41139:30"/>
this Period, that it may appear, there is nothing now in
Controversy, between the suffering &amp; reproached party
now in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and either their Friends or Enemies,
which could fall under our Reformers inquiry; but they
have declared themselves of the same sentiments, that are
now so much opposed: And therefore none can condemn
the present heads of suffering, except also they condemn
the Reformers judgment; and consequently the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of novelty must fall.</p>

               <head>PERIOD. IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">Containing the Testimony of the first Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
against Prelacy and Supremacy, from
the year 1570. to 1638.</head>
               <p>HItherto the Conflict was for the Concerns of Christs
<hi>Prophetical</hi> &amp; <hi>Priestly</hi> Office, against <hi>Paganisine</hi> &amp;
<hi>Popery.</hi> But from the year 1570. And dounward,
the Testimony is stated, and gradually Prosecuted, for the
Rights, Priviledges, &amp; Prerogatives of Christs <hi>Kingly</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
which hath been the peculiar Glory of the Church of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> above all the Churches in the Earth, that this hath
been given to her as the word of her Testimony; and not
only Consequentially &amp; Reductively, as all other Churches
may challenge a part of this dignity, but Formally &amp; Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
to contend for this very head, <hi>The Headship &amp; King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Iesus Christ,</hi> the Prince of the Kings of the Earth,
and His Mediatory <hi>Supremacy</hi> over His oun Kingdom of
Grace, both visible &amp; Invisible. This is Christs supremacy,
a special radiant Jewel of His Imperial Croun: which, as
it hath been as explicitely incroached upon in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by
His Insolent Enemies, as ever by any that entered in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to Him; so it hath been more expressly witnessed
and wrestled for, by His suffering Servants in that Land,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41139:31"/>
than in any place of the world. This was in a particular
manner the Testimony of that <hi>Period,</hi> during the reign of
King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Sixth;</hi> as it hath been in a great measure in
our day, since the year 1660. Which, as it is the most
important Cause, of the greatest Consequence that Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
can contend for; So it hath this peculiar Glory in it,
that it is not only for a Truth of Christ, of greater value
then the standing of Heaven &amp; Earth, but also it is the very
Truth, for which Christ Himself died, considered as a
<hi>Martyr;</hi> And which concerns Him to vindicate &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as a Monarch. The Witnesses of that day made such
an high account of it, that they encouraged one another
to suffer for it, as the greatest Concern; <q>being a witness
for Christs Glorious &amp; free Monarchie, which as it is the
end of the other two Offices</q>, so the Testimony is more
Glorious to God, more honourable to His Son, and more
Comfortable to them, then the Testimony either for His
Prophetical office, or for His Priesthood, because His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was specially impugned at the time; As <hi>Mr Forbes</hi> &amp;
<hi>Mr Welsh</hi> write in a Letter to the Ministers at Court. The
Corruptions &amp; Usurpations wronging this Truth, that they
contended against, were <hi>Prelacy</hi> and the Kings <hi>Supremacy</hi>
in Ecclesiastical matters: which will be usefull to hint a
litle, how they Prosecuted the Conflict. When Sathan
(whose Kingdom was then declining) by several instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
&amp; means, both by force &amp; fraud, did endeavour to
put a stop to the Reformation, by reintroducing the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Hierarchy of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> when he could not reesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the Antichristian Doctrine of Popery; he left no
means unessayed to effectuate it. And first he began to
bring the name <hi>Bishop</hi> in request, that was now growing
obsolete &amp; odious, by reason of the abuse of it (as it ought
to be still; for though the name be found in the Scriptures,
yet neither is that Catechrestical application of it to Prelats
to be sound, nor was there any other reason for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of it after that manner, except it were to please
Princes; seeing the native signification of it is <hi>an Overseer,</hi>
proper and common to all faithfull Pastors.) And indeed his
first essay reached litle further then the bare name, for they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41139:31"/>
were to be subject to &amp; tryed by Assemblies, and hardly
had so much power as Superintendents before. But it was
a fine Court-juggle for Noblemen, to get the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
into their hands, by restoring the Ecclesiastical
titles, and obtaining from the titulars either Temporal
Lands, or Pensions to their dependers: so they were only
<hi>Tulchan</hi> Bishops, a Calfeskin to cause the Cow give milk.
Yet, though this in our day would have been thought tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable;
The faithful Servants of Christ did zealously op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it. <hi>Mr Knox</hi> denunced <hi>Anathema</hi> to the Giver, and
<hi>Anathema</hi> to the Receiver. And the following Assembly
condemned the office it self, as having <q>no sure warrant,
authority, nor ground in the Book of God, but brought
in by the folly &amp; corruption of mens invention, to the
overthrow of the Church; and ordained all that brooked
the office, to dimit <hi>simpliciter,</hi> and to desist &amp; cease from
preaching, while they received <hi>de novo</hi> admission from
the Generall Assembly, under the pain of excomunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
Hereby they were awakened &amp; animated, to a more
vigorous Prosecution of the establishment of the House of
God, in its due Government. In pursuance whereof,
the Assemblies from that time untill the year 1581. Did
with much painfulness &amp; faithfulness attend the work; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till,
by perfecting of the <hi>Second Book of Discipline,</hi> they
compleated their work, in the exact Model of <hi>Presbyterial
Government,</hi> in all its Courts &amp; Officers. Which was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
&amp; Covenanted to be kept inviolate, in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Covenant,</hi> subscribed that year by the King, his Court,
&amp; Council; and afterwards by all ranks of People in the
Land. Whence it may be doubted, whether the impudence
of the succeeding Prelats that denyed this, or their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
in breaking of it, be greater. This was but the first
brush: a brisker assault followes. Wherein, for the better
establishment of Prelacy, that what it wants of Divine
right, might be supplyed by the accession of humane Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
and not only <hi>Diocesan</hi> but also <hi>Erastian</hi> Prelacy
might be set up, to destroy Christs Kingdom &amp; advance
Sathans; the Earle of <hi>Arran</hi> &amp; his wicked Complices,
move the King, contrary both to the Word &amp; Oath of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41139:32"/>
God, to usurp the prerogative of Jesus Christ, and assume
to himself, a blasphemous Monster of <hi>Supremacy, over
all Persons, &amp; in all Causes, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil.</hi> But this
also the faithful Servants of God did worthily &amp; valiantly
resist: and at the very first appearance of it, gave in a Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to the King, <hi>anno</hi> 1582. <q>That he had taken upon
him a spiritual Power, which properly belongs to Christ,
as only King &amp; Head of the Church; the Ministerie &amp;
execution whereof, is only given to such as bear office
in the Ecclesiastical Government in the same: so that in
the Kings Person, some men press to erect a new <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
as though he could not be full King of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
unless as well the spiritual as temporal
Sword be put in his hand, unless Christ be rest of His
Authority, and the two Jurisdictions confounded, which
God hath divided, which directly tendeth to the wrack
of all true Religion.</q> Which being presented by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of the General Assembly; the Earle of <hi>Arran</hi>
asked, with a frouning Countenance, who dare subscribe
these treasonable Articles? <hi>Mr Andrew Melvin</hi> answered,
we dare, &amp; will subscribe, &amp; render our Lives in the
Cause. And afterward, that same Assembly presented
Articles, shewing, that <q>seeing the spiritual Jurisdiction of
the Church, is granted by Christ, and given only to
them, that by preaching, teaching, &amp; overseeing, bear
Office within the same, to be exercised, not by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
of men, but by the only Rule of Gods Word
—hereafter, no other of whatsomever degree, or
under whatsomever pretence, have any colour to ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be,
or to take upon them any part thereof, either in
placing or displacing of Ministers, without the Churches
admission, or in stopping the mouths of Preachers, or
puting them to silence, or take upon them the judgment
of tryal of Doctrine &amp;c.</q> But in contempt &amp; contradiction
to this, and to prosecute &amp; exert this new usurped Power,
<hi>Mr Andrew Melvin</hi> was summoned before the secret
Council, for a Sermon of his, applying his doctrine to
the Times Corruptions: whereupon he gave in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinature
against them as incompetent Judges; and told
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41139:32"/>
them, <q>they were too bold, in a Constitute Christian
Church, to pass by the Pastors, Prophets, &amp; Doctors,
and to take upon them to judge the Doctrine, and to
control the Ambassadors of a Greater then was there,
which they neither ought nor can do. There are (saith
he, Loosing a litle Hebrew Bible from his girdle) my
Instructions &amp; Warrant: see if any of you can control
me, that I have past my injunctions.</q> For this he was
decerned, to be warded in the Castle of <hi>Edinbrugh,</hi> but he
being informed, that if he entered in ward he would not
be released, unless it were for the scaffold, he conveyed
himself secretly out of the Countrey. Hereafter when the
Parliament 1584. had enacted this Supremacy, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to Prelacy, to be subscribed by all Ministers; the
faithful first directed <hi>Mr David Lindsey</hi> to the King, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
that nothing be done in Parliament prejudicial to the
Churches Liberty: who got the Prison of <hi>Blackness</hi> for his
Pains. And then when they could not get access for shut
doors to Protest before the Parliament; yet, when the
Acts were proclaimed at the Cross of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> they took
publick Documents, in name of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>
(though they were but two) that they protested against the
said Acts: and fled to <hi>England,</hi> leaving behind them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that moved them to do so. And <hi>Mr Iames Melvin</hi>
wrote against the subscribers at that time very pertinently:
Proving, first, that they had not only set up a new <hi>Pope,</hi>
                  <q>&amp; so become Traitors to Christ, and condiscended to
that chief error of Papistrie, whereupon all the rest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend;
but further, in so doing they had granted more to
the King, than ever the Popes of Rome peaceably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
&amp;c.</q> And in the end, as for those that Lamented
their oun weakness &amp; feebleness, he adviseth them, to
remove the publick slander, by going boldly to the King &amp;
Lords, <q>and shew them how they had fallen through
weakness, but by Gods power are risen again; and there
by publick note &amp; witness taken, free themselves from
that subscription, and to will the same to be delete, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
&amp; detesting it plainly, and thereafter publickly
in their Sermons, and by their Declaration &amp; retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41139:33"/>
in writ,</q> presented to the faithful, manifest the same,
let them do with stipend, benefice, &amp; Life it self what
they list. This I insert, because this Counsel is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and when poor people, offended with Ministers
subscriptions of Bonds &amp; other Complyances, desire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
of the offence, they reject it as an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
imposition, and plead they are not obliged to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
any retractation but to an Ecclesiastical Judicatory.
To which I shall say nothing here, but this is no novelty.
After this, it is known what bickerings the faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of Christ had, in their Conflicts with this supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
upon the account of <hi>Mr David Blacks</hi> Declinature,
which they both advised him to, &amp; approved when he gave
it in, against the King &amp; Conncil as Judges of his Doctrine.
And the Commissioners of the General Assembly ordained
all, to deal mightily with the power of the word, against
the Councils encroachments; for which they were charged
to depart forth of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> After which he added a second
Declinature: Declaring, <q>there are two Jurisdictions in
this realme, the one Spiritual the other Civil; the one
respecting the Conscience, the other externals; &amp;c.—
Therefore, in so far as he was one of the spiritual office-bearers,
and had discharged his spiritual Calling in some
measure of grace &amp; sincerity, should not nor could not
be Lawfully judged, for preaching and applying the word,
by any Civil power; he being an Ambassadour &amp; Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of the Lord Jesus, having his Commission from
the King of Kings, and all his instructions set doun &amp;
limited in the book of God, that cannot be extended,
abridged, or altered by any mortal wight, King or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
And seeing he was sent to all sorts, his Commission
&amp; discharge of it should not nor cannot be Lawfuly, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by them to whom he was sent; they being sheep &amp;
not Pastors, to be judged by the Word and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t to be
judges thereof in a judicial way.</q> The <hi>Interloquutor</hi>
being past against him for this; the Brethren thought it
duty, that the Doctrine of the Preachers should be directed
against the said <hi>Interloquutor,</hi> as against a strong &amp; mighty
hold set up against the Lord Jesus, and the freedom of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41139:33"/>
Gospel; and praised God for the force &amp; unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that was among themselves. And being charged to
depart out of Toun, they leave a faithful Declaration at
Large; shewing, how the Liberties of the Church were
invaded &amp; robbed: But all this was nothing, in comparison
of their wrestlings for the Royalties of their Princely Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and Priviledges of His Kingdom, against that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
Insolencies, after he obtained he Croun of <hi>England.</hi>
For then he would not suffer the Church to indict her oun
Assemblies. And when the faithful thought themselves
obliged to counteract his Encroachments, and therefore
conveened in an Assembly at <hi>Aberdeen, anno</hi> 1605. they
were forced to dissolve: and thereafter, the most eminent
of the Ministers there assembled, were transported Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
to <hi>Black-ness.</hi> Whence being cited befor the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
they decline their Judicatory. And one of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<hi>Mr Robert Youngson,</hi> who had formerly succumbed,
being moved in Conscience, returned: and when the rest
were standing before the Council, desired to be heard; and
acknowledged his fault, and therefore, howbeit not
summoned by the Lords, was charged by the Living God,
and compelled to compear that day, to justifie that Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
to the great astonishment of the Lords, and comfort
of His brethren; He subscribed the Declinature with
the rest: And for this they were arraigned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
as guilty of Treason, and banished. Before
the execution of which sentence, <hi>Mr Welsh</hi> wrote to
the Lady <hi>Fleming,</hi> to this effect. <q>What am I, that He
should first have called me, and then constituted me a
Minister of glad things, of the Gospel of Salvation, these
fifteen years already, and now last of all to be a sufferer
for His Cause &amp; Kingdom? To witness that good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
that Jesus Christ is the King of Saints, and that
His Church is a most free Kingdom, yea as free as any
Kingdom under Heaven, not only to convocate, hold
&amp; keep her Meetings, Conventions, &amp; Assemblies:
But also to judge of all her affairs in all her Meetings &amp;
Conventions, among His members and Subjects. These
two points. (1) That Christ is the Head of His Church.
(2) That she is free in her Government from all other ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41139:34"/>
except Christs, are the special Cause of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
being now convict as Traitors, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
thereof. We have now been waiting with joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to give the last Testimonie of our blood in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
thereof. If it would please our God to be so
favourable, as to honour us with that dignity.</q> After
this, the King resolving by Parliament to advance the
estate of Bishops again, as in the time of Popery, without
Cautions as before; and further to establish not only that
Antichristian Hierarchie, but an Erastian Supremacy: The
faithful Ministers of Christ, thought themselves bound in
Conscience to protest. And accordingly they offered a
faithful Protestation to the Parliament <hi>Iulij</hi>—1606. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing,
that they would reserve into the Lords own hands,
<q>that Glory which He will communicate neither with
man nor Angel, to wit, to prescribe from His holy
Mountain a Lively pattern, according to which His
oun Tabernacle should be formed: Remembring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that there is no absolute &amp; undoubted Anthority
in this world, except the soveraigne Authority of Christ
the King; to vvhom it belongeth as properly to rule the
Church, according to the good pleasure of His oun
vvill, as it belongeth to Him to save His Church by the
Merit of His oun Sufferings: All other anthority is so
intrenched vvithin the marches of Divine Command,
that the least overpassing of the bounds set by God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
bring men under the fearful expectation of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
&amp; Eternal judgements.—If ye should authorize
Bishops, ye should bring into the Church the ordinance
of man, vvhich experience hath found, to have been
the ground of that Antichristian Hierarchie, vvhich
mounted up on the steps of Bishops preeminence, until
that man of sin came forth, as the ripe fruit of mans vvise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
vvhom God shall consume vvith the breath of
His oun mouth. Let the svvord of God pierce that belly,
vvhich brought forth such a monster: And let the staff of
God crush that egg, vvhich hath hatched such a Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice:
And let not only that <hi>Roman</hi> Antichrist be thrown
down from the high bench of his usurped authority, but
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41139:34"/>
also let all the steps whereby he mounted up to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
preeminence, be cut down &amp; utterly abolished in
this Land: And beware to strive against God with an
open displayed banner, by building up again the walls of
<hi>Iericho,</hi> which the Lord hath not only cast down, but
also hath laid them under an horrible Interdiction &amp; exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
so that the building of them again must needs
stand to greater charges to the builders, then the reedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of <hi>Iericho,</hi> to <hi>Hiel</hi> the <hi>Bethelite</hi> in the days of <hi>Ahab.</hi>
                  </q>
Yet notwithstanding of all opposition, Prelacy was again
restored in Parliament. And to bring all to a Complyance
with the same, Presbytries &amp; Synods universally charged,
under highest pains, to admit a <hi>constant Moderator</hi> without
change: which many refused resolutely, as being the first
step of Prelacy. Upon this followed a great Persecution of
the faithful, for their <hi>Nonconformity,</hi> managed by that
Mongrel &amp; Monstrous kind of Court, made up of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
&amp; Statesmen, called <hi>the High Commission Court,</hi> erected
<hi>anno</hi> 1610. whereby many honest men were put violently
from their charges &amp; habitations; the Generality were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in a great &amp; fearful Defection. But the Copestone
of the wickedness of that <hi>Period,</hi> was the Ratification of
the <hi>five Articles of Perth; kneeling at the Communion, private
Communion to be given to the sick, private Baptisme,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of Children by the Bishop,</hi> and <hi>observation of festival
dayes.</hi> Which were much opposed &amp; testified against by the
faithful, from their first hatching <hi>anno</hi> 1618. to the year
1621. when they were ratified in Parliament: at what time
they were also witnessed against from Heaven, by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Lightenings &amp; Tempest. And against this the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the faithful continued, till the Revolution <hi>anno</hi>
1638. Here we see how the Cause was stated in this <hi>Period;</hi>
and may gather also, wherein it aggress, and how far it
differs from the present Testimony, now suffered for under
all rage &amp; reproach.</p>
               <p>I. The matter of the Testimony was one with that that
we are suffering for, against Popery, Prelacy, &amp; Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy;
except that it was not so far extended against
<hi>Tyranny,</hi> because that Tyrant was not such an usurper,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41139:35"/>
nor such a violater of the fundamental constitutions of the
Civil Government, as these that we have had to do with
all. But as to the managing the Testimony, they far out
stripped their successors in this generation, in conduct &amp;
courage, Prudence &amp; zeal, as is above hintend in many
instances: to which we may adde some more. When se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
plots of Papist Lords had been discovered, conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> And they were by the Kings
Indulgence favoured, and some were also perswaded to
treat with them: famous <hi>Mr Davidson</hi> opposed with great
resolution; Declaring before the Synod of <hi>Lothian,</hi> that it
favoured much of defection in these dayes, <q>that such no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
rebells to God, His Church, &amp; the Country,
should be so treated with; we should not rashly open a
door to Gods Enemies, without better proof of their
manners nor were yet seen.</q> And when a convention in
<hi>Falkland</hi> was consulting to call home these conspiring Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
<hi>Mr Andrew Melvin</hi> went thither uncalled; and when
found fault with by the King for his boldness, he answered,
<q>Sir, I have a call to come here from Christ &amp; His Church,
who have special Interest in this Turn, and against
whom this Convention is assembled directly: I charge
yow, and your Estates, in the Name of Christ &amp; His
Church, that ye favour not His Enemies whom He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
nor go about to call home nor make Citizens of
these, who have traiterously sought to betray their City &amp;
native Countrey, with the overthroiw of Chists Kingdom.</q>
And further challenged them of <hi>treason against Christ,</hi> His
Church &amp; the Countrey, in that purpose they were about.
About the same time in a private Conference with the
King, he called the King <hi>Gods sillie vassal;</hi> and taking him
by the sleeve, told him; Sir, yow, and Church &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
is like to be wracked for not telling the Truth, <q>and
giving yow faithful Counsel; we must discharge our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or else be enemies to Christ &amp; yow: Therefore I must
tell yow, there are two Kings and two Kingdoms; There
is Christ and His Kingdom, whose subject King
<hi>Iames the</hi> 6th is, and of whose Kingdom he is not a King,
nor a Head, nor a Lord, but a member, and they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41139:35"/>
vvhom Christ hath called to vvatch over &amp; govern his
Church, have sufficient Authority, and Power from
Him, which no Christian King should control but assist,
othervvise they are not faithfull subjects to Christ. Sir,
vvhen yovv vvere in your svvedling clouts, Christ
reigned freely in this Land, in spight of all His enemies;
but novv the vvisdom of your Council, vvhich is Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
&amp; pernicious, is this, that yovv may be served of
all sorts of men to your purpose &amp; grandour, <hi>Iew</hi> &amp;
Gentile, Papist &amp; Protestant, because the Ministers &amp;
Protestants in <hi>Scotland</hi> are too strong, &amp; control the
King, they must be vveakened &amp; brought lovv, by stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up a party against them, and the King being equal &amp;
indifferent, both shall be fain to flee to him, so shall
he be well setled: But, Sir, let Gods wisedom be the
only wisdom, this will prove meer &amp; mad folly; for
His curse cannot but light upon it, so that in seeking both
yow shall lose both. To the like effect, <hi>Mr Robert Bruce,</hi>
in a Sermon upon <hi>Psal,</hi> 51. gives faithful warning of the
danger of the times. It is not we (sayes he) that are
Partie in this cause; no, the quarrel is betwixt a greater
Prince and them. What are we, but sillie men? Yet it
has pleased Him to set us in this Office, that we should
oppone to the manifest usurpation that is made upon His
Spiritual Kingdom. Is there a more forcible mean to
draw down the wrath of God, than to let <hi>Barrabas</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitate
Malefactor pass free, and to begin the war against
Christ and His Ministry. It puteth on the Copestone,
that so many of our brethren should not be so faithful, as
their Calling &amp; this Cause craveth. Fy upon false bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
to see them dumb, so faint hearted, when it
comes to the Chock: Not only are they ashamed to
speak the thing they think, which is a shame in a Pastor,
but speak directly against their former Doctrin. They
will speak the Truth a while, till they be put at, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent
they will turn and make their gifts weapons to
fight against Christ; for there is none so malicious as an
Apostate when he begins to slide back &amp;c.</q> The same
faithful witness, because he would not preach as the King
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41139:36"/>
would have him, against his oun conscience, to justifie &amp;
Proclaim the Kings Innocency, in a forged conspiracy
against him, was put from his Church in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and
being requested in an insinuating manner to desist from
preaching but for nine or ten dayes; he condiscended at
first, thinking the matter of no great importance: yet that
night his body was cast in a fever, with the terror of his
conscience, and he promised he should never obey their
Commandment any more. These were faithful men, yet
we find they challenge themselves in deep humiliation, for
their short comings &amp; defections, at the renovation of the
National Covenant, <hi>March,</hi> 30. 1596. the greatst so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
ever had been seen in <hi>Scotland</hi> before that time, so
that the place might worthily have been called <hi>Bochim.</hi> O
when shall we see such a day, when even the most faithful
among us, shall mourn over our far more aggravated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections!
but if they mourned then for these first degrees of
declensions, we may say, <hi>quam gravius ingemiscerent illi for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
viri, qui propter Ecclesiae Scoticanae Libertatem. olim in acie
decertarunt, si nostram hanc ignaviam (ne quid gravius dicam)
conspicerent!</hi> I know notwithstanding of all this, that some
encourage themselves in a base Complyance with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
corruptions of our Church, from the practise of these
Worthies; Alledging, they did not scruple to hear &amp; join
with Prelatical men, dispensing the ordinances. But this
Objection will be easily refelled, if we consider, first, the
<hi>Period</hi> wherein they were but growing up to a more perfect
Reformation, and therefore might bear with many things
which we cannot, after we have been reformed from
them: They were then advancing and still gaining ground,
we are now declining, and therefore should be more shie
to lose what we have gained. They had then of a long time
enjoyed their Judicatories, unto which they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
for an orderly redress of such grievances that offended
them; and when they were deprived of them, yet they were
still in hopes of recovering them, and so suspended their
total secession from that corrupt Church, untill they should
recover them; in the mean time still holding their right and
maintaining their cause against these Invaders. But we
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41139:36"/>
were at thevery first begining of this unhappy Revolution,
totally deprived of our Judicatories, and denuded of all
expectation of them in an ordinary way, and of all place,
but what they are Masters of to contend with them that
way; therefore must keep our selves free of their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
But next if we consider their practise, we shall find
these Worthies vvere not such <hi>Conformists,</hi> as our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyers
vvould make them. What if vve find among them
<hi>Meetings,</hi> that vvere Called &amp; Counted as Seditious &amp;
Schismatick, as Ours are novv? vve find a <hi>field Meeting,</hi>
yea a General Assembly, at <hi>Dumfermling</hi> vvithout &amp; against
the Kings vvarrant, vvhen the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ports vvere shut against
them, <hi>anno</hi> 1585. But that is not so pat to the purpose,
as that vve find <hi>Private-Meetings</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and that in
the very time of publick Service in the Churches, dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by open Proclamation <hi>anno</hi> 1624. vvherein it is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
that they had no respect to the ordinary Pastors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
&amp; impugned their Doctrine, disobeyed &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled
their Discipline, abstained to hear the Word
preached, and to Participate of the Sacraments. And
long before that, vve find the sincerer sort scrupled to hear
Bishop <hi>Adamson,</hi> not withstanding that he vvas absolved
in the Assembly. And that aftervvards, the doubt being
proponed to the Assembly, if it be a slander to a Christian,
to absent himself from the Sermons of them that are sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
from all function in the Ministry. The Assembly
Ansvvered, there is no slander in the Case but rather it is
slanderous to resort. And why is not this ground to think
it slanderous or scandalous to resort to them, who deserve
to be suspended (all of them by a Spiritual cognizance,
and some of them to be <hi>suspended</hi> Corporally, for their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie)
when there can be no access orderly to do it. And
the rather, because we find in this Period, that sometimes
Ministers were so faithful &amp; zealous against the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Ministry, that they decerned Ministers to
be suspended for far smaller faults, than many now could
exempt themselves from; <hi>viz.</hi> if they were not powerful &amp;
Spiritual, if they did not apply their Doctrine to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
if they were obscure &amp; too Scholastick before
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41139:37"/>
the people, cold &amp; wanting zeal, flatterers, dissembling
at publick sins for flattery or fear &amp;c. As we may read in
the <hi>Advice of the Brethren, deputed for penning the Corruptions
in the Ministery, anno</hi> 1596. I wish our silent prudent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
now would consider the justness of this Censure, and
what ground people have to be offended at such censura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness.
But not only this may answer the false imputation
of Conformity on these witnesses of Christ at that time,
but I shall set down a part of a Letter of one of the banished
Ministers at that time, discovering his mind about <hi>hearing</hi>
these men, that were then serving the times. <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Mr Iohn
Welsh,</hi> writing to <hi>Mr Robert Bruce,</hi>
                     </bibl>—what my mind is
concerning the root of these branches, the bearer will
shew yow more fully. They are no more to be counted
Orthodox, but Apostates; They have fallen from their
Callings by receiving an Antichristian, and bringing in
of Idolatrie, to make the Kingdom culpable, and to
expose it to fearful Judgments, for such an high perfidie
against an Oath so sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mnly enacted &amp; given; And are
no more to be counted Christians, but strangers, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
&amp; Persecutors, And therefore <hi>not to be heard any
more,</hi> either in publick, or in Consistories, Colledges,
or Synods; for what fellowship hath light with darkness?</q>
We see then as to that part of the Testimony, they were
not dissonant to the vvitness of the present reproached suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers.</p>
               <p>II. As the matter &amp; manner of their Testimony against
all the invaders of the Churches priviledges, did speak
forth a great deal of sincere &amp; pure zeal; so their <hi>practice</hi>
was conform, shewing forth a great deal of strictness, and
aversness from all sinfull Complyances, even with things
that would be now accounted of very minute &amp; inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
consequence, and for which honest sufferers now
are flouted at as fools. When that Oath was formed for
acknowledging the Supremacy, there was a Clause added
which might have been thought to salve the matter, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Word of God.</hi> I fear many now would not stand
to subscribe, with such a qualification. Yet the faithful
then perceived the Sophistrie, that it made it rather worse,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41139:37"/>
affirming that that brat of Hell was according to the word
of God: And therefore, though there were several emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
men to perswade them to it both by advice &amp; example,
yet they could not in conscience Comply; And pleaded
also from the illegality of that imposition, that they should
be charged with the subscription of Laws, a thing never
required before of any subject; if they offended against the
Laws, why might they not be punished according to the
Laws? When many honest faithful Patriots, for their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
at <hi>Ruthven</hi> to deliver the Countrey from a vermine
of Villains that abused the King, to the destruction of the
Church &amp; Kingdom, were charged to crave <hi>Pardon,</hi> &amp;
take remission; they would do neither, judging it a base
condemning of duty: which puts a brand upon our sneaking
Supplicators, &amp; Petitioners, &amp; Pardon-mongers, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to be called the race of such Worthies, who scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such baseness, and choosed rather to endure the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of their unjust Sentences, of Intercommuning &amp;
Banishment &amp;c. And when the Earle of <hi>Gowrie</hi> accepted
of a Remission, he afterwards condemned himself for it,
and desired that his old friends would accept of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
to whom he had made himself justly suspected.
<hi>Mr Black,</hi> when he had the same favour offered to him,
refused altogether, left so doing he should condemn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and approve the Courts Proceedings: And the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
confering with the Councellors, craving that some
penalty should be condiscended unto for satisfying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
in his honour, would not condiscend to any how
light soever; lest thereby they should seem to approve the
Judicatorie &amp; their Proceeding. The Imprisoned Ministers,
for declining the Council, had it in their offer, that if they
would without any confession of offence only submit
themselves to his Majestie, <hi>pro scandalo, accepto non dato,</hi>
they should be restored to their places: But it pleased God
so to strengthen them, that they stopped their Mouths, and
convinced them in their Consciences, that they could not
do it without betraying of the Cause of Christ. Again in
another case, we have Instances of such strictness, as is
much scorned now a dayes. The Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:41139:38"/>
were committed to ward, for refusing to pray for the
Queen, before her execution in <hi>Forthringam</hi> Castle 1586.
they refused not simply to pray for her, but for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of her life, as if she had been innocent of the crimes
laid to her charge, which had imported a condemnation
of the proceedings against her. Afterwards in the year
1600. the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> would not praise God
for the deliverie of the King, from a pretended Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
of the Earle of <hi>Gowrie</hi> at that time, of which they had
no credit nor assurance; and would not crave Pardon for
it neither. For this <hi>Mr Robert Bruce</hi> was deprived of the
exercise of his Ministry, and never obtained it again in
<hi>Edinburgh:</hi> But now for refusing such compelled &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Devotion, to pray or praise for the King, poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are much condemned. I know it is alleadged, that
these faithful sufferers in those days, were not so strict as
they are now, in submitting to unjust Sentences, and
obeying &amp; keeping their Confinements. I shall grant, there
was much of this, and much might be tollerate in their
circumstances, when the Court procedure against them
was not so illegal, their Authority was not so Tyrannical,
nor so necessary to be disouned, and they were so
stated, that they were afrayed to take guilt upon them, in
making their escapes: whereas it is not so with us. Yet
we find very faithful men broke their Confinements: As
<hi>Mr Iohn Murray,</hi> confined about <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> perceiving
there was no end of the Bishops malice, and that he would
be in no worse case than he was, he resolved without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
either of King or Council to transport himself: So
did also <hi>Mr Robert Bruce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. For resistence of Superior Powers, we have in this
Period, first the practice of some Noblemen an <hi>Ruthven,
anno</hi> 1582. who took the King, and seised on that Arrant
Traitor, Enemy to the Church &amp; Countrey, the Earle of
<hi>Arran;</hi> declaring to the world the Causes of it, the Kings
Correspondence with Papists, his usurping the Supremacy
over the Church, and oppressing the Ministers, all by
means of his wicked Councellors, whom therefore they
removed from him. The King himself emitted a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41139:38"/>
allowing this deed. The General Assembly approved
of it, and perswaded to a Concurrence with it, and nothing
was wanting to ratifie it, as a most Lawfull &amp; laudable
action. At length the Fox escapes, &amp; changes all, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
his former Declaration. The Lords again rallie, and
interprise the taking of the Castle of <hi>Stirling,</hi> and gain it;
but afterward surrender it: after which the Earle of <hi>Gowrie</hi>
is executed, and Ministers are commanded to retract the
Approbation of <hi>Ruthven</hi> business, but they refused: and
many were forced to flee to <hi>England,</hi> and the Lords were
banished. But in the year 1585. they return with more suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and take the Castle of <hi>Stirling.</hi> The cowardly King
does again acknowledge &amp; justify their Enterprise, <hi>that
they needed no Apology of words, Weapons had spoken well enough,
and gotten them audience to clear their own Cause:</hi> but his after
carriage declared him as crafty &amp; false, as he was cowardly
&amp; fearful. Again we have the advice of the General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
for resisting, when the Ministers were troubled,
upon <hi>Mr Blacks</hi> bussiness, and there was an intention to
pull them out of their Pulpits: They advised them to stand
to the discharge of their Calling, if their flocks would save
them from violence, and yet this violence was expected
from the King and his Emissaries. As to that point then
there can be no dispute.</p>
               <p>IV. There was litle occasion for the Question about the
Kings Authority in this Period, but generally all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
it: because they were not sensible of his usurpation,
and his cowardice made him incapable of attempting any
thing that might raise commotions in civil things. Yet we
remark, that whatsoever Authority he usurped beyond his
sphere, that was disouned &amp; declined by all the Faithful, as
the Supremacy. Next that they resented, &amp; represented
very harshly, any aspiring to <hi>Absoluteness;</hi> as <hi>Mr Andrew
Melvin</hi> could give it no better name, nor intertain no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
notion of it, then to terme it, <hi>The bloodie Guillie,</hi> as he
inveighs against it in the Assembly, 1582. And next, in
this same Period, we have a very good description of that
Authority, which the King himself allowes not to be
ouned, which out of a Kings mouth abundantly justifies
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41139:39"/>
the disouning of the present Tyrannie: This same King
<hi>Iames,</hi> in a speech to the Parliament in the year 1609.
sayth, <hi>A King degenerateth into a Tyrant, when he leaveth to
rule by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, much more when he beginneth to invade his Subjects
Persons, Rights, &amp; Liberties, to set up an Arbitrary Power,
impose unlawful taxes, raise forces, make War upon his Subjects,
to pillage, plunder, wast, and spoil his Kingdoms.</hi>

            </div>
            <div n="5" type="subpart">
               <head>PERIOD. V.</head>
               <head type="sub">Containing the Testimony for the last Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
from Prelacy, in all its steps, from
the year 1638, to 1660.</head>
               <p>THe following <hi>Period,</hi> from the year 1638. to 1660,
continues &amp; advances the Testimony, to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
hight of Purity &amp; Power, that either this Church
or any other did ever arrive unto, with a Gradation, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
&amp; Complication of wonders, of Divine Wisdom,
Power, Justice &amp; Mercy, signally &amp; singularly ouning &amp;
sealing it, to the Confusion of His Enemies, Comfort of
His People, Conviction of Indifferent Neutrals, and
Consternation of All. Now after a long winter, and night
of Deadness &amp; Darkness, the sun returns with an amiable
approach of Light &amp; Life: now the winter was past, the
rain was over &amp; gone, the flowers appear on the earth, and
the time of singing of birds is come, and the voice of the
turtle is heard in our Land. Now the second time, the
Testimony comes to be managed in an <hi>Active</hi> manner,
as before it was <hi>Passive:</hi> As the one hath been alwayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to follow interchangably upon the other, especially
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Last alwayes the Greatest; which
gives ground to hope, though it be now our turn to suffer,
that when the summer comes again after this winter, and
the day after this night, the next Active Testimony shall
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41139:39"/>
be more notable than any that went before. The matter of
the Testimony was the same as before, for the Concerns
of Christs <hi>Kingly</hi> Prerogative, but with some more increase
as to its opposites: for these grew successively in every
Period, the Last alwayes including all that went before.
The first Period had <hi>Gentilisme</hi> principally to deal with, the
second <hi>Poperie,</hi> The third <hi>Poperie</hi> &amp; Tyrannie, the fourth
<hi>Prelacy</hi> &amp; <hi>Supremacy,</hi> this fifth hath all together, and <hi>Sectaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme</hi>
also, to contend against. The former had alwayes the
opposites on one hand, but this hath them in extremes on
both hands; both fighting against one another, and both
fighting together against the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and she
against both, till at length one of her opposites prevailed,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Secterian</hi> Party, and that prevailing brought in the
other, to wit, the <hi>Malignant,</hi> which now domineers over
all together. Wherefore, because this Period is in it self
of so great importance, the Revolutions therein emergent
so eminent, the Reformation therein prosecuted wanting
litle of its perfect Complement; the Deformation suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in its Deviation from the Pattern being so destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive;
to the end it may be seen from whence we have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
and whether or not the present reproached Sufferers
have lost or left their ground, we must give a short de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the Rise, Progress, &amp; End of the Contendings
of that Period.</p>
               <p>In the midst of the forementioned Miseries &amp; Mischiefs,
that the pride of Prelacy and Tyrannical Supremacy had
multiplied beyond measure upon this Church &amp; Nation,
and at the hight of all their haughtiness, when they were
setting up their <hi>Dagon,</hi> and erecting Altars for him, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the <hi>Service-book,</hi> and book of <hi>Canons</hi> &amp;c. the Lord in
Mercy remembered His people, and surprised them with
a sudden unexpected Deliverance, by very despicable
means; even the opposition of a few weak women, at the
beginning of that Contest, which, ere it was quashed, made
the Tyrant tumble headless off his throne. The zeal
against the <hi>English popish Ceremonies,</hi> obtruded on <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
did first inflame some feminine hearts to witness
their detestation of them; but afterwards was followed out
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41139:40"/>
with more Masculine fervor, accosting King &amp; Council

against all that would innovate or invade them.
To fortifie which, and conciliate the favour both of God
&amp; man in the Resolution, All the Lovers of God, and
friends to the Liberty of the Nation, did solemnly Renew
the <hi>National Covenant</hi> (wherein they were signally coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced

the Condemnation of Prelatical <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> and clearly
enough confirming Presbyterial Government, yet they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
into it vvith an inlargment, to suspend the practice
of Novations already introduced, and the approbation of
the Corruptions of the present Government, vvith the
late places &amp; povver of Church men, till they be tried in
a free General Assembly. Which vvas obtaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that same
year, and indicted at <hi>Glasgow:</hi> and there, not vvith stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the opposition that the Kings Commissioner could
make, by Protestations &amp; Proclamations to dissolve it, the
six preceeding Assemblies establishing Prelacy vvere an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled,
The <hi>Service-Book,</hi> and <hi>high Commission</hi> vvere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
All the <hi>Bishops</hi> vvere deposed, and their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
declared to be abjured in that National Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
though many had, through the Commissioners,
persvvasions, subscribed it in another sense vvithout that
application: As also the <hi>five Articles of Perth</hi> vvere there
discovered, to have been inconsistent vvith that Covenant
&amp; Confession, and the Civil places &amp; povver of Church
men vvere disproved &amp; rejected: on the other hand <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial
Government</hi> vvas Justified &amp; Approved, and an Act
vvas passed for their keeping yearly General Assemblies.
This was a bold begining, into which they were animated
with more than humane resolution, against more than
humane opposition, Hell as well as the powers of the earth
being set against them. But when the Lord gave the Call,
they considered not their oun deadness, nor were daunted
with Discouragments, nor staggered at the promise through
unbelief, but gave Glory to God, out braving all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41139:40"/>
Which in the following year were much increased,
by the Prelats and their Popish Partakers, rendevouzing
their forces under the Kings Personal Standart, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing
nothing but misery to the zealous Covenanters: yet
when they found them prepared to resist, were forced to
yeeld to a Pacification, concluding that an Assembly &amp;
Parliament should be held for healing all grievances of
Church and State. In which Assembly, at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the
Covenant is ratified &amp; subscribed by the Earle of <hi>Traquair</hi>
Commissioner, and enjoined to be subscribed by the body
of the whole Land, with an explication expressly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the five <hi>Articles of Perth,</hi> the Government of
Bishops, the Civil places &amp; power of Church men: But
the sons of <hi>Belial</hi> cannot be taken with hands, nor bound
with bonds of faith, humanity, or honour; For in the
year following, King &amp; Prelats, with their Popish Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
go to arms again; but were fain to accommodate the
matter by a new Pacification, whereby all Civil &amp; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Liberties were ratified. And in the folowing year
1641, by Lawes, Oaths, Promises, subscriptions of
King &amp; Parliament fully confirmed. The King, <hi>Charles
the I.</hi> being present, and consenting to all; though in the
mean time he was treacherously encouraging the <hi>Irish
murderers,</hi> who by his Authority made a <hi>Massacre</hi> of many
thousand Innocent Protestants in <hi>Ireland.</hi> But in <hi>Scotland</hi>
things vvent vvell, the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus vvas
greatly advanced, the Gospel flourished, and the Glory
of the Lord did shine upon us, vvith such a splendor that
it avvaked <hi>England,</hi> and animated the Lords People
there, then groaning under those Grievances from vvhich
<hi>Scotland</hi> vvas delivered, to aspire to the like Reformation.
For advice in vvhich, because though all aggreed to cast
off the yoke of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> yet sundry forms of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
vvere projected to be set up in the room there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
chiefly the <hi>Independent</hi> order, determining all Acts of
Church Government, as Election, ordination, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of officers, vvith Admission, Excommunication,
&amp; Absolution of members, to be done &amp; decided by the
voices of every Particular Congregation, vvithout any
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41139:41"/>
Authoritative Concurrence or interposition of any other,
condemning all imperative &amp; decisive povver of Classes
&amp;c. as a meer usurpation; Therefore the Brethren in
<hi>England</hi> vvrote to the Assembly then fitting at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
vvho gave them ansvver <q>That they vvere grieved, that
any of the Godly should be found not aggreeing vvith
other Reformed Churches in point of Government, as
well as Doctrine; and that it was to be feared, where
the edge of Discipline &amp; Government is different, the
Doctrine &amp; Worship shall not long continue the same
without change; That the Government of the Church,
by Compound Presbytries &amp; Synods, is a help &amp; strength,
and not a hinderance to particular Congregations &amp;
Elderships, in all the parts of Government; and
are not an extrinsecal Power set over Particular
Churches, but the intrinsecal power where with Christ
hath invested His Officers, who may not exercise it Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently,
but with subordination unto Presbytries &amp;c.
Which as they are Representative of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
conjoined together in one under their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
so their determination, when they proceed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
whether in Causes common to all, or brought
before them by reference in case of aberration, is to the
several Congregations Authoritative, &amp; not Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
only. And this subordination is not only warranted
by the light of nature, but grounded upon the Word of
God, and conforme to the Pattern of the Primitive &amp;
Apostolick Church, for the Preservation of verity &amp;
unity, against Schisme, Heresie, &amp; Tyrannie, which
is the fruit of this Government where soever it hath place.</q>
So from henceforth the Assembly did incessantly urge
<hi>uniformity</hi> in Reformation, with their Brethren in <hi>England,</hi>
as the chiefest of their Desires, Prayers, &amp; Cares. And in
the year 1643. prevailed so far, that the <hi>English</hi> Parliament
did first desire that the two Nations might be strictly united
for their mutual defence, against the Papists &amp; Prelatical
faction and their Adherents in both Kingdoms; and not to
lay down Armes, till these implacable Enemies should be
brought in subjection: and did instantly urge for the help &amp;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41139:41"/>
assistance from <hi>Scotland.</hi> Which being sent did return with
an Olive branch of Peace, and not without some beginings
of a Reformation in <hi>England.</hi> And afterwards, a bloody
War begining between the King &amp; Parliament, with great
success on the Kings side, whence the Papists at the time
got great advantage (witness the cessation of Armes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in <hi>Ireland</hi>) Commissioners were sent from both
Houses to <hi>Scotland,</hi> earnestly inviting to a nearer union of
the Kingdoms, and desiring Assistance from this Nation to
their Brethren in that their great distress: And this, by the
good hand of God, produced the <hi>solemn League &amp; Covenant</hi>
of the three Kingdoms, first drawen up in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
approven in the Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and afterward
embraced in <hi>England,</hi> to the terror of the Popish and
Prelatical party, and to the great comfort of such as
were wishing and waiting for the Reformation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the recoveries of Just Liberties. The tenor
whereof did import, <hi>their sincere &amp; constant endeavours, in
their several places &amp; Callings, for preservation of the Uniformity
in Reformation, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, &amp; Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

of all under the bond of this Covenant; and the performing all duties

which the Lord did Ratifie from Heaven, by the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of many thousands at their entering under the bond of
it, securing &amp; establishing unto them, and all the faithful,
the blessings &amp; priviledges therein expressed, and avouching
Himself to be their God, as they had avouched themselves
to be His people; That Covenant, which in all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
it hath occasioned, did never receive a greater
confirmation than from the malice &amp; opposition of its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries;
That Covenant, which malignants do malign
&amp; deny, and Sectaries scorn &amp; lay aside, as an <hi>Almanack
out of date;</hi> which hath been many ways traduced &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
by enemies, and yet could never be reflected on
by any Serious in this Land, without a honourable &amp; fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
remembrance: Especially that Retortion of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
of the rigor of its imposition upon Recusants, to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their cruelty upon its Asserters now, is to be refelled,
not with confutation of its importance, but with disdain
of its impudence. For who were the Recusants: but wicked
enemies to God and Church &amp; Nation, who for their
malignancy were then to be prosecuted, not for their
scrupling at a Covenant, but for their contumacious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of a Law? This was no violence done to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
for as they had none, and could not pretend to
any, so they were never troubled for that, but for their
opposition &amp; conspiracy against the common cause. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it went through at that time: And that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
Reformation, in a nearer conjunction betwixt the
united Churches, might be promoted, the Parliament of
<hi>England</hi> called an Assembly of Divines at <hi>Westminster:</hi> and
desired the Assembly of <hi>Scotland</hi> to send thither their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners;
which accordingly nominated &amp; elected, <hi>Mr
Alexander Henderson, Mr Robert Dowglas, Mr Samuel Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford,
Mr Robert Balzie, Mr George Gillespie</hi> Ministers,
And <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of <hi>Cassils, Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Maitland,</hi> and <hi>Sir
Archbald Iohnstoun</hi> of <hi>Waristoun,</hi> Ruling Elders; to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone,
Consult, Treat, &amp; conclude in all such things as
might conduce to the extirpation of Popery, Prelacy, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
Schism, Superstition, &amp; Idolatry, and for the

settling of the so much desired union of the whole Island,
in one forme of Church Government, one Confession of
Faith, one common Catechisme, &amp; one Directory for
the Worship of God. Forces were also sent, to assist the
Parliament of <hi>England:</hi> which were favoured with great
success in their Entreprizes, till that War was ended by
the total overthrow of Tyranny at that time, and all its
upholders. But that Popish, Prelatical, &amp; Malignant
faction being brought much under in <hi>England,</hi> attempted
(not unlike the <hi>Syrians,</hi> who thought the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was
not God of the Hills &amp; Valleyes both) to try the fortune of
War in <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the conduct of that Treacherous
&amp; truculent Traitor <hi>Montrose,</hi> gathering an Army of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Apostates &amp; <hi>Irish</hi> Murderers: who prevailing for a time,
did punish, in the Justice of God, the Hypocrisie &amp; self-seeking
of such in this Land whose hearts were not upright
in His Covenant; at length was defeat at <hi>Philiphaugh,</hi> in
the year 1645. yet certain it is, that they had Commission
&amp; warrant from the King: as the Assembly that year, <hi>Feb.</hi>
13. remonstrates it to himself; <q>Warning him in the name of
their Master, the Lord Jesus Christ, that the guilt which
cleaved to his throne was such, as (whatsoever flattering
Preachers or unfaithful Counsellors might say to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)
if not timely repented, could not but involve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
&amp; his Posterity, under the wrath of the Everliving
God, for his being guilty of the shedding of the blood of
many thousands of his best Subjects, for his permitting
the Masse &amp; other Idolatry in his family &amp; Dominions
&amp;c.</q> At the same time also the Assembly did zealously
incite the Parliament to a speedy course of Justice, against
these Incendaries &amp; Murderers, as the only mean of cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Land from that deluge of blood then current, and
of appeasing the wrath of God: and solemnly &amp; seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
warned all ranks, to applaud the Glory &amp; Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that Judgment of the sword, in the hands of these
Apostates &amp; Murderers, and to search to understand the
Language of that Dispensation; wherein many Publick
sins &amp; breaches of Covenant are pointed at, as the Causes
of that desolation; And the Covenant it self is there very
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41139:43"/>
Encomiastically vindicated. <q>We are so far from repenting
of it (say they) that we can not mention it without great
joy &amp; thankfullness to God, as that which hath drawn
many blessings after it, and unto which God hath given
manifold evident Testimonies: for no sooner was the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
begun to be taken in <hi>England,</hi> but sensibly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of affairs there was changed to the better, and our
forces sent into that Kingdom, in pursuance of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
have been so mercifully &amp; manifestly assisted &amp; bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from Heaven, that we have what to answer the enemy
that reproacheth us concerning that business, &amp; that which
may make iniquity it self to stop her mouth: but which is
more unto us than all victories, the Reformation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; Uniformity therein between both
Kingdoms (a principal end of that Covenant) is so far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
that the Government of the Church by Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational

being crushed in all their Projects, the King renders
himself to the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>New castle:</hi> by whom (because by
Covenant they were not obliged to defend him, but only in
defence of Religion &amp; Liberty, which he had been destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

oppose &amp; oppugne these conditions, under which they
were only to defend him, and therefore they had all alongst

&amp; Union of the Kingdoms, which could not be retained in
maintaining their destroyer, And to assist mutually all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into that Covenant, which he was fighting against)
he was delivered up into the <hi>English,</hi> and kept under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> untill he received his just deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
for all his oppressions, Murders, Treachery, &amp; Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;
being condemned &amp; execute <hi>Ianuar. 30. anno</hi> 1648/9
Which fact, though it was protested against both before
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41139:43"/>
&amp; after by the Assembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> out of
zeal against the <hi>Sectarians,</hi> the executioners of that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Act of Justice; yet it was more sor the manner than
for the matter, and more for the motives &amp; ends of it
than for the grounds of it, that they opposed themselves
to it, and resented it. For they acknowledged &amp; remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
to himself, the Truth of all these things upon
which that sentence &amp; execution of Justice was founded.
And when a wicked Association, &amp; <hi>Unlawful Engagment</hi>
was on foot to rescue him, they opposed it with all their
might: Shewing, in their Answers to the Estates that
year 1648. and Declarations &amp; Remonstrances, the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness
&amp; destructiveness of that Engagment; that it
was a breach of the Commandments of God, &amp; of all
the Articles of the Covenant; Declaring withal, they
would never consent to the Kings Restitution to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of his Power, without previous assurance by solemn
Oath under his hand &amp; seal, for settling of Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Covenant. By which it appears, they were
not so stupidly Loyal, as some would make them. Yet
indeed it cannot be past without regrate, that there was too
much of this plague of the <hi>Kings-evil</hi> even among good
men: which from that time forth hath so infected the heads
&amp; hearts of this Generation, that it hath almost quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
all Loyaltie to Christ, and all zeal for Religion &amp; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
Then it began to infuse &amp; diffuse its Contagion,
when after the death of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>first,</hi> in the year 1649.
they began, after all that they had smarted for their trusting
these treacherous Tyrants, and after that Grace had been
shewed them from the Lord their God, by breaking these
mens yokes from from off their necks, and puting them
again into a Capacity to act for the good of Religion, their
oun safety, and the peace &amp; safety of the Kingdom, to
think of joining once more with the people of these abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
and taking into their bosoms these Serpents
which had formerly stung them almost to death. <hi>Hinc il<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

lachrimae, en origo &amp; Scaturigo nostrae defectionis!</hi> There was
indeed at that time a Party faithful for God, who consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the many breaches of the Solemn League &amp; Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41139:44"/>
and Particularly by the late Engagment against <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
did so travel that they procured the Covenant to be
renewed, with the <hi>Solemn Acknowledgment of sins &amp; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagment
to duties,</hi> which was Universally subscribed &amp;
sworn through all the Land; wherein also they regrete
this tampering with Malignants. And therefore the Lord
did mightily save &amp; defend them from all their Adversaries,
subdued them at <hi>Stirling,</hi> and in the North. They did also
give warning concerning the young King, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the Lords hand against his Father, <q>yet he
hearkens unto the Counsells of these, who were Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of these Miseries to his Father; by which it hath
come to pass, that he hath hitherto refused to grant the
just &amp; necessary desires of the Church &amp; Kingdom, for
securing of Religion &amp; Liberty: And it is much to be
feared, that these wicked Counsellers, may so far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon him, as to ingage him in a war, for overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Work of God, and bearing doun all those in the
three Kingdoms that adhere therto. Which if he shall do,
cannot but bring great wrath from the Lord upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
&amp; throne, and must be the cause of many new &amp;
great Miseries &amp; Calamities to these Lands.</q> And in the
same warning, by many weighty reasons, they prove, that
he is not to be admitted to the exercise of his power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
security for Religion &amp; Liberty. And when the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home of the King came to be voted in the Assembly,
there was one faithful witness, <hi>Mr Adam Kae</hi> Minister in
<hi>Galaway,</hi> protested against it; fore shewing &amp; fore telling,
what mischeef &amp; misery he would bring with him when he
should come. These things might have had some weight,
to demur the Nation from medling with that perfidious
Traitor. But all this serves only to aggravate the sin &amp;
shame of that distraction, which hath procured all this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
under which the Land mourns to this day:
That notwithstanding of all these Convictions, warnings
yea and discoveries of his Malignancy, Treachery, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to Tyranny; They sent Commissioners, and
concluded at Treaty with him at <hi>Breda.</hi> During which
Treaty, the Commissions which he had sent to that bloody
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41139:44"/>
villain <hi>Montrose,</hi> &amp; his Cut throat Complices, to raise an
Armie, &amp; wast &amp; invade the Countrey with fire &amp; sword
the second time; were brought to the Committee of Estates,
discovering what sort of King they were treating with.
Whereupon, after serious Consulting not only together,
but with the Lord: And after many debates what to do in
such a doubtfull case, wherein all was in danger, the Estates
concluded to break off the Treaty, and recall their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners.
To which intent, they sent an Express with
Letters to <hi>Breda;</hi> which by providence falling into the
hands of <hi>Libberton,</hi> a true Libertine, &amp; false betrayer of
his trust &amp; Country, was by him, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the other Commissioners, delivered unto the
King: who consulting the Contents of the Packet with
his Jesuitical &amp; Hypocritical Cabal, found it his interest to
play the fox (being disappointed at that time to play the
Tyger) and dissemble with God &amp; man. And so sending
for the Commissioners, he made a flattering speech to
them, shewing that novv after serious deliberation he vvas
resolved to comply vvith all their Proposals. Where upon
the poor cheated Commissioners dispatch the post back
with Letters, full of praise &amp; joy, for the satisfaction they
had received. The Estates, perceiving themselves imposed
upon, consulted again vvhat to do; and in end, being
oversvvayed more vvith respect to their oun credite
(vvhich they thought should be impeached, if they should
retract their oun Plenipotentiary Instructions, to conclude
the Treaty upon the Kings assent to their Conditions) than
to their reclamant consciences, they resolved to bring home
that pest, and thereby Precipitated themselves &amp; us into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eluctable
miserie. Yet they thought to mend the Matter,
by binding him vvith all Cords, and puting him to all most
explicite Engagments, before he should receive the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Croun. Well, upon these termes home he comes,
and before he set his foot on <hi>British</hi> ground he takes the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.

to have with it the same Common friends &amp; Enemies,
exhorting all to lay doun their enmity against the cause

by Court parasites, that the King was then compelled to
do these things. To which I shall only say: It would
have cost any of them their head at that time, to have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
that he did upon deliberation &amp; choise mock God &amp;
man, and entered into these Engagments, only with a
purpose to be thereby in better Capacity, to destroy what
he swore to maintain; only because he could not have the
Croun without this way, which in the Confession of the
objectors themselves was only deliberate &amp; premeditate
Perjurie. Next, if it should, be granted he was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled;
let it be also considered, who Compelled him;
and these will be found to be the deceitful Courtiers. For,
let it be adverted, what <hi>Mr Gilespie</hi> declares of the Case,
who put the pen in his hand when he subscribed that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration:
He, perceiving there was sufficient ground to
Jealouse his reality, and seeing evidently that the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
prevailed with the King on a sudden to offer to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the Declaration (when they observed that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of Churh &amp; State were resolute, &amp; ready to go
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41139:45"/>
away in a fixedness, to leave out the puting of his Interest
in the state of the quarrel) and being afrayed of the sad
Consequences of it, spoke his mind plainly to the King,
<q>That if he was not satisfied in his Soul &amp; Conscience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all hesitation of the righteousness of the subscription,
he was so far from overdriving him to run upon that, for
which he had no light, as he obtested him, yea he charged
him in his Masters name, and in the name of these who
sent him, not to subscribe this Declaration, no not for
the three Kingdoms.</q> Whereupon the King answered,
<hi>Mr Gillespie, Mr Gillespie I am satisfied, I am satisfied with the
Declaration, and therefore will subscribe it.</hi> Upon which some
of the Courtiers swore that <hi>Mr Gillespie</hi> intended simply to
disswade the King from subscribing it, that so Church and
State might professedly lay aside his Inetrest: which would
have defeat their hopes to make up themselves, as now they
have done, upon the then designed ruine of the Interest of
Truth. Then at his Coronation, we have his again reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
confirmations of that Covenant: <hi>first,</hi> he is desired
in name of the people to accept the Crown, and maintain
Religion according to the National &amp; Solemn League &amp;
Covenant; whereunto he gave his apparently Cordial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
(the words are in <hi>the forme &amp; order of the Coronation</hi>
with the whole Action.) Then <hi>next,</hi> a Sermon being
Preached upon 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 12, &amp; 17. the action commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,
with his most solemn renewing of the National and
solemn League &amp; Covenant, by Oath. <hi>Then,</hi> he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the people, and their willingness demanded to
have him for their King on these termes. At the same time,
in the <hi>next</hi> place, he took the Coronation Oath. <hi>Then</hi> on
these termes he accepted the Sword. And after the Crown
is set upon his head, the peoples obligatory Oath is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
on the termes foresaid, otherwise he is not that
King to whom they swore subjection. <hi>Then</hi> being set
upon the Throne, he was by the Minister put in mind
of his Engagments, from 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 33. And then the
Nobles of the Land came one by one kneeling, and lifting
up their hands between his hands, swore the same Oath.
These things done, the whole Action was closed with a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41139:46"/>
most solid &amp; severe exhortation from several instances,
<hi>Neh. 5. 13. Ier.</hi> 34. 18, 19, 20, &amp;c. There after in the year
1651. followed the Ratification of all these preceeding
Treaties, Transactions, &amp; Engagments, concluded &amp;
enacted by the King, and the Parliament then fully &amp;
freely conveened; whereby the same did pass into a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Law. And this Covenant, which from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
was &amp; is the most sure &amp; indispensible Oath of God,
became at length the very fundamental Law of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
whereon all the rights or priviledges, either of
King or people, are principally bottomed &amp; secured. This
might seem security sufficient, but considering the former
discoveries &amp; experiences they had of his Treachery, and
the visible appearances (in the mean time) of his Refusalls,
visible Reluctances, manifest Resilings, open Counter
actings, and continued prejudices against the Covenant,
and his following unprecedented avowed perjurie, every
thing doth indelebly fasten upon them the weakness at
least of an overweening Credulity, and upon him the
wickedness of a perfidious Policy, in all these Condiscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
After this it came to pass, that zeal for the Cause
rightly stated was suddenly contracted to a few, and the
flame thereof extinguished in many, and Court wild fire
substitute in its place: whereby a plain defection was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
carried on by the <hi>Publick Resolutioners,</hi> who relapsing
into that most sinful Conjunction with the People of these
abominations, so solemnly repented for &amp; resolved against,
did notwithstanding bring in Notorious <hi>Malignants,</hi> into
places of power &amp; Trust, in Judicatories &amp; Armies, in a
more Politick than Pious way of requiring of them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
&amp; dissembled Repentance, to the mocking of the
God of Truth, and Scorn of all our holy Engagments.
Which defection did not only cause for a long time an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
Division; the first of that kind, and most perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
of any that ever was in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by
reason of the surcease of General Assembl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, stoped &amp;
hindered by the yoke of the <hi>Sectarian</hi> Usurpation; but also
was the spring &amp; source of all our defections since, all
flowing from &amp; fomented by that same spirit that fostered
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41139:46"/>
that: And for that, since that time, the Lord hath been
contending with this Church &amp; Nation, bringing us under
the bondage of these Malignant Enemies, whom we
suffered them then to encourage &amp; introduce. And both
at that time, &amp; since that time, the Lord never counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
an Expedition where that Malignant Interest was
taken in unto the state of the quarrel. Upon this our Land
was invaded by <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> who defeat our Army at
<hi>Dumbar,</hi> where the Anger of the Lord was evidently seen
to smoke against us, for espousing that Interest. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
it is, how in that very day where in the <hi>Publick
Resolutions</hi> were concluded in the Assembly at <hi>St Andrews,</hi>
the Lord then shed the blood of His people at <hi>Enner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keithing;</hi>
so as that the Assembly, having in great hast hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
through this Approbation, were all made to run for
it, and Adjourn themselves to <hi>Dundie,</hi> where they met
and compleated that step of defection. And afterwards its
known, what a peculiar vengeance fell upon that City,
where this deed was done beyond all the Cities of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Next, an Army being raised, according to these
unhallowed <hi>Resolutions,</hi> and the Lord puting remarkable
Discountinance upon them in their attemptings at home,
as was manifest in their attemptings at <hi>Torewood</hi> &amp;c. They
march into <hi>England;</hi> and there did the Lord continue, by
His leaving our Army to the Sword, to preach that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to the world <hi>Iosh.</hi> 7. 10, 11, 12. [<hi>Israel hath sinned
and transgressed the Covenant—have taken the accursed thing
—and dissembled also, and have put it even amongst their oun
stuff, therefore the Children of Israel could not stand before their
enemies, but turned their backs before their Enemies, because they
were accursed: Neither will I be with yow any more, except ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the accersed thing from among yow</hi>] An army of near 30000
was totally routed at <hi>Worcester;</hi> and the <hi>Achan,</hi> the Cause
of the overthrow, was forced to hide himself in the <hi>Oak,</hi>
and thence to transport himself beyond sea, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
a wandering fugitive in <hi>Exile,</hi> till the year 1660. In
the mean time the <hi>Sectarian</hi> Army here prevailed, till,
after the usurper <hi>Cromwel</hi> his death, the false <hi>Monk</hi> then
General, with a Combination of <hi>Malignants</hi> and Publick
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41139:47"/>
                  <hi>Resolutioners,</hi> did machinate our misery, and effectuated
it by bringing home the King to <hi>England</hi> from his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Wherein he was habituate into an implacable hatred
against the Work of God. Yet, though since the Kings
first reception into <hi>Scotland,</hi> our declensions were still
growing untill they produced this fearful Revolt from God,
wherein the Nation is now involved; there was still a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Remnant of Ministers &amp; Professors, zealous for the
Cause, keeping their Integrity; who in their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances
&amp; Testimonies witnessed against both their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Enemies and their backsliding Brethren the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutioners,
and also against the Sectarians their Invaders;
whose vast <hi>Toleration</hi> &amp; <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> which they
brought in to invade our Religion as they had invaded our
Land, and infect it with their multifarious Errors, was
particularly by the Synod of <hi>Fife,</hi> and other Brethren in the
Ministery that joined themselves to them, Testified against,
and demonstrated to be wicked &amp; intollerable. Now to
see how far the present Testimony is Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irmed by the
witnesses of this Period, we may resume some Reflections
on it.</p>
               <p>I. They impartially carried on the Testimony against
Prelacy, and the <hi>Popish Prelatical</hi> &amp; <hi>Malignant</hi> faction on
the one hand, and the <hi>Sectarians</hi> on the other, without
ever waving the Testimony against either, or at the least
winking at the one to weaken the other: both which Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
they though of so great importance, that they could
not dispense with but faithfully maintain both, in their
witnessings &amp; warnings. In that <hi>seasonable &amp; necessary Warning
&amp; Declaration concerning present &amp; imminent dangers,</hi> given at
<hi>Edinb. Iuly 27. sess</hi> 27. They say first of the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctaries</hi> 
                  <q>That
prevailing Party of Sectaries in <hi>England,</hi> who have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Covenant, and despised the Oath of God, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Truth, subverted the fundamental Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Look upon us with an evil eye, as upon these
who stand in the way of their Monstrous &amp; new fangled
devices in Religion &amp; Government; and though there
were no Cause to fear any thing from that party, but the
Gangren &amp; infection of those many damnable &amp; abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41139:47"/>
errors which have taken hold on them; yet our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity
unto and dayly Commerce with that Nation, may
justly make us afrayed, that the Lord may give up many
in this Land into a spirit of delusion to beleeve Lies,</q> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have not received the Love of the Truth. In
that same <hi>warning</hi> they say <q>we are not so to have the one
of our eyes upon the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> as not to have the other
upon <hi>Malignants,</hi> they being an Enemie more numerous
&amp; more dangerous than the other; not only because ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
hath proven, that there is a greater aptitude &amp;
inclination in these of our Land to comply with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants,
than Sectaries, in that they carry on their wicked
designe, under a pretext of being for the King, but also
because there be many of them in our oun bovvells.</q> By
vvhich vve may see, hovv impartially they opposed both;
and that this cannot be condemned in the Testimonies of
the present Sufferers, except the Assembly be condemned.
And because many novv a dayes have extenuating notions
of those debates, against <hi>Prelacy</hi> &amp; <hi>Sectarianisme,</hi> about the
Government of the Church &amp;c. and condemn these that
vvould adhere to &amp; suffer for the <hi>Punctilio's</hi> of it, as rigid
nicetie: I shall, for seeing vvhat account the Assembly
had of them, cite their vvords in a <hi>Letter to the Assembly of
divines at</hi> Westminster, Dated <hi>Edin. Iune</hi> 18. 1646. <q>The
smallest (say they) of Christs Truths (if it be Lavvfull to
call any of them small) is of greater moment than all the
other businesses, that ever have been debated since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
of the vvorld to this day: but the highest of honours
and heaviest of burdens is put upon yovv; to declare, out
of the Sacred Records of Divine Truth, vvhat is the
Prerogative of the Croun &amp; extent of the Scepter of Jesus
Christ; vvhat bounds are to be set betvveen Him Ruling
in His House, and povvers established by God on Earth;
hovv &amp; by vvhom His House is to be Governed; and by
vvhat vvayes a restraint is to be put on these, vvho vvould
pervert His Truth and subvert the faith of many.</q>
               </p>
               <p>II. In the manner of maintaining this Testimony, these
famous Fathers while faithful for God gave us a perfect
pattern of purity &amp; strictness, in opposition to all degrees
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41139:48"/>
of conformity &amp; complyance with the Corruptions of the
time; and laid down such Rules &amp; Constitutions, as might
regulate us in our Contendings about present Defections,
and teach us what account to make of them, and how to
carry towards them: which if adverted unto, would evince
how manifest &amp; manifold the declinings of many have been
from the late Reformation, that yet pretend to adhere
unto it, and how Justifieable the aversation &amp; abstraction
of the present reproached suffering party is, from all these
defections and the daubings of them, because so much
deviating &amp; declining from the attained Reformation. I
need not repeat, how Prelacy, and all the parts &amp; pendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of that Antichristian Hierarchy, were abjured in the
National Covenant, and condemned in the Acts of Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
and reabjured in the solemn League &amp; Covenant,
and in the solemn Acknowledgment of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ins &amp; Engagment
to duties, where also we came under Sacred &amp; Inviolable
Engagments, to endeavour the extirpation thereof: Which
doth clearly file the present Countenancing &amp; submitting
to the Prelatick <hi>Curats,</hi> in receiving ordinances from them,
among the grossest of defections; being altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with these Acts and Constitutions &amp; Covenant-obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to extirpate them, as much as the countenancing
of Popish Priests were inconsistent therewith, being both
equally Covenanted to be extirpated. Next, though in this
Period, Tyrannie being in its Retrograde Motion, Erastian
Supremacy was not so much contended for, and therefore
not so much questioned as formerly, being held exploded
with exsecration out of doors &amp; out of doubt; yet the
Testimony was still continued against it, in the uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upted
maintaining of the Churches Priviledges and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Assemblies, against all Encroachings of Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
And therefore the embracing of the late detestable
<hi>Indulgences,</hi> were as Contrary to the Actings of this as to
the Testimonies of the former <hi>Period,</hi> against the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
from which they flow. Yea many Particulars, might
be instanced, wherein the Accepters had declined from
the Covenanted Reformation then prosecuted; not only
in their Confederating with Malignant Usurpers, for the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41139:48"/>
pretended benefite of them (by which, if there had been
no more, they are obnoxious to the Censure of the
Church, standing registred in an Act of Assembly, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
all persons in Ecclesiastick office, for the like or
lesser degrees of Complyance, yea even for procuring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections
from Malignant Enemies, to be suspended from
their office &amp; all exercise thereof At <hi>Edinb. 1646. Sess,</hi> 14)
Nor only in their taking sinfull Instructions from them,
restricting them in the exercise of their Ministry; but in
admitting themselves, by their <hi>patronage,</hi> to be by them
presented to their prelimited &amp; preimposed Congregations:
which involves them in the iniquity of the Abolished <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages,</hi>
condemned by the Assembly; for that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of such so presented, is made too much to depend
upon the will &amp; pleasure of man, and such an imposition
is Destructive of the Church &amp; peoples Liberties, obstructive
of the Gospels freedom &amp; faithful plainness, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of much base flattery &amp; partiality; And in subjecting
to, homologating, &amp; fortifying a Sacrilegions Supremacy,
overturning the Intrinsick power of the Church, contrare
to the Covenant obliging to the Preservation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as well as to the Doctrine of the Church, in the
first Article thereof; And in their suffering themselves,
either directly or indirectly, either by Combination, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion,
or terror, to be divided &amp; withdrawn from that
blessed Union &amp; Conjunction, which they were obliged
to maintain &amp; promove, according to the <hi>6th</hi> Art. of the
Solemn League &amp; Covenant; And in their strengthening
the Erastian Usurpations of Enemies encroaching upon
the Churches Liberties and Christs prerogatives, against
which wer are engaged expressly in the Solemn Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of sins and Engagment to duties, where also we
have these words <hi>Art. 2. Because many have of late laboured
to supplant the Liberties of the Church, we shall maintain &amp; defend
the Church of Scotland, in all her Liberties &amp; Priviledges, against
all who shall oppose or undermine the same, or encroach thereupon
under any pretext whatsomever,</hi> Next, we have many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of the zeal &amp; strictness of these Servants of
Christ, in their Synodical determinations of Censures, to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41139:49"/>
be past upon many Ministerial Corruptions; which will
condemn the present course of covering &amp; countenancing
them, and commend the Contendings of a poor reproached
party against them, in their consciencious abstracting from
them. Of which determinations, I shal rehearse some.
Among the <hi>Enormities &amp; Corruptions of the Ministrie,</hi> in their
<hi>Callings,</hi> this is one, §. 4. 5. Silenee in the publick Cause
—Some accounting it a point of wisedom to speak am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguously
—whereof the remedie is §. 15. <q>That beside
all other scandals, <hi>Silence</hi> or <hi>Ambiguous speaking</hi> in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
Cause—be seasonably Censured, <bibl>
                        <hi>Gen. Ass.</hi> at
<hi>Edinb. Iunij</hi> 13. 1646.</bibl>
                  </q> There is indeed an Act against
withdrawers from Ministers: but in the self same Act,
they are charged to be diligent in fulfilling their Ministrie,
to be faithful in Preaching, declaring <q>the whole Counsel
of God, and as they have occasion from the Text of
Scripture to reprove the sins &amp; errors, and press the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the time, And in all these to observe the Rules
prescribed by the Acts of Assembly, wherein if they be
negligent, they are to be Censured, <bibl>
                        <hi>Gen, Ass. Edinb.
Aug. 24. 1647. Sess.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                  </q> 19. Then there is that Act, <hi>August
3. 1648. Sess.</hi> 26. for Censuring Ministers for their silence,
and not speaking to the Corruptions of the time; <q>Calling
it, a great Scandal, through some Ministers their reserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp; not declaring themselves against the prevalent sins
of the times; appointing, that all that do not apply their
Doctrine to these Corruptions, which is the Pastoral
Gift, and that are cold or wanting of Spiritual zeal,
Dissembling of Publick sins, that all such be Censured
even to deprivation; for forbearing or passing in silence
the Errors &amp; Exorbitancies of Sectaries in <hi>England,</hi> or
the defections current at home, the plots &amp; Practises of
Malignants, the Principles &amp; Tenents of <hi>Erastianisme;</hi>
And if they be found too sparing, general, or ambiguous
in their applications &amp; reproofs, and continuing so, they
are to be deposed, for being pleasers of men rather than
servers of Christ, for giving themselves to a detestable
indifferency or Neutrality in the Cause of God, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding
the souls of people, yea for being highly guilty
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41139:49"/>
of the blood of Souls, in not giving them warning.</q> And
in that <hi>seasonable &amp; necessary warning</hi> of the <hi>Gen. Ass. Edinb.
Iuij 27. 1649. Sess.</hi> 27. we are taught how they resented
the unfaithfulness of Ministers continuing in defections,
and how we are to look upon them &amp; carry to them: where
they say; <q>It is undenyably true, that many of the evils,
wherewith this Church &amp; Kingdom hath been afflicted in
our age, have come to pass because of the negligence of
some and corruptions of others of the Ministrie; And
the course of backsliding was carryed on, untill it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God to stir up the spirits of these few, who stood in
the Gap, to oppose &amp; resist the same, and to begin the
work of Reformation in the Land; since which time, the
silence of some Ministers, &amp; the complyance of others,
hath had great influence upon the backslidings of many
amongst the people, who, upon the discovery of the evil
of their way, complain that they got not warning, or
that if they were warned by some, others held their peace,
or did justify them in the course of their backsliding:
we can look upon such Ministers no otherwise, than
upon these that are guilty of the blood of the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and with whom the Lord will reckon, for all the
breach of Covenant &amp; defection that hath been in the
Land; The Priests lips should preserve knowledge, and
they should seek the Law at his mouth, for he is the
Messenger of the Lord of Hosts, but such as are departed
out of the way, and have caused many to stumble at the
Law, therefore hath the Lord made them contemptible
before all the people, according as they have not kept
His wayes, but have been partial in His Law, because
they have lost their savour, He hath cast out many of
them as unsavoury salt.</q> Further more, to evidence the
Purity &amp; power of zeal burning &amp; blazing in these dayes,
in their Contendings against Publick Enemies on all hands,
I shall instance some of their Acts &amp; Testimonies, clearly
condemning the manifold Complyances of this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and which may contribute somewhat to Justifie the
reproached preciseness of a Remnant, standing at the
furthest distance from them. There is an Act <hi>for Censuring
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41139:50"/>
the Complyers with the publick Enemies of this Church &amp; King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Gen. Ass. Edinb. Iunij 17. 1646. Sess.</hi> 14. where, <q>they
judge it a great &amp; scandalous provocation, &amp; grievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
from the publick cause, to comply with these
Malignants (such as <hi>Iames Graham</hi> then was) in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
even to procure Protections from them, or to
have invited them to their houses, or to have drunk <hi>Iames
Graham</hi> his health, or to be guilty of any other such Gross
degrees of Complyance; censured to be suspended from
the communions, ay &amp; while they acknowledge their
offence.</q> And yet now, for refusing these degrees of
complyance, for not having the protectior of a <hi>Pass</hi> from
the wicked courts of malignant enemies, by taking a wicked
oath, and for refusing to drink the <hi>Kings health,</hi> a greater
Enemy then ever <hi>Iames Graham</hi> was, some poor conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
people have not only been murdere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by Enemies,
but mocked &amp; condemned by professores. There is an Act
likewise, &amp; <hi>declaration against all new oaths or bonds in the
common cause imposed without consent of the Church Gen. Ass.
Edinb. Iuly 28. 1648. Sess.</hi> 18. <q>Enjoining all the members
of the Church to forbear the swearing or subscribing any
new oaths or bonds, in this Cause, without Advice &amp;
concurrence of the Church, especially any <hi>negative</hi> oaths
or bonds, which may any way limit or restrain them in
the duties whereunto they are obliged, by National or
Solemn League &amp; Covenant.</q> Yet now, for refusing
Oaths, not only limiting in Covenanted duties, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
&amp; condemning many material Principles of the
Covenanted Reformation, many have not only lost their
Lives, but also have been condemned, by them that are
at ease having a wider conscience to swallow such baits.
It is known how pertinacious the most faithful in those
dayes were, in their contendings against <hi>Associations,</hi> in
any undertaking for the cause, with persons disaffected to
the true state thereof. I need not give any account of this,
were it not that now that Principle is quite inverted; and
poor Adherers to it, for their abstracting &amp; substracting
their concurrence with such promiscuous Associations,
are much hated &amp; flouted; therefore I shall give some hints
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41139:50"/>
of their sentiments of them. <q>
                     <bibl>In their <hi>Answer to the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
of Estates, Iulij 25. 1648. Sess.</hi> 14.</bibl> the <hi>Gen. Assembly</hi> sayes,
It was represented to the Parliament, that for securing of
Religion it was necessary, that the Popish, Prelatical,
&amp; Malignant party, be declared Enemies to the cause
upon the one hand, as well as Sectaries upon the other,
and that all Associations either in forces or counsels,
with the former as well as with the latter, be avoided.</q>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>And in their <hi>declaration concerning the Present dangers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
especially <hi>the unlawful Engagment</hi> in War, <hi>Iulij,
ult. 1648. Sess.</hi> 21.</bibl> They say, suppose the ends of that
Engagment be good (as they are not) yet the means &amp;
wayes of Prosecution are unlawful; because there is not
an equal avoiding of rocks on both hands, but a joining
with Malignants to suppress Sectaries, a joining hands
with a black devil to beat a white devil; They are bad
Phisicians who would so cure one disease, as to breed
another as evil or worse—we find in the Scriptures
condemned, all Confederacies &amp; Associations with the
Enemies of true Religion, whether <hi>Canaanites Exod.</hi> 23.
32. and 24. 12, 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 2. or other heathens 1. <hi>King.</hi>
11. 1, 2.</q> More Arguments against <hi>Associations</hi> may be seen
in that excellent <hi>discussion</hi> of this <hi>useful Case, Concerning
Associations &amp; Confederacies with Idolaters Infidels Hereticks
or any other known enemy of Truth or Godliness,</hi> by famous
<hi>Mr G. Gillespie,</hi> published at that same time: whereunto is
appended his Letter to the commission of the General
Assembly, having these golden words in it, words fitly
spoken in that season, when he was a dying, at the begining
of the <hi>Publick Resolutions</hi> 
                  <q>Having heard of some motions
&amp; beginings of complyance, with these who have been
so deeply engaged in a war destructive to Religion &amp; the
Kingdoms Liberties, I cannot but discharge my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
in giving a Testimony against all such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance.
I know &amp; am perswaded, that all the faithful
witnesses that gave Testimony to the <hi>Thesis,</hi> that the late
Engagment was contrary &amp; destructive to the Covenant,
will also give Testimony to the <hi>Appendix,</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with any who have been active in that Engagment
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41139:51"/>
is most sinful &amp; unlawful. I am not able to express all the
evils of that complyance, they are so many—But above
all, that which would highten this sin even to the Heavens
is, that it were not only a horrid backsliding, but a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding
into that very sin, vvhich vvas specially pointed at
&amp; punished by the prevailency of the Malignant party,
God justly making them thorns &amp; scourges vvho were
taken in as friends. Alas! shall we split twice upon the
same rock? yea run upon it, when God hath set a beacon
on it? yea I may say, shall we thus out face &amp; out dare
the Almighty, by protecting His &amp; our Enemies, by
making peace &amp; friendship with them, when the anger
of the Lord is burning against them. I mus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> here apply to
our present condition, the words of <hi>Ezrah.</hi> 9. 14—O
happy <hi>Scotland,</hi> if thow canst now improve &amp; not abuse
this Golden opportunity? but if thou help the ungodly,
&amp; love them that hate the Lord, wrath upon wrath,
and wo upon wo, shall be upon thee from the Lord.
Whereunto is subjoined his dying Testimony to the same
purpose; wherein are these words,, But if there shall be a
falling back, to the sin of complyance with Malignant
ungodly men, then I look for the breaking out of the
wrath of the Lord, till there be no remedy.</q> This was the
warning of a worthy dying Man. Notwithstanding of which
&amp; many other warnings &amp; witnessings, a course of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
was commenced by the <hi>pulick Resolutioners,</hi> and
continued in to this day; wherein that faithful warning of
a dying servant of Christ is verified. But before I leave this
purpose, I must obviate an objection that some make use
of for strengthening themselves in their incorporations &amp;
joinings at least in Worship, with the corruptions of the
time, and for condemning conscientious withdrawers;
That the Godly in those dayes did not separate from the
men of these complyances &amp; defections, as many do now,
to wit the <hi>protesting party</hi> did not withdraw from the <hi>publick
Resolutioners</hi> &amp; Associators with Malignants. I answer,
first, many &amp; these the most Godly &amp; tender did withdraw,
even from their oun Ministers, and would have gone 40.
or 50 myles to hear a faithful Minister at that time: yea
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41139:51"/>
Ministers themselves, in the case of <hi>intrusion</hi> of the unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
would have supplyed the Paroch, as if the Church
had been vacant, and when they could not get access to
the pulpit, they preached in the fields, on purpose to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against, and professedly to withdraw the people from
such an unfaithful Intruder; as might be instanced particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
for time &amp; place, if need were. But next, The
Church then, though broken by division, and under the
subjection of strangers deprived of her General Assemblies,
yet was in a <hi>constitut Case,</hi> enjoying the priviledge, power
&amp; order of Synods &amp; Presbyteries, to whom the people of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with their Ministers might address themselves, for an
orderly redress, and removal of these Scandals in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way; and so they needed not assume to themselves that
power to regulate their communion, that in a <hi>broken State,</hi>
as now is, must be allowed to them. And besides, both the
Ministers at that time who were faithful, though they
might have proceeded to censure &amp; silence the corrupt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as they were obliged, yet not only found it difficult by
reason of the injury of the times; but also thought it best to
spare them, And the people to bear them, as burdens;
untill, as they were still in hopes, they should obtain a
General Assembly to take order with them but now it is
not so. And then the defection was but begining, and
people did not know and could not expect it would go such
a length, and therefore could not fall upon the rigor of
that duty, which such disorders call for at first: but if they
had seen where these beginings would Land them at length,
I doubt not but they would have resisted those beginings,
in such a way as would have precluded this imputation of
novelty upon our necessitated with drawings.</p>
               <p>III. We have in this Period, not only an Illustrious
Testimony for the Principle, but a continued and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
putting into practice the duty of <hi>defensive Armes,</hi> in
resisting the Soverain power, malversing &amp; abusing Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to the destruction of the ends of it; which resistence
was avowed, encouraged, &amp; furthered by the General
Assembly, both for the defence of themselves, and for
the help of their Brethren in <hi>England.</hi> Take one expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in their <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Solemn &amp; seasonable Warning to all ranks Feb.</hi> 12.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41139:52"/>
1645. <hi>Sess</hi> 18.</bibl> Unless men will blot out of their
hearts the love of Religion &amp; cause of God, and cast off
all care of their Country, Lawes, Liberties &amp;c. (all
being in visible danger of present ruine &amp; destruction) they
must now or never appear actively, each one stretching
himself to, yea beyond his power. It is no time to dally,
or to go about the business by halfs, nor be almost but
altogether zealous: Cursed is he that doeth the work of
the Lord negligently. If we have been forward to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
our Neighbour Kingdoms, shall we neglect to
defend our oun? Or shall the Enemies of God be more
active against His cause, than His people for it? God
forbid. In another <hi>seasonable &amp; necessary warning Iuly</hi> 27.
1649. <hi>Sess.</hi> 27. They say, But if his Maj. or any having
or pretending power &amp; commission from him, shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
this Kingdom, upon pretext of establishing him in
the exercise of his royal power; as it will be an high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
against God, to be accessory or assisting there
to, so it will be a necessary duty to resist &amp; oppose the
same.</q> These Fathers could well distinguish, between
<hi>Authority</hi> and the <hi>person</hi> abusing it: And were not so Loyal,
as now their degenerate Children are ambitious to shew
themselves, stupidly stouping to the shaddow thereof,
and yet will be called the only Asserters of Presbyterian
principles. But we find, they put it among the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of <hi>Malignants,</hi> to confound the Kings honour &amp; Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with the abuse &amp; pretence thereof, and with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions,
warrants, &amp; Letters, procured from the King
by the Enemies of the cause &amp; Covenant, as if we could
not oppose the Latter, without increaching upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
But here, an <hi>Objection</hi> or two must be removed out
of the way, before we go forward. One is, from the
<hi>Third Atticle</hi> of the <hi>Covinant;</hi> where there seems to be a
great deal of Loyaltie, obliging to defend the Kings Maj.
his person &amp; Authority, in the preservation &amp; defence of
the true Religion &amp; Liberties of the Kingdoms, <hi>that the
world may bear witness with our consciences of our Loyaltie, And
that we have no thoughts or intentions to diminish his Majesties just
power &amp; greatness.</hi> I Ans. There is indeed a deal of Loyaltie
there, and <hi>true Loyaltie,</hi> because Lawfully limited, being
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41139:52"/>
qualified with &amp; subordinate unto the preservation &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the true Religion &amp; Liberties of the Kingdom (as
the makers of the Covenant do expound it, in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<hi>declaration against the unlawful Eugagment Iuly ult.</hi> 1648.
<hi>Sess.</hi> 21.) not that <hi>Reverse Loyaltie,</hi> which makes duties to
God conditional &amp; limited, and duties to thee King abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
&amp; unlimited, as our <hi>Loyalists</hi> do now. And I wish
others were free of it, who have sworn Oaths of unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
<hi>Alledgiances,</hi> to maintain the King in any power unto
which his force aspires; and to justify this their Loyaltie,
will bring in this Article of the Covenant with a distorted
sense, reading it backward, <hi>that we in the preservation &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Religion must preserve &amp; defend the King:</hi> As if Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
obliged to defend him, do what he will. It were
better such pretended Covenanters, denyed the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
than to be such a reproach to it, in wresting its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
sense. But I have adduced the sense of the best In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
of it, the General Assembly. Next when they
entered under the bond of this Covenant, they did it with
a purpose to oppose all his invasions upon Religion &amp; the
Liberty of the people, and to vindicate these precious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
from his usurpings, into a state of Liberty: And shall
we imagine, that that very Oath of God did lay upon
them or us an obligation, to defend the person who is a
destroyer of all these, contrary to the very nature of the
Oath, contrare to the scope of the Covenanters, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their subsequent practise? But then it will be urged,
why then was that clause cast into the Covenant? I answer
we have not the same cause to keep it, as they had some
cause to put it in, with accommodation to the present posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
of the Soveraignity. The ouning of it in our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
would be as great a reproach to us, as the want of it
was to them in theirs. They put in the words, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the worlds mistake, and to remove that odium in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously
heaped upon the heads of those, whose hearts
were associate in the defence of Religion &amp; Liberty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they would profess they would not be disloyal while
he was for God. And a defiance may be given to clamour,
&amp; calumnie it self, to give one instance of the defect of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41139:53"/>
performance hereof, while he went not about to ruine
those things, incomparably more precious then his person
or Authority, and in ruining whereof no person can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Authority.</p>
               <p>IV. But now two things will chiefly be desiderated,
which now we oune in our Testimony, for which many
have dyed, that seem not to be confirmed by or consistent
with the Testimony of this Period. <hi>One</hi> is, that we not
only maintain defensive resistance, but in some cases vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive
&amp; punitive force, to be executed upon men that
are bloody <hi>beasts of prey,</hi> and burdens to the earth, in cases
of necessity, when there is no living for them. This prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Reason &amp; natural Justice, was not much inquired
into in this time; when the sun was up, whose warmth &amp;
light made these beasts creep into their dens, and when
they, being brought under subjection, could not force
people into such extraordinary violent courses when the
ordinary &amp; orderly course of Law was running in its right
Channel. Yet from the ground of their ordinary Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
Military &amp; Civil, against such Monsters, we may
gather the lawfullness of an ordinary Procedure in a pinch
of necessity, conforme to their grounds: I hope to make
this evident, when I come <hi>ex proposito</hi> to vincicate this head.
But there is another thing that we onne, which seems not
to have been known in these dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> That when we
are required to <hi>oune the Authority</hi> of the present Dominator,
we hold sinful to oune it. Yet we find these Reverend &amp;
renouned Fathers ouned King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
the succession of <hi>Charles</hi> II. I shall answer in order.
First, as to King <hi>Charles the first,</hi> there was a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betuixt him and his sons that succeeded; he never
declared Parliamentarely that neither Promises, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
nor Oaths should bind him, as the first of his
perfidious sons did; It might have been then presumed,
if he had engaged so far for promoving the Work of God,
he would have been a man of his word (for to say a King
of his word, is antiquitate in a good sense, except that it
means he is as absolute in his word as in his sword, and
scorns to be a slave to it) Neither professed he himself
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41139:53"/>
a Papist, as the second Son hath done: Again it must
be granted, that more might have been comported with
in the begining, when there were some hopes of redress,
than after such process of time; whereby now we see &amp;
feel beyond all debate, that the Throne stands and is
stated, not only in opposition to, but upon the ruines of
the Rights &amp; Priviledges both of Religion &amp; Liberty. But
was not the equivalent done by the Church, <hi>anno</hi> 1648.
when they refused to concur with that unlawful Engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for restoring of the King, till security be had, by
<q>Solem Oath under his hand &amp; Seal, that he shall for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
&amp; Successors, give his assent to all Acts &amp; Bills for
enjoining Presbyterial Government, and never make
opposition to it, nor endeavour any change thereof? <bibl>
                        <hi>Iulij ult. 1648. Sess,</hi> 21.</bibl>
                  </q>
 But it will be said, that in their
renewing the Covenant that year, they did not leave out
that Article. True, thereby they stopped the mouths of their
Adversaries: And then they were not without hopes, but
that in his straits he might have proved a <hi>Manasseh</hi> taken
among the thornes. And the Covenanters at that time, not
being clear that he had done that which <hi>ipso jure</hi> made him
no Magistrate, chused rather while matters stood so to
ingage to maintain him, than simply to disoune him (which
yet our forefathers did upon smaller grounds many times)
in the hopes of being prevailed with at last. But when they
saw that this proved ineffectual, therefore at the <hi>Coronation</hi>
of the new King they made the Covenanted Interest the
sole <hi>Basis</hi> upon which alone Authority was conferred upon
him. For the second, though they did not refuse the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of <hi>Charles the Second</hi> (which vvas their blame and
our bane, of vvhich vve may blush this day) yet vve find
many things in that Transaction vvhich justifie our disoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him, and condemn the ouning of the present Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor.
(1.) <q>
                     <bibl>In that <hi>seasonable &amp; necessary warning Iulij 27.
Sess.</hi> 27.</bibl> vvhereas many vvould have admitted his Maj. to
the exercise of his Royal povver, upon any termes vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever:
The Assembly declares first; That a boundless
&amp; illimited povver is to be acknovvledged in no King
nor Magistrate; neither is our King to be admitted to the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41139:54"/>
exercise of his povver, as long as he refuses to vvalk in
the administration of the same, according to this rule.
Secondly, that there is a mutual stipulation &amp; obligation
betvveen the King &amp; the people, as both of them are tyed
to God, so each of them are tyed to one another, for
the performance of mutual &amp; reciprocal duties; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
Kings are to take the Oath of Coronation, to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Popery &amp; maintain the Protestant Religion: As long
therefore as the King refuses to engage &amp; oblige himself
for security of Religion &amp; safety of his people, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to Scripture &amp; Reason and Lavves of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that he should be refused. Thirdly, in the League
&amp; Covenant the duty of defending &amp; preserving the King,
is subordinate to the duty of preserving Religion &amp; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
And therefore, he standing in opposition to the
publick desires of the people for their security, it vvere a
manifest breach of Covenant, and a preferring the Kings
Interest to the Interest of Jesus Christ, to bring him to the
exercise of his povver. Fourthly, That it vvas for restraint
of Arbitrary Government, and for their Just defence
against Tyranny, that the Lords people did join in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and have been at the expence of so much blood
these years past; And if he should be admitted to the
Government before satisfaction, it vvere to put in his
hand that Arbitrary Povver, and so to abandon their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Principles, and betray the Cause. Fifthly, That he,
being admitted before satisfaction, vvould soon endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
an overturning of the things vvhich God hath
wrought, and labour to dravv publick administrations,
concerning Religion &amp; Liberty, into that course &amp;
Channel in vvhich they did run under Prelacy, and before
the work of Reformation. Whence they warn that every
one take heed of such a snare, that they be not accessery
to any such design, as they would not bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
&amp; their families, the guilt of all the detriment that
will undoubtedly follow thereupon, of all the miseries it
will bring upon the Kingdoms—And therefore who
soever attempt the same, oppose themselves to the cause
of God, and will at last dash against the Rock of the Lords
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41139:54"/>
power, which hath broken in pieces many high &amp; lofty
ones, since the begining of the work in the Kingdoms.</q>

demands, after he had given many clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of his disaffection &amp; enmity to the work &amp; people
of God: That these demands, which he was required to
subscribe, did not contain a real security, a real aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
of former Malignant courses &amp; principles, and
cleaving to the Work of God; It was not a paper or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal

to mock God, and deceive the world, and to betray &amp;

               <head type="sub">Containing the Testimony through the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Tract of the present Deformation
from the year 1660. to this day.</head>
               <p>NOw comes the last <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of the Deformation
of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which now renders
her to all Nations as infamously despicable, as her
Reformation formerly made her admired &amp; envied; which
in a Retrograde motion hath gradually been growing these
27 years, going back through all the steps by which the
Reformation ascended, till now she is returned to the very
border of that <hi>Babylon,</hi> from whence she took her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and reduced through defection, &amp; division, and
persecutions, to a confused <hi>Chaos</hi> of almost irreparable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
and unavoidable desolation. Through all which
steps notwithstang, to this day, <hi>Scotland</hi> hath never wanted
a witness for Christ, against all the various steps of the
Enemies advancings, and of professed friends declinings:
Though the Testimony hath had some singularities, some
way discriminating it from that of former <hi>Periods;</hi> in that
it hath been more difficult, by reason of more desperate &amp;
dreadful assaults of more enraged enemies, more expert &amp;
experienced in the accursed art of overturning than any
formerly; In that it hath been attended with more disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
by reason of the Enemies greater prevalency,
and Friends deficiency, and greater want of significant
Assertors, than any formerly; In that it hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41139:56"/>
in more multifarious intricacies, of questions, and
debates, and divisions among the Assertors themselves,
making it more dark, and yet in the end contributing to
clear it more than any formerly; In that it hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
&amp; extended to a greater measure, both as to matter
&amp; manner of contendings against the Adversaries, and
stated upon nicer points; more enixely prosecuted &amp; tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
maintained, &amp; sealed with more sufferings, than
any formeriy; In that it hath had more opposition &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
and less countenance from professed friends to
the Reformation, either at home or abroad, than any
formerly. And yet it hath had all these several specialities
together, which were peculiar to the former Testimonies,
in their respective Periods: being both Active &amp; Passive,
both against Enemies &amp; Friends; And <hi>in cumulo</hi> stated against
Atheisme, Popery, Prelacy, &amp; Errastian Supremacy, which
were the successive heads of the former Testimonies, and
also now extended in a particular manner against <hi>Tyrannie.</hi>
And not only against the substance &amp; essence of these in the
abstract, but against substance &amp; circumstance, abstract &amp;
concret root &amp; branch, head &amp; tail of them, and all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with them, conforming to them, or countenancing
of them, or any thing conductive for them, or deduced
from them, any manner of way, directly or indirectly,
formally or interpretatively. This is that extensive and very
comprehensive Testimony of the present Period, as it is
now stated &amp; sealed with the blood of many: Which in all
its parts, points &amp; pendicles is most directly relative, and
dilucidly reducible, to a complex Witness for the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
Glory of <hi>Christs Kingship and Headship over all,</hi> as He
is God and as He is Mediator, which is the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that Creatures have to contend for, either as Men or
as Christians. The matter of this Testimony, I shall give
a short manuduction to the progress &amp; Result of its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagment.</p>
               <p>During the Exile of the <hi>Royal Brothers,</hi> it is undenyably
known that they were, by their Mothers caresses and the
Jesuites Allurements, seduced to abjure the Reformed
Religion (which was easie to induce persons to that never
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41139:56"/>
had the sense of any Religion) and to be reconciled to the
Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And that, not only they wrote to the
Pope many promisses of promoting his projects, if ever
they should recover the power into their hands again, and
often frequented the Mass themselves; but also, by their
example and the influence of their future hopes, prevailed
with many of their dependents &amp; attendants abroad, to do
the like. Yet it is also unquestionably known, that in the
mean time of his Exile, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e renewed &amp; confirmed, by
private Letters to <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> his many reiterated En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagments
to adhere to the Covenant, and declared that he
was &amp; would continue the same man, that he had declared
himself to be in <hi>Scotland</hi> (wherein doubtless, as he was an
expert Artist, he equivocated, and meant in his heart he
would continue as Treacherous as ever) which helped to
keep a Loyal Impression of his Interest in the hearts of too
many, and an expectation of some good of him, of which
they were ashamed afterwards. And immediatly before
his return, its known what promises are contained in
that Declaration from <hi>Breda</hi> (from whence he came also
the second time, with greater Treachery than at the first)
to all Protestants that would live peaceably under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
begining now to weigh out his perfidie, &amp;
perjurie, &amp; breach of Covenant, in offering to <hi>tolerote</hi> that
in an <hi>Indulgence,</hi> which he swore to maintain as a <hi>duty.</hi> But
in all this he purposed nothing, but to ingyre &amp; ingratiate
himself into the peoples over credulous affections, that
they might not obstruct his return, which a jealousie of his
intended Tyrannie would have awakened them to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
And so having seated himself, and strengthened his
power against the attemptings of any, whom his conscience
might suggest an apprehension that they ought to resist him,
he thought himself discharged from all obligations of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
Oaths, or promises, for which his faith had been
pledged. And from the first hour of his arrival, he did in a
manner set himself to affront &amp; Defy the Authority, of
God, and to be revenged upon his Kingdoms for inviting
him so unanimously to sway their Scepter; in polluting &amp;
infecting the people with all debaucheries &amp; monstrous
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41139:57"/>
villanies; and commencing his incestous Whoredoms that
very first night he came to his Palace, wherein he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to his dying day outvying all for vileness. Yet he went
on deluding our Church with his dissimulations, and would
not discover all his wickedness hatched in his heart at first,
till his designs should be riper; but directed a Letter to the
Presbyterie of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> declaring he was <hi>resolved to protect
&amp; preserve the Government of the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>as it is
settled by Law without violation:</hi> Wherein it was observed
he altered the Stile, and spake never a word of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of Religion &amp; Righteousness, our
greatest security for all Interests intrusted to him, but only
of <hi>Law;</hi> by which, as his practice expounded it afterwards,
he meant the <hi>Prelatical</hi> Church, as it was settled by the
Law of his Father, since which time he reckoned there
was no Law but Rebellion. This was a piece &amp; preludie
of our base defection, &amp; degeneration into blind, block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,
&amp; brutish stupidity; that after he had discovered so
much perfidie, we not only at first tempted him to Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
in admitting him to the Crown, upon his mock-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagment
in the Covenant, whereby God was mocked,
His Spirit was grieved, His Covenant prostituted, the
Church cheated, &amp; the State betrayed; but after the Lord
had broken his yoke from off our necks, by sending him to
exile ten years, where he was discovered to be imbibing all
that venome &amp; Tyrannical violence, which he afterward
vented in revenge upon the Nations; and after we had
long smarted for our first transaction with him; yet not
withstanding of all this, we beleeved him again, and
<hi>Issachar</hi>-like couched under his burdens, and were so far
from withstanding, that we did not so much as witness
against the readmission &amp; restauration of the head &amp; tail of
Malignants, but let them come in peaceably to the throne,
without any security to the Covenanted cause, or for our
Civil or Religious Interests, and by piece meal, at their oun
ease, leasure &amp; pleasure, to overturn all the Work of
God, and reintroduce the old Antichristian yoke of abjured
<hi>Prelacy,</hi> and blasphemous Sacrelegious <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and
Absolute Arbitrary <hi>Tyrannie</hi> with all their abominations:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41139:57"/>
which he, and with him the generality of our Nobility,
Gentry, Clergy, &amp; commonality by him corrupted, without
regard to faith, or fear of God or man, did promote &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogate,
until the Nation was involved in the greatest revolt
from, &amp; rebellion against God, that ever could be recorded
in any Age or Generation; Nay attended with greater &amp;
grosser Aggravations, than ever any could be capable of
before us, who have had the greatest Priviledges that ever
any Church had; since the National Church of the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
the greatest light; the greatest effects of matchless magnified
love, the greatest Convictions of Sin, the greatest Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
&amp; Solemn Engagments against it, and the greatest
Reformation from it, that ever any had to abuse &amp; affront.
O Heavens be astonished at this, &amp; horribly afraid! for
<hi>Scotland</hi> hath changed her Glory, and the Crown hath
fallen from off her head, by an unparalelled Apostasie,
a free &amp; voluntary, vvilfull &amp; deliberate Apostasie, an
avoued &amp; declared &amp; Authorized Apostasie, Tyrannically
carried on by Militarie violence &amp; cruelty, a most univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
&amp; every vvay unprecedented Apostasie! I must a litle
change my method, in deducing the narration of this <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastrophe,</hi>
and subdistinguish this unhappie Period into
several steps; shevving hovv the Enemies opposition to
Christ advanced, and the Testimony of His Witnesses did
gradually ascend, to the pitch it is novv arrived at.</p>
               <p>I. These Enemies of God, having once got footing
again, with the favour and the fawnings of the foolish
Nation, went on fervently to further and promote their
wicked design: and meeting with no opposition at first,
did encourage themelves to begin boldly. Wherefore,
hearing of some Ministers peaceably Assembled, to draw
up a Monitory Letter to the King, minding him of his
Covenant Engagments &amp; promises (which was though
weak, yet the first witness &amp; warning against that Heaven-daring
wickedness then begun) they cruelly incarcerate
them. Having hereby much daunted the Ministry from their
duty in that day, for fear of the like unusual &amp; outragious
usage. The Parliament conveens <hi>Ianuar.</hi> 1. 1661. without
so much as a Protestation for Religion &amp; Liberty given in to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41139:58"/>
them. And there, in the first place, they frame &amp; take the
Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> Exauctorating Christ, and investing
His usurping Enemy with the spoils of his robbed Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
acknowledging the King <hi>only supreme Governour over all
persons &amp; in all Causes, and that his power &amp; Iurisdiction must not
be declined.</hi> Whereby under <hi>all persons</hi> &amp; <hi>all Cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> All Church
Officers, in their most properly Ecclesiastick Affairs &amp;
Concerns of Christ, are comprehended: And if the King
shall take upon him to judge their Doctrine, Worship,
Discipline, or Government, he must not be declined as
an incompetent Judge. Which did at once enervate all
the Testimony of the <hi>4th Period</hi> above declared, and laid
the foundation for all this <hi>Babel</hi> they have built since, and
of all this war that hath been waged against the Son of God,
and did introduce all this Tyrannie &amp; absolute power
which hath been since carried to its Complement, and made
the Kings Throne the foundation of all the succeeding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie
&amp; Apostasie. Yet, though then our Synods &amp; Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytries,
were not discharged, but might have had access
in some Concurrence to witness, against this horrid Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
upon Christs Prerogative and the Churches Priviledge,
no joint Testimony was given against it, except that some
were found witnessing against it in their singular Capacity by
themselves. As faithful Mr <hi>Iames Guthrie,</hi> for declining this
usurped Authority in prejudice of the Kingdom of our Lord
Jesus, suffered death, and got the Martyrs Crown upon his
head: And some others, for refusing that Oath arbitrarly
imposed, were Banished or Confined, when they had gained
this Bulwark of Christs Kingdom; Then they waxed more
insolent, and set up their Ensigns for signs, and broke doun
the carved Work of Reformation with axes &amp; hammers. In
this Parliament 1661. They past an <hi>Act Rescissorie,</hi> whereby
they annulled &amp; declared void the National Covenant,
the Solemn League &amp; Covenant, Presbytrial Government,
and all Lawes made in favours of the Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
since the year 1633. O horrid wickedness! both
in its nature so attrocious, to condemn &amp; rescind what
God did so signally seal as His oun Work, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the world, and for which He will rescind the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41139:58"/>
Rescinders, and overturn these Overturners of His Work,
and make the curse of that broken Covenant bind them to
the punishment, vvhom its bond could not oblige to the
duty Covenanted; And in its design &amp; end so base &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable,
for nothing but to flatter the King in making way
for Prelacy, Tyranny, &amp; Popery, and to indulge the
licenciousness of some debauched Nobles; who could not
endure the yoke of Christs Government, and to suppress
Religion &amp; Righteousness under the ruines of that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
But O holy &amp; astonishing Justice, thus to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
our way upon our own head! to suffer this work &amp;
cause to be ruined under our unhappy hands, who suffered
this Destroyer to come in before it was so effectually se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
as it should not have been in the power of his hand
(whatever had been in his heart, swelled with enmity
against Christ) to have razed &amp; ruined that Work as now
most wickedly he did, and drew in so many into the guilt
of the same deed, that almost the whole Land not only
consented unto it but applauded it; by approving &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing
another wicked <hi>Act</hi> framed at the same time,
by that same perfidious Parliament for an Anniversary
Thanksgiving commemorating every 29. of <hi>May,</hi> that
Blasphemy against the Spirit &amp; Work of God, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
that unhappy Restauration of the Rescinder of the
Reformation; which had not only the concurrence of the
universality of the Nation, But (alas for shame that it
should be told in <hi>Gath</hi> &amp;c!) even of some Ministers who
afterwards accepted the Indulgence (one of which a Pillar
among them, was seen scandalously dancing about the
bonefires.) And others, who should have alarmed the
whole Nation <hi>quasi pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> to rise for Religion &amp;
Liberty, to resist such wickedness, did wink at it. O how
Righteous is the Lord now in turning our Harps into
mourning! Though alas! we will not suffer our selves to
this day, to see the shining Righteousness of this Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And though we be scourged with Scorpions, &amp;
brayed in a Mortar, our madness, our folly in these irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
frolicks, is not yet acknowledged let be lamented.
Yet albeit, neither in this day when the Covenant was not
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41139:59"/>
only broken but Cassed &amp; declared of no obligation, nor
afterward when it was burnt (for which Turks &amp; Pagans
would have been ashamed &amp; afraid at such a terrible sight,
and for which the Lords Anger is burning against these
bold burners, and against them who suffered it, and did
not witness against it) was there any publick Testimony by
protestation, or Remonstrance, or an publick witness?
though the Lord had some then, and some who came out
afterward with the Trumpet at their mouth, whose heart
then sorrowed at the sight: And some suffered for the
sense they shewed of that Anniversary abomination, for
not keeping which they lost both Church &amp; Liberty. Its
true the ordinary Meetings of Presbytries &amp; Synods were
about that time discharged, to make way for the exercise
of the new power conferred on the four Prelats who were
at Court, reordained &amp; Consecrated thereby renouncing
their former Title to the Ministry. But this could not give
a discharge from a Necessary Testimony, then called for
from faithful Watchmen. However the Reformation being
thus rescinded &amp; razed, and the House of the Lord pulled
doun, then they begin to build their <hi>Babel.</hi> In the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>anno</hi> 1662. by their first Act they restore &amp; reestablish
<hi>Prelacy,</hi> upon such a foundation as they might by the same
Law bring in <hi>Poperie,</hi> which was then designed; and so
settled its Harbinger Diocesan &amp; Erastiar Prelacy, by
fuller Enlargment of the <hi>Supremacy.</hi> The very Act begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
thus. For as much as the ordering &amp; disposal of the
<q>external Government of the Church, doth properly
belong to his Maj. as an Inherent right of the Croun, by
virtue of his Royal Prerogative, &amp; Supremacy in Causes
Ecclesiastick—what ever shall be determined by his
Maj. with advice of the Arch Bishops, and such of the
Clergy as he shall nominate, in the external Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church (the same consisting with the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lawes of the Kingdom) shall be valide &amp; effectual.
And in the same Act all Lawes are rescinded, by which
the sole power &amp; Jurisdiction within the Church doth
stand in the Church Assemblies, And all which may be
interpreted, to have given any Church power, Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41139:59"/>
or Government to the Office bearers of the
Church, other than that which acknowledgeth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
upon, &amp; subordination to the Soveraign
power of the King as Supreme.</q> By which, Prelats are
redintegrated to all their priviledges &amp; preheminencies,
that they possessed <hi>anno</hi> 1637. And all their Church power
(robbed from the Officers of Christ) is made to be derived
from, to depend upon, and to be subordinate to, the
Croun prerogative of the King: whereby the King is made
the only fountain of Church power, and that exclusive
even of Christ, of whom there is no mentioned exception:
And his vassals the Bishops, as his Clerks in Ecclesiastiks,
are accountable to him for all their administrations; A
greater usurpation upon the Kingdom of Christ, than ever
the Papacy it self aspired unto. Yet, albeit here was
another display of a banner of defyance against Christ, in
altering the Church Government of Christs Institution into
the humane Invention of Lordly Prelacy, in assuming a
power by prerogative to dispose of the external Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, and in giving his Creatures <hi>patents</hi> for
this effect, to be his Administrators in that usurped Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
There was no publick, Ministerial, at least united
Testimony against this neither. Therefore the Lord puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
this sinful &amp; shamful silence of Ministers, in His holy
Justice, though by mens horrid wickedness; when by
another wicked <hi>Act</hi> of the Council at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> above 300
Ministers were put from their Charges; and afterwards,
for their Non-conformity in not Countenancing their
Diocesan Meeting, and not keeping the Anniversary day
<hi>May</hi> 29. The rest were violently thrust from their labours
in the Lords vineyard, and banished from their Parishes,
and adjudged unto a nice &amp; strange Confinement, twenty
miles from their oun parishes, six miles from a Cathedral
Church as they called it, and three miles from a Burgh;
whereby they were reduced in to many inconveniencies.
Yet in this fatal Convulsion of the Church, generally all
were struck with blindness &amp; baseness, that a Paper-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
made them all run from their posts, and obey
the Kings Orders for their ejection. Thus were they given
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41139:60"/>
up, because of their forbearing to sound an alarm, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the people of God, in point of Loyaltie to Christ,
and under the pain of the Curse of the Covenant, to a
wake and acquit themselves like men, and not to suffer
the enemie to rob them of that Treasure of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which they were put in possession of, by the tears,
prayers, &amp; blood of such as went before them; instead of
those prudential fumblings, &amp; fisflings then &amp; since so much
followed. Wherefore the Lord in His holy righteousness,
left that enemie (against whom they should have cried &amp;
contended, and to whose eye they should have held the
Curse of the Covenant, as having held it first to their oun, in
case of unfaithful silence in not holding it to his) to cast
them out of the House of the Lord, and dissolve their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
and deprive them of their priviledges, because of
their not being so valiant for the Truth, as that a ful &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Testimony against that Encroachment might be found
upon record. Nevertheless somewere found faithful in that
hour &amp; pour of darkness, who kept the Word of the Lords
patience, and who were therefore kept in &amp; from that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
(which carried many away into sad &amp; shamful defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions)
though not from suffering hard things from the
hands of men; &amp; only these who felt most of their violence,
found grace helping them to acquit themselves suitably to
that dayes Testimony, being thereby prevented from an
Active yeelding to their impositions, when they were made
passively to suffer force. However that season of a publick
Testimony was lost, and as to the most part never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to this day. The Prelats being settled, &amp; readmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to voice in Parliament, they procure an Act, Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
condemning several Material parts &amp; points of our
Covenanted Reformation, to wit, these positions <q>That
it was lawful for Subjects, for Reformation or necessary
self defence, to enter into leagues, or take up Armes,
against the King: And particularly declaring that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

Solemn league &amp; Covenant, were &amp; are i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unlawful Oaths, and were taken by &amp; imposed upon
the subjects of this Kingdom against the fundamental

Lawes &amp; Liberties thereof, That all such gatherings &amp;
petitions, that were used in the begining of the late
troubles, were unlawful &amp; seditious: And whereas then
People were led unto these things, by having dissemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among them such principles as these, That it was
lawful to come with petitions &amp; Representations of
grievances to the King, That it was lawful for people
to restrict their Allegiance under such &amp; such limitations,
and suspend it untill he should give security for Religion
&amp;c. It was therefore enacted, that all such positions &amp;
practices founded thereupon, were treasonable—And
furder did enact<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no person, by writing, praying,
preaching, or malicious or advised speaking, express
or publish any words or sentences, to stir up the people
to the dislike of the Kings prerogative &amp; Supremacy, or
of the Government of the Church by Bishops, or justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
any of the deeds, actings, or things declared against
by that Act.</q> Yet not withstanding of all this subversion
of Religion &amp; Liberty, and restraint of asserting these
Truths here trampled upon either before men by Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or before God in mourning over these Indignities
done unto Him, in everting these &amp; all the parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,

some to assert &amp; demonstrate the Glory of these Truths &amp;
duties to the vvorld. As that Judicious Author of the
<hi>Apologetical Relation,</hi> vvhose Labours need no <hi>Elagium</hi> to

novv as they thought subverted the Work of God, they
provided also against the fears of its revival: making Acts,
declaring, that if the outed Ministers dare to continue to

should be punished as seditious persons; requiring of all a
due acknowledgment of, &amp; hearty complyance with, the

their <hi>Conversions</hi> of Reformation into Deformation, of
the Work &amp; Cause of God into the similitude of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
beast, of Ministers into Hirelings, of their Proselytes
into ten times worse children of the Devil then they were
before, of the power of Godlyness into formality, of
Preaching Christ into Orations of Morality, of the purity
of Christs Ordinances into the vanity of mens Inventions,
of the beautiful Government of the House of God for Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
to a Lordly preheminence &amp; Domination over
consciences, in a word of Church &amp; State Constitutions
for Religion &amp; Liberty all up side doun into wickedness &amp;
slavery: These are the Conversions of Prelacy. But now
this astonishing blow to the Gospel of the Kingdom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
such a Swarm of Locusts into the Church, And
in forcing a Complyance of the people with this defection,
and that so violently &amp; rigorously, as even simple with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
was so severely punished by severe Edicts of fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
&amp; other arbitrary punishments at first; what did it
produce? did it awaken all Christs Ambassadours, now
to appear for Christ, in this clear &amp; clamant case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
Him, and the freedom &amp; Purity of His Ordinances?
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41139:61"/>
Alas! the backwardness &amp; bentness to backsliding, in a
Superseding from the duties of that day, did make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that now the Lord had in a great measure forsaken
them, because they had forsaken Him. The standart of
the Gospel was then fallen, and few to take it up. The
Generality of Ministers &amp; Professors both went &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
so far as to <hi>hear the Curats,</hi> contrary to many points
of the Reformation formerly attained, contrare to their
Covenant Engagments, and contrare to their oun princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
&amp; practice at that same time; scrupling and refusing
to keep the Bishops <hi>visitations,</hi> and to Countenance their
<hi>Discipline</hi> &amp; power of <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> because it was required
as a Testification of their acknowledgment of, &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with the present Government, And yet not scrupl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Countenance their <hi>Doctrine</hi> &amp; usurped power of
<hi>Order</hi> required also by the same Law, as the same Test of
the same Compliance &amp; submission. Its strange that some
yet doe plead for persisting in that same Complyance, after
all the bitter Consequents of it. Other Ministers Lay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

things would turn to: Others were hopeless, turned <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>

                  </gap>; but rather found
themselves under an indispensible necessity to Preach the
Gospel and witness for the freedom of their Ministry, and
make full proof of it, in preaching in season &amp; out of season:
and thereupon as occasion offered preached to all such as
were willing to hear; but at first only in private <hi>houses,</hi> and
that for the most part at such times, when Sermons in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
surceased (a superplus of Caution.) But afterwards,
finding so great difficulties and Persecutions for their house
Meetings, where they were so easily attrapped, were
constrained at last to keep their Meetings in the <hi>fields,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
shelter from cold, wind, snow, or rain. Where
testifieing both practically &amp; particularly against these U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpations
on their Masters Prerogatives, and witnessing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41139:62"/>
for their Ministerial freedom, contrary to all Law-Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
without any Licences or Indulgences from the
Usurper, but holding their Ministry from Jesus Christ
alone, both as to the Office &amp; exercise thereof; they had so
much of their Masters Countenance, &amp; success in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
that they valued neither hazards nor hardships, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the contempt of pretended Friends, nor the Laws

Now having thus overturned the <hi>Church Government,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
Prelacy, to advance an absolute Supremacy; the
effects whereof were either the Corruption, or Persecution
of all the Ministrie, Encouragment of profanity &amp; wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

horsemen sufficiently armed, with 40 dayes provision,
to be ready upon the Kings call to march to any part of
his Dominions, for opposing whatsoever invasion, or
insurrection, or for any other service.</q> The first sprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Tyrannie were cherished, by the cheerfull &amp; stupid
submission generally yeelded to these exorbitances; under
which they who suffered most were inwardly Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
but there was no opposition to them by word or
Action, but on the contrary, generally people did not so
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41139:62"/>
much as scruple sending out or going out as Militia-men:
never adverting unto what this Concurrence was designed,
&amp; demanded, and given for; Nor what an accession it
was, in the nature &amp; influence of the mean it self, and in
the sense &amp; intention of the Requirers, unto a Confederacy
for a Complyance with, and a Confirmation &amp; strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Arbitrary Tyrannie. After the fundamental consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of both Church &amp; State are thus razed &amp; rooted up,
to confirm this <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> he contrived to frame all
inferior Magistrats according to his mould: And for this
end appointed, that all persons in any publick Trust or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
whatsoever should subscribe a <hi>Declaration,</hi> renouncing
&amp; abjuring the Covenants; whereby Perjurie was made
the chief &amp; indispensible qualification, and <hi>Conditio sine qua
non,</hi> of all that were capable of exercing any power or
place in Church or State. But finding this not yet sufficient
security for this unsettled settlement; because he wel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
the people stood no ways obliged to acknowledge
him but only according to the solemn Covenants, being the
fundamental Conditions whereupon their Allegiance was
founded (as amongst all people, the Articles mutually
consented betwixt them and these whom they set over
them, are the constituent fundamentalls of Government)
and wel knowing, that he &amp; his Associats, by violating
these Conditions, had loosed the people from all subjection,
to him, or any deriving power from him, whereby the
people might justly plead, that since he had kept no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
they were not now obliged to him, he therefore
contrived a new <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> to be imposed upon all
in publick trust both in Church &amp; State; wherein they are
made to oblige themselves to that Boundless breaker of all
Bonds Sacred &amp; Civil, and his Successors also, without
any reciprocal obligation from him to them, or any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
restriction, limitation, or qualification, as all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Authority by Gods Ordinance must be bounded.
Whereby the Swearers have by Oath homologated the
overturning of the very <hi>Basis</hi> of the Government, making
free people Slaves to the subverters thereof, betraying their
native Brethren &amp; posterity to the lust of Tyrannie, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41139:63"/>
have in effect as really as if in plain termes affirmed, that
whatsoever Tyrannie shall command or do, either as to
the overturning of the work of God, subverting of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
destroying of Liberty, or persecuting all the Godly
to the utmost extremity, they shall not only stupidly endure
it, but actively concur with it, and assist in all this Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
Alas there was no publick Testimony against this
Trick, to bring people under the yoke of Tyrannie; except
by some who suffered for Consciencious refusing it, while
many others did take it, thinking to salve the matter by
their pitiful quibleng senses, of giving <hi>Cesar</hi> his due. Where
as this <hi>Cesar,</hi> for whom these Loyal Alleg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers plead, is not
an ordinary <hi>Cesar,</hi> but such a <hi>Cesar, Nero,</hi> or <hi>Caligula,</hi> that
if he got his due, it would be in another kind. Strange! can
Presbyterians swear that Allegiance, which is substitute in
the place of the broken &amp; burnt Covenant? Or could they
swear it to such a person, who having broken &amp; buryed the
Covenant, that he who had sworn it might have another
right and another Allegiance than that of the Covenant,
had then remitted to us all Allegiance founded upon the
Covenant? However, having now prepared &amp; furnished
himself with Tools so qualified for his purpose, in Church
&amp; State, he prosecutes his Persecution with such fervour
&amp; fury, rage &amp; revenge, impositions &amp; oppressions, and
with armed formed force, against the faithful following
their duty in a peaceable manner, without the least shadow
of Contempt even of his abused Authority, that at length
in the year 1666, a small party were compelled to go to
defensive armes. Which, whatever was the desire of the
Court (as it is known how desirous they have been of an
Insurrection, when they thought themselves sure to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it, that they might have a vent for their Cruelty; and
how one of the Brothers hath been heard say, <hi>that if he might
have his wish, he would have them all turn Rebells and go to armes.</hi>)
Yet it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> no predetermined design of that poor Handful.
For <hi>Sir Iames Turner,</hi> pursuing his cruel orders in <hi>Galoway,</hi>
sent some Souldiers to apprehend a poor old man; whom
his neighbours compassionating, intreated the Souldiers to
loose him as he lay bound, but were answered with drawen
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41139:63"/>
Swords and necessitated to their own defence: In which
they relieve the man, and disarm the Souldiers, and further
attacqued some others oppressing that Countrey, disarming
10 or 12 more, and killing one that made resistence.
Whereupon, the Countrey being alarmed, and fearing
from sad experience <hi>Sir Iames</hi> would certainly avenge this
affront upon the whole Country, without distinction of
free &amp; unfree, they gather about 54 horsemen, march to
<hi>Drumfreis,</hi> take <hi>Sir Iames Turner</hi> Prisoner, and disarm the
Souldiers, without any more violence. Being thus by
Providence engaged without any hope of retreat, and gett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some Concurrence of their Brethren in the same
Condition, they come to <hi>Lanerk,</hi> where they renew the
Covenant; and thence to <hi>Pentland hills:</hi> where, by the
holy Disposal of God, they were routed, many killed,
and 130 taken Prisoners, who were treated so treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
&amp; truculently, as <hi>Turks</hi> would have blushed to have
seen the like. Hence now on the one hand, we may see
the Righteousness of God, in leaving that Enemy to Him,
whom we embraced, to make such avowed Discoveries
of himself, without a blush to the world, and to scourge
us with Scorpions that we nourished and put in his hands:
And also, how justly at that time He left us into such a
damp, that like Asses we couched under all burdens, and
few came out to the help of the Lord against the Mighty,
drawing on them <hi>Meroz's</hi> Curse, and the blood of their
butchered Brethren; after we had sitten, &amp; seen, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
all things Civil &amp; Sacred to be destroyed in our sight
without resentment. And though the Lord, who called
out these worthy Patriots who fell at <hi>Pentland</hi> to such an
appearance for His Interests, did take a Testimony of their
hands with acceptance by sufferings, and singularly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
them in sealing it with their blood; yet He would
not give success nor His presence to the Enterprise, but left
them in a sort of infatuation, without Counsel &amp; Conduct,
to be a prey to devourers, that by a sad inadvertency they
took in the Tyrants Interest into the State of the Quarrel.
Which should have warned His people for the future, to
have stated the Quarrel otherwise.</p>

II. By this time; and much more after, the King gave
as many proofs &amp; demonstrations of his being true to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
in minding all the promises &amp; treaties with him, as
he had of his being false to Christ, in all his Covenant En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagments
with His People. For in this same year 1666.
he, with his dear &amp; Royal Brother the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
countenanced, &amp; abetted, the burning of <hi>London,</hi>
evident by their employing their Guards to hinder the
People from saving their oun, and to dismiss the Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries
the Papists, that were taken in the fact. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
appointed to cognosce upon that business, traced
it fo far, that they durst go no further, unless they would
arraign the Duke, &amp; charge the King, and yet before this
it was enacted as Criminal for any to say the King was a
Papist. But having gained so much of his design in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
where he had established Prelacy, advanced Tyranny
to the hight of Absoluteness, and his Supremacy almost
beyond the reach of any additional supply, yea above the
<hi>Popes</hi> oun Claim, and had now brought his only opposites,
the few faithful Witnesses of Christ, to a Low pass; he
went on by Craft as wel as Cruelty, to advance his oun in
promoting Antichrists Interest. And therefore, having
gotten the <hi>Supremacy</hi> devolved upon him by Law (for
which also he had the <hi>Popes</hi> dispensation, to take it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for the time, under promise to restore &amp; surrender it
to him, as soon as he could attain his end by it, as the other
Brother succeeding hath now done) he would now exert
that usurped power, and work by infnaring policy to
effectuate the end which he could not do by other means.
Therefore, seeing he was not able to suppress the Meetings
of the Lords people for Gospel Ordinances, in house &amp;
fields, but that the more he laboured by violent courses
the greater &amp; more frequent they grew; he fell upon a
more Craftie device, not only to overthrow the Gospel
and suppress the Meetings, but to break the faithful, and
to <hi>divide, between the Mad-cap &amp; the Moderate Fanaticks</hi> (as
they phrased it) that he might the more easily destroy both;
to confirm the usurpation, and to settle people in a sinful
silence &amp; stupid submission to all the Incroachments made
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41139:64"/>
on Christs Prerogatives, and more effectually to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
what remained of the Work of God. And, knowing
that nothing could more fortifie the Supremacy than Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
their homologating &amp; acknowledging it; Therefore
he offerd the first <hi>Indulgence, Anno</hi> 1669. Signifying in a
Letter, dated that year <hi>Iune</hi> 7. His gracious pleasure was,
to appoint so many of the outed Ministers, <q>as have lived
peaceably &amp; orderly, to return to preach &amp; exercise other
functions of the Ministrie, in the Paroch Churches where
they formerly served (provided they be vacant) and to
allow Patrons to present to other vacant Churches, such
others of them as the Council should approve: That all
who are so Indulged, be enjoyned to keep Presbytries,
and the Refusers to be confined within the bounds of
their paroches: And that they be enjoined not to admitt
any of their neighbour Paroches unto their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
nor Baptize their Children, nor marry any of
them, without the allowance of the Minister of the
Paroch, and if they Countenance the people deserting
their oun Paroches, they are to be silenced for shorter or
longer time, or altogether turned out, as the Council
shall see cause: And upon Complaint made &amp; verified,
of any Seditious discourse or expressions in the Pulpit,
uttered by any of the Ministers, they are immediatly to
be turned out, and further punished according to Law:
And seeing by these orders, all Pretences for <hi>Conventickles</hi>
were taken away, if any should be found hereafter to
Preach without Authority, or keep Conventickles,
his Pleasure is, to proceed with all severity against them,
as Seditious persons &amp; Contemners of Authority.</q> To
salve this in point of Law (because it was against former
Lawes of their oun) and to make the Kings Letter the
supreme Law afterwards, and a valid ground in Law,
where upon the Council might proceed, &amp; enact, and
execute what the King pleased in Matters Ecclesiastick; he
therefore caused frame a formal Statutory <hi>Act of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi>
of this Tenor. <q>That his Maj. hath the supreme
Authority &amp; Supremacy over all Persons and in all Caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
Ecclesiastick, within his dominions, and that by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41139:65"/>
virtue thereof, the ordering &amp; disposal of the external
Government of the Church, doth properly belong to
him &amp; his successors, as an Inherent right to the Croun:
And that he may settle, enact, &amp; emitt such Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Acts, &amp; Orders, concerning the Administrating
therof, and Persons employed in the same, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
all Ecclesiastical Meetings &amp; Matters, to be

shall think fit:</hi> which Acts, Orders, &amp; Constitutions, are to

1669. do nominate several Ministers, and appoint them
to Preach, <q>and exercise the other functions of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie,
at their respective Churches there specified, with
Consent of the Patrons. The same day also they conclude
&amp; enact the forementioned <hi>Restrictions,</hi>
                  </q> conform to the
Kings Letter above rehearsed, And ordain them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timat
to every person, who is by Authority foresaid allowed
the exercise of the Ministrie. These Indulged Ministers,
having that Indulgence given only upon these termes, that
they should accept these Injunctions, and having received
it upon these termes also (as an essential part of the bargain
&amp; Condition, on which the Indulgence was granted &amp;
accepted, as many following Proclamations did expressly
declare) do Appoint <hi>Mr Hutcheson,</hi> one of the number,
to declare so much; <q>In Acknowledging his Maj. favour
&amp; Clemency, in granting that Liberty, after so long a
restraint; And however they had received their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie
from Jesus Christ, with full Prescriptions from Him
for regulating them therein, yet nothing could be more
refreshing on earth to them, than to have free Liberty
for the exercise of their Ministrie, under the Protection
of Lawful Authority: And so they purposed to be have
themselves, in the discharge of the Ministrie, with
that wisdom that became faithful Ministers, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
themselves towards Lawful Authority, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of their known judgment in Church affairs, as
wel becometh Loyal subjects; And their prayer to God
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41139:65"/>
should be, that the Lord should bless his Maj. in his
person &amp; Government, and the Council in the publick
administration, and especially in the Pursuance of his
Maj. mind in his Letter, wherein his singular modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
eminently appears.</q>—Afterwards they issued out
Proclamations, reinforcing the punctual observation of
the forementioned Injunctions, and delivered them into
the Indulged. In the mean time, though Cruel Acts &amp;
Edicts were made against the Meetings of the Lords
people, in houses &amp; the fields, after all these <hi>Midianitish</hi>
wyles to suppress them; such was the presence of the Lord
in these Meetings, and so powerful was His Countenance
&amp; Concurrence with the Labours of a few, who laid out
themselves to hold up the Standart of Christ; that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Converts multiplyed dayly, to the praise of free
Grace, and to the great encouragment of the few hands
that wrestled in that Work, through all humane discourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Therefore King &amp; Council was put to a new shift,
which they supposed would prove more effectual: To
wit, because there was a great number of Non-conformed
Ministers not yet Indulged, who either did or might
hereafter hold <hi>Conventickles,</hi> therefore, to remeed or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
this in time coming, they appoint &amp; ordain them to
such places where Indulged Ministers were settled, there
to be confined with allowance to Preach as the Indulged
should employ them; thinking by this means to incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
many to hold Meetings there or elswere: And to
these also they give injunctions &amp; restrictions to regulate
them in the exercise of their Ministrie. And to the end that
all the outed Ministers might be brought under restraint,
and the Word of God be kept under bonds, by another
Act of Council they Command, that all other Ministers
(not Disposed of as is said) were either to repair to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roch
Churches where they were, or to some other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roches
where they may be ordinary hearers, and to declare
&amp; condiscend upon the Paroches where they intend to have
their Residence. After this they assumed a Power, to
Dispose of these their Curats as they pleased, and transport
them from place to place; whereof the only ground was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41139:66"/>
a simple Act of Council, the <hi>Instructions</hi> alwayes going

of their Ministerial exercise, and some of them sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41139:66"/>
silenced, &amp; deposed for alledged disobedience.
This was a manifest <hi>Treason</hi> against Christ, which involved
many in the actual guilt of it that day, and many others
who gaped after it &amp; could not obtain it, and for more at
that time &amp; since in the guilt of <hi>Misprision</hi> of Treason, in
passing this also without a witness. Thus, in holy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because of our Indulging &amp; Conniving at the
usurper of Christs Throne, He left a great part of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to take that wretched <hi>Indulgence;</hi> and another part,
instead of remonstrating the wickedness of that deed, have
been left to palliate, &amp; plaister, &amp; Patronize it, in keeping
up the Credit of the King &amp; Councils <hi>Curats,</hi> wherein they
have shewed more zeal, than ever against that wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.
Yet the Lord had some Witnesses, who prettie
early did give significations of their resentment of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
done to Christ, as <hi>Mr William Weer,</hi> who having got
the Legal Call of the People, and discharging his duty
honestly, was turned out; And <hi>Mr Iohn Burnet,</hi> who
wrote a Testimony directed to the Council, shewing why
he could not submit to that <hi>Indulgence,</hi> inserted at large in
the <hi>History of the Indulgence;</hi> Where also we have the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of other ten Ministers, who drew up their Reasons
of Non-Complyance with such a snare; And <hi>Mr Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Blair,</hi> who, upon occasion of a Citation before the
Council for not observing the 29 of <hi>Maij,</hi> having with
others made his appearance, and got new Copies of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
presented to them, being moved with zeal and
remembering whose Ambassadour he was, told the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
plainly, that <hi>he could receive no Instructions from them in the
exercise of his Ministry, otherwise he should not be Christs Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
but theirs,</hi> and herewith lets their Instructions drop
out of his hand, knowing of no other <hi>Salv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> or manner of
Testifying for the Truth in the Case<g ref="char:lpunctel">؛</g> for which he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned,
&amp; died under Confinement. But afterwards,
the Lord raised up some more explicite Witnesses against
that defection. All this Trouble was before the year 1673.
About which time, finding this device of <hi>Indulgences</hi> proved
so steadable for his Service in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he was induced to try
it also in <hi>England;</hi> which he did almost with the same or
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41139:67"/>
like success, &amp; producing the same effects of defection, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
&amp; unfaithfulness. The Occasion was upon his wars
with the <hi>Dutch:</hi> Which gave another demonstrative disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his Treacherie &amp; <hi>Popish</hi> perfidie, in breaking League
with them, and entering into one with the <hi>French,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
Religion &amp; Liberty in <hi>Britain:</hi> 
                  <q>Wherein the King
of <hi>France</hi> assures him an <hi>Absolute Authority</hi> over his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and to reestablish the Catholick Religion in his
Kingdoms of <hi>England Scotland</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland;</hi> to Compass
which it was necessary first to abate the pride &amp; power of
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to reduce them to the sole Province of
<hi>Holland,</hi> by which means the King of <hi>England</hi> should
have <hi>Zeland</hi> for a retreat in case of need, and that the
rest of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> should remain to the King of
<hi>France,</hi> if he could render himself Master of it. But to
return to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </q> While by the forementioned Device,
he thought he had utterly suppressed the Gospel in <hi>house</hi> &amp;
<hi>field Meetings,</hi> he was so far disappointed, that these very
means &amp; Machins by which he thought to bury it, did
chiefly contribute to its revival. For, when by Persecution
many Ministers had been chased away by illegal Law-Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
many had been banished away, and by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snaring
<hi>Indulgences</hi> many had been drawen away from their
duty, and others were now sentenced with Confinements
&amp; Restraints, if they should not choose &amp; fix their residence
where they could not keep their Quiet &amp; Conscience
both; they were forced to wander and disperse through the
Country, and the People being tired of the cold &amp; dead
<hi>Curats,</hi> and wanting long the Ministrie of their old <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi>
so longed &amp; hungered after the <hi>Word,</hi> that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
to have it at any rate cost what it would; which made
them entertain the dispersed Ministers more earnestly,
and encouraged them more to their duty. By whose En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
through the mighty power &amp; presence of God,
and the Light of His Countenance now shining through
the Cloud, after so fatal &amp; fearful a darkness that had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded
the Land for a while, with such a resplendent
brightness, that it darkened the <hi>Prelatick Locusts,</hi> and made
them hisse and gnash their tongues for pain, and dazeled
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41139:67"/>
the eyes of all Onlookers; the Word of God grew exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
and went through at least the Southern borders of
the Kingdom like lightning, or like the Sun in its Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
beauty; discovering so the Wonders of Gods Law,
the Mysteries of His Gospel, and the Secrets of His Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and the Sins &amp; Duties of that day, that a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
issue was begotten to Christ, and His Conquest was
Glorious, Captivating poor slaves of Satan, and bringing
them from his power unto God, and from darkness to
Light. O! who can remember the Glory of that Day,
without a melting heart, in reflecting upon what we have
lost, and let go, and sinned away, by our Misimprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
O that in that our day we had hearkened to His
voice, and had known the things that belonged to our
peace! A day of such power, that it made the People, even
the bulk &amp; body of the People, willing to come out and
venture, upon the greatest of hardships and the greatest of
hazards, in pursuing after the Gospel, through Mosses &amp;
Moors, &amp; inaccessible Mountains, Summer &amp; Winter,
through excess of heat &amp; extremity of cold, many dayes &amp;
night-journeyes; even when they could not have a probable
expectation of escaping the Sword of the wilderness,
and the barbarous fury of bloody <hi>Burrio's</hi> raging for their
prey, sent out with orders to take &amp; kill them, it being
now made Criminal by Law, especially to the preachers
&amp; Convocaters of those Meetings. But this was a day of
such power, that nothing could daunt them from their
duty, that had tasted once the sweetness of the Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
at these persecuted Meetings. Then had we such
<hi>Humiliation-dayes</hi> for personal &amp; publick Defections, such
<hi>Communion-dayes</hi> even in the open fields, and such <hi>Sabbath-Solemnities,</hi>
that the places where they were kept might have
been called <hi>Bethel,</hi> or <hi>Peniel,</hi> or <hi>Bochim,</hi> and all of them
<hi>Iehovah-Shammah;</hi> wherein many were truly Converted,
more Convinced, and generally all Reformed from their
former immoralities: That even Robbers, Thieves, and
Profane Men, were some of them brought to a saving sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to Christ, and generally under such restraint, that
all the severities of heading &amp; hanging &amp;c. in a great many
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41139:68"/>
years, could not make such a Civil Reformation, as a few
dayes of the Gospel, in these formerly the Devils Terito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
now Christs Quarters, where His Kingly Standart
was displayed. I have not Language to lay out the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
Glory of that day: But I will make bold to say two
things of it, first, I doubt if ever there was Greater dayes
of the Son of Man upon the Earth since the Apostolick
times, than we enjoyed for the space of Seven years at that
time: And next, I doubt, if upon the back of such a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
day there was ever a blacker night of darkness, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
division, &amp; confusion, and a more universal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
Apostasie, than we have seen since. The world
is at a great loss, that a more exact &amp; complete account
demonstrating both these, is not published, which I am sure
would be a fertile Theme to any faithful pen. But this not
being my scope at present, but only to deduce the steps of
the Contendings of Christs Friends &amp; His Enemies, I must
follow the threed of my Narration. Now when Christ is
gaining Ground by the preached Gospel in plenty, in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
&amp; power, the Usurpers <hi>Supremacy</hi> was like to stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and <hi>Prelacy</hi> came under universal Contempt, in so much
that several Country <hi>Curats</hi> would have had but scarce
half a dozen of hearers, and some none at all. And this was
a General Observe that never failed, that no sooner did
any poor Soul come to get a serious sense of Religion, and
was brought under any real Exercise of Spirit about their
Souls Concerns, but as soon they did fall out with <hi>Prelacy</hi>
and left the <hi>Curats.</hi> Hence to secure what he had possessed
himself of by Law, and to prevent a dangerous <hi>Paraxisme</hi>
which he thought would ensue upon these Commotions,
the King returned to exerce his innate Tyranny, and to
emit terrible Orders, and more terrible Executioners, &amp;
bloody Emissaries, against all Field Meetings: which,
after long patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the people at length could not endure;
but being first chased to the Fields, where they would have
been content to have the Gospel with all the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of it, and also expelled from the Fields, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
to maintain the Gospel, they resolved to defend it
&amp; themselves by Armes. To which, unavoidable necessity
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41139:68"/>
in unsupportable extremity did constrain them, as the only
remaining remedy. It is known, for several years they met
without any Armes, where frequently they were disturbed
&amp; dispersed with Souldiers some killed others wounded,
which they patiently endured without Resistence: At length
the Ministers that were most in hazard, having a Price set
upon their heads to be brought in dead or alive, with some
attending them in their wanderings, understanding they
were thus appointed for death, judged it their duty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the necessary defence of their lives from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of their Armed Assaulters. And as Meetings increased,
diverse others came under the same hazard, which enforced
them to endeavour the same remedy, without the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of prejudice to any. Thus the number of Sufferers
increasing, as they joyned in the Ordinances at these perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
Meetings, found themselves in some probable Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to defend themselves and these much endeared &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Gospel Priviledges, &amp; to preserve the Memory of the
Lords great Work in the Land, which to transmit to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was their great design. And they had no small encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragment
to endeavour it, by the satisfying sweetness &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
they found in these Ordinances, being perswaded of the
justness of their Cause, and of the groundlessness of their
Adversaries quarrel against them: And hereunto also they
were incited &amp; prompted, by the palpableness of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
purposes to destroy the Remainder of the Gospel, by
extirpating the Remnant that professed it. Wherefore in
these circumstances, being redacted to that strait, either
to be deprived of the Gospel or to defend themselves in
their Meetings for it; And thinking their turning their
backs upon it for hazard, was a cowardly deserting duty, and
palpable breach of Covenant-Engagments, abandoning
their greatest Interest, They thought it expedient, yea ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
to carry defensive Armes with them. And as for
that discouragment from the difficulty &amp; danger of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their fewness &amp; meanness, it did not deter or daunt
them from the endeavour of their duty; when they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
the Lord in former times was wont to oune a very
small party of their Ancestors, who in extremity jeoparded
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41139:69"/>
their lives in defence of Reformation against very potent &amp;
powerful Enemies: These now ouning the same Cause,
judged themselves obliged to run the same hazard, in the
same circumstances, and to follow the same method, &amp;
durst not leave it unessayed, leaving the event to God:
considering also, that not only the Law of Nature &amp; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
doth allow self defence from unjust violence, but
also the indissoluble obligation of their Covenants, to
maintain &amp; defend the true Religion &amp; one another in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
the same, made it indispensible to use that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
the defect of which through their former supine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
gave no small encouragment to the Enemies: They
considered also what would be the consequence of that
War, declared against all the Faithful of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

acts of horrid hostility, published in printed Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
&amp; written in Characters of blood by barbarous soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
so that none could enjoy Gospel Ordinances dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
in Purity, but upon the hazard of their lives: And
therefore, to prevent &amp; frustrate these effects, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to put themselves in a posture. And hereunto
they were encouraged, by the constant experience of the
Lords countenancing their endeavours in that posture,
which alwayes proved successful for several years, their
enemies either turning their backs without disturbance,
when they observed them resolve defence, or in their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saultings
repulsed: So that there was never a Meeting
which stood to their defence, got any considerable harme
thereby. Thus the Lord was with us while we were with
Him, but when we forsook Him then He forsook us, and
left us in the hands of our enemies. However, while Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for Gospel Ordinances did continue, the wicked
Rulers did not cease from time to time to encrease their
numerous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ands of Barbarous Souldiers, for suppressing
the Gospel in these <hi>field-Meetings.</hi> And for their Mainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
they imposed new wicked &amp; arbitrary <hi>Cesses</hi> &amp;
<hi>Taxations,</hi> professedly required for suppressing Religion &amp;
Liberty, banishing the Gospel out of the Land, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
&amp; promoting his Absoluteness over all Matters &amp;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41139:69"/>
Persons Sacred &amp; Civil: Which, under that tentation of
great suffering threatened to Refusers, and under the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
of the silence &amp; unfaithfulness of many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
who either did not condemn it or pleaded for the
peaceable payment of it, many did comply with it then,
and far more since. Yet at that time there were far more
Recusants, in some places, (especially in the Western
Shires) than Complyers: And there were many of
the Ministers that did faithfully declare to the people the sin
of it; Not only from the <hi>illegality</hi> of its imposition, by a
convention of overawed and prelimited States; but from
the <hi>nature</hi> of that imposed Complyance, that it was a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
transaction with Christs declared Enemies, a strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the hands of the wicked, an Obedience to a wicked
Law, a Consenting to Christs Expulsion out of the Land,
and not only that, but (far worse than the sin, of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darens</hi>)
a formal Concurrence to assist His Expellers, by
maintaining their force, a hiring our Oppressours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
Religion &amp; Liberty; And from the <hi>fountain</hi> of it, an
Arbitrary power domineering over us, and oppressing &amp;
overpressing the Kingdoms with intollerable exactions
That to pay it, it was to entail slaverie on the posterity;
And from the declared <hi>end</hi> of it, expressed in the very Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of the <hi>Act, viz:</hi> to levy &amp; maintain forces for suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
&amp; dispersing Meetings of the Lords people, and to
shew unanimous affection for maintaining the Kings <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi>
as now established by Law; which designs he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
and would be capacitate by the Granters to effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
by such a Grant, which in effect, to all tender
Consciences, had an evident tendency to the exauctorating
the Lord Christ, to maintain Souldiers to suppress His
Work, &amp; murder His Followers, yet all this time Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
&amp; Professors were unite, and with one soul &amp; shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
followed the Work of the Lord, till the <hi>Indulged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

being dissatisfied with the Meetings in the fields, whose
Glory was like to overcloud &amp; obscure their beds of ease,
and especially being offended at the freedom &amp; faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of some, who set the Trumpet to their mouth, and
shewed <hi>Iacob</hi> his sins &amp; <hi>Israel</hi> his transgressions impartially
without a clock or cover, they began to make a <hi>faction</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:41139:70"/>
among the Ministers, and to devise how to quench the
fervour of their zeal who were faithful for God. But
the more they sought to extinguish it, the more it brake
out and blazed into a flame. For Several of Christs Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours,
touched &amp; affected with the affronts done to
their Princely Master by the <hi>Supremacy</hi> and the <hi>Indulgence</hi> its
Bastard brood &amp; brat, began after long silence to discover
its iniquity, and to acquaint the people how the Usurper
had invaded the Mediators Chair, in taking upon him to
depose; suspend, silence, plant &amp; transplant His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
where &amp; when &amp; how he pleased, and to give
forth warrants &amp; Licences for admitting them, with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
&amp; Instructions for regulating them in the exercise
of their Ministrie, and to arraign &amp; censure them at his
Courts for delinquencies in their Ministry; pursuing all to
the death who are faithful to Christ, and maintain their
Loyaltie to His Lawes, and will not prostitute their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
to his lusts, and bow doun to the Idol of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
but will oune the Kingly Authority of Christ.
Yet others, and the greater number of dissenting Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
were not only deficient herein, but defended them,
joyned with them, and (pretending prudence &amp; preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Schisme</hi>) in effect homologated that deed and the
practice of these Priests <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 26. teaching &amp; advising
the people to hear them, both by precept, and going along

condemned &amp; censured such who preached against the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
thereof, especially in the first place, Worthy <hi>Mr

defection, and <hi>Mr Kid, Mr King, Mr Cameron, Mr Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald

as long as Ministers were faithful in following the Lord in
the way of their duty, Professors were fervent, And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>under
all their Conflicts with Persecuters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the courage &amp;

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41139:70"/>
which from time to time they were now and then
essaying, till defection destroyed, and division diverted
their zeal against the Enemis of God, who before were
alwayes the object against which they whetted the edge of
their just Indignation. Especially the insulting insolency

Anniversary day <hi>May</hi> 29. the Testimony at <hi>Rutherglen</hi> was
Published, against that abomination of celebrating an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary
day, kept every year for giving thanks for the setting
up an usurped power, destroying the Interest of Christ in the Land—And angainst all sinful &amp; unlawful Acts, emitted &amp;
executed, published &amp; prosecuted against our Covenanted Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
Where also they burnt the <hi>Act of Supremacy,</hi> the
<hi>Declaration,</hi> the <hi>Act Recissory</hi> &amp;c. in way of retaliation for
the burning of the Covenants. On the Sabbath following
<hi>Iun.</hi> 1. A field Meeting for the Worship of God near to
<hi>Loudoun-hil</hi> was assaulted by <hi>Graham</hi> of <hi>Claverhouse,</hi> and
with him three troups of horse &amp; Dragoons, who had that
morning taken an honest Minister and about 14 Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
out of their beds and carried them along with them as
Prisoners to the Meeting in a Barbarous manner. But by
the good hand of God upon the Defendents, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed
at <hi>Drumclogg</hi> and put to flight, the Prisoners reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
about 30. of the Souldiers killed on the place, and 3.
of the Meeting, and several wounded on both sides. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
the people retreating from the pursuit, consulted
what was expedient in that juncture, whether to disperse
themselves as formerly, or to keep together for their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
defence. The result was, that considering the
craft &amp; cruelty of those they had to deal with, the sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents
of falling into their hands now more incensed
than ever, the evil effects that likely would ensue upon
their separation, which would give them access to make
havock of all; they judged it most safe in that extremity
for some time not to separate. Which Resolution, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad to the ears of others of their Brethren; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
them incontinently to come to their Assistence,
considering their necessity, and their oun lyableness to the
same common danger, upon the account of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41139:71"/>
of that nature elsewhere to defend themselves, being
of the same judgement for maintaining of the same Cause,
to which the were bound by the same Covenants, and
groaning under the same burdens; they judged therefore
that if they now with held their assistence in such a strait,
they could not be innocent of their Brethrens blood, nor
found faithful in their Covenant: To which they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
with the Countenance &amp; success the Lord had
given to that Meeting, in that defensive Resistence. This
was the Rise &amp; Occasion of that Appearance at <hi>Bothwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
which the Lord did in His Holy Soveraignty
confound, for former Defections by the means of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which broke that litle Army among themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were broken by the Enemy. They continued
together in amiable &amp; amicable peace for the space of
8 or 9 dayes, while they endeavoured to put out &amp; keep out
every wicked thing from amongst them, and adhered to
the <hi>Rutherglen-Testimony,</hi> and that short Declaration at
<hi>Glasgow</hi> confirming it; <q>Representing their present purposes
&amp; endeavours, where only in vindication &amp; defence of
the Reformed Religion—as they stood obliged thereto
by the National &amp; Solemn League &amp; Covenant, and the
Solemn Acknowledgment of Sins &amp; Engagment to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
Declaring against Popery, Prelacy, Erastianisme,
and all things depending thereupon.</q> Intending hereby to
comprehend the defection of the <hi>Indulgence,</hi> to witness
against which all unanimously aggreed: Until the Army
encreasing, the Defenders &amp; Daubers of that defection,
some Ministers and others, came in who broke all, and
upon whom the blood of that Appearance may be charged.
The occasion of the breach was, first, When in the sense
of the obligation of that Command, <hi>when the host goeth forth
against thine enemies, keep thee from every wicked thing,</hi> an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was offered to set times apart for humiliation for the
publick sins of the Land, according to the practice of the
Godly in all ages before engaging their enemies, and the
laudable precedents of our Ancestors; that so the Causes of
Gods wrath against the Nation might be enquired into &amp;
confessed, and the Lords Blessing, Counsel, &amp; Conduct
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41139:72"/>
to &amp; upon present Endeavours, might be implored. And
accordingly the Complying with abjured <hi>Erastianisme,</hi> by
the acceptance of the ensnaring <hi>Indulgence,</hi> offered by &amp;
received from the Usurping Rulers, was condescended
upon among the rest of the grounds of fasting &amp; humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so seasonably &amp; necessarely called for at that time.
The Sticklers for the <hi>Indulgence</hi> refused the overture, upon
politick considerations, for fear of offending the Indulged
Ministers &amp; Gentlemen, and provoking them to withdraw
their Assistence. This was the great Cause of the division,
that produced such unhappy &amp; destructive effects. And
next, whereas the Cause was stated before according to
the Covenants, in the <hi>Rutherglen-Testimony</hi> &amp; <hi>Glasglow-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi>
wherein the Kings Interest was waved; These
Dividers drew up another large paper (called the <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun-Declaration</hi>)
wherein they assert the <hi>Kings Interest,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>third Article</hi> of the Solemn League &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
Against which the best affected contended, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
they could not in Conscience put in his Interest in the
State of the Quarrel, being now in stated opposition to
Christs Interests, and inconsistent with the meaning of
the Covenant, and the practices of the Covenanters, and
their own Testimonies; while now he could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
for as being in the defence of Religion &amp; Liberty,
when he had so palpably overturned &amp; ruined the Work of
Reformation, and oppressed such as adhered thereunto,
and had burnt the Covenant &amp;c. Whereby he had loosed
the people from all obligation to him from it. Yet that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
faction prevailed, so far as to get it published in the
name of all: whereby the Cause was perverted &amp; betrayed,
and the former Testimonies rendered irrite, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the publick Enemy epsoused. Finally, the same
day that the Enemy approached in sight, And a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
advantage was offered to do execution against them,
these Loyal Gentlemen hindered &amp; retarded all Action,
till a <hi>Parly</hi> was beat, and an <hi>Address</hi> dispatched to the
Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who then commanded his Fathers
Army. By which nothing was gained, but free Liberty
given to the Enemies to plant their Canon, and advance
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41139:72"/>
without interruption. After which, in the Holy All-over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
Providence of God, that poor handful was signally
discountenanced of God, deprived of all Conduct, divested
of all Protection, and laid open to the raging Sword, the
just punishment of all such tamperings with the Enemies
of God, and espousing their Interest, and omitting humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
for their own and the Lands sins. About 300
were killed in the Fields, and 1000. and upwards were
taken Prisoners, stripped, and carried to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where
they were kept for a long time in the <hi>Gray Friers</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
without shelter from cold or rain. And at length
had the tentation of an insnaring <hi>bond of peace:</hi> Wherein
they were to acknowledge that Insurrection to be <hi>Rebellion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
and oblige themselves <hi>never to rise in Armes against the King,
nor any commissionate by him, and to live peaceably &amp;c.</hi> Which,
through fear of threatened death, and the unfaithfulness of
some, and the impudence of other Ministers that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
them to take it, prevailed with many: Yet others
resolutely resisted, judging it to imply a condemning of
their duty, an abandoning of their Covenant-Engagments,
wherein they were obliged to duties inconsistent with such
bonds, and a voluntary binding up their hands from all
oppositions to the declared War against Christ, which is
the native sense of the peace they require, which can never
be entertained long with men so treacherous. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon Principles of Reason &amp; Conscience they refused
that pretended <hi>Indemnity,</hi> offered in these termes. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
the most part took it: and yet were sentenced with
banishment; and sent away for <hi>America</hi> as well as they
who refused it; And by the way, (a few excepted,) pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
in Shipwrack: whose blood yet cries both against
the Imposers, and the Perswaders to that bond.</p>
               <p>III. This fearful &amp; fatal stroke at <hi>Bothuel,</hi> not only was
in its immediate effects so deadly, but in its consequents so
destructive, that the decaying Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
before was begining to revive, was then cast into such a
swoon that she is never like to recover to this day. And
the Universality of her Children, which before espoused
her Testimony, was after that partly drawn by Craft, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41139:73"/>
partly drawn by Cruelty, from a Conjunction with their
Brethren in prosecuting the same, either into an open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the Contrary side, or into a detestable indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
&amp; neutrality in the Cause of God. For first of all the
Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> whose nature more averse from
Cruelty than the rest of that Progeny made him pliable to
all suggestions of wicked policy, that seemed to have a
shew or smoothness &amp; lenity, procured the emission of a
pretended <hi>Indemnity,</hi> attended with the foresaid <hi>Band of
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ace</hi> for its Companion. Which were dreadful snares,
catching many with flatteries, and fair pretences of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
fairded over with curious words and cozening
names of living <hi>peaceably</hi> &amp;c. while in the mean time a most
deadly &amp; destructive thrust (as it were under the fifth rib)
because most secret, was intended against all that was left
remaining of the Work of God undestroyed, and a bar put
upon all essayes to revive or recover it by their oun con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
who should endeavour it. This Course of Defection
carried away many at that time: And from that time, since
the taking of that bond of <hi>peaceable living,</hi> there hath been an
universal preferring of peace to Truth, and of ease to duty.
And the generality have been left to swallow all baits, tho
the hook was never so discernible, all those ensnaring
Oaths &amp; Bonds imposed since, which both then &amp; since
People were left to their oun determination to chuse or
refuse; many Ministers refusing to give their Advice when
required &amp; requested thereunto, and some not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
or afraid to perswad the People to take them. The
Ministrie then also were generally insnared with that <hi>band<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Indulgence,</hi> the pretended benefit of that <hi>Indemnity,</hi>
which as it was designed so it produced the woful effect of
propagating the defection, and promoting the division,
and laying them by from their duty &amp; Testimony of that
day, which to this day they have not yet taken upon their
former ground. For when a Proclamation was emitted,
inveighing bitterly against <hi>field Meetings,</hi> and absolutely
interdicting all such for the future under highest pain, but
granting Liberty to Preach in houses upon the termes of a
<hi>Cautionary bond</hi> given for their living peaceably: yet exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41139:73"/>
all these Ministers who were suspected to have been
at the late <hi>Rebellion;</hi> and all these who shall afterward be
admitted by Non-Conforme Ministers: And certifying,
that <hi>if ever they shall be at any field Conventickle, the said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity
shall not be useful to such Transgressours any manner of
way:</hi> And requiring security, that none under the colour
of this favour continue to preach <hi>Rebellion.</hi> Though there
seems to be enough in the Proclamation it self to have
scarred them from this scandalous snare, yet a Meeting of
Ministers at <hi>Edinburg</hi> made up of Indulged, avowed Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauders
of the Indulgence, or underhand Approvers and
favourers of the same, and some of them old <hi>Publick Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutioners,</hi>
assuming to themselves the name of a General
Assembly, yea of the Representative of the Church of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> voted for the Acceptance of it. And so formally
transacted &amp; bargained upon base, dishonest, &amp; dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
termes with the Usurper, by consenting &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacting
with the People to give that bond, Wherein the
People upon an humble Petition to the Council, <q>obtaining
their Indulged-Minister do bind &amp; oblige—that the
said—shall live peaceably. And in order thereto to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
him before his Maj. Privie Council, when they
shall be called so to do; And in case of failzie in not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
him, to be Lyable to the summe of 6000 Merks.</q>
Whereby they condemned themselves of former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceableness,
and engaged to a sinful Peace with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of God, and became bound and fettered under these
bonds to a forbearance of a Testimony, and made answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their Courts, and the People were bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
them for their duty. The sinfulness, scandalousness,
&amp; inconveniences of which transactions, are abundantly
demonstrated by a Treatise thereupon, intituled, <hi>The
Banders disbanded.</hi> Nevertheless many embraced this new
<hi>bastard Indulgence,</hi> that had not the benefit of the former
brat, of the same Mother the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and far more
consented to it without a witness, and most of all did
some way homologate it, in preaching under the sconce of
it: Declining the many reiterated &amp; urgent Calls of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ealous Lovers of Christ, to come out and maintain the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41139:74"/>
Testimony of the Gospel in the open fields, for the honour
of their Master and the freedom of their Ministrie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
as many poor People were stumbled and jumbled
into many confusions, so that they were so bewildered &amp;
bemisted in doubts &amp; debates, that they knew not what to
do, and were tempted to question the Cause formerly
so servently contended for against all opposition, then so
simply abandoned, by these that seemed sometimes valiant
for it, when they saw them consulting more their oun
ease than the Concerns of their Masters Glory, or the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the poor people hungering for the Gospel, and
standing in need of Counsel in time of such abounding
snares, whereby many became a prey to all tentations: So
the more zealous &amp; faithful, after several Addresses, Calls,
&amp; Invitations to Ministers, finding themselves deserted by
them, judged themselves under a necessity to discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
many of them, whom formerly they followed with
pleasure; and to resolve upon a pursuit &amp; prosecution of
the duty of the day without them, and to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with faithful Ministers, who would not shun for all
hazards to declare the whole Counsel of God. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
through the tender Mercy of God, compassionating
the exigence of the People, the Lord sent them first <hi>Mr
Richard Cameron,</hi> with whom after his serious solicitation
his Brethren denied their concurrence, and then <hi>Mr
Donald Cargil;</hi> who, with a zeal &amp; boldness becoming
Christs Ambassadours, maintained &amp; prosecuted the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
against all the Indignities done to their Master and
wrongs to the Cause, both by the encroachments of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
and defections of their declining Brethren.
Wherein they were signally countenanced of their Master;
And the Lords Inheritance was again revived with the
showres of the Gospels blessings, wherewith they had been
before refreshed; and enlightened with a Glance &amp; Glimpse
of resplendent brightness, immediatly before the obscurity
of this fearful night of darkness that hath succeeded. But
as Christ was then displaying His beauty, to His poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
&amp; persecuted People; so Antichrist began to blaze
his bravery, in the solemn &amp; shameful reception of his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41139:74"/>
harbinger, that Pimp of the <hi>Romish</hi> whore, the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>York.</hi> Who had now pulled off the Mask, under which he
had long covered his Antichristian Bigotrie, through a
trick of his brother, constrained by the Papists importunity,
and the necessity of their favour, &amp; recruit of their Coyn,
either to declare himself Papist, or to make his brother do
it: whereby all the locusts were engaged to his Interest,
with whom he entered into a Conspiracy and <hi>Popish Plot,</hi>
as was discovered by many infallible evidences, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
by <hi>Coleman</hi> his Secretary, to <hi>Sir Edmund-Bury Godfrey;</hi>
for which, lest he should witness against him, when <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
was apprehended, that Gentleman was cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorks</hi> contrivance &amp; command. Yet
for all the demonstrations of his being a Bigot Papist, that
he had long given unto the world, it is known what some
suffered for saying, that the <hi>Duke of York was a Papist and
being forced to leave</hi> England <hi>he was come to</hi> Scotland <hi>to promots
Poperie &amp; Arbitrary Government.</hi> However, thô the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England,</hi> for his Poperie &amp; Villanie, and his plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp; pursuing the destruction of the Nation, did vote his
<hi>Exclusion;</hi> yet degenerate <hi>Scotland</hi> did receive him in great
pompe &amp; pride. Against which, the forementioned faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
witnesses of Christ did find themselves obliged to testify
their just resentment, and to protest against his succeeding
to the Croun, in their Declaration published at <q>

at <hi>Rutherglen,</hi>
                  </q> and disclaiming that declaration at
<hi>Hamiltoun.</hi> This Action was generally condemned by the
body of lurking Ministers, both for the matter of it, and
the unseasonableness of it, and its apparent unfeasibleness,
being done by a handful so inconsiderable, for number,
strength, or significancy. But as they had very great &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41139:75"/>
reasons to disclaim that Tyrants Authority, hinted
in the Declaration it self, and hereafter more fully vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated:
so the necessity of a Testimony against all the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Encroachments on Religion &amp; Liberty, then current
&amp; encreasing; and the sin &amp; shame of shifting &amp; delaying it
so long, when the Blasphemous Supremacy was now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to its summity; the Churches Priviledges all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
Religion and the Work of Reformation trampled
under foot; the Peoples Rights &amp; Liberties destroyed, and
Lawes all subverted; and no shadow of Government left
but arbitrary Absoluteness, obtruding the Tyrants will for
Reason, and his Letter for the Supreme Law (witness the
Answer which one of the Council gave to another, obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
against their Proceedings as not according to Law,
<hi>what devil do ye talk of Law? have not we the Kings Letter for it?</hi>)
And all the ends of Magistracy wholly inverted; while inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
&amp; honest People were grievously oppressed in their
persons, Consciences, &amp; Estates; And Perjuries, Adulteries,
Idolatries, and all impieties were not only connived at, but
countenanced as badges of Loyaltie, and manifest &amp; mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Robbries &amp; Murders Authorized, Judgement turned
into gall, and the fruit of Righteousness into hemlock; do
justify its <hi>Seasonableness:</hi> And the <hi>ends</hi> of the Declaration, to
keep up the Standart of the Gospel, and maintain the Work
of Reformation, and preserve a Remnant of faithful Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
to it; the <hi>nature</hi> of the Resolution declared, being only
to endeavour to make good &amp; maintain their Revolt, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to all who would pursue them for it, and reinforce
them to a subjection to that yoke of slaverie again; and the

in his maintainance of the true Covenanted Religion—which
homage they cannot now require upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

Of the hope of their returning from these
Courses: Whereof there is none, seeing they have so often
declared their purposes of persevering ill thein, And
suppose they should dissemble a repentance—suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
also they might be pardoned, for that which is done—from
whose guiltiness the Land cannot be cleansed,
but by executing Gods righteous Judgements upon them—yet
they cannot now be believed, after they have
violated all that humane wisdom could devise to bind

those associate with him in the Government—and
declare them henceforth no lawful Rulers, as they had
declared them to be no lawful Subjects—they having
destroyed the established Religion, overturned the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental

Divorces &amp; Polygamie—6. Seeing the greatest part
of Ministers, not only were defective in Preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

—And whereas Separation might be imputed
to them, they refell both the malice, and the ignorance
of that Calumnie—for if there be a Separation, it
must be where the change is; and that was not to be
found in them, who were not separating from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the true Church, nor setting up a New Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie,
but cleaving to the same Ministers &amp; Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
that formerly they followed, when others
have fled to new wayes, and a new Authority, which is
like the old piece in the new Garment. 8. That they
shall defend themselves in their Civil, Natural, &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Rights &amp; Liberties—And if any assault them,
they shall look on it as a declaring a war, and take all
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41139:76"/>
advantages that one enemie does of another—but trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</q>
and injure none but those that injure them—This
is the Compend of that Paper which the Enemies seised
and published, while it was only in a rude draught, and
not polished, digested, nor consulted by the rest of the
Community: yet, whether or not it was for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
so to blaze their oun baseness in that Paper truly
represented, I leave it to the Reader to judge: or, if they
did not thereby Proclaim their oun Tyrannie, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
&amp; honesty of that people, whom thereby they were
seeking to make odious; but in effect inviting all Lovers
of Religion &amp; Liberty to Sympathise with them, in their
difficulties &amp; distresses there discovered. However that
poor Partie continued together in a posture of defence,
without the Concurrence or Countenance of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
Brethren, who staid at home, and left both them
to be murdered and their Testimony to be trampled upon,
untill the 22. of <hi>Iulij</hi> 1680. Upon the which day they
were attacqued at <hi>Airsmoss,</hi> by a strong party of about 120
horse well armed, while they were but 23 horse and 40
foot at most; and so fighting valiantly were at length rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not without their Adversaries Testimony of their
being resolute men: Several of Zions precious Mourners,
and faithful Witnesses of Christ, were killed; and among
the rest, that faithful Minister of Christ, <hi>Mr Richard Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron</hi>
sealed &amp; fulfilled his Testimony with his blood. And
with others, the valiant and much honoured Gentleman,
<hi>David Hackstoun</hi> of <hi>Rathillet,</hi> was after many received
wounds apprehended, brought in to <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and there,
resolutely adhering to the Testimony, and disouning the
Authority of King &amp; Council, and all their Tyrannical
Judicatories, was cruelly murdered, but countenanced
eminently of the Lord. Now remained <hi>Mr Donald Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi>
deprived of his faithful Collegue, destitute of his
Brethrens concurrence, but not of the Lords Counsel
&amp; Conduct; by which he was prompted &amp; helped to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Testimony, against the Universal Apostasie of the
Church &amp; Nation, Tyranny of Enemies, Backsliding
of Friends, and all the wrongs done to his Master on
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41139:77"/>
all hands. And considering, in the zeal of God, and sense
of His holy Jealousie provoked and threatening wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Land; for the sins especially of Rulers; who had
arrived to the hight of Heaven-daring Insolence in all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
in which they were still growing &amp; going on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
control; That notwithstanding of all the Testimonies
given against them, by publick Preachings, Protestations,
and Declarations, remonstrating their Tyranny and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouning
their Authority; yet not only did they still persist in
their sins &amp; scandals, to make the Lords fierce Anger break
forth into a flame, but were ouned also by Professors, not
only as Magistrats, but as members of the Christian &amp;
<hi>Protestant</hi> Church; And that, however both the defensive
armes of men had been used against them, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
armes of Prayers, and the Ministerial weapon of
Preaching, yet that of <hi>Ecclesiastical Censure</hi> had not been
Authoritatively exerted against them: Therefore, that no
Weapon which Christ allowes His Servants under His
Standart to manage against His Enemies might be wanting,
thô he could not obtain the Concurrence of his Brethren
to strengthen the solemnity &amp; formality of the Action; yet
he did not judge that defect, in this broken Case of the
Church, could disable his Authority nor de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ur the duty,
but that he might and ought to proceed to <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
And accordingly, in <hi>September</hi>—1680. at the <hi>Torwood,</hi>
he excommunicated some of the most scandalous and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Promoters &amp; Abettors of this Conspiracy against
Christ, as formally as the present Case could admit: After
Sermon upon <hi>Ezek. 21. 25, 26, 27. And thou profane wicked
Prince of Israel, whose day is come</hi> &amp;c. He had a short and
pertinent discourse on the nature, the subject, the causes,
and the ends of <hi>Excommunication</hi> in general: And then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that he was not led out of any private Spirit or
passion to this Action, but constrained by Conscience of
duty and zeal to God to stigmatize with this brand, and
wound with the Sword of the Lord, these Enemies of
God that had so Apostatized, rebelled against, mocked,
despised &amp; defied Our Lord, and to declare them as they
are none of His, to be none of ours. The persons excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41139:77"/>
and the Sentence against them, was given
forth as followes—<hi>I being a Minister of Iesus Christ, and
having Authority and Power from Him, do, in His Name &amp; by
His Spirit, excommunicat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, cast out of the true Church, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
up to Satan,</hi> Charles the Second, <hi>King &amp;c.</hi> The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was founded upon these grounds, <q>declared in the
pronunciation thereof (1) for his high mocking of God,
in that after he had acknowledged his own sins, his fathers
sins, his mothers Idolatrie—yet had gone on more avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
in the same than all before him. (2) for his great
Perjurie, in breaking &amp; burning the Covenant. (3) for
his rescinding all Lawes for establishing the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and enacting Lawes contrarie thereunto. (4) for
commanding of Armies to destroy the Lords people.
(5) for his being an Enemy to true Protestants, &amp; helper
of the Papists, and hindering the execution of just Lawes
against them. (6) for his granting Remissions &amp; Pardons
for Murderers, which is in the power of no King to do,
being expressly contrare to the Law of God. (7) for his
Adulteries, and dissembling with God &amp; man—Next
by the same Authority, and in the same name, he excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<hi>Iames Duke of York,</hi> for his Idolatrie, and
setting it up in <hi>Scotland</hi> to defile the Land, and entycing
&amp; encouraging others to do so:</q> Not mentioning any
other sins, but what he scandalously persisted in in <hi>Scotland</hi>
&amp;c. With several other rotten Malignant Enemies, on
whom the Lord hath rati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ed that Sentence since very
remarkably, whose sins &amp; punishments both may be read
more visiblie in the Providences of the time, than I can
record them. But about this time, when amidst all the
abounding defections &amp; divisions of that dark &amp; dismal
hour of tentation, some in zeal for the Cause were endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to keep up the Testimony of the day, in an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
from Complying Ministers; Others were left (in
holy judgment, to be a stumbling block to the Generation
hardening them in their defections, and to be a beacon to
the most zealous to keep off from all unwarrantable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses)
to fall into fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ul extravagances and delirious &amp;
damnable delusions, being overdriven with ignorant &amp;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41139:78"/>
blind zeal into untroden paths, which led them into a
labyrinth of darkness; when as they were stumbled at many
Ministers their unfaithfulness, so through the deceit of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
and the hypocrisie of his Instruments, they came to be
offended at <hi>Mr Cargil</hi> his faithfulness, who spared neither
left hand declensions nor right hand extremes, and left
him and all the Ministers; not only disouning all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with those that were not of their way, but exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating
&amp; Cursing them; and kept themselves in desert
places from all Company; where they persisted prodigiously
in fastings, and singing Psalms, pretending to wonderful
raptures &amp; Enthusiasmes: and in fine, <hi>I. Gib</hi> with 4 more of
them came to that hight of Blasphemy, that they burnt the
Bible &amp; Confession of Faith. These were the <hi>sweet singers,</hi>
as they were called, led away into these delusions by that
Impostor &amp; Sorcerer <hi>Iohn Gib;</hi> who never encreased to such
a number, as was then feared &amp; reported, being within thirty
&amp; most part women: all which for the most part have been
through Mercy reclaimed from that destructive way, which
through Grace the Reproached Remnant, adhering to
the foresaid Testimony, had alwayes an abhorrence of.
Wherefore that ignorant &amp; impudent Calumnie, of their
Consortship with <hi>Gibs</hi> followers, is only the vent of vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Envy. For they were the first that discovered them,
and whose pains the Lord blessed in reclaiming them, and
were alwayes so far from partaking with them, that to this
day these that have come off from that way, and have
offered the Confession of their scandal, do still complain
of their over-rigid severity, in not admitting them to their
select fellowships. To which may be added this undenyable
Demonstration, that whereas the persecu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing <hi>Courts of
Inquisition</hi> did alwayes extend the utmost severity against
the Ouners of this Testimony, yet they spared them: And
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> then in <hi>Scotland</hi> was so we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> pleased with
<hi>Gib's</hi> Blasphemies, that he favoured him extraordinarly,
and freely dismissed him. This was a cloudy &amp; dark day,
but not without a burning &amp; shining light as long as that
faithful Minister of Christ, <hi>Mr Donald Cargil,</hi> was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Work of the Lord; who shortly after this finished
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41139:78"/>
his Testimony, being apprehended with other two faithful
&amp; zealous Witnesses of Christ, <hi>Mr Walter Smith,</hi> and <hi>Mr
Iames Boog,</hi> who with 2 more were altogether, at <hi>Edinburgh
27. Iulij</hi> 1681. Crouned with the Glory of Martyrdom.
Then came the day of the Remnants vexation, trouble,
darkness &amp; dimness of anguish, wherein who so looked
unto the Land could see nothing but darkness &amp; sorrow, &amp;
the light darkened in the Heavens thereof, wherein neither
Star nor Sun appeared for many dayes, and poor People
were made to grope for the wall like the blind, and to
stumble in noon day as in the night. While the Persecution
advanced on the one hand, a violent spait of defection
carried doun the most part of Ministers &amp; Professors before
it, driving them to Courses of sinful &amp; scandalous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formings
with the times Corruptions, Compearings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Courts, Complyings with their Commands,
paying of theis <hi>Cesses</hi> and other Exactions, Taking of their
Oaths &amp; Bonds, and countenancing their Prelatical
Church-Services, which they were ashamed to do before.
And thereupon on the other hand the Divisions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions
were augmented, and poor people that desired to
cleave to the Testimony were more &amp; more offended
and stumbled at the Ministers, who either left the Land
in that clamant Call of the peoples necessity, or lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their own retirements, and declined the duty of
that day, leaving people to determine themselves in
all their perplexities, as a prey to all tentations. But
the tender Pastor and Shepherd of <hi>Israel,</hi> who leads
the blind in the way they know not, did not forsake a
Remnant in that hour of tentation who kept the Word of
His Patience; and as He helped those that fell into the hands
of Enemies to Witness a good Confession, so He strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
the zeal of the remaining Contenders, against all
the Machinations of Adversaries to crush it, and all the
Methods of Backsliding Professors to quench it. And the
mean which most effectually preserved it in life &amp; vigour,
was the expedient they fell upon of Corresponding in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Meetings,</hi> to consult, informe, &amp; confirme one another
about common duties in common dangers, for preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41139:79"/>
of the Remnant from the destruction &amp; contagion of
the times, and propagation of the Testimony: Laying
doun this General Conclusion for a foundation of Order,
to be observed among them in incident doubtful cases, &amp;
emergent Controversies, that <hi>nothing relative to the publick,
and which concerns the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e of their Community, be done by any of
them, without harmonious consent sought after &amp; rationally waited
for, and sufficient deliberation about the best means &amp; manner.</hi> In
the mean time, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> as Commissioner from his
brother, held a Parliament wherein he presided, not only
against all righteous Lawes that make a bloody &amp; avowed
Papist incapable or such a Trust, but against the Letter of
their oun wicked Lawes, whereby none ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
but such as swear the Oaths; yet not only was he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
in this place, but in the whole Administration of the
Government of <hi>Scotland</hi> without the taking any Oath,
which then he was Courting to be entailed Successor and
heir of the Croun thereof; And for this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

carrying on his oun Popish &amp; Tyrannical designs: But what
good-will he hath born to it, not only his acts &amp; actings

but his words do witness, which is known when and to
whom he spake, when he said, <hi>It would never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the southside of</hi> Forth <hi>were made a hunting field.</hi> However in
that Parliament, <hi>anno</hi> 1681. he is chiefly intended, and upon
the matter by a wicked Act declared legal &amp; lineal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
and a detestable Blasphemous and Self-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
<hi>Test</hi> is framed for a Pest to Consciences, which
turned out of all places of Trust any that had any remaining
measure of common honesty; And when some was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a bill for securing Religion in case of a Popish Prince,
the Dukes answer was notable, that <hi>whatsoever they intended
or prepared against Papists should light upon others:</hi> whereby we
may understand what measures we may expect, when his
designs are ripe. And to all the Cruel Acts then &amp; before
made against the People of God, there was one superadded
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41139:79"/>
regulating the execution of all the rest, whereby at one
dash all Civil &amp; Criminal Justice was overthroun, and a
foundation laid for Popish-Tyranny, that <hi>the Right of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
both in Civil &amp; Criminal Matters is so inherent in the
Croun, that his Maj. may judge all Causes by himself, on any
other he thinks fit to commissionate.</hi> Here was Law for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionating
Souldiers to take away the lives of Innocents,
as was frequently exemplified afterwards, and may serve
hereafter for erecting the <hi>Spanish Inquisition</hi> to murder Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
when he thinks fit to commissonate them. Against
which wicked Encroachments on Religion &amp; Liberty, the
Faithful thought themselves obliged to emit a Testimony:
And therefore published a <hi>Declaration at Lanerk, Iannary</hi>
12. 1682. Confirming the preceeding at <hi>Sanquhair,</hi> and
adding reasons of their Revolt from the Government of
<hi>Charles the Second.</hi> 1. <q>For cutting off the neck at one blow
of the noble Constitution of Church &amp; State, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving
all Officers in the Kingdom in the same perjurie
with himself. 2. For exalting himself into a sphere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
all measures Divine &amp; humane, Tyrannically
obtruding his will for a Law in his arbitrary Letters, so
that we are made the reproach of Nations, who say, <hi>we
have only the Law of Letters instead of the Letter of the Law.</hi>
3. For his constant adjourning &amp; dissolving Parliaments
at his pleasure. 4. For his arrogantly arrogated Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
in all Causes Civil &amp; Ecclesiastick, and oppressing
the Godly for Conscience &amp; duty. 5. For his exorbitan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Taxings, Cessings, &amp; grinding the faces of the poor,
dilapidating the rights &amp; revenues of the Croun, for no
other end but to imploy them for keeping up a <hi>Borthel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
rather than a <hi>Court.</hi> 6. For installing a successor, such
an one (if not worse) as himself, contrare to all Law,
Reason, &amp; Religion, and framing the <hi>Test</hi> &amp;c. And in
end offer to prove, they have done nothing in this against
our Ancient Lawes, Civil or Ecclesiastick—but only
endeavoured to extricate themselves from under a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
yoke, and to reduce Church &amp; State to what they
were in the year 1648 and 1649.</q> After which Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they were more condemned by them that were at
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41139:80"/>
ease than ever, and very untenderly dealt with; being
without any previous admonition reproached, accused,
and informed against, both at home &amp; abroad, as if they
had turned to some wild &amp; unhappy Course. For which
Cause, in the next General Meeting, they resolved to
delegate some of their number to forreign Churches, on
purpose to vindicate themselves from these Calumnies,
and to represent the justness of their Cause, and the sadness
of their Case, and provoke them to some Sympathie
abroad, which was denied at home: And withall to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for a Succession of Witnesses, who might maintain
the Testimony, which was then in appearance interrupted,
except by Martyrdom &amp; Sufferings. Therefore by that
means having obtained access for the instruction of some
young men, at an University in the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> in
process of time, <hi>Mr Iames Renwick</hi> received Ordination
there, and came home to take up the Standart of his
Master, upon the ground where it last was left, and to
carry on the Testimony against all the oppositions of that
day, from open Enemies &amp; backsliding Professors: an
undertaking more desperate-like than that of <hi>Unus Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius
contra totam orbem,</hi> and like that of a Child threshing
doun a Mountain. Which yet against all the outragious
rage of ravening Enemies, ranging, ravaging, hunting,
chasing, pursuing after him, through all the touns, villages,
cottages, woods, moors, mosses, &amp; mountains of the
Country; and against all the scourge of tongues, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
condemnations, obliquies, reproaches, &amp;
cruel mockings of incensed Professors, and generally of
all the Inhabitants of the Land; he was helped to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
by many weary wanderings, travells, and travers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
through the deserts, night &amp; day, Preaching, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
&amp; Catechising, mostly in the cold winter nighrs in
the open fields: until, by the Blessing of God upon his
labours, not only was the faithfull Witnessing Remnant
that joyned in the Testimony, further cleared confirmed,
and encouraged, and their number much encreased by
the coming in and joyning of many others to the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of their settled Societies; but also many others, in

but as soon as it grew dark, all hope lost, they dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
every man shifting for himself; only a few keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together all the nixt day, had a skirmage with a
Party of the Enemies, in which they slew the Captain,
and about 12 or some moe of his men, and afterwards
they dispersed themselves also. The Enemies, searching
the Country, gleaned up the E. of <hi>Argyle</hi> himself, Col.
<hi>Rumbol</hi> an <hi>Englishman, Mr Thomas Archer</hi> Minister, <hi>Gawin
Russel,</hi> an <hi>David Law,</hi> who were all condemned &amp; exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and many others who were banished to
<hi>America:</hi> and about some 20 in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> who were
hanged at <hi>Inerarie.</hi> In <hi>England,</hi> the D. of <hi>Monmouths</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
though it had more action, yet terminated in the

in Battel: And afterwas, by the <hi>mercy</hi> of the <hi>Duke of York<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
several hunderds in the <hi>West</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were carried about
and hanged before the door of their oun habitations; and
to make his Captains sport by the way, according to the
number of the hours of the day, when the murdering hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
came in their head, so many of the poor Captives
were hanged, as a prodigious monument of monstrous
Crueltie. This was the Comencement of the present Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
Government. In the mean time, the <hi>Wanderers</hi> in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> thô they did not associate with this Expedition
upon the account of the too promiscuous admittence of
persons to trust in that Partie, who were then and since
have discovered themselves to be Enemies to the Cause,
and because they could not espouse their <hi>Declaration</hi> as the
State of their Quarrel, being not concerted according
to the constant Plea of the <hi>Scots</hi> Covenanters, and for
other reasons given in their late <hi>Vindication:</hi> yet against
this Usurpation of a bloody Papist, advancing himself to
the Throne in such a manner, they published another <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi>
at <hi>Sanquhair, May</hi> 28. 1685. <q>Wherein, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
&amp; adhering unto all their former Declarations,
And considering that <hi>Iames</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> a Profest &amp;
Excommunicate Papist, was proclaimed—To te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
their resentment of that deed, And to make it appear
unto the world, that they were free thereof, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41139:81"/>
or connivance; They Protest against the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Proclamation of <hi>Iames</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> as King: In

who hath shed the blood of the Saints—that it
is the hight of Confederacy with an Idolater, for bidden
by the Law of God—contrarie to the Declaration of
the <hi>Gen. Ass.</hi> of the Church, <hi>Iulij</hi> 27. 1649. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to many wholesome &amp; laudable Acts of Parliament—and
inconsistent with the safety, faith, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
&amp; Christian Libertie of a Christian People, to
chuse a subject of Antichrist to be their Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate—and
to entrust an Enemy to the Work &amp;
People of God with the Interests of both: And upon
many important grounds &amp; reasons (which there they
express) they Protest against the validity &amp; Constitution
of that Parliament, approving &amp; ratifying the foresaid
Proclamation—And against all kind of Poperie in
General &amp; Particular heads—as abjured by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Covenant, and abrogated by Acts of Parliament—and
against its entrie again into this Land, And eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that doth or may directly or indirectly make way
for the same: Disclaiming likewise all Sectarianisme,
Malignancy,</q> and any Confederacy therewith.—This
was their Testimony against <hi>Poperie</hi> in the season thereof:
which thô it was not so much condemned as any former
Declarations, yet neither in this had they the Concurrence
of any Ministers or Professors; who as they had been silent,
and omitted a seasonable Testimony against Prelacy, and
the Supremacy, when these were introduced, so now also,
even when this wicked Mysterie &amp; Conspiracie of Poperie
&amp; Tyrannie, twisted together in the present designe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
had made so great a progress, and was evidently
brought above board, they were left to let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lip this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of a Testimony also, to the reproach of the declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp; far degenerate Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Yea to their
shame, the very rabble of ignorant People may be brought
as a witness against the body of Presbyterian Ministers in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> in that they testified their detestation of the first
Erection of the Idolatrous <hi>Mass,</hi> and some of the souldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41139:81"/>
and such as had no Profession of Religion, suffered unto
death for speaking against Poperie and the designs of the
King, while the Ministers were silent. And some of the
Curats, and members of the late Parliament 1686. made
some stickling against the taking away of the penal Statutes
against Papists; while Presbyterians, from whom might
have been expected greater opposition, were sleeping in a
profound submission. I cannot without Confusion of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
touch these obvious &amp; dolorous reflections, and yet in
candor cannot forbear them. However the Persecution
against the <hi>Wanderers</hi> went on, and more cruel Edicts were
given forth against them, while a relenting abatement of
severity was pretended against other Dissenters. At length
what could not be obtained by Law at the late Parliament
for taking off the Statutes against Papists, was effectuated
by Prerogative: and to make it pass with the greater appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
it was convoyed in a channel of pretended Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
offering a sort of <hi>Liberty,</hi> but really introducing a
licencious <hi>Latitude,</hi> for bringing in all future snares by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off some former, as arbitrarly as before they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
in a Proclamation dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 12. 1687. Granting,
<q>by the Kings Soveraign Authority, Prerogative Royal,
and <hi>absolute power, which all Subjects are to obey without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</hi>
a Royal <hi>Toleration,</hi> to the several Professors of the
Christian Religion afternamed, with &amp; under the several
Conditions, restrictions, &amp; limitations aftermention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In the first place, tolerating the <hi>Moderate Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
to meet in their private houses, and there to hear
all such Ministers, as either have or are willing to accept
of the Indulgence allanerly, and none other: And that
there be nothing said or done contrare to the wel &amp;
peace of his reign, seditious or treasonable, under the
highest pains these Crimes will import, nor are they to
presume to build Meeting houses, or to use out-houses
or barns—In the mean time its his Royal will &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that <hi>Field Conventicles,</hi> and such as Preach at them,
or who shall any way assist or connive at them, shall be
prosecute according to the utmost severity of Lawes
made against them—In like manner tolerating the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41139:82"/>
Quakers to meet &amp; exercise in their forme, in any place
or places appointed for their Worship—And by the
same <hi>absolute power,</hi> foresaid, suspending, stoping, &amp;
disabling all Lawes or Acts of Parliament, Customs,
or Constitutions against any <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> subjects—So
that they shall in all things be as free in all respects as
any Protestant subjects whatsoever, not only to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their Religion, but to enjoy all Offices, benefices,
&amp;c. which he shall think fit to bestow upon them in all
time coming—And cassing, annulling, &amp; discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all <hi>Oaths</hi> whatsoever, and <hi>Tests,</hi> and Lawes enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. And in place of them this Oath only is to be
taken—<hi>I A. B. do ackowledge, testifie, &amp; declare
that Iames the Seventh &amp;c. is rightful King &amp; Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of these Realms, and over all persons therein; And that
it is unlawful for Subjects, on any Pretence or for any Cause
whatsoever, to rise in Armes against him, or any Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
by him; and that I shall never so rise in Armes, nor as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
any who shall so do; And that I shall never resist his power
or Authority, nor ever oppose this Authority to his person—but
shall to the utmost of my power assist, defend, &amp;
maintain him, his heirs &amp; lawful successors, in the exercise of
their Absolute power &amp; Authority against all deadly</hi>—And
by the same <hi>absolute power</hi> giving his ful &amp; ample <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnitie,</hi>
to all the foresaid sorts of People, under the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
restrictions.</q> Here is a Proclamation for a Prince:
That Proclaims him in whose name it is emitted, to be
the greatest Tyrant that ever lived in the world, and their
Revolt who have disouned him to be the justest that ever
was. For herein that Monster of <hi>Prerogative</hi> is not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
paramount to all Lawes Divine &amp; humane, but
far surmounting all the lust, impudence, &amp; insolence of all
the <hi>Roman, Sicilian, Turkish, Tartarian,</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
that ever trampled upon the Liberties of Mankind;
who have indeed demanded <hi>absolute subjectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> &amp; surrender
of their Lives, Lands, &amp; Liberties at their pleasure, but
never arrived at such a hight of arrogance as this does, to
claim <hi>absolute obedience, without reserve</hi> of Conscience, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Honour, or Reason; Not only that which igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41139:82"/>
is called <hi>Passive,</hi> never to resist him, not only on
any <hi>Pretence,</hi> but for any <hi>Cause,</hi> even thô he should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his Popish <hi>Ianizaries</hi> to murder &amp; massacre all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
which is the tender mercy &amp; burning fervent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Papists;</hi> but also of <hi>absolute Active obedience</hi> without
<hi>reserve,</hi> to assist, defend, &amp; maintain him in every thing,
whereby he shall be pleased to exercise his <hi>absolute power,</hi> thô
he should command to burn the <hi>Bible</hi> as well as the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
(as already he applauded <hi>Iohn Gib</hi> in doing of it) and
to burn and butcher all that will not go to <hi>Mass,</hi> which we
have all grounds to expect will be the end of his Clemency
at last. Herein he claims a power to command what he
will, and obliging subjects to obey whatsoever he will
command: A power to rescind, stop, &amp; disable all Lawes;
which unhinges all stabilitie and unsettles all the security
of humane societie, yea extinguishes all that remains of
natural Liberty: Wherein, as is wel observed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Representation of the threatening dangers impending
over Protestants Pag.</hi> 53.</bibl> It is very natural to observe, that
he allowes the Government, under which we were
born, and to which we were sworn, to be hereby
subverted &amp; changed, and that thereupon we are not
only absolved &amp; acquited from all Allegiance to him,
but indispensably obliged, by the ties &amp; engagments
that are upon us, to apply our selves to the use of all
means &amp; endeavours against him, as an Enemy of the
People &amp; subverter of the legal Government.</q> But this
was so gross, and grievously gripping in its restrictions, as
to persons, as to the place, as to the matter allowed the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> in Preaching, that it was disdained of all; and
therefore he behoved to busk it better, and mend the matter,
in a Letter to the Council (the Supreme Law of <hi>Scotland</hi>)
bearing date <hi>March</hi> 31. 1687. of this tenor—Whereas
<q>we did recommend to yow to take care, that any of the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> should not be allowed to Preach, but such
only as should have your Allowance for the same, and
that they at the receiving the <hi>Indulgence</hi> should take the
Oath contained in the Proclamation—These are
therefore to let you know, that thereby we meant such
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41139:83"/>
of them as did not solemnly take the <hi>Test;</hi> but if never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preachers do scruple to take the
said Oath, or any other Oath whatsoever, and that you
shall find it reasonable or fit to grant them or any of them
our said <hi>Indulgence,</hi> so as they desire it upon these termes;
It is now our will &amp; pleasure—to grant them our said
Indulgence, without being obliged to take the Oath,
with power unto them to enjoy the benefite of the said
Indulgence (during our pleasure only) or so long as
yow shall find they behave themselves <hi>regularly</hi> &amp;
<hi>peaceably,</hi> without giving any cause of offence to us,
or any in Authority or trust under us in our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</q>—Thus
finding the former Proposal not
adequately apportioned to his design, because of its pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
odiousness, he would pretend his meaning was
mistaken (thô it was manifest enough) and mitigate the
matter by taking away of the Oaths altogether, <hi>if any should
scruple it;</hi> whereas he could not but know, that all that
had sense would abhor it: yet it is clogged with the same
restrictions, limited to the same persons, characterized
more plainly and peremptorly, with an addition of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
not only that they shall not say or do any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare
to the wel &amp; peace of his reign seditious or treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
but also that they behave themselves regularly &amp;
peaceably <hi>without giving any cause of offence</hi> to him or any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him; which comprehends lesser offences than <hi>sedition</hi> or
<hi>treason,</hi> even every thing that will displease a Tyrant and a
Papist, that is, all faithfulness in seasonable Duties or
Testimonies. But at length lest the difformity &amp; disparity
of the <hi>Proclamation</hi> for the <hi>Toleration</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the
<hi>Declaration</hi> for <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> should make
his Pretences to Conscience suspect of disingenuity, and
lest it should be said he had one Conscience for <hi>England</hi>
and another for <hi>Scotland;</hi> therefore he added a third <hi>eke</hi>
to the liberty, but such as made it still an ill favoured
patched project to destroy Religion &amp; true Liberty, in
another Proclamation dated at <hi>Windsor, Iune</hi> 28. 1687.
wherein he sayes—Taking into our Royal Consideration,
<q>the sinistrous Interpretations, which either have or may
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41139:83"/>
be made of some Restrictions (mentioned in the last) we
have thought fit by this further to declare, that we will
Protect our Arch-bishops &amp;c. And we do likewise, by
our Soveraign Authority, Prerogative Royal, and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
power,</hi> suspend, stop, &amp; disable, all penal &amp; San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary
Lawes; made against any for Non-conformity
to the Religion established by Law in that our Ancient
Kingdom—to the end, that by the Liberty thereby
granted the peace &amp; security of our Government in the
practice thereof may not be endangered, we hereby straitly
charge all our Loving subjects, that as we do give them
leave to meet &amp; serve God after their oun way, in private
Houses, Chappels, or Places purposely hired or built
for that use, so that they take care that nothing be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or taught, which may any way tend to alienate the
hearts of our People from us &amp; our Government, and
that their Meetings be peaceably &amp; publickly held, and
all persons freely admitted to them, and that they do
signify &amp; make known to some one or more of the next
Privie Councellors, Sheriffs, Stewards, Bailiffs, Justices
of the Peace, or Magistrats of Burgh Royal, what place
or places they set a part for these uses, with the names of
the Preachers—provided alwayes that the Meetings
be in houses, and not in the open fields; for which now
after this our Royal grace &amp; favour (which surpasses the
hopes, &amp; equalls the very wishes of the most zealously
concerned) there is not the least shadow of execuse left:
Which Meetings in the fields we do hereby strictly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite
&amp; forbid, against all which we do leave our Lawes
&amp; Acts of Parliament in full force &amp; vigour, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the premises; and do further command all our
Judges, Magistrats, &amp; Officers of forces, to prosecute
such as shall be guilty of the said field Conventicles with
the utmost rigour; for we are confident, none will after
these Liberties &amp; freedoms, given to all without reserve
to serve God in their oun way, presume to meet in these
Assemblies, except such as make a pretence of Religion
to cover their treasonable designs against our Royal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
&amp; the peace of our Government</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:41139:84"/>
This is the Royal Charter for security of the Protestant
Religion (intended to secure it so, that it shall not go much
abroad again) in Lieu of all the Lawes, Constitutions,
Oaths, &amp; Covenants wherewith it was formerly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This is the only patent which the Royal Dâties, the
<hi>Moderate Presbyterians,</hi> have now received to ensure their
enjoyment of it <hi>durante beneplacito,</hi> during his pleasure whose
Faith is as <hi>absolute</hi> over all ties of promises, as his power
from whence it flowes is over all Lawes; whose chiefest
principle of Conscience is that <hi>no Faith is to be kept to Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
Here is the Liberty which is said to <hi>surpass the hopes and
equal the wishes of the most zealously concerned;</hi> holding true
indeed of too many, whose hopes &amp; wishes &amp; zeal are
terminate upon peace rather than Truth, ease rather than
duty and their own things rather than the things of Christ;
But as for the poor wild <hi>Wanderers,</hi> it some way answers
their <hi>fears</hi> and corrosponds with their <hi>jealousies,</hi> who put
the same interpretation upon it as on all the former <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
Indemnities</hi> &amp; <hi>Tolerations,</hi> proceeding from the same
fountain &amp; designed for the same sinistrous ends with this,
which they look upon as more openly &amp; obviously Anti-christian:
and therefore, while others are rejoicing under
the bramble-shadow of it, they think it a cause of weeping
&amp; matter of mourning, not because they do not share of
the benefit of it, but because they are afraid to share of the
Curse of it. For which cause, thô a freedom be pretended
to be given, <hi>to all without reserve to serve God in their own way,</hi>
they think it necessary to reserve to themselves the Liberty
wherewith Christ hath made them free, and to serve Him
in His Way thô interdicted by men, and to take none from
Antichrist restricted with his reserves; And do look upon
it as a Seasonable Testimony for the Cause of Christ, and
the Interest of the Protestant Religion, and the Lawes &amp;
Liberties of the Country, all overturned &amp; subverted by
this Toleration, to keep their Meetings as in former times,
in the open fields whither their Tyranny hath driven them.
And let them call these Meetings <hi>covered &amp; treasonable designs
against the Government on pretence of Religion,</hi> I trust it shall be
made evident in the Conviction of all that know Religion,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41139:84"/>
that their designs are to preserve it, in opposition to the
Tyranny that goes about all these wayes to suppress it.
Though I must suspend the Reasons of their keeping their
Meetings in the fields, till I come to discuss that Case in its
oun place: Here I shall only say, none that is acquainted
with their Circumstances, which are as dangerously stated
as ever, by reason of the Constant Persecution of Cruel
enraged Enemies incessantly pursuing them without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting,
notwithstanding of all this pretence of Clemency
&amp; tenderness to Conscience, but may know they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have safety, secrecy, nor conveniency in houses for
fear of their entrapping enemies, and none will blame them
that after so many discoveries of their truculent treachery
they dare not trust them: And besides, they think it sinful,
scandalous, &amp; inconvenient to seem to homologate this
<hi>Toleration,</hi> the wickedness whereof they are convinced of,
from these Reasons.</p>
               <p>I. Considering the <hi>Granter</hi> in his personal Capacity, as
to his <hi>Morals,</hi> they look upon him as a person with whom
they cannot in Prudence communicate, in any transaction
of that nature. First, because being in his Principles &amp;
practice professedly <hi>treacherous,</hi> yea obliged to be both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
&amp; cruel by that Religion whereunto he is addicted,
he cannot be trusted in the least concerns, let be those of
such momentous consequence as this, without a stupid
abandoning of Conscience, Reason, &amp; Experience. Since
both that known principle, that <hi>no Faith is to be kept to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi>
which is espoused by all Papists, does to them
justify all their lying dissimulations, equivocations, &amp;
treacheries imaginable; and that <hi>Lateran</hi> Canon, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
<hi>Kings to destroy &amp; exstirpate Hereticks under pain of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi>
does oblige him to be cruel; besides what deep
engagments he is known to be under by Oaths &amp; Promises
to the <hi>Pope,</hi> both in his exile, and while a subject, and since
he came to the Croun; which make him to all Considering
persons to be a person of that Character, whose deceitful
dainties are not to be desired, and that when he speaketh
fair is not to be beleeved, for there are seven abominations
in his heart. Of which open &amp; affronted <hi>Lies</hi> we have a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41139:85"/>
sufficient swatch, both in his Proclamation for <hi>Scotland</hi>
and Declaration for <hi>England;</hi> where he speaks of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
resolves of <hi>uniting the hearts of Subjects to God in Religion,
&amp; to their Neighbours in Christian Love, and that it never was
his principle to offer violence to any mans Conscience, or use invinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible
necessity against any man on the account of his persuasion;</hi> and
that their <hi>Property</hi> was never in any case <hi>invaded</hi> since his
coming to the Croun; and that it hath been his constant
sense &amp; opinion, that <hi>Conscience ought not to to be constrained
nor People forced in matters of meer Religion.</hi> To which, his
uninterrupted endeavours to divide us from God and from
on another, that he might the more easily destroy us, and
his constant encroachments upon Lawes, Liberties, &amp;
Properties, and all Interests of men &amp; Christians for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
sake do give the lie manifestly. And it must be great
blindness not to see, and great baseness willingly to wink
at that double faced equivocation, <hi>in matters of meer Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
by which he may elude all these flattering promises of
tenderness, by excepting at the most necessary &amp; indispens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
duties, if either they be such wherein any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
is concerned beside meer Religion, or if their troubles
sustained thereupon be not altogether <hi>invincible necessities.</hi>
Hence the plain falsehood &amp; doubleness of his Assertions
as to what is past, may give ground to conclude his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
perfidie in the promises of what is future. <hi>Next,</hi> it is
known what his Practices &amp; Plots have been for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of all honest &amp; precious Interests; what a deep
hand he had in the burning of <hi>London,</hi> in the <hi>Popish plot</hi>
discovered, <hi>anno</hi> 1678. in the Murder of the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi>
yea in the Parricide committed upon his oun brother. By
all which it appears, nothing is so abominable &amp; barbarous
which he hath not a Conscience that will swallow &amp; digest
without a scruple; and what he hath done of this kind
must be but preparatory to what he intends, as meritorious
to attone for these villanies. And in his esteem, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion
of Papists, nothing is thought more meritorious
than to exstirpate the Protestant Religion, and destroy the
Professors thereof. Therefore being such a person with
whom in Reason no honest man could transact, for a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41139:85"/>
tenure of the least piece of Land or house or any holding
whatsoever, they dare not accept of his security or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
for so great an Interest, as the freedom &amp; exercise
of their Religion under the shadow of such a bramble. If
it was the <hi>Shechemites</hi> sin &amp; shame to strengthen a naughty
<hi>Abimelech,</hi> and strengthen themselves under the shadow
of his protection, much more must it be to take protection
for Religion as wel as peace, from such a Monster of
crueltie &amp; treacherie. This were against their Testimony,
and contrary to the Laudable Constitutions of the Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to take no Protections from Malignant Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as was shewed above in <hi>Montroses</hi> case. See Pag. 82.
above.</p>
               <p>II. Considering his <hi>Religion</hi> more particularly, they
judge it unlawful so to bargain with him as this Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
would import. It is known he is not only a <hi>Papist,</hi>
an <hi>Apostate</hi> Papist, and an <hi>Excommunicate</hi> Papist (as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
above) but a fiery <hi>Bigot</hi> in the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, and
zealous sworn votarie &amp; vassal of Antichrist: who, as the
Letter of the <hi>Iesuite</hi> from <hi>Liege</hi> lately published in print
tells us, is resolved <hi>either to convert England to Poperie or die a
Martyr,</hi> and again that he stiles himself <hi>a son of the Societie of
Iesuites, and will account every injury done to them to be a wrong
done against himself;</hi> being known to be under the conduct
&amp; guidance of that furious Order, yea and enrolled as a
member of that Society. Which makes it the less to be
wondered, that he should require <hi>absolute obedience without
reserve,</hi> seeing he himself yeelds absolute obedience as wel
as <hi>implicite faith,</hi> without reserve, to the Jesuites. Such a
Bigot was <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (as also his great Grandame of
<hi>Scotland</hi> if she had got her will) And his Bigotrie will make
him emulous of her Crueltie, as counting it a diminution
of his glory, for such a Champion as he under Antichrists
banner to come short of a womans enterprizes: Nor would
the late King have been so posted off the stage, if his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
were not to act more vigorously than he in this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
design, to which this Toleration is subservient. He
is then a Servant of Antichrist, and as such under the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators
Malediction; yea in this respect is heir to his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41139:86"/>
imprecation, who <hi>wished the Curse of God to fall upon
such of his Posterity as should at any time turn Papists.</hi> How
then can the Followers of the Lamb strike hands, be at
peace, associate, confederate, or bargain with such a
declared Enemy to Christ? Certainly the Scripture-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of making no Covenant or League, interdicting
entering into any affinity with the People of these abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and forbidding saying a Confederacy with them,
do lay awful bonds on the Faithful to stand aloof from such.
The People might have had Liberty of Conscience under
the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Protection, when they were saying a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy
with him, but in so doing they forefaulted the benefit
of the Lord being a <hi>Sanctuary to them.</hi> To bargain therefore
with such an one for a Toleration of Religion, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Scriptures, contrary to the Covenants and
Principles of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> against Associations
&amp; Confederacies with such Enemies. See <hi>Gillesp. Useful
Case of Conscience concerning Assoc.</hi> hinted <hi>Pag.</hi> 83. and more
<hi>Head. 3. Arg.</hi> 1. But to accept of this Liberty as now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
were a bargaining; for where there is a Giving &amp;
Receiving upon certain Conditions, where there are
Demands &amp; Complyance; Commands &amp; Obedience,
Promises &amp; Relyance, Offers upon termes &amp; Acquiescence
in these termes, what is there wanting to a bargain, but
the meer formality of Subscriptions? At least it cannot be
denied, but the <hi>Addressers</hi> have bargained for it, and in
the name of all the Accepters, which must stand as their
deed also; if they do not evidence their resentment of such
Presumption, which I do not see how they can, if they
abide under the shadow thereof the same way as they do.
I grant Liberty is very desirable, and may be taken &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven
from Enemies of Religion: And so do the <hi>Wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
now take it &amp; improve it to the best advantage, without
receiving it by acquiescing in any termes. But such a Liberty
as this was never offered without a destructive design,
nor ever received without a destructive effect. It is one of
the filthie flatteries found in the <hi>English Addresses,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that from <hi>Totness,</hi> that the present Indulger is like
another <hi>Cyrus</hi> who proclaimed Liberty to the People of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41139:86"/>
God <hi>Ezra.</hi> 1. But who sees not the disparity in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect?
<hi>Cyrus</hi> at his very first entry into the Government
did lay out himself for the Churches good; This man who
speaks now so fair, his first work was to break our head
and next to put on our hood, first to assert &amp; corroberate
his prerogative, and then by virtue of that to dispense
with all Penal Lawes: It was foretold that <hi>Cyrus</hi> should
deliver the Church at that time; But was it ever promised
that the Church should get Liberty to advance Antichrist?
or that Antichrist, or one of his Limbs, should be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the Churches deliverance, while such? The
Lord stirred up the Spirit of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> Can it be said without
blasphemy that the Lord stirred up this man, to contrive
the introduction of Poperie by this Gate &amp; Gap, except in
a penal sense for judgment? <hi>Cyrus</hi> had a Charge to build
the Lord a House, but this is not a Charge but a Grant or
Licence, not from nor according to Gods Authority but
mans, not to build Christ a House, but a <hi>Babel</hi> for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ;
and all this Liberty is but contrived as <hi>scaffolding</hi> for
that Edifice, which when it is advanced then the scaffold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
must be removed.</p>
               <p>3. Considering him in his <hi>Relation</hi> as a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> it
were contrary to their Testimony so often renewed &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
&amp; confirmed with so many reasons, and sealed by
so much blood, bonds, banishment, &amp; other sufferings,
to oune or acknowledge his Authority which is meer
Usurpation &amp; Tyrannie; in that by the Lawes of the Land
he is incapable of Government, and that he hath neither
given nor can give, without an hypocritical &amp; damning
cheat, the Oath &amp; Security indispensibly required of him
before &amp; at his entry to the Government. Yet this Liberty
cannot be Complyed with, without recognoscing his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that he arrogates in giving it: Seeing he tenders it
<hi>to all his good Subjects,</hi> and gives it by his <hi>Soveraign Authority,</hi>
and <hi>to the end that by the Liberty thereby granted the peace &amp; secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Government in the practice thereof may not be indangered;</hi>
And in the Declaration to <hi>England,</hi> it is offered as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<hi>to establish his Government on sach a foundation, as may
make his Subjects happy, and unite them to him by inclination as
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41139:87"/>
well as duty;</hi> to which indeed the Acceptance thereof hath
a very apt subserviency: seeing it implies, not only ouning
of the Government out of Duty, but an union &amp; joyning
with it and him by inclination, which is a cordial Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy
with Gods enemie, and a cooperating to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of his Tyrannie; that the peace &amp; security thereof
may not be endangered. And in his former Proclamation,
he gives them the same security for their Rights &amp; Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which he gives for Religion; And in the <hi>English</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
<hi>addeth that to the perfect enjoyment of their Propertie,
which was never invaded &amp;c.</hi> Which to accept, were not
only to take the security of a manifest lie, but to prefer the
word of a man that cannot, must not, will not keep it
(without going cross to his principles) to the Security of
Right &amp; Law which is hereby infringed, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
not only the Liberty of Religion, but the Right of
Property to his grant: which when ever it is removed,
there must remain no more Charter for it, but stupid slavery
entailed upon Posterity, and pure &amp; perfect Tyranny trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them. The sin &amp; absurdity where of may be seen
demonstrated <hi>Head.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>4, Considering the <hi>Fountain</hi> whence it flowes, they
cannot defile themselves with it. In the <hi>English</hi> Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it flowes from the <hi>Royal will &amp; pleasur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> which speaks
a Domination Despotical &amp; Arbitrary enough, but more
gently expressed than in the <hi>Scots</hi> Proclamation; where it
is refounded on <hi>Soveraign Authority, Prerogative Royal, and
Absolute Power:</hi> Proclaiming by sound of Trumpet à
Power Paramount to all Law, Reason, &amp; Religion, and
outvying the hight of <hi>Ottoman</hi> Tyranny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A Power which
all are to <hi>obey without res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rve:</hi> A power to Tolerate or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the Protestant Religion, according to his Royal will
or pleasure: An <hi>Absolute power</hi> which can not be limited
by Lawes, nor most Sacred Obligations, but only regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by the Royal lust; whereby indeed he may suffer the
Protestant Religion, but only precariously so long as he
pleases, and until his Royal pleasure shall be to command
the establishment of <hi>Poperie,</hi> which then must be complyed
with without control. Whereby all the tenure that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41139:87"/>
have for their Religion, is only the Arbitrary word
of an absolute Monarch, whose principles oblige him to
break it, and his ambition to disdain to be a slave to it.
Now the Acceptance of this Grant, would imply the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance
of this power that the Granter claims in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; which utterly disolves all Government, and all
security for Religion &amp; Liberty, and all the precious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of men &amp; Christians: Which to acknowledge, were
contrare to Scripture, contrary to Reason, and contrary
to the Principles of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> particularly the
Declaration of the <hi>Gen. Ass. Iulij</hi> 27. 1649. See pag. 89.
&amp;c. and contrary to the Covenant.</p>
               <p>5. Considering the <hi>Channel</hi> in which it is conveyed, they
cannot Comply with it. Because it comes through such a
Conveyance, as <hi>suspends, stops,</hi> &amp; <hi>disables,</hi> all penal
Lawes against <hi>Papists,</hi> and thereby everts all the Securities
&amp; legal Bulwarks that <hi>Protestants</hi> can have for the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Religion; yea in effect leaves no Lawes in
force against any that shall attempt the utter subversion of
it, but rati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies &amp; leaves in ful vigour all wicked Lawes &amp;
Acts of Parliament, against such as would most avowedly
assert it; and stops &amp; disables none of the most cruel &amp;
bloody Lawes against Protestants: for the most cruel are
such as have been made against Field-Meetings, which are
hereby left in ful force &amp; vigour. Hence as he hath formally
by <hi>absolute power</hi> suspended all Lawes made for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of our Religion, so he may when he will dispense
with all the Lawes made for its establishment; and those
who approve the one by such an Acceptance, cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow
the other, but must recognosce a power in the King
to subvert all Lawes, Rights, &amp; Liberties, which is
contrare to Reason as wel as Religion, and a clear breach
of the National &amp; Solemn League &amp; Covenants.</p>
               <p>6. Considering the <hi>Ends</hi> of its Contrivance, they dare
not have any accession to accomplish such wicked Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to which this Acceptance would be so natively sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient.
The expressed ends of this Grant are, to <hi>unite the
hearts of his Subjects to him in Loyaltie and to their Neighbours in
love,</hi> as in the former Proclamation; And that <hi>by the Liberty
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41139:88"/>
granted the peace &amp; security of his Government in the practice
thereof may not be endangered,</hi> as in the latter Proclamation;
And to <hi>unite the Subjects to him by inclination as well as duty</hi>
which he thinks <hi>can be done by no means so effectually as by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the free exercise of Religion,</hi> as in the <hi>English</hi> Declaration.
Whence we may gather not obscurely, what is the proper
tendency of it, both as to the work &amp; worker, to wit, to
incline &amp; induce us by flatterie to a lawless <hi>Loyaltie,</hi> and a
stupid contented slavery when he cannot compel us by
force, and make us actively cooperate in setting &amp; settling
his Tyranny, in the peaceable possession of all his Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
Robberies, &amp; Encroachments upon our Religion,
Lawes, &amp; Liberties, and to incorporate us with <hi>Babylon,</hi>
for wbo are the Neighbours he would have us unite with
in love, but the Papists? against whom all the Lovers of
Christ must profess themselves irreconcileable Enemies.
The <hi>English</hi> Declaration does further discover the design
of this device, in one expression which will most easily be
obtained to be beleeved of any in it, <hi>viz.</hi> that he <hi>heartily wishes
that all the People of these Dominions were members of the Catholick
Church:</hi> which clearly insinuates, that hereby he would
entyce them to commit fornication with that Mother
of harlots; which entycing to Idolatrie (if we consult the
Scripture) should meet with another sort of entertainment
than such a kind &amp; thankful Acceptance, which is not an
opposing of such a wicked wish, but an encouraging &amp;
corroberating of it. And further he sayes, that all the former
tract of Persecutions <hi>never obtained the end for which it was
employed; For after all the frequent &amp; pressing endeavours that
were used, to reduce this Kingdom to an exact con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ormity in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
it is visible the success has not answered the design, and that
the difficultie is invincible.</hi> Wherein we may note his extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
acknowledgment, that all former endeavours to destroy
the Work of God have been successless, which induces
him to try another method, to which this Acceptance is
very subservient, to wit, to destroy us and our Religion
by flatteries, and by peace to overturn Truth, and by the
subversion of Lawes to open a door to let in Poperie and
all abominations. But what is more obscurely expressed in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41139:88"/>
his words, is more visibly obvious in his works, to all that
will not willingly wink at them; discovering clearly the
end of this Liberty is not for the Glory of God, nor the
Advantage of Truth, or the Churches Edification, nor
intended as a benefit to <hi>Protestants;</hi> but for a pernicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
by gratifying a few of them in a pretended favour to
rob all of them of their chiefest Interests, Religion, Lawes,
Rights, &amp; Liberties, which he could not otherwise ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuate
but by this arbitrary way; for if he could have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
his designs by Law: he would never have talked of
Lenity or Liberty, but having no legal ends he behoved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
compass them by illegal means. They must then be very
blind who do not see, his drift is, first to get in all <hi>Popish</hi>
Officers in places of Publick Trust, by taking off the Penal
Lawes disabling them for the same; Then to advance his
Absoluteness over all Lawes, in a way which will be best
acknowledged &amp; acquiesced in by People, till he be so
strengthened in it that he fears no control; And then to
undermine &amp; overturn the Protestant Religion, &amp; establish
Poperie &amp; Idolatrie: which he is concerned the more
violently to pursue, because he is now growing old, and
therefore must make hast, lest he leave the Papists in a
worse condition than he found them: which to be sure
the <hi>Papists</hi> are aware of, and their conscious fears of the
Nations resentments of their Villanies will prompt them,
as long as they have such a Patron, to all vigilance &amp; vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in playing their game: And withall, hereby he may
intend to capacitate himself for subduing the <hi>Dutch,</hi> against
whom he hath given many indications of a hostile mind of
old &amp; of late; not only in hiring two Rascals to burn the
<hi>Amsterdam-fleet</hi> heretofore, but in stirring up &amp; protecting
the <hi>Algerine Pyrats</hi> against them; So universal a Protector
is he become of late, that <hi>Papists</hi> &amp; <hi>Protesiants, Turks</hi> &amp;
<hi>Iewes</hi> are shrouded under the shadow of his Patrociny,
but with a design to destroy the best, when his time comes.
Which cursed designs cannot be counteracted, but very
much strengthened by this Acceptance.</p>
               <p>7. Considering the <hi>Effects</hi> already produced thereby,
they cannot but abhor it. Seeing the eyes of all that are
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41139:89"/>
tender may affect their hearts, observing how the <hi>Papists</hi>
are hereby encouraged &amp; encreased in numbers, the whole
Nation overflow'd wlth their hellish <hi>Locusts,</hi> and all Places
filled with Priests &amp; <hi>Iesuites,</hi> yea the executive power of
the Government put into the hands of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> and
on the other hand how the People are endangered with
their abounding &amp; prevailing Errors (to which the Lord may
&amp; will give up those that have not received the love of the
Truth) Truth is sallen in the streets &amp; equity cannot enter,
a Testimony against Antichrist is abandoned &amp; laid aside
as unseasonable, the edge of zeal for the Interest of Christ is
blunted and its fervor extinginshed, they that should stand
in the Gap and upon the watch Tower are laid aside from
all opposition to the invasions of the Enemy, and lulled
asleep by this bewitching Charm &amp; intoxicating <hi>Opium,</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
&amp; Professors are generally settling on their lees and
languishing in a fatal security, Defection is carried on, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
promoted, and Destruction is imminent. Is it not
then both a part of the Witness of the Faithful, and of
their wisdom to stand aloof from such a Plague, that hath
such destructive effects?</p>
               <p>8. Considering the <hi>Nature</hi> &amp; <hi>Name</hi> of this pretended Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
they cannot but disdain it as most dishonourable to
the Cause of Christ. It is indeed the honour of Kings and
happiness of People; to have true humane &amp; Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
established in the Common wealth, that is, Liberty
of Persons from slaverie; Liberty of Priviledges from Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
and Liberty of Conscience from all impositions of
men; Consisting in a freedom from the Doctrines, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
&amp; Commandments of men against or beside the
Word of God, in the free enjoyment of Gospel Ordinanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
in purity &amp; power, and in the free observance &amp; esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of all His Institutions of Doctrine, Worship,
Discipline, &amp; Government, in subordination to the only
Rule of Conscience, the revealed Will of its only Law-giver
Jesus Christ. When this is ratified as a <hi>Right</hi> by the
Sanction of approven Authority, and countenanced &amp;
encouraged <hi>as Religion,</hi> by the Confirmation of Lawes,
approving whatsoever is Commanded by the God of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41139:89"/>
Heaven to be done for the House of the God of Heaven
(which is the full amount of all Magistrats Authority) Then
we are obliged to accept of it with all thankful acceptation.
But such a Liberty, as overturns our Rights, our Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
our Lawes, our Religion, and <hi>Tolerates</hi> it only
under the Notion of a <hi>Crime,</hi> and indemnifies it under the
notion of a <hi>Fault</hi> to be Pardoned, and allowes the exercise
thereof only in <hi>Part</hi> so &amp; so modified, cannot be accepted
by any to whom the reproach thereof is a burden, and to
whom the reproaches of Christ are in esteem, in such a
day when even the hoofs of Christs Interest buried in bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
are to be contended for. Whatever Liberty this may
be to some Consciences, it is none to the tender according
to the Rule of Conscience, It is only a <hi>Toleration</hi> which is
alwayes <hi>of evil:</hi> for that which is good cannot be tolerated
under the notion of good, but countenanced &amp; encouraged
as such. Therefore this reflects upon our Religion, when
a <hi>Toleration</hi> is accepted which implies such a reproach:
And the annexed <hi>Indemnity</hi> &amp; <hi>Pardon</hi> tacitely condemns
the Profession thereof as a <hi>fault</hi> or Crime, which no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
can bear with, or by his acceptance homologate these
reproaches, if he consider the nature of it: And much
more will he be averse from it, if he consider how disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
it is to God (whatever some <hi>Addressers,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
the Presbyterians at <hi>London,</hi> have blasphemously
alledged, that <hi>God is hereby restored to His Empire over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>)
Since the Granter, after he hath robbed the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
of His Supremacy and given it away to Antichrist,
And God of His Supremacy Imperial as Universal King
by a Claim of Absolute Power peculiar to Him, he hath
also robbed Him of His Empire over the Conscience, in
giving every man the Empire over his oun Conscience,
which he reserves a power to retract whem he pleases.</p>
               <p>9. Considering the <hi>Extent</hi> of it, they cannot class them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
amoug the number of them that are <hi>Indulged</hi> thereby.
It takes in not only the <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> &amp; <hi>Bishops,</hi> and the
Prelatical &amp; Malignant Crue, but all <hi>Quakers,</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi>
reaching all Idolatry, Blasphemy, &amp; Heresie, and Truth
also (which could never yet dwell together under one
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41139:90"/>
sconce) Whereby the Professors of Christ come in as Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in the same bargain with Antichrists Vassals; And the
<hi>Lords Ark</hi> hath a place with <hi>Dagon,</hi> and its Priests &amp; Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
consent to it; And the builders of <hi>Babel</hi> &amp; of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
ar made to build together, under the same Protection;
and a sluce is opened to let the enemy come in like a flood,
which to oppose the Accepters cannot stand in the Gap
nor lift up a Standart against them. Liberty indeed should
be Universally extended to all the Lords People, as <hi>Cyrus</hi>
his Proclamation was General, <hi>who is there among yow of all
His People? his God be with him.</hi> But a Toleration of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
Blasphemers, &amp; Hereticks, as <hi>Papists,</hi> &amp;c. is odious
to God, because it is contrary to Scripture, expressly
Commanding <hi>Idolaters to die the death,</hi> and all Seducers &amp;
Entycers to Apostasie from God to be put to death without
pity; and Commending all righteous Magistrats that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
Judgement accordingly, as <hi>Asa, Hezekiah</hi> &amp;c. yea
even Heathen Magistrats that added their Sanction to the
Lawes of God, as <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> is approven for that Statute,
that <hi>whosoever will not do the Law of God and of the King, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should be executed speedily upon him.</hi> And in the New
Testament this was never repealed but confirmed, in that
the sword is given to Magistrats, not in vain, but to be a
terror to, and revengers to <hi>execute wrath upon all that do evil,</hi>
among whom Seducers that are <hi>evil workers</hi> &amp; Idolaters are
chiefly to be ranked, being such as do the worst of evil to
mankind. <hi>Ephesus</hi> is commended because they could not
<hi>bear</hi> them which are evil: and <hi>Thyatira</hi> reproved for <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Iezebel:</hi> by which it appeareth, that our Lord Jesus is no
friend to <hi>Toleration.</hi> It is true this is spoken against Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
but will any think that will be approven in Civil
Powers, which is so hateful in Church Officers? Surely it
will be the duty &amp; honour of these <hi>horns</hi> spoken of Revel.
17. to eat the whores flesh &amp; burn her with fire: And shall
that be restricted only to be done against the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
&amp; not be duty against the lesser Antichrists, the limbs
of the Great one? It is recorded of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, that
among other devices he used, to root out Christianity this
was one, that he gave <hi>Toleration</hi> openly to all the different
Professions that were among Christians, whereof there
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41139:90"/>
were many heretical in those dayes: which is exactly aped
by <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostate now for the same end. It is also
contrare to the <hi>Confession of faith Chap.</hi> 20. § 4. asserting that
<q>for their publishing such opinions, or maintaining of
such practices, as are contrary to the light of Nature, or to
the known Principles of Christianity, whether concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faith Worship, or Conversation, or to the power
of Godliness, or such erroneous opinions or practices,
as either in their oun nature, or in the manner of publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or maintaining them, are destructive to the external
Peace &amp;. Order, which Christ hath established in the
Church; they may lawfully be called to account, and
proceeded against by the Censures of the Church, and by
the power of the Civil Magistrate.</q> And therefore to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of this Toleration is inconsistent with the Principles of
the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the National &amp; Solemn League
&amp; Covenants, &amp; Solemn Acknowledgment of sins &amp; Enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement
to duties, in all which we are bound to <hi>extirpate Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
Prelacie</hi> &amp;c. With the whole tract of Contendings in the
<hi>fifth Period</hi> above related, and particularly by the <hi>Testimony</hi>
of the <hi>Synod of Fife,</hi> and other Brethren in the Ministry,
against <hi>Cromuels</hi> vast <hi>Toleration</hi> &amp; Liberty of Conscience,
mentioned above Pag. 76. for it is plain, if it be not to be
suffered, then it is not to be accepted.</p>
               <p>10. Considering the <hi>Termes</hi> wherein it is offered, they
cannot make such a shameful bargain. In the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
it is granted expressly <hi>under several Conditions,
Restrictions, &amp; Limitations:</hi> whereof indeed some are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
in the Latter, as the restriction of it to <hi>Moderate
Presbyterians,</hi> which would seem to be taken off by extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>all without reserve to serve, God in their oun may;</hi> but being
evidently exclusive of all that would serve God in Christs
way, and not after the mode prescribed, it is so modified
and restricted that all that will accept of it must be <hi>Moderate
Presbyterians</hi> indeed, which as it is taken in the Court sense
must be an ignominy to all that have zeal against Antichrist.
The Limitation also to private houses and not to out-houses,
is further enlarged to <hi>Chappels or places purposely
hired</hi> but still it is stinted to these, which they must bargain
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41139:91"/>
for with <hi>Councellors, Shiriffs &amp;c.</hi> So that none of these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions
&amp; Limitations are altogether removed, but the
Condition of taking the Oath only: yet it is very near to
an equivalency homologated, by the Accepters acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
in the Granter a Prerogative &amp; <hi>Absolute Power</hi> over
all Lawes, which is confirmed &amp; maintained by their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.
As for the rest that are not so much as said to
be removed, they must be interpreted to remain, as the
<hi>termes,</hi> conditions, restrictions, &amp; limitations, upon
which they are to enjoy the benefite of this Toleration.
And what he sayes, that <hi>he thought fit by this Proclamation
further to declare,</hi> does confirme it, that there are <hi>further</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
but no taking off of former restrictions. Hence
it is yet clogged with such provisions &amp; restrictions, as must
make it very nauseous to all truly tender (1) The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction
as to the <hi>Persons</hi> still remains, that only <hi>Moderate</hi>
Presbyterians, and <hi>such as are willing to accept of this Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
allanerly, and none other,</hi> and such only whose names
must be <hi>signified to these Sheriffs, Stewards, Bailifs</hi> &amp;c. are
to have the benefit of this Indulgence: wherey all the zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
&amp; faithful Presbyterians are excluded, (for these they
will not call them <hi>Moderate</hi>) and all that would improve it
without a formal Acceptance, and all who for their form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
diligence in duty are under the lash of their wicked Law,
and dare not give up their names to those who are seeking
their lives, must be deprived of it. (2) It is restricted to
certain <hi>Places</hi> still, which must be made <hi>known to some one
or more of the next privie Councellors</hi> &amp; whereby they are tied
to a dependence on their warrand, and must have their
lease &amp; licence for Preaching the Word in any place, and
Field-Meetings are severely interdicted, though signally
countenanced of the Lord, whereby the Word of the
Lord is bound &amp; bounded; and by this Acceptance their
bloody Lawes against Preaching in the open fields, where
People can have freest access with conveniency &amp; safety,
are justified. (3) The <hi>manner</hi> of Meeting is restricted,
which must be in such a way as the <hi>peace &amp; security of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the practice thereof may not be endangered,</hi> and again
<hi>that</hi> their Meetings be <hi>peaceably held,</hi> which is all one upon
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41139:91"/>
the matter with the <hi>bond of peace,</hi> and <hi>binding to the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour</hi>
so much formerly contended against by Professors,
and is really the same with the Condition of the <hi>Cautionary
Bond</hi> in the Indulgence after <hi>Bothuel,</hi> of which see Pag. 129.
And further they must be <hi>openly &amp; publickly</hi> held, and all
persons freely admitted to them; which is for the inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
trade, exposing to all the inconveniences of <hi>Iesuites,</hi>
and other Spies &amp; <hi>Flies</hi> their delations, in case any thing
be spoken reflecting on the Government, a great tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Ministers. (4) The worst of all is upon ther <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of Preaching. which is so restricted &amp; limited, that
nothing must be <hi>said or done contrare to the well &amp; peace of his
reign, seditious or treasonable;</hi> And in case <hi>any treasonable
speeches be uttered the Law is to take place against the guilty, and
none other present, providing they reveal to any of the Council the
guilt so committed,</hi> as in the former Proclamation: And in
the last it is further declared, that <hi>nothing must be Preached or
taught, which may any way tend to alienate the hearts of the People
from him or his Government.</hi> Here is the price at which they
are to purchase their freedom (a sad bargain to buy Liberty
&amp; sell Truth) which yet hardly can be so exactly paid, but
he may find a pretence for retrenching it when he pleases;
for if a Minister shall Pray for the overturning of a throne
of iniquity, or for confounding all that serve graven Imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and for destruction to the <hi>Pope</hi> and all that give their
power to that beast, there will be something said against
the well of his Government; Or if any shall hear this and
not delate it, then the same pretence is relevant; Or if he
shall Preach against the Kings Religion as <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Babylon,</hi> and discharge his Conscience
&amp; Duty in speaking against the Tyrannie of the times; Or
let him Preach against any publick sin faithfully, a <hi>Popish
Critick</hi> or <hi>Romish Bigot</hi> shall interpret it to be an alienation
of the Peoples hearts from the King &amp; his Government.
But who can be faithful, and Preach in season &amp; out of
season now, but he must think it his duty to endeavour to
alienate the hearts of the People from such an Enemy to
Christ, and his absolute Tyranny, so declaredly stated
against God? What Watchman must not see it his indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41139:92"/>
Duty, to warn all People of his Devilish designs
to destroy the Church &amp; Nation, and Preach so that People
may hate the whore, and this Pimp of hers? Sure if he
Preach the whole Counsel of God, he must Preach against
Poperie &amp; Tyrannie. And if he think this <hi>Indulgence</hi> from
Absolute Prerogative, granted &amp; accepted on these
termes, can supercede him from this faithfulness, then
he is no more the Servant of Christ but a pleaser of men.
Therefore since it is so clogged with so many restrictions,
so inconsistent with duty, so contrary to Scripture, so
clearly violatory of Covenant-Engagements, so cross to
the constant Contendings &amp; Constitutions of this Church,
and Acts of <hi>Ass.</hi> (See <hi>Pag.</hi> 80. &amp;c.) it were a great defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to Accept of it.</p>
               <p>11. Considering the <hi>Scandal</hi> of it, they dare not so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the generation of the Righteous by the Acceptance,
and dishonour God, disgrace the Protestant Profession,
wrong the Interest thereof, and betray their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as thus to comply with the Design of Antichrist, and
partake of this cruel tender mercy of the <hi>beast;</hi> who hath
alwayes mischief in his heart, and intends this as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
for inducing or inforcing all that are hereby lulled
asleep either to take on his <hi>Mark,</hi> or bear the Marks of
his fiery fury afterwards. For hereby forreign Churches
may think, we are in a fair way of reconciliation with
Antichrist, when we so kindly accept his Harbingers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
And it cannot but be very stumbling to see the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whose Testimony used to be terrible
to the <hi>Popish</hi> and renouned through all the <hi>Protestant</hi>
Churches, purchasing a Liberty to themselves at the rate
of burying &amp; betraying the Cause into bondage &amp; restraint,
and thus to be laid by from all active &amp; open opposition to
Antichrists Designs, in such a season. The world will
be tempted to think, they are not governed by Principles
but their oun Interest in this juncture, seeking their oun
things more than the things of Christ; And that it was not
the late Usurpation upon, &amp; overturning of Religion &amp;
Liberty that offended them, so much as the Persecution
they sustained thereby; but if that Arbitrary Power had
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41139:92"/>
been exerted in their favours, tho with the same prejudice
of the Cause of Christ, they would have complyed with it
as they do now. Alas sad &amp; dolorous have been the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
given &amp; taken by &amp; from the Declining Ministers of
<hi>Scotland</hi> heretofore, which have rent &amp; racked the poor
Remnant, and offended many both at home &amp; abroad,
but none so stumbling as this. And therefore the tender
will be shie to medle with it.</p>
               <p>12. Considering the <hi>Addresses</hi> made thereupon, with
such a stain of foulsome &amp; blasphemous flatteries, to the
dishonour of God, the reproach of the Cause, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
of the Church, and detriment of the Nation, and
exposing themselves to the contempt of all, the poor Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
Partie dare not so much as seem to incorporate
with them. I shall set doun the first of their <hi>Addresses,</hi> given
forth in the name of all the Presbyterian Ministers, And
let the Reader judge whether there be not Cause of stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aloof from every appearance of being of their number.
It is dated at <hi>Edinburgh, Iulj</hi> 21. 1687. of this tenor.</p>

               <p>These Gentlemen needed not to have been sollicitous,
that those who avouch an Adherance to the Covenanted
Reformation, and avow an opposition to Antichristian
Usurpers (which they call <hi>promoting Dislayal principles &amp;
practices</hi>) might not be looked upon as of their Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
for all that abide in the principles &amp; Practices of the
Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> (which they have deserted) and that
desire to be found Loyal to Christ, in opposition to His
and the Churches and the Countries Declared Enemy,
would count it a sin &amp; scandal, laying them obnoxious to
the Displeasure of the Holy &amp; Jealous God, who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
this heinous Indignity they have done unto His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
(if they do not Address themselves unto Him for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of the iniquity of this Address, which is the desire of
those whom they disoune that they may find Grace to do
so) and a shameful Reproach, exposing them to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of all of whom they expect Sympathie, to be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
of their Association who have thus betrayed the
Cause &amp; the Country. These mutual Complements (so
like the Caresses of the <hi>Romish</hi> whore whereby she entyces
the Nations to her fornication) between the Professed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Christ and the Vassals of Antichrist, if they be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial;
would seem to import that they are in a fair way of
compounding their differences and to accommodate their
oppositions at length; which yet I hope will be irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leably
maintained &amp; kept up by all true Presbyterians, in
whose name they have the impudence to give out their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress:
But if they be only Adulatory &amp; flattering Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
importing only a Conjunction of tails like <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
foxes</hi>) with a Disjunction of heads and hearts, tending
towards distinct &amp; opposite Interests; then, as they would
suite far better the Dissmulations of Politicians, than the
Simplicity of Gospel-Ministers, and do put upon them the
brand of being men-pleasers rather than Servants of Christ,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41139:94"/>
so for their dissemblings with Dissemblers, who know
their Complements to be and take them for such, they
may look to be paid home in good measure, heaped up &amp;
running over, when such <hi>methods shall be laid doun as shall not
be in the power of any to alter,</hi> when such designs shall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by this Liberty and these Addresses, that the after
bought wit of the Addressers shall not be able to disappoint.
However the <hi>Address</hi> it self is of such a dress, as makes
the thing addressed for to be odious, and the Addressers to
forefault the respect, &amp; merit the indignation of all that are
friends to the <hi>Protestant</hi> &amp; <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Cause, as may appear
from these obvious Reflections. 1. It was needful indeed
they should have assumed the <hi>name of Presbyterians</hi> (though
it might have been more tolerable to let them pass under
that name, if they had not presumed to give forth their
flatteries in the name of all of that Persuasion, and to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it was at their desire; which is either an illuding
equivocation, or a great untruth, for though it might be
the desire of the men of their oun persuasion, which is a
newly start up opinion that Interest hath led them to espouse,
yet nothing could be more cross to the real desires of
<hi>true Presbyterians,</hi> that prefer the Truth of the Cause to the
external peace of the Professors thereof) and call it <hi>the
humble Address of Presbyterian Ministers:</hi> for otherwise it
could never have been known to come from men of the
Presbyterian persuasion; seeing the Contents of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
are so clearly contrary to their known Principles. It
is contrary to Presbyterian Principles, to Congratulate an
Antichristian Usurper for undermining Religion, and
overturning Lawes &amp; Liberties. It is contrary to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Principles, to justify the abrogation of the <hi>National
Covenant,</hi> in giving thanks for a Liberty whereby all the
Lawes are called &amp; disabled therein confirmed. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
to Presbyterian Principles, to thank the King for
opening a door to bring in <hi>Poperie,</hi> which they are engaged
to exstirpate in the Solemn League &amp; Covenant. It is
contrary to Presbyterian Principles to allow or accept of
such a vast <hi>Toleration</hi> for Idolaters &amp; Hereticks, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
above from all their Contendings against it, which is
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41139:94"/>
also contrary to the <hi>Confession of faith,</hi> generally ouned by
Presbyterians, as may be seen in the place forecited <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.
<hi>Par.</hi> 4. It is contrary to Presbyterian Principles to consent
to any Restrictions, Limitations, &amp; Conditions, binding
them up in the exercise of the Ministerial function, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
this Liberty is loaded &amp; clogged; whereby indeed
they have the Liberty of the <hi>Publick &amp; peaceable exercise</hi> of it,
without any hazard of present Persecution, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great hazard of sin, and incurring the guilt of the blood
of Souls, for not declaring the whole Counsel of God,
which Addressers cannot declare, if they <hi>Preserve an intire
Loyaltie in their Doctrine,</hi> as here they promise. 2. There
is nothing here sounds like the <hi>old Presbyterian</hi> strain; neither
was there ever an Address of this stile seen before from
Presbyterian hands. It would have looked far more Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
like, instead of this Address, to have sent a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi>
against the now openly designed introduction of
Poperie, and subversion of all Lawes &amp; Liberties which
they are Covenanted to maintain, or at least to have given
an Address in the usual Language of Presbyterians, who
used alwayes to speak of the <hi>Covenants,</hi> and Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
But here never a word of these, but of <hi>Loyaltie</hi>
to his <hi>excellent,</hi> to <hi>his Gracious,</hi> and to <hi>his Sacred Majestie,</hi>
of <hi>Loyaltie</hi> not to be questioned, an Entire <hi>Loyaltie in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
a resolved <hi>Loyaltie</hi> in <hi>Practice,</hi> and a servent <hi>Loyaltie</hi> in
Prayers: And all that they are solicitous about, is not lest
the Prerogatives of their Master be encroached upon, and
the Liberties of the Church be supplanted, and Religion
wronged; but lest their <hi>Loyaltie be questioned,</hi> and they be
<hi>otherwise represented:</hi> And all that they beseech for is, not
that the Cause of Christ be not wronged, nor Antichristian
Idolatrie introduced by this Liberty; but that these who
<hi>promove any disloyal Principles &amp; Practices may be looked upon as
none of theirs,</hi> wherein all their encouragment is, that they
<hi>persuade themselves from his Maj. justice &amp; goodness, that he will
not give credite to any other information until he take due cognition
thereof.</hi> Here is a Lawless unrestricted Loyaltie to a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
claiming an <hi>absolute power to be obeyed without reserve,</hi>
not only professed, but solicitously sought to be the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41139:95"/>
of Presbyterians; whereas it is rather the Principle of
Athiestical <hi>Hobbes</hi> exploded with indignation by all rational
men. This is not a Christian Loyaltie, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> profession of
Consciencious Subjection, to a Minister of God for good
who is a terror to evil doers, but a stupid subjection &amp;
absolute Allegiance to a Minister of Antichrist, who gives
Liberty to all <hi>evil men</hi> &amp; seducers. This is not the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Loyaltie to the King, <hi>in the defence of Christ His
Evangel, Liberties of the Country, Ministration of Iustice, &amp;
punishment of iniquity,</hi> according to the National Covenant;
And <hi>in the preservation &amp; defence of the true Religion &amp; Liberties
of the Kingdoms,</hi> according to the Solemn League &amp; Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
but an <hi>Erastian</hi> Loyaltie to a Tyrant, in his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
Religion Lawes &amp; Liberties, &amp; protecting &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
all iniquity. This Loyaltie <hi>in Doctrine</hi> will be
found Disloyaltie to Christ, in a sinful &amp; shameful silence
at the wrongs done to Him, and not declaring against the
Invasions of His open Enemies. This Loyaltie in <hi>Practice</hi>
is a plain betraying of Religion &amp; Liberty, in lying by from
all opposition to the open Destroyer of both. And this
Loyaltie in <hi>Prayers,</hi> for <hi>all blessings ever to attend his person &amp;
Government,</hi> will be found neither consonant to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Prayers in reference to Popish Tyrants, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the Zeal of Christians, and the Cries of all the
Elect unto God to whom vengeance belongs, against An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
and all his Supporters, nor any way conforme to
the Saints Prayers in Scripture, nor founded upon any
Scripture promises, to pray for a blessing to a Papists Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie,
which cannot be of Faith and therefore must be
sin. It were much more suitable to pray, that <hi>the God
which hath caused His Name to dwell in</hi> His Church, <hi>may destroy
all Kings that shall put to their hand to alter &amp; destroy the House of
God, Ezrah.</hi> 6. 12. 3. This Address is so stuffed with sneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flatteries, that it would become more Sycophants &amp;
Court-Parasites than Ministers of the Gospel; and were
more suitable to the Popish, Prelatical, &amp; Malignant
faction to congratulate &amp; rejoice in their professed Patroh
&amp; Head, and fill the <hi>Gazetts</hi> with their Adulatory Addresses,
which heretofore used to be deservedly inveighed against
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41139:95"/>
by all Dissenters; than for Presbyterians to take a Copy
from them, and espouse the practice which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
before, and which was never commended in any
good Government, nor never known in these <hi>British</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
before <hi>Oliver's</hi> Usurpation &amp; <hi>Charles</hi> his Tyranny;
flatterie being alwayes counted base among ingenuous
men. But here is a Rhapsodie of flatteries, <hi>from the deep
sense they have of his Maj. gracious &amp; surprising favour—finding
themselves bound in duty to offer their most humble &amp; hearty thanks,
to his Sacred Maj. the favour bestowed being to them—valuable
above all earthly comforts.</hi> One would think this behoved to be
a very great favour, from a very great friend, for very
gracious ends: But what is it? <hi>In not only puting a stop to
their long sad sufferings;</hi> which were some ground indeed if
the way were honest: but this <hi>not only</hi> supposes an <hi>also;</hi>
what is that? but also <hi>granting us the Liberty</hi>—which is
either a needless Tautology (for if all Sufferings were stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
then Liberty must needs follow) or it must respect
the qualifications of the Liberty; flowing from such a
Fountain, <hi>absolute power;</hi> through such a Conveyance, the
<hi>stoping all penal Lawes</hi> against Papists; in such a Forme as a
<hi>Toleration;</hi> for such Ends, as overturning the Reformation
&amp; introducing Poperie. This is the favour for which they
offer most humble &amp; hearty thanks, more valuable to them
than all earthly comforts; thô it be manifestly intended to
deprive the Lords People, at the long run, of the Heavenly
Comforts of the Preached Gospel. Sure, if they thank
him for the Liberty, they must thank him for the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
whereby he grants it, and justify all his Claim
there to <hi>Absoluteness,</hi> being that upon which it is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
and from which it emergeth, And so become a
listed faction to abett &amp; oune him in all his attemptings,
engaged now to demean themselves as that he may find
cause rather to enlarge than to diminish his favours, which
can be no other way but in assisting him to destroy Religion
&amp; Liberty, at least in suffering him to do what he will
without control. O what an indeleble reproach is this for
Ministers, who pretend to be set for the defence of the
Gospel, thus to be found betraying Religion, through
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41139:96"/>
justifying &amp; magnifying a Tyrant, for his suspension of so
many Lawes whereby is was established &amp; supported. 4. It
were more tolerable if they went no further than flatteries:
but I fear they come near the border of <hi>Blasphemie,</hi> when
they say, that the <hi>Great God hath put this in his Royal heart:</hi>
which can bear no other Construction but this, that the
holy Lord hath put it in his heart to assume to himself a
blasphemous &amp; absolute power, whereby he stops &amp; sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
all Penal Lawes against Idolaters, and gives a <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
for all Errors: Or if it be capable of any other sense,
it must be like that as the Lord is said to have moved <hi>David</hi>
to number the People, or that <hi>Rev. 17. 17. God hath put it
in their hearts to fulfill His Will, and to aggree aud give their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
unto the Beast.</hi> But to bless God and thank the Tyrant
for this wicked Project, as deliberate &amp; purposed by men,
I say is near unto Blasphemy. And again where they say,
they are <hi>firmly resolved by the help of God so to demean themselves
as his Maj. may find cause rather to enlarge than to diminish his
favours;</hi> this in effect is as great Blasphemy as if they had
said, they resolved by the help of God to be as unfaithful
Time-serving &amp; Silent Ministers as ever plagued the
Church of God; for no otherwise can they demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so as he may find cause to enlarge his favours towards
them, it being no way supposible that his enlarging his
favours can consist with their faithfulness, but if they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
any measure of zeal against Antichrist, he will
quickly diminish them.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have compendiously deduced the Account
of the Progress, &amp; Prosecution of the Testimony of
this Church to the present State thereof, as it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
&amp; Contended for, by the Reproached Remnant
now only Persecuted: which I hope this pretended Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
shall be so far from obscuring &amp; interrupting,
that it shall contribute further to clear it, and engage
them more to Constancy in it, and induce others also
to Countenance it, when they shall see the sad effects
of this Destructive Snare, which I leave to time to
produce: And hope, that as the former Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Cause will conciliate the Charity of the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41139:96"/>
unbyassed, so an Account of their Sufferings thereupon
will provoke them to Sympathie. To which I now

permit, to be Published to the world, which will
discover strange &amp; unheard of Cruelties: yet in this little
heap of some hints only of the kinds of their Sufferings,
I do not question but it will appear, that the Persecution
of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath been very remarkable, and scarcely out-done
by the most Cruel in any Place or Age, in respect of
injustice, illegality, &amp; inhumanity, though perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
in some other Circumstances. But that none could
be more unjust, illegal, or inhumane, I need not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I cannot better, demonstrate than only to Declare
the matter of fact, as it fell out in the several Steps of the
Last Period.</p>
            <p>1. In the Entry of this fatal Catastrophe, the first of
their Mischievous Machinations was to remove out of the
way all who were eminent Instruments in carrying on the
former Work of God, or might be of influence for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
their Antichristian &amp; Tyrannical designs, both in
the State and in the Church. And accordingly when the
Marque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of <hi>Argyle,</hi> who had a main hand in bringing
home the King, and closing the Second Treaty at <hi>Breda,</hi>
went up to <hi>London</hi> to Congratulate his return from exile,
he was made Prisoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> thereafter sent doun to
<hi>Scotland,</hi> indyted of high Treason, at length beheaded,
and his head placed upon the <hi>Tolbooth</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> (A watch
word of warning to our <hi>Addressers,</hi> who may ere all be
done meet with the same sawce) for no other alledged
Cause, but for his Complyance with the <hi>English</hi> when
they had our Land in subjection; a thing wherein the
Judges that condemned him were <hi>Socii Criminis:</hi> but really
for another provocation that incensed the King against him,
which made him a Tyrant as infamous for villanie as for
violence, to wit, for his reproving the King (when others
declined it) for an Adulterous Rape, which he held for so
piacular a Crime, that he resolved nothing should expiate
it but the blood of this Nobleman. For the same Pretended
Cause was the Lord <hi>Waristoun</hi> afterwards executed to death
at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> after they had missed of their design of taking
him off by Clandestine ways abroad. Then they fall upon
the Ministers: And because <hi>Mr Iames Guthrie</hi> was a man,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41139:97"/>
who had been honoured of God to be zealous &amp; singularly
faithful in carrying on the Work of Reformation, and had
asserted the Kingly Authority of Christ in opposition to
the Erastian Supremacy encroaching thereupon, therefore
he must Live no longer, but is condemned to die, and
most basely handled as if he had been a most Notorious
Thief or Malefactor; he is hanged, &amp; afterward his head
placed upon one of the Ports of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> where it
abideth to this day Preaching not only against the Enemies
Rebellion against God, but against the defection of many
Ministers since, who have Practically denied that Great
Truth for which he Suffered, <hi>viz,</hi> his Testimony against
the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and for declining the Usurped Authority
of him who Arrogated it. At the same time there was a
Proclamation, which they caused to be read at all the
Church-doors, discharging Ministers to speak against them
or their Proceedings, whereby Profane &amp; Malicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were encouraged to witness against their Ministers.
By which means (though many were in no hazard, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it commendable Prudence, commended indeed by the
world, but hateful unfaithfulness before God, to be silent
at such a time) some faithful Ministers giving faithful &amp; free
warning &amp; Protesting against the present Defection, were
condemned of Treason, and banished out of the three
Dominions. Others <hi>Indicta Causa</hi> without access to give in
their defences, were sentenced with banishment, and
could never get an Extract of their sentence: And furder
were compelled to subscribe a bond, under pain of death
to remove out of all the Dominions betuixt &amp; such a day.
This was the lot, and also the blot, of these famous &amp;
faithful Ministers, <hi>Mr Iohn Livingstoun, Mr Ro M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Ward, Mr Io. Broun</hi> &amp;c. who spent the rest of their dayes in
<hi>Holland,</hi> serving their Generation by their excellent Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Then after they had disposed of many other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
whom they thrust out for not keeping the <hi>29th</hi> of
<hi>May,</hi> having now laid by the most Eminent, &amp; whom
they feared most of the Ministrie, they shortly thereafter
outed &amp; violented the rest from the exercise of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie,
and straitened them with strange &amp; severe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41139:98"/>
yea because they would not be out done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
suppressing Religion by any, no not by <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
they proceeded to poyson all the springs &amp; fountains
of Learning; ordaining that none be Masters in Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
except they take the Oath of Supremacy, &amp; oune
the Government of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and none be admitted to teach
in a School without the <hi>Prelats</hi> Licence. These Courses
brought many Ministers &amp; Expectants to great Sufferings.</p>
            <p>2. Hitherto they reached only Noblemen, Gentlemen,
&amp; Ministers, and others whom they thought might stand in
their way: of advancing their Cursed Designs. The next
Drift is, when they had emptied the Churches of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and filled them with the vermine of ignorant &amp; scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
<hi>Curats,</hi> to force the People to Conformity, and to
Disoune &amp; discountenance their oun Ministers; first, by
severe Edicts of exorbitant fining not only the persons
themselves contraveening, but those that had the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
over them, &amp; rigourous execution of these fines,
to the Depopulation of a poor Country, by Military
force. Whereby, where there was but one Church in the
bounds, still enjoying a Minister whom the People could
hear, the profane Souldiers would beset that Church in
time of Worship, and cause all within to pay their fines,
or take the garments from them that could not, and beat
them to the effusion of their blood: And where the Church
was planted with a <hi>Curat,</hi> the Souldiers would come and
call the Names of the Parishoners, and amerciate the
Absents in such fines as they pleased. In other Places they
went to private houses, and by force drove them to
Church, even though sick &amp; unable. But where the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
were numerous, great bands of Legal Robbers
were sent to exact &amp; extort these exorbitant fines, by plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
quartering, beating, wounding, binding men
like beasts, chasing away from houses, and harrassing
whole Countrysides, in a hideous manner. And yet after
all these insolencies, some of the common sort were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to subscribe an acknowledgment, that the Captain
had <hi>used them civilly &amp; discreetly;</hi> though the account of
others of that place manifests the violence to have been so
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41139:98"/>
monstrous, that it justified the greatest barbarity: shewing
their exactions to have been intolerable, both for the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
without all proportion or pity, and for the manner
of it, consuming &amp; wasting poor Peoples provision by
their very dogs, and sparing no more these who conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than others who did not conform at all, and punishing
husbands for their wives, yea doubling &amp; tripling the same
exactions after payment. Next, though at first they did
not imprison any for simple absenting themselves from the
<hi>Curats,</hi> yet they began to fill Prisons with such as at any
time shewed more than ordinary zeal against the <hi>Curats</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion,
and testified their dissatisfaction to his face; for
which, some were imprisoned, scourged, stigmatized, and
thereafter carried to <hi>Barbadoes.</hi> Others, because they
would not give the <hi>Prelats</hi> their Title of <hi>Lords,</hi> when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened
before them were also scourged: And one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
seised for Preaching, and offending the Prelates by
the same fault, was carried first to the <hi>Thieves hole,</hi> laid
in irons in company with a Madman, and then banished to
<hi>Shetland,</hi> the coldest &amp; wildest of all the <hi>Scots</hi> Islands.</p>
            <p>3. But when <hi>fining</hi> would not do, and still the People
were more averse from the <hi>Curats,</hi> by getting some times
occasions of hearing their oun Ministers in private: Hence
were houses forced &amp; searched, many hailed to Prisons,
and several necessitate to escape at windowes with the
hazard of their lives; spies sent unto &amp; set in suspected
places, to seize &amp; fall upon such as they found at such
Meetings, or but suspected to have been there. Whence
it came to pass, that many both men &amp; women, young &amp;
old, have been dragged to Prisons, &amp; there closs keeped
as Malefactors, besides several other outragious &amp; illegal
Acts of violence &amp; oppression committed against them,
contrare to all Law, Equity, &amp; Conscience.</p>
            <p>4. After <hi>Pentland</hi> defeat, they ruled by rage more than
either Law or Reason. There 40. Prisoners who were
taken upon quarter, and solemn Parol to have their life
spared, yet treacherously &amp; bloodily were all hanged (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
5. that were reprieved) who had much of the Lords
presence at their deaths, and assurance of His love, strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41139:99"/>
them to seal a Noble Testimony. One of them a
much honoured young Minister, only for having a sword
about him though not present at the fight, did first most pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
endure the cruel Torture of the <hi>Boots</hi> (a Cruel En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
of Iron, whereby with wedges the Leg is tortured
until the marrow come out of the bone) and afterwards
death, with great Courage &amp; Constancy. Upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
at their execution, they then began that barbarity
never practised in <hi>Scotland</hi> before, but frequently &amp; al most
alwayes at all the executions since, to beat Drums that
they might not be heard. After this Conflict, many were
forefaulted of their Estates, and intercommuned, with
inhibition to all to reset, conceal, or correspond with
any that had escaped, under the pain of being accounted
guilty of the same Rebellion, as they called it. Souldiers
are permitted to take free quarter in the Country, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
to all the abuses that either Rapine or Cruelty may
suggest; to examine men by tortures, threatnening to kill
or rost alive, all that would not delate all they knew was
accessory to that Rising; To strip them who did so much
as resett the fugitives, &amp; thrust them into Prisons in cold,
hunger &amp; nakedness, and croud them so with numbers,
that they could scarce stand together, having the miseries of
their oun excrements superadded; yea to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rther without
process such as would not, nay could not, discover those
persecuted People. But not only time but heart &amp; tongue
would fail, to relate all the Violences &amp; Insolencies, the

               </gap>ings of mens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persons,
violent breaking of their houses both by day &amp;
night, beatings of Wives &amp; Children, ravishings of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
forcings of them by <hi>fire Matches</hi> &amp; other tortures, to
discover their husbands &amp; nearest relations, although not
within the compass of their knowledge, and driving away
all their goods that can be carried away, without respect
to guilt or innocency, and all the Cruelties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
without a check by these Ruffians at that time.</p>
            <p>II. After all these tender Mercies &amp; Clemencies or
Cruelties, which his Gracious Maj. was pleased to confer
or commit upon these poor Contenders for Religion &amp; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41139:99"/>
he and his Cabal the <hi>Council,</hi> thought it not enough
to suppress them with Oppressions and force, distrusting
the Authority of his Law (that he knew the People would
no more observe, than he would observe a promise or
Oath) and diffiding also the Authority of his sword, which
he had above their heads; he proposes termes of bargaining
with them, whereupon he would suffer them to live, and
to which he would have them bound to live according to
his Prescript: Therefore, besides the old Oaths of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi>
&amp; <hi>Supremacy</hi> that were still going among hands, he
caused coyn New Ones to keep the <hi>Peace,</hi> and to live <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,</hi>
meaning to conforme themselves to the Disorders
of the times. Whereby, after he had wrought such destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to their Bodies &amp; Estates, &amp; almost nothing was left
them but a bit of a Conscience, he would rob them of that
too; verifying the Constant Character of the wicked, <hi>They
only consult to cast a man doun from his excellency:</hi> What is a
mans excellency but a good Conscience? But these men,
having feared Consciences of their oun not capable of any
impression, they presume to impose upon all others, and
cannot endure so much as to hear of the Name of <hi>Conscience</hi>
in the Country, except it be when it is baffled in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings
of beastly mouths. As one, that was well acquaint
with he Councils humor in this point, told a Gentleman
that was going before them. To have one of these Oaths
imposed upon him, who was before hand signifying his
Scruples that he could not do such things in Conscience;
<hi>Conscience</hi> (said he) <hi>I beseech yow whatever yow do, speak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Conscience before the Lords, far they cannot abide to hear
that word.</hi> Therefore it is, that since this last Revolution
there have been more Conscience-debauching &amp; ensnaring
Oaths invented &amp; imposed, and some repugnant &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to others, than ever was in any Nation in the
World in so short a time. And hereby they have had wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
success in their designes, involving the generality of the
Land in the sin of Perjurie &amp; false swearing with themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves.
And it hath been observed, that scarcely have they
let on year pass without imposing some <hi>Oaths</hi> or <hi>Bonds</hi> upon
<hi>Presbyterians;</hi> Such alwayes as are unlawful to take, yea
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41139:100"/>
&amp; impossible to keep, sometimes more obviously gross,
some times more seemingly smooth, sometimes tendered
more generally through the Kingdom, sometimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon particular Shires; And these carried on some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by Craft &amp; Cunning, sometimes by Force &amp; Cruelty.
Doubtless it is not the least part of their design, hereby to
make Oaths &amp; Bonds become a trivial &amp; common thing,
&amp; by making all men of as Capacious Consciences as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>2. Further they never ceased to express their fear of
another Rising (their guilty Consciences dictating that they
deserved greater opposition) Hence, to secure themselves
and incapacitate the People from further Attempts of that
nature, they order all Withdrawers from Churches, all
who did not joyne to suppress the Lords People, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
up their Armes betuixt &amp; such a day, and not keep a
horse above such a very mean price, unfit for service.</p>
            <p>3. When force could not do the business then they try
flatteries; and hence Contrive that wicked <hi>Indulgence</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
&amp; distroy the Ministers that remained, and to suppress
Meetings. But when this bait so well busked could not
catch all, but still there were Meetings for administring
the Ordinances; their flatterie turns to fury, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of that <hi>Indulgence</hi> by some, and despising of it by
others, did both animate &amp; instigate them unto a following
forth of their design, by all the Cruel Acts &amp; bloody exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.
And hereby the residue of the Faithful of the
Land were exposed unto their rage, while the Indulged
became Interpretatively guilt of, &amp; accessorie to all the
Cruelties used &amp; executed upon Ministers &amp; Professors, for
adhering unto that way. Hence it was common at private
&amp; peaceable Meetings when, without Armes of defence,
they were disturbed by Souldiers, &amp; exposed to all manner
of villanous violence, some being dragged to Prisons,
some banished &amp; sold to <hi>French</hi> Captains to be transported
with Rascals, many intercommuned &amp; driven from their
Dwellings &amp; Relations, Great summes of money were
proferred to any that would bring in severa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the most
eminent Ministers, either dead or alive; yea several at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41139:100"/>
times were killed, and others cruelly handled: All
which for several years they patiently endured without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence.
But especially, when not only they were driven to
the fields to keep their Meetings in all weathers, Summer
&amp; Winter, but necessitate to meet with Armes, then they
raised more Troups of horse &amp; Dragoons to pursue them
with all rage, as Traitors &amp; Rebels. Hence what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suings,
hornings, huntings, hidings, wanderings through
Mountains &amp; Moors, and all Kinds of Afflictions, the
People of God then met with, because of their following
that necessary &amp; signally blessed Duty; All the Lands In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
know, the Jaylors can witness to this day, and
the barbarous Souldiers, bloody Executioners of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of their enraged Masters, having orders to wound
&amp; kill and apprehend all they could take at these Meetings,
or on the way suspected to be going to or coming from
them, having encouragment to apprehend some Ministers,
and bring them dead or alive, by the promise of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Merks, others valued at one thousand, and several
Professors also with prices put upon their heads. Hence
others that were taken of them were sent into the <hi>Bass,</hi> a
Dry &amp; Cold Rock in the Sea, where they had no fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor any provision but what they had brought many
miles from the Country, and when they got it, it would
not keep unspoiled. And others, both Ministers and
many hundreds of Professors, were outlawed; whereby
all the Subjects were prohibited to reset, supply, intercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
with any of them, or to correspond with them by
word writ, or message, or furnish them with meat, drink,
house, harbour, victual, or any other thing useful under
the highest pains. Hence also Prisons were filled: And
the Wives &amp; Children of the Outed Ministers, that were
come to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for shelter, were commanded to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge,
within a short day prefixed, under the pain of being
forcibly shut up or dragged out. For which and other
such uses, to apprehend &amp; seise on Meetings, a <hi>Major</hi> was
appointed in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> with command over the toun
Guards, and a good Salarie for that end. Then Prisons
being filled, they were emptied to make room for others
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41139:101"/>
in Ships, to be taken away to be sold for Slaves, in one of
which were sent to <hi>Virginia</hi> above 60 men, some Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
who, through the kindness &amp; Sympathie of some
<hi>English</hi> Godly People, were relieved at <hi>London.</hi> A greater
Barbarity not to be fonnd, in the Reigns of <hi>Caligul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> or
<hi>Nero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. But all this is nothing to what followed: when,
thinking these blood-hounds were too favourable, they
brought doun from the Wild <hi>Highlands</hi> a host of <hi>Savages</hi>
upon the western Shires, more terrible than <hi>Turks</hi> or
<hi>Turtars,</hi> men who feared not God nor regarded man; And
being also poor pitiful <hi>Skybalds,</hi> they thought they had come
to a brave world, to waste &amp; destroy a plentiful Country,
which they resolved before they left it to make as bare
as their oun. This hellish Crue was adduced to work a
Reformation, Like the <hi>French Conversions,</hi> to press a <hi>Band</hi>
of <hi>Conformity,</hi> wherein every Subscriber was bound for
himself &amp; all under him, wife, Children, Servants,
Tenants, to frequent their Paroch-Churches, and never
to go to these Meetings, nor reset nor intertain any that
went, but to informe against, pursue, &amp; deliver up all
<hi>vagrant Preachers</hi> as they called them, to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yal &amp; Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Which they prosecuted with that rigor &amp; restless
boundless rage, that the Children then unborn and their
pitiful Mothers do lament the memory, of that day, for the
loss of their fathers &amp; husbands. Many ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ses &amp; families
then were left desolate in a winter flight, many lost their
Cattel &amp; Horses, and some in seeking to recover them
lost their lives, by the Sword of these <hi>Burrio's.</hi> So that it
was too evident, both by what orders was given, the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of prosecuting, and the expressions of some great ones
since, that nothing less than the utter ruin and desolation
of these Shires was consulted and concluded, and that
expedition at that time calculated for that end; for what
else can be imagined could induce to the raising 10, or
11000 barbarous Savages the joyning them to the standing
forces, and with such cruel orders the directing them all
to the West; where there was not one person moving the
finger against them; neither could they pretend any quarrel,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41139:101"/>
If it was not the faithfulness of the People there in their
Covenanted Religion, and their hoplessness of complying
to their Popish and Tyrannical designs, and therefore no
course so feasible as to destroy them; So for dispatching
thereof, order is given forth that whosoever refuseth to
subscribe that Hell-hatched bond, must instantly have 10,
20, 30, 40, moe or fewer according to his condition as he
is poorer or richer, of these new Reformers sent to him,
to ly not only upon free Quarters to eat up and destroy
what they pleased, but also (for the more speedy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition)
ordered to take a six pence for each common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
a day, and the Officers more, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and so to remain till either the bond was subscribed,
or all destroyed; Nor was these Trusties deficient to
further their purposes in prosecuting their orders, Who
coming to their Quarters used ordinarly to produce a Bill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
for near to as many more as came, and for these ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
they must have double money, because their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
was not burthened with their maintenance, and
where that was refused would take the readiest goods, and
if any thing remained not destroyed and plundered at their
removeing, which was not transportible, rather then the
owner should get any good of it, they would in some places
set fire to it, as they did with the Corn-stacks. It would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
several great volumes to record the many instances of
horrid Barbarities, Bloods, and Villanies of that wicked ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
so that what by free Quarterings, Exactions,
Robberies, Thifts, Plunderings and other acts of Violence
&amp; Crueltie, many places was ruined almost to desolation, all
which the faithful choosed rather to suffer, than to sin in
complying: and albeit their oppression was exceeding
lamentable, and their loss great, yet that of the complyers
was greater and sader who lossed a good Conscience in
yielding to them, and compounding with them.</p>
            <p>5 Then the Country behoved to pay the Souldiers for
all this Service, and hire them to do more, by paying the
imposed <hi>Cess;</hi> whereby they were sharpened into a greater
keenness in Cruel executions of their Orders, returning
to those places of the Country whether they had chased the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41139:102"/>
Persecuted People, who still kept their Meetings where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they were, though they could not attend them but
upon the hazard of being killed, either in the place (where
some had their blood mingled with their sacrifice) or flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or be exposed to their dreadful Cruelties more bitter
than death. For then it was counted a greater Crime, and
punished with greater severity, for Persons to hear a
faithful Minister Preach, than to commit Murder, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest,
Adulterie, or to be guiltie of Witchcraft, or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,
or the grossest abominations: for these have past
unpunished, when some for their simple presence at a
Meeting, have been executed unto the death. Then also,
when some were forced to flee into the <hi>English</hi> border for
shelter, there also were Parties ordered to pursue those
poor hunted <hi>Partridges,</hi> who could not find a hole to hide
their head in. There we lost a valiant Champion for Truth,
and truly zealous Contender for the Interest of Christ, that
universally accomplished Gentleman &amp; Christian, <hi>Tho.
Ker of Heyhope,</hi> who was cruelly murthered in a rancounter
with a Party of the <hi>English</hi> side.</p>
            <p>Thereafter followed that Lamentable stroke at <hi>Bothuel,</hi>
where about 300 were killed on the field, and about 10.
or 1100 taken Prisoners, and stript, &amp; brought into <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
in a merciless manner. After which, first two faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
&amp; painful Ministers &amp; Witnesses of Christ, <hi>Mr Iohn
Kid &amp; Mr Iohn King,</hi> received the Croun of Martyrdom,
sealling that Testimony with their blood, and many others
after them for the same Cause. Then the Enemy, after
the manner used before, first to wound our head and then
put on a hood upon it (as they have done alwayes after a
Mischief, and intending a greater) offered their <hi>Bond of
peace,</hi> on termes that clearly condemned the Cause, never
to rise in armes against the King &amp;c. by which bond, many
of the Prisoners, after they had lyen several weeks in a
Church-yard, without the shadow of a house to cover
them night &amp; day, were Liberate: And many of the rest,
by the persuasion of some Ministers, at whose door their
blood lied as well as at the Enemies, took that bond; and
yet were sent away with others that did not take it, in a

debauching Oaths, &amp; Bonds to compear when

called, and to keep the Church, and to refrain from going
to Meetings &amp;c. and by these tentations involved in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyances
and Defections.</p>
            <p>2. To enrich themselves by these means with the spoyl
of the Country did not satisfie these Destroyers; but they
must glut themselves with the blood of the Saints, upon
every pretext that they could catch, under any colour of
Law. As upon the account of <hi>Bothwel</hi> Insurrection, many
were cruelly executed to the death, some Gentlemen, and
some Common Country men, without any Legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
by packing bloody Juries &amp; Assises most partially
for their Murdering ends, besides more than can be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that were kept to perish in their imprisonments. And
not only for being actually in armes, or any overt act of
transgressing their wicked Lawes, but even for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
opinion of things, or because they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
these necessitated Risings in armes to be <hi>Rebellion</hi> and
<hi>a sin against God,</hi> which they were forced to declare by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
menacings of death &amp; torture, they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to death; making their arbitrary Lawes to reach
the heart, thoughts, &amp; inward sentiments of the mind, as
well as outward actions. Whereupon this became a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
question robbing many of their Lives, <hi>Was the rising
at Bothwel-bridge Rebellion and a sin against God?</hi> And this
another, <hi>Was the killing of the Bishop of St Andrewes horrid
Murther?</hi> which if any answered negatively, or did not
answer affirmatively, they were cruelly condemned to
death: for which first five innocent Christians were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
upon the spot, where that Murtherer fell. Tho they
declared, and it was known, they were as free as the
Child unborn, and that some of them had never seen a
Bishop that they knew from another man, and were never
in that place of the Country where he was killed. And
afterwards this was the constant question that all brought
before them were troubled with, which some avouching
to be duty were dismembered alive, their hands struck off,
and then hanged, and their heads cut off when dead.</p>
            <p>3. After <hi>Sanquhair Declaration,</hi> they observed the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
rules more exactly, especially that mentioned above
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41139:104"/>
to load the Opinions as are most obnoxious with all odious
Constructions, and to make it both Criminal to declare
them, and also Criminal to conceal &amp; wave their intrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
questions thereupon. For after <hi>Mr Hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> was killed at
the <hi>Queensferrie,</hi> and <hi>Mr Cameron</hi> with several worthies were
slain at <hi>Airsmoss,</hi> and after <hi>Mr Hackstoun</hi> for declining the
Authority of his Murderers, head and tail, and for being
accessory to executing Judgement upon the Arch-traitor or
Arch-Bishop of St Andrewes (thô he laid not his hands on
him himself, nor was present at the action, but at a distance
when it was done) was tortured alive, with the cuting off
of his hands, and then hanged, and before he was dead
ripped up, his heart taken out, carried about on the point
of a knife and throun into a fire, and afterwards his body
quartered. Then, not only such as were with that litle
handful at <hi>Airsmoss</hi> were cruelly murdered, but others
against whom they could charge no matter of fact, were
questioned <hi>if they ouned the Kings Authority?</hi> which if any
did not Answer affirmatively &amp; positively, he was to look
for nothing but exquisite torments by terrible kinds of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
&amp; death besides. And if any declared their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they could not in Conscience oune such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
as was then exercised; or if they declined to give their
thoughts of it, as judging thoughts to be under no humane
jurisdiction; or if they answered with such innocent speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
as these, that they ouned all Authority <hi>in the Lord,</hi>
or <hi>for the Lord,</hi> or <hi>according to the Word of God,</hi> or all <hi>just</hi> &amp;
<hi>Lawful</hi> Authority, these under-went &amp; suffered the Capital
punishment of <hi>Treason.</hi> And yet both for declining &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
their extorted Answers about this, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as unsufferable Maintainers of Principles incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with Government.</p>
            <p>4. But here, as in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the more they were afflicted
the more they grew, the more that the Enem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es rage was
increased the more were the People inflamed to inquire
about the Grounds of their Suffering, seeing rational men
and Religious Christians die so resolutely upon them; And
the more they insisted in this <hi>Inquisition,</hi> the more did the
number of Witnesses multiply, with a growing increase
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41139:104"/>
undauntedness, so that the then shed blood of the Martyrs
became the seed of the Church, and as by hearing &amp; seeing
them so signally countenanced of the Lord many were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
from their Courses of Complyance, so others
were daylie more &amp; more, confirmed in the wayes of the
Lord, and so strengthened by His Grace that they choose
rather to endure all Torture, and embrace death in its most
terrible aspect, than to give the Tyrant &amp; his Complices
any acknowledgment: yea not so much as to say, <hi>God save
the King,</hi> which was offered as the price of their life, and
Test of their acknowledgment, but they would not accept
Deliverance on these termes, that they might obtain a
better Resurrection. Which so enraged the <hi>Tygrish</hi> Trucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of these Persecuters, that they spared neither age,
sexe, nor Profession: the tenderness of youth did not move
them to any relenting, in murdering very boyes upon this
head, nor the gray hairs of the aged; neither were women
spared, but some were hanged, some drouned, tied to Stakes
within the Sea-mark, to be devoured gradually with the
growing waves, and some of them of a very young, some
of an old age. Especially after the murder of the never to
be forgotten Martyr, <hi>Mr Cargil,</hi> the multitude of merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Sufferings upon this account cannot be enumerated;
which encreased far beyond all the former steps, after the
<hi>Lanerk Declaration,</hi> which was burnt with great Solemnity
by the Magistrats of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in their robes, together with
the <hi>Solemn League &amp; Covenant,</hi> which had been burnt before,
but then they would more declaredly give new demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of their rage against it, because they confessed and
were convinced of its being conforme unto &amp; founded
upon that Covenant. And because the Incorporation of
<hi>Lanerk</hi> did not, because they could not, hinder the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, therefore they were threatened with the loss of
their Priviledges and forced to pay 6000 Merks. Upon the
back of which, the Sufferings of poor People that ouned
the Testimony were sadder &amp; sharper, and further extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than ever: Some being banished for Souldiers to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
&amp;c. some to be sold as Slaves in <hi>Carolina,</hi> and other
Places in <hi>America,</hi> to empty the filled Prisons and make
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41139:105"/>
room for more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which were daylie brought in from all

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>asty Prisons,
or Thiefes holes, in bolts &amp; <hi>irons</hi> to make them weary of
their life, or dispatched as Sacrifices and led as dumb Sheep
to the slaughter, without suffering them to speak their
dying words, for beating of Drums, or disposed of to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Ships to be transported in Slaverie.</p>
            <p>5. Had they satisfied themselves with murdering them
out of hand, it would have been more tolerable, and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
some degree of mercy, in comparison of their malice;
which, after all their endeavours to murder their Souls,
by ensnaring Offers, enslaving Bonds, blasphemous &amp;
contradictory Oaths, and multiplying captious Questions
to catch the Conscience, or at least vexe the Spirits of the
Righteous, whom they could not prevail with to put forth
their hands into iniquity, did proceed to invent all exquisite
torments more terrible than death. Some at their first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
were tortured with <hi>Fire-matches,</hi> burning and
for ever thereafter disabling their hands: Then laid fast &amp;
locked up in great <hi>Irons</hi> upon their legs, where they lay
many Moneths in the cold of winter, without any relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Some were tortured with the <hi>Boots,</hi> squeezing out
the marrow of their legs: Others with <hi>Thumbkins,</hi> piercing
&amp; bruising the bones of their thumbs: And some torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with both one after another, and besides kept waking
nine nights together by watchful Souldiers. who were
sworn not to let the afflicted person sleep all that time.</p>
            <p>6. All this Tyranny had been the more tolerable, if
they had kept within any bounds of colourable or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
shadow of legality, or in any consonancy to their oun
wicked Lawes, or exemplars of any former Persecutions.
But in an ambition to outdo all the <hi>Nero's, Domitians, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesians,
Duke d' Alva's,</hi> or <hi>Lewis de Grands,</hi> they scorned
all formes as wel as Justice of Law, and set up monstrous
Monuments of unprecedented illegalitie &amp; inhumanitie.
For when, after all their hornings, harrass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngs, hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
searchings, chasings, catchings, imprisonments,
torturings, banishments, and effusions of blood, yet they
could not get the Meetings crushed, either in publick or
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41139:105"/>
private, nor the zeal of the poor <hi>Wanderers</hi> quenched, with
whom they had interdicted all harbour, supply, comfort,
refreshment, converse or corrospondence, and whom
they had driven out of their oun &amp; all other habitations, in
Touns, Villages, or Cottages, to the Deserts, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
Moors, &amp; Mosses, in whose <hi>hags</hi> &amp; holes they
were forced to make <hi>Dens</hi> &amp; <hi>Caves</hi> to hide themselves, but
that they would still meet for the Worship of God, either
in Publick (though mostly in the cold winter nights) or in
their Private fellowships for Prayer &amp; Conference; and to
rescue their Brethren, and prevent their Murder in these
extremities, would surprize and take advantages of the
Souldiers now &amp; then: They then raged beyond all bounds,
and not only apprehending many innocent persons (against
whom they had nothing to accuse them of, but because
they could not satisfie them in their Answers) sentenced,
and executed them, all in one day, and made an Act to do
so with all; but allowed the bloody Souldiers to murder
them, without either Tryal or Sentence. Especially after
the <hi>Apologetical Declaration,</hi> affixed on the Church-doors,
they acted with an unheard of Arbitrariness. For not only
did they frame an <hi>Oath of Abjuration,</hi> renouncing the same;
but pressed it universally upon pain of death, upon all men
&amp; women in City &amp; Country, and went from house to
house forcing young &amp; old to give their judgement of that
Declaration, and of the Kings <hi>Authority</hi> &amp;c. to ridicule
and reproach and make a <hi>Ludibrum</hi> of all Government: yea
impowered Souldiers, &amp; common Varlets, to impannel
Juries, condemn &amp; cause to be put to death innocent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants,
and having stopt all Travel &amp; Commerce without
<hi>a Pass,</hi> signifying they had taken that Oath, they gave
power to all <hi>Hostlers</hi> &amp; <hi>Inn-keepers</hi> to impose Oaths, upon
all Passengers, Travellers, Gentlemen or Countrymen,
who were to swear that their <hi>Pass</hi> was not <hi>forged.</hi> And
Prisoners that would not take the Oath, were according
to the foresaid Act condemned, sentenced, &amp; execute,
all in one day, and early in the morning, that the People
might not be affected with the Spectacles of their bloody
Severities. Yea Spectators also, that gathered to see the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41139:106"/>
execution, were imposed upon, and commanded to give
their judgement, whether these men were justly put to
death or not. And not only so, but after that, they gave
Orders &amp; Commands to to the Souldiers to pursue the
chase after these <hi>Wanderers</hi> more violently, and shoot or
other wise put them to death wherever they could appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
them: Whereby many were taken &amp; instantly most
inhumanely murdered.</p>
            <p>IV. In the begining of this <hi>killing time,</hi> as the Country
calls it; the first Author &amp; Authorizer of all these Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
<hi>Charles II.</hi> was removed by death. Then one
would have thought, the Severity would have stopped:

upon his mounting the Throne, the executions and Acts
prosecuting the Persecution of the poor <hi>Wanderers,</hi> were
more Cruel than ever.</p>
            <p>1. There were more butchered &amp; slaughtered in the
fields, without all shadow of Law, or Trial, or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
than in all the former Tyrants reign; who were
murdered without time given to deliberate upon death,
or space to conclude their Prayers, but either in the instant
when they were Praying shooting them to death, or sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
them in their Caves, and murdering them there,
without any grant of Prayer at all; Yea many of them mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
without taking notice of any thing to be laid against
them, according to the worst of their oun Lawes, but
slain &amp; cut off without any pity, when they were found at
their labour in the field, or travelling upon the road. And
such as were Prisoners were condemned for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:41139:106"/>
and surprized with their execution, not knowing certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the time when it should be, yea leff in suspense whether
it should be or not, as if it had been on design to destroy
both their Souls &amp; Bodies. Yea <hi>Queens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, being then Commissioner, for a Reprieval in
favours of some of them, he told them, <hi>they should not have
time to prepare for Heaven, hell was too good for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There have been more banished to forreign Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in this mans time, than in the others. Within these
two years, several shipfulls of honest &amp; Consciencious
Sufferers have been sent to <hi>Iamacia</hi> (to which before they
were sent, some had their ears cutt) <hi>New Ieresey,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes,</hi>
in such Crouds &amp; Numbers, that many have died in
transportation; as many also died before in their pinching
Prisons, so thronged that they had neither room to lye nor
sit. Particularly the Barbarous usage of a great multitude of
them that were sent to <hi>Denotter Castle,</hi> when there was
no room for them in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> is never to be forgotten;
which the wildest &amp; rudest of Savages would have thought
shame of. They were all that long way made to travel on
foot, men &amp; women, and some of both sexes, very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
&amp; decrepite through age, and several sick, guarded
by bonds of Souldiers, And then put in to an old ruinous
&amp; rusty house, and shut up under vauts above 80 in a room,
men &amp; women, without air, without ease, without place,
either to lie, or walk, &amp; without any Comfort save what
they had from Heaven, &amp; so straitened for want of refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which they could not have but at exorbitant prices in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with their poor empty purses, and so suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with the smell of the place, and of their oun excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that as several of them died, so it was a wonder of
Mercy that any of them could outlive that Miserie: Yet
there they remained some moneths, at a distance from all
their friends, being sent thither to that Northern Corner
out of the South &amp; West borders of the Country; and some
out of <hi>London.</hi> Whose transportation hither, if it were not
a part of this Tragical Story, would seem a merry &amp; ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
passage to Strangers discovering the ridiculous folly
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41139:107"/>
as well as the outragious fury of their Persecuters. For
at a Private Meeting in <hi>London,</hi> among others some
<hi>Scotchmen,</hi> of very mean figure, some Taylors, a Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,
a Chap man &amp;c. were taken, &amp; being found to be
<hi>Scotchmen,</hi> were not only examined at the Common Courts
there but by <hi>Sir Andrew Foster,</hi> by express Commission
from the late King a litle before his death; who threatened
them under a strange sort of Certification (considering
what fell out immediately thereafter) that assuredly they
should be sent to <hi>Scotland</hi> very shortly, <hi>if there were not a
Revolution of the Government.</hi> But this Revolution follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
within a few dayes retarded it a litle: yet not long there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
they were sent in a <hi>Yacht,</hi> with a Guard of Souldiers,
and a Charge of high <hi>Treason.</hi> But when brought before
the Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the amount of all that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ussle with
them was, a Question posed to them under pain of death,
<hi>whether the King should be King or no?</hi> that is, wheither they
ouned his Authority or not. Yet thô some of the poor men
did oune it, they were sent to <hi>Denotter Castle:</hi> And thence
among the rest banished &amp; transported to <hi>New Iersey;</hi> in
which passage, by reason of their Croud &amp; bad provision,
the most part in the ship were cast into a fever, and upwards
of 60 died yea even since the former Proclamation for this
pretended Liberty, there are 21. men and 5. women sent
to <hi>Barbadoes</hi> against whom nothing could be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ledged but
matters of <hi>meer Religion</hi> &amp; Conscience: which, as it Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
the Notoriousness of these impudent lies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Proclamations for this Liberty are stuffed; So it
puts an indeleble brand of infamy upon some <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndon</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
that are said to pretend to some profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
who sent the ship to transport them, thereby to make
gain of the merchandise of the Lords Captives.</p>
            <p>3. There have been more Cruel Acts of Parliament
enacted in this Tyrants time, than the former made all his
reign. For in his first Parliament held by <hi>Queensberrie</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner,
not only was there an Act for making it <hi>Treason</hi>
to refuse the Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> confirming all the illega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of their Procedure hereupon before; but an Act mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it <hi>Criminal</hi> to oune the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and another Act mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41139:107"/>
it <hi>Criminal</hi> for any to be present at a <hi>Field Meeting,</hi> which
was only so to Preachers before. Yet neither these Acts,
and all the executions following upon them, have daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor I hope shall drive them, nor the <hi>Indemnity</hi> and <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi>
(so generally now applauded) draw them from
the Duty of ouning both these, that are so much the more
Publickly to be avouched, that they are so openly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by wicked &amp; blasphemous Tranny, though for the
same they expect from the <hi>Scotish Inquisition</hi> all the murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
violence, that hell &amp; <hi>Rome</hi> and Malignant rage can exert.</p>
            <p>But to conclude this Tragical Deduction: As these hints
we have heaped together of the Kinds &amp; several sorts (the
Particulars being impossible to be reckoned) of barbarities
and arbitrary Methods, used in carrying on this Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
demonstrating the reign or rather rage of these two
Dominators, under which we have houled these 27,
years, to be a Complete &amp; habitual Tyranny, do discover
the inhumanity &amp; illegality of their Proceedings, having
no other Precedent save that of the <hi>French Conversions,</hi> or
<hi>Spanish Inquisition,</hi> out done by many stages in respect
of Illegality by the <hi>Scotish Inquisition,</hi> and the Practices
of the <hi>Council of Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Iusticiary</hi> Court; So I shall
shut up all in a summarie Relation, of the Common Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
&amp; formes of Procedure in these Courts: which will
be useful to understand a litle more distinctly, to the end
the Innocency of Sufferers may more clearly appear. 1.
They can accuse whom they will, of what they please; And
if by summar Citation, he will not, may be because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
compear, if once his Name be in their <hi>Porteous rolls,</hi>
that is sufficient to render him convict. 2. They used
also to seize some, and shut them up in Prison year &amp; day,
without any signification of the cause of their imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
3. They can pick any man off the Street, and if
he do not answer their Captious Questions, proceed against
him to the utmost of severity; as they have taken some
among the Croud at Executions, &amp; imposed upon them the
Questions. 4. They can also go through all the houses of
the City, as well as the Prisons, and examine all families
upon the Questions of the <hi>Councils Catechisme,</hi> upon the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41139:108"/>
hazard of their life; if they do not answer to their satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as hath been done in <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> 5. When any are
brought in by Seisure, sometimes (as is said before) they
let them lie long without any hearing, if they expect they
cannot reach them: But if they think they can win at them
any way, then they hurry them in such hast, that they
have no time to deliberate upon, and oftentimes have no
knowledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or conjecture of, the matter of their Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Yea if they be never so insignificant, they will take
Diversion from their weightiest affairs, to examine &amp; take
Cognizance of poor Things, if they understand they dare
vent or avow any respect to the Cause of Christ: And the
silliest body will not escape their Catechization, about af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of State, what they think of the Authority &amp;c. 6. If
they be kept in Prison any space, they take all wayes to
pump and discover what can be brought in against them:
Yea sometimes they have exactly observed that Device of
the <hi>Spanish Inquisition,</hi> in suborning &amp; sending <hi>Flies</hi> among
them, under the disguise &amp; shew of Prisoners, to search
&amp; find out their minds, who will outstrip all in an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
zeal, thereby to extort &amp; draw forth words from
the most wary, which may be brought in judgement against
them the next day. 7. When Prisoners are brought in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, they have neither Lybel nor Accuser, but must
answer <hi>super inquirendis,</hi> to all Questions they are pleased
to ask. 8. If at any time they forme a sort of Lybel, they
will not restrict themselves to the Charges thereof, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the person about other things altogether extraneous
to the Lybel. 9. They have frequently suborned Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
and have sustained them as Witnesses, who either
were sent out by themselves as Spies &amp; Inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ligencers,
or who palpably were known to delate those against
whom they witnessed out of a pick &amp; prejudice, and
yet would not su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er them to be cast for partial Counsel.
10. If they suppose a man to be wary &amp; circumspect, and
more prudent than forward in the Testimony; then they
multiply questions, and at first many impertinent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations,
having no Connexion with the Cause, to try
his humour &amp; freedom, that they may know how to deal
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41139:108"/>
with him; And renew &amp; reiterate several Criminal exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
that they may know whereof, and find matter
wherein, to indyte him by endeavouring to confound, or
intrap, or involve him in Confessions, or Contradictions,
by wresting his words. 11. They will admit no time for
advice, nor any Lawful defence for a delay, but will have
them to answer presently, except they have some hopes of
their Complyance, and find them begining to stagger &amp;
succumb in the Testimony; in that case, when a man seeks
time to advise, they are animated to a keenness to impose,
and encouraged to an expectation of Catching by their
snares, which then they contrive &amp; prepare with greater
cunning. 12. If a man should answer all their questions,
and clear himself of all things they can alledge against him
yet they used to impose some of the Oaths, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
he would not take; and according to the measure
of the tenderness they discovered in any man, so they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
the Oaths to trap them, to the Stricter the
smoother Oaths, to the Laxer the more odious, that all
natural Consciences did scar at. 13. They will not only
have their Lawes obeyed, but subscribed; And they reckon
not their Subjects obedience secured by the Law-makers
sanction, but the Peoples hand-writing; And think it not
sufficient that People transgress no Lawes, but they must
also oune the justice of them, and the Authority that enacts
them, and swear to maintain it: And yet when some have
done all this, and cleared themselves by all Complyances,
they will not discharge them, but under a bond to answer
again when called. 14. They will have their Lawes to
reach not only actions but thoughts, and therefore they
require, what People think <hi>of the Bishops death,</hi> and of
<hi>Bothwel</hi> Insurection; And whether they <hi>oune the Authority,</hi>
when they can neither prove their disouning of it, nor any
way offending it. 15. They will have men to declare their
thoughts, and hold them convict if they do not answer
Positively all their Captious questions; And if they will
not tell what they think of this or that, then they must go
as guilty. 16. If they insist in waving, and will not give
<hi>Categorical</hi> Answers, then they can extort all and prove
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41139:109"/>
what they please by <hi>torture:</hi> And when they have extorted
their thoughts of things, thô they be innocent as to all actions
their Law can charge them with, then they used to hang
them when they had done. 17. They have wheedled men
sometimes into <hi>Confession</hi> either of Practices or Principles,
by promising to favour their ingenuity, and upbraiding
them for dissemblers if they would not, and by mock-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulations,
<hi>why were they ashamed to give a Testimony?</hi> And
then make them sign their Confessions at the Council, to
bring them in as a witness against them at the Criminal
Court. 18. Yea not only <hi>extrajudicial Confession</hi> will sustain
in their Law, but when they have given the Publick faith,
the Kings security, the Act &amp; Oath of Council, that their
Confesion shall not militate against them, they have
brought it in as witness against them, and given it upon
Oath, when their former Oath &amp; Act was produced in
open Court, in demonstration of their perjurie. 19. When
the matter comes to an <hi>Assize</hi> or Cognizance of a <hi>Iurie,</hi>
they use to pack them for their purpose, and pick out such
as are listed, who they think will not be bloody enough.
20. Sometimes when the Jurie hath brought their verdict
in favours of the <hi>Pannal,</hi> they have made them sit doun, &amp;
resume the Cognition of the Case again, and threatened
them with an Assize of errour if they did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring him in
guilty. 21. Yea most frequently the Kings Advocate used
to <hi>Command</hi> them to Condemn and bring in the Pannal
Guilty, under most peremptory Certification; of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
if they should not; so that they needed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Juries but
only for the fashion. 22. Sometimes they have sentenced
innocent persons twice, once to have their ears cut and be
banished, and after the lopping of their ears, some have
been re-examined and Sentenced to death, and execute.
23. They have Sentenced some and hanged them both in
one day; Others early in the morning, both to surprize
the persons that were to die, and to prevent Spectators of
the sight of their Cruelty; Others have been kept in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense,
till the very day &amp; hour of their execution. 24. Not
only have they murdered serious &amp; zealous Followers of
Christ, in taking away their <hi>Lives,</hi> but endeavoured to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41139:109"/>
murder their <hi>Names,</hi> and to murder the <hi>Cause</hi> for which
they suffered; loading it with all Reproaches, as Sedition
&amp; Rebellion &amp;c. which was their peculiar Policy, to bring
the Heads of Sufferings to Points that are most obnoxious
to mens Censure, and accounted most extrinsick to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
whereby they levelled their-designs against Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
not directly under that notion, but obliquely in the
destruction of its Professors, under the odium &amp; reproach
of enemies to Government. 25. But chiefly they labour to
murder the Soul, defile the Conscience, and only consult
to cast a man doun from his excellency, which is his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity;
that is a Christians Croun, and that they would rather
rob him of as any thing, either by hectoring or flattering him
from the Testimony! which they endeavour by proposing
many offers, with many threatenings in subtile termes;
And pretend a great deal of tenderness, protesting <hi>they will
be as tender of their blood as of their oun Soul</hi> (which in some
sense is true, for they have none at all of their oun Souls)
and purging themselves as <hi>Pilate</hi> did, and charging it upon
their oun head. 26. They will be very easie in their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations,
where they find the poor man begining to
faint, and hearken to their overtures wherein they will
grant him his life, yeelding to him as cunning Anglers do
with Fishes: And to persuade him to some length in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,
they will offer Conference sometimes or reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Point, to satisfie &amp; informe his Conscience,
as they pretend, but really to catch him with their busked
hook. 27. If they have any hope of prevailing they will
change a mans Prison, and take him out from among the
more strict &amp; fervent in the Cause, that might sharpen &amp;
strenghen his zeal, and put him in among the more cool &amp;
remiss. 28. Sometimes they used to stage several together,
whereof they knew some would Comply, to <hi>Tantalize</hi> the
rest with the sight of the others Liberty, and make them
byte the more eagerly at their bait to catch the Conscience.
But when they had done all they could; Christ had many
Witnesses, who did retain the Croun of their Testimony
in the smallest Points, till they obtained the Croun of
Martyrdom, and attained to the Croun of Glory, Speaking
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41139:110"/>
boldly to them without fear or shame, and disdaining their
flattering Proposals, but looking on them under a right
notion as stated there in opposition to Christ; whereby
they found this Advantage, that hence they were restrained
from all sinful tampering with them, or intertaining any
discourse with them, but what was suitable to speak to
Christs enemies, or doing any thing to save their life but
what became Christs Witnesses, who loved not their lives
unto the death. Of whom universally this was observed,
that to the Admiration of all, the Conviction of many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
the Confirmation of many friends, the Establishment
of the Cause, and the Glory of their Redeeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, they went
off the stage with so much of the Lords Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enance, so
much Assurance of Pardon &amp; Eternal Peace, so much
hope of the Lords returning to Revive His Work and
Plead His Cause again in these Lands, that never any
suffered with more meekness, humility, &amp; composure of
Spirit, and with more faithfulness, stedfastness, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
than these Worthies did for these despised &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
Truths: for which their surviving Brethren are
now Contending &amp; Suffering, while others are at ease.</p>

TESTIMONY
Stated and Vindicated in its Principal
Heads.</head>
            <p>BY what is above premitted, the Reader may see
the Series &amp; Succession of the Testimony of
Christs Witnesses in <hi>Scotland</hi> from time to time,
in all the Periods of that Church; how it hath
been transmitted from one generation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Doun to our hands; how far it hath been extended;
and what Increments it hath received in every Period;
how it hath been opposed by a Continued Prosecution
of an hereditary War against Christ, by an Atheistical,
Papistical, Prelatical, and Tyrannical faction; and how
it hath been concerted, contended for, maintained, &amp; sealed
actively &amp; passively, by an Anti-pagan, Anti-Popish, Anti-Prelatical,
Anti-Erastian, Anti-Sectarian, and Anti-Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Remnant of the Followers, Professors, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
&amp; Martyrs of Christ in all Ages. Now it remains
in the <hi>third</hi> &amp; last Place to consider the Merit of the Cause
as it is now Stated, to see whether it will bear the weight of
those great Sufferings wherewith it hath been sealed. I hope
all the Lovers of Christ, who have an estee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ven of His

least of Truths, is of greater value than any thing that we
can suffer the loss of for it, yea of infinitely greater value
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41139:111"/>
than the whole world. So that if I prove these Heads of
Suffering to be Truths, wherein Conscience is concerned,
the Cause will be sufficiently vindicated from the loadings

dutie, who to Justify their oun backwardness &amp; detastable
lukwarmness call some of them only <hi>State questions</hi> about
things Civil, and not Gospel-Truths and Heads to State
suffering upon: And if they be Truths &amp; Duties, the Cause
will some way be rendered more Illustrious, that it is
Stated upon the smallest hoofs &amp; hair-breadths of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of Christs Declarative Glory; as being a greater
witness of its Ouners Love &amp; Loyalty to Christ, and of
their pure &amp; tender zeal for His honour, than if for more
substantial &amp; fundamental Truths, which a Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
may reclaim to Decline, when for the meanest
Circumstantials of Christs Truths they dare &amp; are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
to bestow their dearest blood. But if the Complexe
of them be impartially Considered, no unprejudiced Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter
will suffer himself to have such extenuating Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the present Word of Patience, &amp; Testimony of the
suffering Remant in <hi>Scotland</hi> this day: But it will appear to
be a very weighty &amp; worthy Concern, as any that either
Men or Christians can be called to Witness for; being the
Priviledge of all mankind, the Duty of all Christians, and
the Dignity of all Churches, to assert, It is for the Glory
&amp; Croun Prerogatives and Imperial <hi>Regalia</hi> of the King
of Kings, with reference to His visible Kingdom, of which
the Government is layd upon His shoulders, against the

both as He is <hi>Mediator</hi> &amp; King &amp; Head of the <hi>Church,</hi>
and as He is <hi>God</hi> &amp; Universal King of the <hi>world.</hi> As He is
Mediator, it is His Peculiar Prerogative to have a <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi>
&amp; Sole Soveraignty over His oun Kingdom, to insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
His oun Government, to constitute His oun Lawes,
to ordain His oun Officers, to appoint His oun Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which He will have observed without alteration, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
or diminution untill His Second Coming: This
His Prerogative hath been &amp; is invaded by <hi>Erastian Prelacy,</hi>
Sacrilegious <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and now by Antichristian <hi>Poperie,</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:41139:111"/>
which have overturned His Government, inverted His
Lawes, subverted His Officiers, &amp; Perverted His Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
As He is God &amp; Universal King, it is His in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
Property &amp; Glory, not only to have <hi>Absolute</hi>
&amp; Illimited Power, but to invest his Deputed Ministers
of Justice with His Authority &amp; Ordinance of <hi>Magistracy,</hi>
to be administred in subordination to Him, to be regulated
by His Lawes, and to be improved for His Glory &amp; the
good of Mankind: This Glory of His hath been invaded
by <hi>Tyrants</hi> &amp; <hi>Usurpers</hi> arrogating to themselves an <hi>Absolute
Power,</hi> intruding themselves without His investment into
Authority, in a Rebellion against Him, in opposition to
His Lawes, and abusing it to His dishonour, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Mankind. Against both which Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the Present Testimony is stated, in a Witness for
Religion &amp; Liberty, to both which these are destructive.
This will appear to be the Result &amp; Tendency of the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in all its parts, opposed by the Enemies of Religion
&amp; Liberty, and the end of all their oppositions, to bring
it to this <hi>Crinomenon, who shall he King? Iesus or Cesar?</hi> Let
any seriously search into all their Proclamations &amp; Edicts
against <hi>Religion &amp; Liberty,</hi> this will be found to be the soul
&amp; sense of them, practically &amp; Really speaking to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
especially since this man came to the Throne.</p>

from an absolute &amp; implicite subjection to us &amp; our

do never cease to assert &amp; maintain strange Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes,
such Principles as are inconsistent with the glory
&amp; interest of our Government, as that the Authority
of Kings should be hem'd in with Limits, and that their
Acts &amp; Actions are to be examined by another rule than
their oun Authority to make them Lawful, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
in the Kingdom are not subject to the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
That there is a Kingdom within a Kingdom not
subordinate to the King, And that there is another King
Superior to the Supreme whom they will rather obey
than us, And that we must either take Laws from Him
or otherwise we are not Magistrats; And Considering
also their Practices are Conforme to their, Principles,
They will not obey our Lawes but the Lawes of Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inconsistent with ours, and will calculate their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
according to His Lawes and not according to ours,
And continually make their Addresses to and receive
Ambassadours from a Prince whom we know not,
whom our Predicessors of truely worthy memory did
crucify, One <hi>Iesus</hi> who was dead, whom they affirm
to be alive, whose Government they alledge is Supreme
over all Kings Whom they acknowledge but as His Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals;
Being now by favourable fortune, not only <hi>brought
to the Imperial Croun of these Kingdoms through the greatest dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
but preserved upon the throne of our Royal Ancestors,</hi>
which from our Great founder <hi>Nimrod</hi> of <hi>Glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi>
and our Illustrious Predecessors <hi>Pharaoh, Nebuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adnezzar,
Herod the Great, Nero, Caligula</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
&amp; pious Memory,</hi> hath been ever opposite to and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
the Destruction of that Kingdom of Christ: Do,
after their Laudable example, resolve to suppress that
Kingdom by all the means &amp; might we can use, because
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41139:112"/>
His Government is hateful to us, His yoke heavy, His
sayings are hard, His Lawes are contrary to our lusts;
Therefore <hi>we will not let this man reign over us, we will break
His bonds and cast away His Cords, from us;</hi> And advance
&amp; exerce our <hi>Soveraign Authority, Prerogative Royal,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Absolute Power, which all our subjects are to obey without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</hi>
And as by virtue of our <hi>Supremacy,</hi> whereby we
are above all, but such as we are pleased to subject our
selves to, settled by Law and Lineally Derived to us as
<hi>an Inherent right to the Croun,</hi> we have Power to order
all matters of Church as well as State, <hi>as we in our Royal
wisdom shall think fit, All Laws &amp; Acts</hi> of Christ <hi>to the
contrary notwithstanding;</hi> And accordingly in our Royal
wisdom have overturned the plat-form of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which Christ hath instituted, razed all Courts
fenced in His Name, and severely interdicted all Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of His subjects, and intertainment of His Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours;
many of whom, in contempt of Him that sent
them, we have punished according to Law, for nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating
His Affairs in our Kingdoms without our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
&amp; requiring Allegiance &amp; obedience to Him, after
we had exauctorated Him; we have also established our
Right Trusty &amp; Entirely beloved Clerks in Ecclesiastick
affairs, and their underlings, by our Authority to have
the Administration of the business of Religion, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
our Right Trusty &amp; well beloved Cousins &amp;
Counsellers, to Compell all to submitt to them, by
Finings, Confinings, Imprisonment, Banishment,
Oaths, &amp; Bonds, and all Legal means: So now having
prosecuted this war against Christ to this length, that we
have no fears of a Rally of His forces again so often
beaten, we are now engaged with other Antichristian
Princes to <hi>give our Power</hi> to our holy Father Antichrist,
so far as may serve his purpose to oppse Christ in his way;
but we reserve so much to our seeves, as may encroach
upon Him in our Capacity. And therefore we have
thought fit to restore to Antichrist our Ecclesiastical Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
from whom we borrowed it, and for which
we have no use at present: But we resolve to maintain
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:41139:113"/>
&amp; prosecute our <hi>Soveraign Authority, Prerogative Royal,
and Absolute Power foresaid,</hi> against Christ, and without
subordation to Him, from whom as we sought none
so we received no Power by His Warrant &amp; Grant, and
against whom we mind to manage it to the utter most of
out power. Yet reflecting <hi>upon the Conduct of the four
last Reigns, how after all the frequent &amp; pressing endeavours
that were used in each of them, to reduce our Kingdoms</hi> to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
the Subjects of Christ were so stubborn, that
<hi>the success hath not answered the designe:</hi> We must now
change our Methods alitle, and tollerate that Profession
of Christ which we cannot yet get overturned, His
Subjects being so numerous, but alwayes upon these
termes, that they take aspecial care that <hi>nothing be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or taught among</hi> them, which may be a Testimony for
Christs Prerogatives in opposition to our Usurpation, or
<hi>may any way tend to alienate the hearts of our People from us or
our Government,</hi> or Preach his Truths which we have
condemned as <hi>Seditious &amp; Treasonable, under the highest
pains these Crimes will import.</hi> Hereby we shall <hi>establish
our Government on such a foundation,</hi> on the ruine of Christs,
as may <hi>make our subjects happy, and unite them to us by Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as well as Duty,</hi> in a belief that we will <hi>not constrain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in matters of meer Religion:</hi> for which we have a
Dispensation from our holy-Father, and also from our
oun Absoluteness, to be slaves to this Promise no longer
then consists with our Interest: And which we have
power to Interpret as we please: And would have all to
understand, that no Testimony for Christs Supremacy
against our Encroachments thereupon, shall be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
under these <hi>Matters of meer Religion</hi> 
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>or which
the Conscience shall not be constrained: But we will
have the Consciences of such Subjects of his, that
dare assert it, brought to a Test &amp; probation how they
stand affected in this Competition betuixt us &amp; this
King <hi>Iesus,</hi> and see whether they will oune or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
our Authority, because not of him, nor for him,
nor to him, but against him &amp; all his Interests.
<hi>Our will is therefore,</hi> that all who will Countenance any
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41139:113"/>
other Meetings of His Subjects than we have allowed,
or connive at them, shall be <hi>prosecuted according to the
utmost severity of our Lawes made against them, which we leave
in full force &amp; vigour notwithstanding of the Premises.</hi> And for
this effect, <hi>we further Command all our Iudges, Magistrats,
&amp; Officers of our Forces,</hi> to prosecute all these Subjects &amp;
Followers of Christ, who shall be guilty of treating with,
or paying homage to that exauctorated King of theirs, in
their Assemblies with His Ambassadours in the Fields,
<hi>with the utmost rigor as they would avoid our highest Displeasure:</hi>
for <hi>we are confident, none will after these Liberties &amp; freedoms
we have given to all without reserve,</hi> to serve God Publickly
in such a way as we by our Soveraign Authority, Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative

&amp; allowed, <hi>presume to meet in these Assemblies,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
such whose Loyaltie to Christ doth alienate them
from us &amp; our Government. As also under the same
Certifications, by the same Soveraign Authority, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
Royal &amp; Absolute Power foresaid, We charge,
impower, warrand, &amp; Authorize, against all hazards
(Hell excepted) all our foresaid Judges &amp; Officers in their
respective places, to Prosecute &amp; execute our Lawes,
against all that may be suspected or convicted of their
Adherence to Christ, or be found guilty of ouning their
Allegiance to Him as their Liege Lord by Solemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
which we have caused burn by the hand of the
hangman, and declared Criminal to oune it, or shall be
found guilty of declining Allegiance to us &amp; our Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Authority, stated in opposition to Him &amp; His, or
of maintaining that pernicious Principle, inconsistent
with our Government that their lives are their oun,
which they will preserve without surrender to our
Mercy: All which we Command to be executed to
death, or banished as Slaves, as shall be found most
conducible to our Interest. And to the end, the few that
remain of that way may be totally exterminated, we
straitly Command all our Souldiers, Horse &amp; Foot, to

Christ and his Followers, and Contribute their best

               <p>WE, a Poor Company of Persecuted, reproached,

wise men among us after the flesh, not many
mighty, not many noble, but are a few foolish, weak,
base, &amp; despised nothings in the world; Yet having this
Ambition to be His called, chosen, &amp; faithful Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who is King of Glory, King of Heaven, King of
Saints, King of Nations, King of Kings, whose King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is Everlasting &amp; Universal; Considering the many
insolent indignities, affronts, &amp; reproaches cast upon
His Name &amp; Glory, and the many Usurpations, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments,
&amp; Invasions made upon His Croun &amp;
dignity, by a Pestilent Generation of His Atheistical,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41139:114"/>
Papistical, Prelatical, &amp; Tyrannical Enemies, who
have rebelled against Him, and have renounced, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
&amp; subverted His Royal Government, both in
the Church &amp; in the world, both in His Kingdom of
Grace and of Power: Do bear Witness &amp; Testimony
against these Rebels, from the Highest to the Lowest:
And assert the Interest &amp; Title of our Princely Master,
and oune Allegiance &amp; absolute obedience to Him and
His Government, to which He hath all undoubted
right; An Essential right by His Eternal God head,
being the Everlasting Father whose goings forth have
been of old from Everlasting; A Covenant right by
Compact with the Father, to bear the Glory and rule
upon His Throne, by virtue of the Council of Peace
between them both; A Donative right by the Fathers
right of Delegation, by which He hath all Power given to
him in Heaven &amp; in Earth, and all Authority even because
He is the Son of man; An Institute right by the Fathers
Inauguration, which hath set Him as King in <hi>Zion;</hi> An
Acquisite right by His oun Purchase, by which He hath
merited &amp; obtained not only Subjects to Govern, but
the Glory of the Sole Soveraignty over them in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
a Name above every Name; A Bellical right
by Conquest, making the People fall under Him, and
be willing in the day of His Power, and overcoming
those that make war with Him; An Hereditary right by
Proximity of blood &amp; Primogeniture, being the first
born, higher then the Kings of the Earth, and the first
born from the dead, that in all things He might have
the Preeminence; An Elective right by His Peoples
choise &amp; surrender, a Croun wherewith His Mother
Crouned Him in the Day of His espousals. In a humble
recognizance of all which Rights, we oune &amp; avouch,
that He hath that Incommunicable Prerogative of Sole
Soveraignty, over his Visible Kingdom as well as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
without a Copartner or Competitor, either
Coordinate or subordinate; in Prescribing Lawes, by
no humane Authority to be reversed; in appointing
Ordinances, immutable without addition or diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:41139:115"/>
for matter or manner; instituting a Government,
which no man or Angel can without Blasphemy arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
a Power either to invert or evert, change or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
And Constituting Officers, which must depend
only on His Authority and His alone; and must be
cloathed only with His Commission and His alone,
guided by His Instructions &amp; His alone, Acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to His Lawes &amp; Prescribed Platforme and His
alone, without any dependence on, subordination to,
Licence warrand or Indulgence from, any Mortal.
And therefore We disoune &amp; detest every thing that
hath not the stamp of His Authority, either in Doctrine,
Worship, Discipline or Government: And will discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
Prelacy, Supremacy, Popery, and all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
contrarie to His Institution, who is Sole &amp; Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Lawgiver to the Conscience, and will submit to,
or comply with nothing that may directly or indirectly
signify our respect unto them. Hence we will take none
of their Oaths, subscribe none of their bonds, yeeld to
none of their Impositions, pay none of their Exactions:
Neither will we hear or receive Ordinances from any
Minister, but the faithful Authorized Ambassadours,
of Christ our King, whatever either rage or reproach
we suffer for it. We assert &amp; affirm also, that our Exalted
Prince is King of the whole world, by whom Kings
reign &amp; Princes Decree Justice, as His Ministers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
in subordination to Him; whom He hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to rule over us, with just boundaries that they may
not exceed, and true Characters by which we should
know them &amp; pay them deference. And therefore, who
soever shall arrogate to themselves and extend their
power beyond &amp; above His prescripts, being neither call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to, nor qualified for, nor improving the Office, for
the ends He hath appointed; We will acknowledge
them no otherwise than Usurping Tyrants, &amp; not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats
nor Ministers of Justice, to whom He hath given
the Sword by His preceptive Will, only as Lyons,
Bears, Wolves, to whom he hath given a rod by His
providential Will: In that case we may be passively
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41139:115"/>
subject when we cannot do better, but will never oune
Consciencious Allegiance to them, nor oune them as
our Lawful Magistrars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore we will not bow
to their Idols they have set up, nor prostitute either
Conscience or Liberty to their Lust, But will endeavour
under our Masters Banner &amp; Conduct to preserve what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he hath intrusted to us, Religion, Life, Liberty,
Estate, And whatsoever the Lord our God hath given
us to possess, As they unjustly possess what their God
gives them: And will maintain a war of constant oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to them (against whom our Lord hath declared a
war for ever) without parly, Treaty of peace, Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
Composition, Truce or any Transaction: we
will neither Medle nor make with them less or more,
nor seek their favour, nor embrace it when it is offered,
on any termes that may imply any obligation to surcease
from our duty to our King, and irreconcileable oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to them &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now I shall come more Distinctly to the purpose, in
offering a short vindication of the Heads &amp; Grounds of our
great sufferings: Dividing them into their principal parts,
which I reduce to two, <hi>viz Negatives</hi> &amp; <hi>Positives.</hi> The <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi>
Grounds? I reckon three principally. 1. For Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to acknowledge a Corrupt <hi>Ministrie.</hi> 2. For Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to oune a Tyrannical <hi>Magistracy.</hi> 3. For Refusing
to Swear &amp; subscribe their unlawful imposed Oaths,
Chiefly that of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> which was the occasion of
suffering unto death. The positive Grounds are also three.
1. For frequenting field-meetings, to receive Gospel-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinancs
from faithful Ministers. 2. For maintaining the
principle &amp; practice of Defensive Resistence of Superior
powers. 3. For maintaining the priviledge &amp; Duty of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
revenge in executing Justice upon Murdering Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Mankind in cases of extreme necessity. In prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
which, I shall intertexe some subordinate questions
relating to their respective Heads, and endeavour to discuss
them briefly.</p>
            <div n="1" type="head">
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:41139:116"/>
               <head>HEAD. I. Where
<hi>The Sufferings of many for Refusing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
a Corrupt Ministrie are Vindicated:
and the Question of Hearing</hi> Curats <hi>is cleared.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Question though it may seem nice and of no
great Moment, to Persons of <hi>Gallio's</hi> or <hi>Laodiceds</hi>
temper, indifferent &amp; Lukwarm dispositions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
their oun more them the things of Christ, which
maks it pass without any enquiry with the most part of the
world: Yet to all who are truly tender in keeping a good
Conscience free of the times Contagion, to all who have the
true Impression of the fear of God, who is <hi>Iealous</hi> especially
in the matters of his worship, to all who have the true
zeal of God eating them up, in a just indignation at the
indignities done to him, in usurping the office, &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
the Administration of the Ministrie, to all who
truly Love the Gospel and put a due value on the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Christ, the Corruptions whereof this Question
touches, it will be accounted of great importance. There
are three Questions about the Duty of hearing the Word,
Concerning which the Lord Jesus gives us very weighty
Cautions, <hi>viz what we should hear, Mark. 4. 24. how we
should hear Luk.</hi> 8. 18. and <hi>whom</hi> we should hear. The last
of which, though it be not so expressly Stated as the other
two, yet the Searcher of the Scriptures will find it as clearly
Determined, and as many Cautions to guard from erring
in it, as in any other Case, And that the Concern of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in it is very weighty. And certain it is if there had
been more advertency in this Point, there would not have
been such inconsideration and Licenciousness in the matter
&amp; manner of hearing. Nor would that itching humor &amp;
Luxuriancy of lust, in heaping up teachers to please the
fancy, have been so much encouraged, to the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment
of the Church, disgrace of the Gospel, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of many poor Souls. But through the ignorance
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:41139:116"/>
&amp; neglect of this Duty of trying <hi>whom</hi> we should hear, by
seeking some satisfieing evidence of their being cloathed
with Authority from Christ, the world hath been left
louse in a Licence to hear <hi>what</hi> they pleased, and so have
received the Poison of error from <hi>Monte banks,</hi> instead of
the true &amp; wholesome Potions of Christs Prescripts from
them that had Power &amp; skill to administer them. Hence
the many Sects, &amp; Schismes, &amp; errors, that have Pestered
the Church in all ages, have in a great measure proceeded
from this latitude &amp; laxness of Promiscous hearing of all
whom they pleased, whom either the worlds Authority
impowered, or by other means were possessed of the
place of Preaching, without taking any Cognizance whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they had the Characters of Christs Ambassadours or
not. If this had been observed, and People had scrupled
&amp; refused to hear these whom they might know should not
have Preached; neither the Great Antichrist, nor the many
lesser Antichrists, would have had such footing in the
world as they have this day. It is then of no small Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to have this Question cleared. Neither is it of
small difficulty to solve the intricacies of it, what Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
to fix for a discovery of Christs true Ministers;
whom we should submit to &amp; obey in the Lord, and Love
&amp; esteem them for their Works sake, and for their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
sake, as standing in Christs stead, having the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the word of Reconciliation committed to them;
And how we may discern those Characters, what judgment
is incumbent to private Christians, for the satisfaction of
theiroun Consciences in the Case; And how they ought
to demean themselves in their practice, with out Scandal
on either hand, or sin against their oun Conscience; how
to avoid the rocks &amp; Extremes that inadvertency or preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitancy
in this matter may rush upon; So as to escape &amp;
sail by the <hi>Scylla</hi> of sinful Separation on the one hand, and
the <hi>Charybdis</hi> of sinful union &amp; Communion on the other,
which are equally dangerous; especially how these Cautions
are to be managed in a broken and disturbed &amp; divided
Case of the Church. The Question also is the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
that as it was never so much questioned before this
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41139:117"/>
time, and never so much sought to be obscured, by the
perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds to find out
evasions to cover sin &amp; escape sufferings upon this account;
So it hath never been discussed by Divines either at home
or abroad, with relation to our Case, except what hath
been of late by some faithful men, who have suffered upon
this head, from whom I shall gather the most of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
in as Compendious a way as I can without
wronging them. The reason, I fancy, that we are at such
a loss in our helps from the Learned on this head, is partly,
that they have written with relation to their oun times,
in a Constitute Case of the Church, when Corruptions &amp;
disorders might be orderly rectified, and people might have
access to get their scruples removed in a Legal way by
Church-order, in which case the Learned &amp; Judicious
<hi>Mr Durham</hi> hath written excellently in his book <hi>on Scandal,</hi>
but therein neither he nor others did consult nor could
have a prospect of such a case as ours is; And partly,
that forreign Divines, not having this for their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
could not be acquainted with our circumstantiate
case, and so are not fit nor Competent Arbiters to decide
this Contraversie; hence many of them do wonder at
our sufferings upon this head. Every Church is best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with her oun Testimony. Yet we want not the
suffrage of some of the Learnedst of them, as the Great
<hi>Gisb. Voetius</hi> in his <hi>Polit Eccles.</hi> in several places comes near
to favour us: where he allowes People to leave some &amp; hear
such Ministers as they profit most by, from these grounds,
<q>that people should chuse the best &amp; most edifying gifts,
and from that scripture 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 21. Prove all things</hi> &amp;c.
and answers objections to the contrare, and granteth
that upon several occasions one may abstain from expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
Communion with a Corrupt Church, for these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that such Communion is not absolutely necessary,
<hi>Necessitate</hi> either <hi>Medii</hi> or <hi>Precepti,</hi> where the Christian
shall have more peace of Conscience, and free exercise
of Christian Duties elswhere, And that he may keep
Communion with more Purity in other places <hi>Polit. Ecces.
Quest. 17. Pag.</hi> 68. And he approves of People refusing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41139:117"/>
to bring their Children to be baptized by such Corrupt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
because they may wait until they have occasion
of a Minister, for if the best gifts be to be Coveted why
should not the best Ministers be preferred? and why
should not Christians shew by their deeds, that they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
such as fear the Lord, &amp; contemn a vile Person?
They ought not to partake of other mens sins 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9.
11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 11. They should not strengthen the hands
of the wicked and make sad the Godly; The Authority
of such Ministers should not be strengthened <bibl>

                  </q> But though it labour under all
these disadvantages: yet it is not the less but so much the
rather necessary, to say somwhat to clear it, with depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon light from the Fountain, and with the help of
those faithful men who hath sufficiently cleared it up, to
all that have a Conscience not blinded or bribed with some
prejudices, by which more light hath accrued to the Church
in this point of withdrawing from Corrupt Ministers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
ever was attained in former times; which is all the good
we have got of <hi>Prelacy.</hi> In so much that I might spare la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in adding any thing, were it not that I would make
the Arguments vindicating this Cause of suffering alitle
more publick, and take occasion to shew, that the grounds
espoused by the Present &amp; reproached party for their with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings,
so far as they are stretched, are no other than
have been ouned by our writers on this head; to the intent
it may appear, there is no Discrepancy but great likness
&amp; harmony between the Arguments &amp; Grounds of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing,
in the late <hi>Informatorie Vindication</hi> &amp;c. and those
that are found in other writings. And so much the rather
I think it needful to touch this subject now, that not only
this hath been the first ground of our sufferings, but many
that suffered a while for it, now have fainted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
all their former Contendings for this Part of the
Testimony, calling in question all these reasons that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfied' them. But to proceed with some distinctness in
this thorny point: Some <hi>Concessory Assertions</hi> must first be
premitted, And then Our Grounds Propounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I willingly yeeld to &amp; Cordially close with the
Truth of these Assertions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:41139:118"/>
I. The Unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace, ought
to be the Endeavour of all that are members of the <hi>One Body</hi>
of Christ, Partakers of his <hi>One Spirit,</hi> called in <hi>One Hope,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
<hi>One Lord,</hi> Confessing <hi>One Faith,</hi> sealed with <hi>One
Baptisme Eph.</hi> 4. 3. &amp;c. And for <hi>Brethren</hi> to dwel together
in <hi>Unity,</hi> is good &amp; pleasant, and like the precious Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the head, that ran doun upon <hi>Aarons</hi> beard
<hi>Psal.</hi> 133. 1, 2. A fragrant Oyntment indeed, if it be
composed aright of <hi>Gospel-simples,</hi> according to Divine art,
and the Wisdom that is from above, which is first pure &amp;
then peacable; and not made up of Adulterate <hi>Politicks:</hi> that
Union that hath the Spirit for its Author, the Scripture
for its Rule, Peace for its bond &amp; beauty, love for its Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Faith for its foment, Christ for its foundation, and
Truth &amp; holiness for its constant Companions, cannot
but be intensely desired, enixely endeavoured, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
followed, by all the Professors of the Gospel of
Peace, &amp; Subjects of the Prince of Peace: Which makes
<hi>Division</hi> &amp; <hi>Schisme</hi> not only a great Miserie, but a Grand
sin. But it must be in the way of Truth &amp; Duty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with holiness &amp; the honour of Christ, otherwise if
it be in the way of Apostasie &amp; defection, it is but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
&amp; Conspiracy against the Lord. And true Union
can neither be attained, nor retained, nor recovered; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the sinful Cause of Division, <hi>Defection;</hi> and the holy
overruling Cause, the <hi>Anger of the Lord</hi> be removed, in
turning to &amp; following him.</p>
               <p>II. Thô there be not perfect Union, but <hi>diversity</hi> both
of judgements and practices, in several Cases there may
be Communion with a Church in its Ordinances and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie.
As 1. We may have a <hi>Catholick</hi> Communion with
all Christian Ministers &amp; Members of the Catholick
Church, considered as such; holding the Head Christ,
and the foundation sure. And so we may meet for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with all Devout men in every Nation under Heaven,
whether they be <hi>Parthians,</hi> or <hi>Medes,</hi> or <hi>Elamites,</hi> or
<hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> &amp;c. thô differing in Controversies of lesser
moment, not overturning that; if they hold the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Testimony of the Gospel, against the Common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41139:118"/>
thereof, <hi>Iewes, Turks, or Pagans:</hi> for there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>Iew</hi> if he be a Christian, Christ is all and in
all <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11. But if they be Hereticks, we can have no
Communion with them. 2. We may have a more <hi>special</hi>
Communion with all <hi>Protestant</hi> Ministers &amp; Members of
the <hi>Reformed</hi> Church, considered as such, more strictly,
and upon stricter conditions: providing they hold, not
only the Universal of <hi>Christians,</hi> but the General Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Protestants,</hi> against the Greater &amp; lesser Antichrists;
thô differing from us in some circumstantial points, not
Reformed, and not contradictory unto the Protestant Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
against <hi>Poperie</hi> &amp; all Heresie; nor declining from
their oun Reformation, by Defection or Schisme. And
Consequently, its Lawful to oune Communion with the
Churches of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and take <hi>Ordination</hi> from
them, thô they have some <hi>formes</hi> not allowable, from
which they were never Reformed, because they are sound
in the Protestant Testimony. But with the <hi>Sectarians</hi> or
<hi>Schismaticks</hi> or <hi>Apostates</hi> among them, we cannot oune
that special Communion. 3. We may have a more <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
Communion upon yet stricter conditions, with all
our <hi>Covenanted</hi> Brethren, Ministers &amp; Members of the
Churches of <hi>Britain</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland,</hi> considered as such: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
they hold, not only the Universal, not only the more
Special, Protestant Testimony against the Greater &amp; lesser
Antichrists, but the <hi>Covenanted</hi> Testimony for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, &amp; Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
against Poperie, Prelacy, Superstition, Heresie,
Schisme, &amp; Profanness, according to the <hi>Covenant;</hi> Thô
differing from us in those Controversial points, never Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and which were never the Word of Christs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and do not overturn the Covenanted Testimony.
But with those that contradict &amp; counteract that, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
oune that particular Communion. 4. We may have
yet a nearer <hi>Organical</hi> Communion, upon stricter condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
still, with all the Ministers &amp; Members of the <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> constitute &amp; confederate under
one Reformed Government, according to the Rule of
Christ: providing they hold, not only all the former Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41139:119"/>
under the foresaid considerations, but the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Testimony as stated in the Ecclesiastical Constitutions,
and sworn to in the National Covenants &amp; Engagements
of that Church, founded upon the Word of God, against
Poperie, Prelacy, Erastianisme, Sectarianisme, Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
Schisme &amp; Defection; thô differing in some things
from us, never Reformed, never considered in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Judicatories, never engaged against in our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
never Stated as the Word of patience and Matter
of Testimony. But with those that oppose, suppress, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
and abandon this Testimony, we cannot oune
this Organical Communion, in this broken State of the
Church. We may have yet a stricter <hi>Congregational</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
upon stricter conditions, in and with the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
or extraordinary Meetings or Societies of the Lords
people for Gospel Ordinances, with any Minister or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
duely &amp; truely admitted to that function, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Christs Appointment, and the Call of the people,
whether in a fixed or unfixed relation: provicing he holds
the Testimony of Christ, under all the former considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and ounes and adheres unto the true received prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in Doctrine, Worship,
Discipline, &amp; Government, founded upon the written
Word of God, and whatsoever Declarations or Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
former or latter, particular or more General, are
aggreable thereunto; thô differing from us in some of the
Integral &amp; not Essential parts of our Testimony, against
the Enemies of our Covenanted Reformation. But with
such as deny or decline from it, by Schisme or Defection,
or Complyance with the enemies thereof, we cannot
oune this Congregational Communion, in this broken
State of the Church.</p>
               <p>III. Thô there be many things in a Church, to brangle
&amp; lessen the <hi>Comfort</hi> of our Communion with it and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie
thereof; yet we may keep fellowship with a true
Church, thô in many things faultie and <hi>Corrupt,</hi> as all
Churches are in some measure in this Militant State. As
the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had many corruptions in their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
yet no separation is enjoyned from it. And the Lord
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41139:119"/>
did not require separation from the Churches of <hi>Perga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
&amp; <hi>Thyatira,</hi> though they had many corruptions &amp; deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in Discipline, in a Toleration of Hereticks; and would
lay no other burden upon them, but to hold fast what they
had: as <hi>Mr Durham</hi> shewes in his <hi>Comment.</hi> on the <hi>Revel.
chap. 2. Lect. 6. Pag.</hi> 148, 149. as also <hi>Chap. 18. Lect. 1. Pag.
585. in</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">to.</hi> This must be granted especially in these cases. 1.
In the <hi>infant</hi> State of the Church, when the Reformation
is only begun: then many things may be tolerated, before
they be gradually Reformed, which in an <hi>adult</hi> State are
not to be suffered. 2. In a <hi>growing</hi> case of the Church,
advancing out of corruptions: then many things may be
born with, while they are ascending &amp; wrestling up the hill,
which in a <hi>Declining</hi> State; when the Church is going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
must not be yeelded unto. See that Objection of
hearing Prelatical men in the time of former Prelacy, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
above, <hi>Peri. 4. Pag.</hi> 54. 3. In a <hi>Constitute</hi> and settled
case of the Church, enjoying her Priviledges &amp; Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
corruptions may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oreborn, and the offended are
not to withdraw, before recourse to the Judicatories for
an orderly redress: But in a <hi>broken</hi> &amp; disturbed State, when
there is no access to these Courts of Christ; then people,
thô they must not usurp a power of Judicial Censuring these
corruptions, yet they may claim &amp; exercise a <hi>discretive</hi>
power over their oun practice; and by their withdrawing
from such Ministers as are guilty of them, signify their sense
of the moral equity of these censures that have been legally
enacted against these &amp; the equivalent corruptions, and
when they should be legally inflicted. As we do upon this
Ground withdraw from the Prelatick <hi>Curats,</hi> and likewise
from some of our Covenanted Brethren, upon the account
of their being chargable with such corruptions &amp; defections
from our Reformation, as we cannot but shew our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of. This the Reverend Author of <hi>Rectius instruendum</hi>
justifies <hi>Confut. 3. Dial. Chap. 1. Pag.</hi> 8. where he is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
what separation is not sinful; and gives this for one,
<hi>if we separate in that, which a National Church hath commanded
us as her Members to disoune, by her standing Acts &amp; Authority,
while those from whom we separate oune that Corruption.</hi> Which
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41139:120"/>
holds true of the <hi>Curats,</hi> &amp; <hi>Indulged,</hi> and <hi>Addressers,</hi> and
all that we withdraw from. However it be, certainly
those are to be withdrawn from, with whom we cannot
communicate without submitting to the Lawes establishing
them, and taking on that Test &amp; badge of our incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with them, and partaking of their sin, &amp; in hazard of
their judgment.</p>
               <p>IV. Thô in some cases, as we are warranted, so are
necessitated to <hi>withdraw:</hi> yet neither do we allow it upon
slight or slender grounds, nor can any tender soul be forced
to discountenance the Ministers of Christ (I do not speak
here of the Prelatick Curats) without great reluctancy and
grief of heart, even when the grounds of it are solid &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
and the necessity unavoidable. Therefore we reject
these as insufficient Grounds, besides what are given al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
1. We cannot withdraw from a Minister, for his
<hi>Infirmities</hi> or weaknesses, Natural, spiritual or Moral. 2.
Neither for <hi>Pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nal faults</hi> &amp; escapes: We expect a faithful,
but not a sinless Ministrie. 3. Nor for every defect in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
through <hi>Ignorance,</hi> want of courage, Misinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or being byassed with affection for particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
We do not hold, that faults in Members, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in Ministers, do pollute the Oordinances, and so
necessitate a Separation; but aggree with what <hi>Mr Durham</hi>
sayes on <hi>Revel. chap. 2. Lect. 6. Pag. 147. in</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">to.</hi> Sincerity
discovered, will cover many faults. 4. Nor for every
discoverie of <hi>Hypocrisie;</hi> thô we may have gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a Mans principle &amp; Motive be not right, yet if he be
following duty unblameably, and have a Lawfull Call,
What then! <hi>notwithstanding every way, whether in Pretence
or in Truth, Christ is Preached, therein me may rejoyce Philip.</hi> 1.
18. 5. Nor yet for real <hi>Scandals,</hi> not attended with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy,
if Ministers will take reproof &amp; admonition, and
at least by <hi>Doctrinal</hi> Confessing and practicall for saking them
satisfie the offended. 6. Yea thô his Scandals be so <hi>gross,</hi>
that we must <hi>discountenance</hi> him, when he persis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s in them:
yet that is not a disouning of his Ministrie `or a rejecting
his Commission, but a discountenancing for his <hi>disorders,</hi>
until they be removed. But the <hi>Apologet. Rela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41139:120"/>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 290, 291. sayes (1) there may be Ministerial cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
<q>that cut the very throat of the Office, and
make one no Officer—and it is past questioning, such
may be shunned, without all hazard of Separation (2)
when personal faults are very gross &amp; palpable, open &amp;
avowed, such may be shuned without any hazard of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;
because the mans being an Officer <hi>coram Deo</hi>
is much to be questioned, and there is great probability
that <hi>ipso facto</hi> he had forefaulted the same, thô such should
be the corruption in a Church, that notwithstanding of
all this he may be maintained. (3) Separation is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
thing, and not hearing such or such a man is a far other
thing: there may be many just grounds of exception
against a particular person, why people may refuse to
countenance him, without any hazard of separation, or
joining with separatists in their principles: Separation
is one thing, and refusing to attend the Ministrie of such
a man is another thing; for a man may joine with Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
in another congregation, and so testify that he
hath no prejudice at the Ministrie, but only against such
a man in particular.</q> Whence it is an ignorant as wel as
malicious calumnie, to say, that our withdrawing from
the <hi>Curats,</hi> and also from some Ministers, whom other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we respect &amp; reverence as Godly Ministers, for their
offensive defections, is a disouning al the Ministrie of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Whereas, we do profess indeed a disouning of the
Curats Ministrie, but for our Reverend Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
thô we do discountenance many of them with sad
hearts, for their not keeping the Word of the Lords pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
in this hour of tentation, nor adhering to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
&amp; constitutions of the Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Yet this is
not a disouning of their Ministrie, but a Refusing to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
them in their present administrations, in this disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
State, till these offences be removed.</p>
               <p>V. As to disoune the <hi>Ministrie,</hi> were hateful <hi>Sectaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme;</hi>
so to dissolve or break off Communion with a true
Church, whereof we are Members, were an unnatural
<hi>Schisme,</hi> which is horrid sin. But because among all the
various Sufferings, wherewith the poor tossed, &amp; racked
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41139:121"/>
Remnant now Persecuted have been exercised, this hath
not been the lightest; that they have been on all hands stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized
as Schismaticks &amp; Separatists, not only because
they have maintained a resolved withdrawing from the
<hi>Curats,</hi> but also have discountenanced many <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
Ministers, with whom they have been offended for their
declining Courses, and Complyances with the Times
Corruptions, and forsaking in a great measure the duty
of this day: I shall distinguish some cases of <hi>Separation,</hi> out
of the Writings of our approven Authors, which will
j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tify all their withdrawings. 1. <hi>Mr Durham</hi> distinguishes
these three; <hi>Schisme,</hi> separating from the Unity &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of a true Church, consisting not alway in diversity
of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but in divided <hi>Practices,</hi> according to that of
<hi>Augustine, Schismaticos facit not diversa fides, sed disrupta
communionis Societas:</hi> Then <hi>separation,</hi> either in whole from
a Church as no Church, or in part in some things wherein
they cannot communicate with that corrupt Church, which
is Lawful if it exceed not its ground: Then lastly, <hi>Secession,</hi>
a local removing to a better Church. The first of these can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be imputed to the Persecuted <hi>Wanderers:</hi> for they sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from no true Church, whereof they were Members,
but these from whom they separate, will be found to be
the Schismaticks. 2. The second of these, to wit, <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
is either <hi>Positive</hi> &amp; <hi>Active,</hi> or <hi>Negative</hi> &amp; <hi>Passive.</hi>
The first is, when a party not only leaves Communion
with a Church, whereunto they were formerly joyned,
but also gathers up new distinct Churches, different from
the former, under another Government &amp; Ministrie &amp;
Ordinances, disouning those they left. The latter is, when
the faithful Remnant of a declining Church, standing still
&amp; refusing to concur with the backsliding part of the same
Church, after they have become obstinate in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
holds clossly by, &amp; adheres unto the Reformation
attained. This Famous <hi>Mr Rutherfoord</hi> in his <hi>due Right of
Presbytries pag.</hi> 253. 254. sheweth to be Lawful, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it a <hi>Non-Union,</hi> as that in <hi>Augustines</hi> time, when the
Faithf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l did separate from the <hi>Donatists,</hi> which is Lawful
&amp; laudable. 3. <hi>Mr Rutherfoord</hi> there proceeds to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:41139:121"/>
                  <q>between a separation from the Church in her
<hi>worst</hi> &amp; <hi>most</hi> part, and a separation from the <hi>best</hi> &amp; <hi>least</hi>
part: and these who separate from the worst &amp; greatest
part, do notwithstanding retain a part of, and a part in
the Visible Church, because they do not separate from
the Church according to the least &amp; best part therof; as
the Godly in <hi>England</hi> who refused the Popish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
&amp; Antichristian Bishops. Hence it will follow, that
though now People should withdraw from Communion
with the greatest part of the Church, which is now
Corrupted, they cannot be counted Separatists because,
they hold still Communion with the better thô lesser
part. Moreover he saith <hi>Pag.</hi> 254. 255. That there may
be Causes of <hi>Non-Union</hi> with a Church, which are not
sufficient causes of separation. Lastly he tells us <hi>ibid. Pag.</hi>
258. When the Greatest part of a Church makes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
from the Truth, the lesser part remaining sound,
the Greast part is the Church of separatists; thô the
manyest &amp; greatest part in the actual exercise of Discipline
be the Church, yet in the case of right Discipline the best
thô fewest is the Church. For Truth is like life, that
retireth from the manyest Members unto the heart, and
there remaineth in its fountain in case of dangers. So that
it is the major part which hath made defection, that are
to be accounted <hi>Separatists,</hi> and not such who stand to
their principles, thô they cannot comply or joyne with
the corrupt Majoritie.</q> Thus the <hi>Apol. Relat.</hi> rehearsed
his words <hi>Sect. 14. pag.</hi> 292. 293. 4. There may be a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
withdrawing, where the Ordinances &amp; Ministrie are
not cast at, as the <hi>Apol, Rel.</hi> saith. <hi>ibid.</hi> 291. So then, <q>so
long as people do not cast at the Ordinances, but are
willing to run many miles to enjoy them: nor cast at
the Church as no Church (thô they sadly fear, that God
shall be provoked by this dreadful defection, which is
carried on by these men &amp; their favourers, to give her a
Bill of divorce) nor at the Ministrie, for they love those
that stand to their Principles dearly, and are most willing
to hear them either in publick or private. 5. It is granted
by all that write against Separatists, that separation from
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:41139:122"/>
a Church is Lawful, when the case so falleth out, that
union cannot be kept up with her without sin, <bibl>

Separation is not <hi>Schisme,</hi> even from the Church which
hath essentials, yea and more than essentials: If it be
from those (thô never so many) who are drawing back
from whatever piece of duty &amp; integrity is attained; for
this is still to be held fast, according to many Scripture
Commands. So <hi>Elias,</hi> when Gods Covenant was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken,
was as another <hi>Athanasius (I and I only am left)</hi>
in point of tenacious integrity. 7. Next he sayes, if we
separate in that which a National Church hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us as her Members to disoune, by her standing
Acts &amp; Authority, while those from whom we separate
oune that Corruption. 8. Likewise he there asserts, there
is a Lawful forbearance of Union &amp; Complyance with
notorious Backsliders, in that which is of it self sinful, or
inductive to it: which is far from <hi>Separation</hi> str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Commands of abstaining from all appearance of evil,
and hating the garment spotted with the flesh, do clearly
include this. 9. He addes, many things will warrant Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from such a particular Minister or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which will not warrant Separation from the Church
National; nor infer it, by <hi>Mr Durhams</hi> acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(<hi>on Scandal, pag.</hi> 129.) for if Scandals become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive,
he allowes to depart to another Congregation.
10. Lastly he sayes, There is a Commanded withdrawing
from Persons &amp; Societies even in Worship, the precepts
<hi>Rom. 16. 17. 2 Cor. 6. 17. Prov. 19. 27. Act.</hi> 2. 40. will

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> it being in part cleared by these Assertions,
what is our mind in this Controversie, I shall lay coun from
Scripture Oracles, all the Causes &amp; Cases justifying &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randing
withdrawing from any Ministers; with application
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41139:122"/>
of all of them to the <hi>Curats,</hi> and accommodation of some
of them to all that the <hi>Wanderers</hi> withdraw from: with
Arguments endeavouring to evince the Validity of them,
and evidencing they are not new Notions, but the same
Grounds which approven Authors have improved in this
Controversie. I shall omitt the ordinary Criticismes in
stating the Question, in distinguishing betuixt <hi>hearing</hi> &amp; <hi>joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
in Worship, and <hi>ouning</hi> them as our Ministers, and
<hi>submitting</hi> to them &amp;c. And only essay to prove this <hi>Thesis:
We cannot without sin oune Church Communion in Gospel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
with the Prelats or their Curats, as Our Ministers, but
must Withdraw from them, and any other guilty of the like Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
which we can make out against them.</hi> I shall not resume
what Confirmations this <hi>Thesis</hi> is strenthened with, from
the Testimonies or Church Constitutions of former <hi>Periods,</hi>
which are premitted in the foregoing discourse: Nor make
any repitition of the Circumstances of our present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
Represented above, which contributes to clear
it: but shortly come to the Arguments.</p>
               <p>I. It is necessary that we must acknowledge them <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Christs,</hi> and his Ambassadours cloathed with his
Commission, from whom we receive the ordinances of
the Gospel. For otherwise they must be looked upon as
<hi>Thieves, Robbers,</hi> Usurpers, and <hi>strangers</hi> whom Christs
sheep <hi>will not,</hi> nay must not <hi>hear, Iohn.</hi> 10. 1, 5. And <hi>how
shall they preach,</hi> or be heard, <hi>except they be sent, Rom.</hi> 10. 15.
for such whom we know may not Lawfully preach, we
cannot Lawfully hear. These from whom we may receive
the Misteries of God, we must account <hi>Ministers of Christ
1 Cor.</hi> 4. 1. and <hi>Ambassadours for Christ,</hi> standing in his
stead, beseeching us to be reconciled to God 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.
Hence such as we doubt to acknowledge Ministers of
Christ, cloathed with His Commission, them we cannot
hear without sin: But the Prelatical Curats are such as we
doubt to acknowledge Ministers of Christ, cloathed with
His commission: Therefore we cannot hear them. The
<hi>Minor</hi> only needs probation. These who neither have nor
can have the Qualifications of a Minister of Christ, nor the
Lawful call of a Minister of Christ, cannot be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41139:123"/>
with confidence to be Ministers of Christ cloathed
with His commission: But the Prelatical Curats are such:
<hi>Ergo.</hi>—First they neither have nor can have the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of Christs Ministers: Since few of them have the
personal, as Christians, far less the Ministerial as Officers,
mentioned 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2-4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 6-9. except it be to be
<hi>husbands of one wife,</hi> and if that do not make them Ministers,
they have nothing else: especially four are wanting in all of
them. (1) <hi>Blamelessness,</hi> and freedom from <hi>Scandal,</hi> even
such as affects the office (besides other gross disorders in
their life &amp; conversation, obvious to the view of onlookers
being men who have denyed the Faith, and therefore unfit
to have the priviledge of Church members in any well
Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erned Church) being in the experience of all that
know them signalized under the Characters of those that
run unsent, and from whom we are commanded to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw:
Causing the people to <hi>erre</hi> by their <hi>lies</hi> and by their
<hi>lightness,</hi> not <hi>sent of</hi> God <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. making the heart of the
righteous sad, and strengthening the hands of the wicked
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 22. See also <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34 2, 3. Such as we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to <hi>beware of Math.</hi> 7. 15, 16. Such as we must <hi>mark
&amp; avoid, Rom. 16. 17, 18. Phil. 3. 2. Disorderly walkers</hi>
from whom we must <hi>withdraw 2 Thess. 3. 6. Covenant-breakers</hi>
from whom we are commanded to <hi>turn away
2 Tim.</hi> 3. 3, 5. They are not then <hi>Blameless:</hi> and in shewing
how fitly these aggree unto the persons now spoken of,
time needs not be spent, such as know them can best Judge.
Hence, such as either are not fit to be Church members,
or have all the Characters of such Officers from whom we
are to withdraw, cannot be acknowledged capable of the
qualifications of the Ministers of Christ: But such are the
<hi>Curats: Ergo</hi>—(2) The qualification of <hi>Vigilancy</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be found with them: for all that know them will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that they neither do, nor can in Preaching the
word be <hi>instant in season &amp; out of season,</hi> so as to make <hi>full
proof of their Ministrie 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 1-5. Nay they can give
no proof of their Ministrie at all, further than may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
to <hi>dumb Dogs that cannot bark, Isa.</hi> 56. 10, 11. for
they nor no man can say, that the <hi>diseased they have strenght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:41139:123"/>
or <hi>healed that which was sick</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 4. And it is
known to all that know them, that if ever there were any
that assumed to themselves the name of <hi>Levites,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
out of the way, and caused many to stumble at the
Law, and corrupted the Covenant of <hi>Levi,</hi> and therefore
were deservedly contemptible &amp; base before all the people
(<hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 8, 9.) they are the men. Let any man judge then,
whether they have the qualifications of the <hi>Messengers of the
Lord of hosts.</hi> Hence, they that can give no proof of their
Ministry, but that which proves them to be such whom
the Lord condemns, &amp; such who deserve to be contemned
of all, cannot be acknowledged to be qualified as the Lords
Ministers: But the Prelatick <hi>Curats</hi> can give no proof of their
Ministry &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi>—(3) The qualification of <hi>Aptness to
teach</hi> is wanting, yea incompatible with them, not only such
of them as are noted for ignorance, of whom clearly that
is verified, they are <hi>blind watchmen,</hi> they are all <hi>ignorant (Isa.</hi>
56. 10.) but even their Greatest Clerks &amp; <hi>Rabbies</hi> may fitly
be called after the name of their forefathers, whom Christ
calls <hi>blind Leaders of the blind,</hi> concerning whom he gives
a Command to <hi>let them alone Math.</hi> 15. 14. Either generally
they are discovered to be such Masters of <hi>Israel,</hi> as <hi>know
not these things Iohn.</hi> 3. 10. being men not exercised in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and have not Learned the Truth as it is in Jesus:
or they are such, as if they have had gifts or Grace, yet
now they are palpably blasted of God, and so cannot profit
the people at all, being such as do not <hi>stand in Gods Counsel,</hi>
for then they should have turned the people from their
evil way, and so they are not apt to teach others when they
are not taught of God, but steal his words every one from
their Neighbour, clearly discovering they are <hi>not sent</hi> of
Him <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 21, 22, 30, 32. And because they do not stand
in Gods Counsel, they cannot <hi>declare all the Counsel of God,
Act.</hi> 20. 27. For they can neither be apt to teach <hi>repentance</hi>
towards God, since they cannot be supposed to be sensible
of these sins to be repented of, for which the Land perisheth
&amp; is burnt up like a wilderness, <hi>Ier.</hi> 9. 12. for then they
would first repent themselves of their oun <hi>Conformity</hi> with
<hi>Prelacy,</hi> of their breach of Covenant &amp;c. All that they can
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41139:124"/>
do in such a subject is, to see <hi>vain &amp; foolish things,</hi> and not
to discover the <hi>Lands intiquity,</hi> but to see <hi>false</hi> burdens, &amp;
causes of banishment, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2. 14. Nor can they be apt to
teach <hi>faith,</hi> seing in many things they teach <hi>otherwise</hi> than
Christ hath taught us in his word, and <hi>consen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

words</hi> and to the Doctrine which is according to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyness
from such the Command is to <hi>withdraw,</hi> 1. Tim.
6. 3-5. whose Mouths must be stopped when they teach
things which they ought not, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9-11. which is
undenyable to all that know what sort of stuff they Preach,
contrary to the word of God, and the principles of our
Covenanted Reformation. Hence if none of them be apt to
teach, then none of them is fit to be heard; <q>But none of
them is apt to teach: <hi>Ergo</hi>—It is true private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

of Ministers, yet every private Christian h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </q> Secondly, They have
not the Lawful <hi>Call</hi> of a Minister of Christ, So much as an
<hi>External Call of</hi> his Institution: which I prove thus. They
that have <hi>Presentations</hi> from Patrons, &amp; <hi>Collations</hi> from
Prelats, and no more for a Call, have no Lawfull Call
at all: But the Curats have presentations from Patrons,
&amp; collations from Prelats, and no more for a Call: <hi>Ergo</hi>
they have no Lawful Call at all. <q>The <hi>Minor</hi> cannot be
doubted: for in this Government, the Ministers Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
Call, Ordination, and Relation to such a people
over whom he is to officiate, flowes all from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;
the Congregational Eldership hath not the least
interest in it: hence the Presbyterian way of Calling
Pastors was ranversed by the Parliament, when <hi>Prelacy</hi>
was set up, and the old custome of <hi>Patronages</hi> was resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

                  </q> The
<hi>Major</hi> proposition may be proven by parts. First, <hi>presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi>
from Patrons cannot give a Lawful Call: for besides
what other reasons might be given against this old relict of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41139:124"/>
                  <hi>Popish</hi> bondage of patronages; It destroyes that priviledge
&amp; Liberty of the Church in calling their oun Pastors, and
makes all Intruders, without the Churches choice; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the flock are allowed a Judgment of Discretion,
knowledge of, &amp; consent to the admission of their Pastors,
to whom they intrust their Souls Directions, before they
be subject &amp; obey him in the Lord, for otherwise he is
<hi>a stranger</hi> that hath not come in at the <hi>door,</hi> and they must
not, nor will not be imposed upon, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10. 1-5. They
had an Interest in choosing &amp; nominating even the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
though there were other Apostles of infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as to qualifications, present to ordain them: And
they appointed two to be <hi>chosen</hi> by Lots, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 23. and
even the <hi>Deacons</hi> were looked out &amp; <hi>chosen by</hi> the people,
and appointed over their business <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 3. Much less
ought Ministers, to be thrust upon such a weighty employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<q>to pleasure Great Men who are Patrons, since
in their faithfulness the people are infinitely more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
<bibl>
                        <hi>Rectius Instruen. ubi Supra.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                  </q> Hence, if the <hi>Curates</hi> have
no Call but what destroyes the Peoples Priviledge, they
have no Lawful Call at all, neither ought they to be ouned
or Countenanced as Called Ministers: But by the Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Patrons they have no Call, but what destroyes
the peoples Priviledge: <hi>Ergo</hi>—Next <hi>Collations</hi> from
Prelats cannot give a lawful Call: for (1) they cannot give
that to others which they have not themselves: But they
have not a Lawful Call themselves, because they are not
Lawful officers, as is clear, &amp; may be proven afterwards.
(2) The only way of Conveyance of an ordinary Call to
this office, is by the Act of a <hi>Presbytrie, Tim.</hi> 4. 14. And
by Ministers their ordaining Elders in every Church, with
the Consent of that Church: But a Prelats Collation is not
this Act of a Presbytrie. (3) That which only makes a
man a Prelats Depute, cannot give him a Call to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of Christ: But this Collation only makes a man a
Prelats Depute. Or thus, A Prelats Depute is no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
But a Curate is a Prelats Depute: <hi>Ergo</hi>—That a
Prelats Depute is no Minister, I Prove: not only from
that, that a Prelat <hi>qua talis</hi> is not a servant of Christ but an
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:41139:125"/>
enemy, and therefore cannot confer upon another that
Dignity to be Christs Servant; but from this, that the
Scripture allowes no Derivation of deputed Officers. If
no Officers of Christ can have Deputes of Christs Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
then the Deputes that they make cannot be Christs
Officers of His Institution: But no Officers of Christ can
have Deputes by Christs Institution: every man that hath
any piece of Stewardship in Gods family, must ever see &amp;
execute it immediatly by himself, &amp; <hi>wait upon it Rom.</hi> 12.
7, 8. That <hi>Curats</hi> are Prelats Deputes is clear: for they are
subject to them in order &amp; jurisdiction, and derive all their
Power from them, and are accountable to them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they cannot be acknowledged with confidence of
conscience to be Christs Ministers, because they have not
such a visible evidence of the Call of Christ, <q>as in reason
&amp; charity doth oblige all men to receive the person so
called, as truely sent: which things are so evident in
themselves, that whoever denyeth them, is obliged by
the same consequence to affirm, that if <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had
in his horrid wickednesse purchased the Apostleship by
money, the Christian world had been bound to receive
him as an Apostle, <bibl>

hear them.</p>
               <p>II. It is necessary also, that all whom we may lawfully
hear as Ministers &amp; Ambassadours of Christ, should not
only have had a commission from Christ, <hi>sometimes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to them in his orderly appointed way, by &amp; from
approven Church officers; but they must have it <hi>then when</hi>
we hear them, at this time when we oune Communion
with them. For if they have sometimes had it, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulted
it or changed it, by taking anew right another way,
it is all one in point of ouning them as if they had none at
all: and we must not medle with such <hi>changelings,</hi> in things
that they &amp; we must not come &amp; go upon <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 21.
Now plain it is that some <hi>Curats</hi> sometimes had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from Christ, when they were <hi>Presbyters;</hi> but
now they have changed their <hi>holding,</hi> and taken a <hi>new right</hi>
from them who are no Officers of Christ, invested with
power to confirm or Convey a Ministerial Mission, and
so they have forefaulted what they had <hi>Mr Durham,</hi> in a
digression on this subject of hearing, shewes that Ministers
may <hi>forefeit on Revel. chap. 1. pag. 55. in</hi> 4 <hi rend="sup">to.</hi> 
                  <q>In matter of
hearing (sayes he) it is not so hard to discern, who are
to be counted to speak without Gods commission; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
ordinarely such have no warrantable Call at all
(no not in the outward forme, and so cannot be counted
but to run unsent) or by <hi>palpable defection</hi> from the Truth,
and Commission given them in that Call, they have <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited</hi>
their commission: And so no more are to be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Ambassadours of Christ, or Watchmen of His flock,
than a Watchmen of the City is to be accounted an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server
thereof, when he hath publickly made defection
to the Enemy, and taken on with him.</q> Let the Indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41139:126"/>
and Addressing Ministers advert to this; And consider,
whether or not the truly tender have reason to discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
them, while they continue in their palpable defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
But undenyably this refells that Objection of the
Curats Ordination before they were Curats: For they that
change their holding of a right, and take a new right which
is null, they forego &amp; forefeit their old right, &amp; all right:
But the Prelatick Curats have changed their holding of their
right, and taken a new one which is null: Therefore they
have foregone &amp; forefeited their old one. The <hi>minor</hi> I
prove thus. They who had aright from Christ by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of His officers, and take a new grant for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of it, not from Christ, but by conveyance of such as
are none of His officers, they change their hold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng and take
a new one which is null: But the Prelatick Curats who had
a right by conveyance of His officers, have taken a new
grant for the exercise of it, not from Christ, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of the <hi>Prelat,</hi> which is none of His officers: <hi>Ergo</hi>
—The stress of all will ly in the Probation of this,
that the <hi>Prelat</hi> is none of Christs officers, and therefore the
conveyance of a power from him is not from Christ. Which
I prove. 1. Because His office is cross to the very <hi>nature</hi>
of Gospel Church-Government, and therefore he cannot
be a Gospel Church Ruler. Christ discharged His officers
to exercise <hi>Dominion</hi> (or <hi>Lordship Luk.</hi> 22. 25.) or <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
as the Gentils did, but that the Chiefest should be only
a Minister <hi>Math.</hi> 22. 25, 26. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> disclaims
<hi>Dominion</hi> over the Church, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. ult. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the
<hi>Elders</hi> not to be <hi>Lords</hi> over Gods Heritage 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. The
Authority of Church officers then is not a <hi>Desp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tick</hi> power,
but a Ministerial Stewardship. But the <hi>Diocesan Bishop</hi> is
both a <hi>Lordly</hi> Title &amp; Power, having all Authority in the
Diocess derived from him, as being as it were the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Pastor, and so taking upon him a power, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commanded, nor can be discharged. Hence, he that
subjects his His Ministrie to the Domination of a strange
Lord, inverting the Nature of Gospel Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
cannot be ouned in His Ministrie: But all <hi>Curats</hi>
subject their Ministry &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi>—2. Because he is an
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41139:126"/>
officer <hi>Distinct</hi> from &amp; <hi>superior</hi> to a <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Pastor;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Scripture makes a <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> all one. The
<hi>Elders</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> are called <hi>Episcopi</hi> or <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers
Act.</hi> 20. 17. 28. An <hi>ordainded Elder</hi> must be a <hi>blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Bishop,</hi> as the steward of God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5, 7. Again,
it cannot be shown where the Scripture mentions either
Name, qualification, work, Duty, or ordination of an
ordinary Church officer Superior to Presbyters, and which
are not likewise appropriat to them, who are called Rulers,
Governours, Bishops. In all the Holy Ghost His purposed
recitalls of ordinary Church Officers, there is not the least
hint of a <hi>Diocesan Bishop:</hi> and yet a <hi>Deacon</hi> is described, the
meanest officer, in His work &amp; qualifications. Hence
then, if this Diocesan Prelate be such an uncouth beast,
that neither in name nor Nature is found in the word of
God, all the power derived from him is null: But the first
is true: <hi>Ergo</hi>—3. Because every Officer in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
relates to the <hi>flock</hi> (except the extraordinary Officers,
who were further extended, now ceased) Bishops of
<hi>Ephesus</hi> were overseers over the <hi>flock Act.</hi> 20. the <hi>Elders</hi>
that <hi>Peter</hi> writes to were over the <hi>flock.</hi> But this Diocesan
Antiscriptural Monster, pretends to be over the <hi>Shepherds:</hi>
And invents new Degrees &amp; orders of Superiority &amp; infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority,
of officers of the same kind, beside &amp; against the
Scripture, which makes all Apostles alike, &amp; all Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
so all Teachers: though there be a Distinction &amp; Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
in diverse Kinds, yet not in the same. God hath
set some in the Church, <hi>first</hi> Apostles, <hi>Secondarly</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<hi>thirdly</hi> Teachers 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. but not among Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
some above others, in a power of order &amp; Jurisdiction.
Hence, an Officer over officers of the same kind is not
an Officer of Christs institution, And consequently any
power conveyed from his is null: But a Prelat pretends
to be an officer over Officers of the same kind: <hi>Ergo</hi>—4.
Because every officer in the Church hath equally, and in
perfect parity, equall power &amp; Authority allowed them
of God in the exercise of both the keyes, both of order &amp;
Jurisdiction: All ruling Elders may rule alike, and deserve
equal honour: And all Preaching Elders have the like Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:41139:127"/>
and the like <hi>honour</hi> conferred upon them 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.
17. The scripture attributes both power of Order &amp; Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to all Preaching Presbyters equally. They must
<hi>oversee</hi> the flock (or as the word is, <hi>do the part of a Bishop
over them) Act.</hi> 20. 28. and they must also <hi>feed the flock 1 Pet.</hi>
5. 2. Subjection &amp; obedience is one, to them all alike:
All that are over us and admonish us, we must <hi>esteem highly</hi>
for their works sake 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12. and <hi>obey</hi> &amp; <hi>submit our</hi> selves
to them that watch for our souls <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. we find also
<hi>excommunication</hi> belongs to all alike 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. and <hi>ordination
1 Tim.</hi> 4. 14. But the Diocesan <hi>Prelat</hi> takes from Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to himself power of ordination, assuming only his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats
for fashions sake, and the sole decisive power in
Church Judicatories, wherein he hath a Negative voice;
like a <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> the first Prelat who loved to have the
<hi>preeminence 3 Iohn.</hi> 9. the only precedent for <hi>Prelacy</hi> in the
Scripture. Hence, he that would take all power to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which is undivided &amp; equall to all officers by Christs
appointment, hath none by Christs allowance, but is to
be reckoned an usurping <hi>Diotrephes:</hi> But the Diocesan
Prelat would take all the power to himself, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
&amp; equall to all. By all which it appears, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
being no Authorized Church Officer of Christs, no
Authority can be derived from him; And so that such as
betake themselves to this pretended power for warranting
them in the function, can warrantably claim no deference
thereupon, nor can be ouned as Ministers whatever they
were before. <q>For this were an acknowledging of the power
&amp; Authority of Prelats (especially when the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
our hearing as a submitting to them.) The reason
is because these men came forth from the Prelat, having
no other call or warrant but what the Prelat giveth. And
so a receiving of them will be a receiving of the Prelate, as
a refusing of them will be accounted a slighting of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat
&amp; his power. <bibl>
                        <hi>Apol. Relat. 15. pag.</hi> 272.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>III. It is necessare also, that all with whom we oune
Communion as Ministers, should be Christs Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
having then when we hear them, and holding still
their Commission from Christ <hi>as King,</hi> and only Head of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41139:127"/>
His Church; conveyed not only from <hi>Church officers,</hi> in a
way that He hath revealed as the <hi>Prophet</hi> of His Church,
but in a way of Dependence upon &amp; subordination to Christ
as <hi>King,</hi> who ascending far above Principalities &amp; Powers,
appointed &amp; gave the <hi>Gifts</hi> of the Ministry <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. 11. and
<hi>set</hi> them in the Church 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. and gave them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to go &amp; teach the Nations, by virtue of that <hi>all
Power</hi> that was given to Him in Heaven &amp; Earth <hi>Math.</hi> 28.
18, 19. If then they take a new <hi>holding</hi> &amp; close with a
new <hi>Conveyance</hi> of the Ministrie, and of the Power to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
the same, from a new Architectonick usurped Power
in the Church, encroaching on Christs Royal <hi>prerogative,</hi>
we dare not Homologat such an affront to Christ, as to
give them the respect of His Ambassadours, when they
become the servants of men, and subject even in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
functions to another <hi>Head</hi> then Christ; for then they
are the Ministers of men, &amp; by men, and not by Jesus
Christ, and God the Father, who raised Him from the
dead, because they do not <hi>hold the Head, Col.</hi> 2. 19. Hence
those that receive &amp; derive their Church-Power from, and
are subordinate in its exercise to, another Head then Christ
Jesus, should not be received and subjected to as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Christ in His Church: But the <hi>Prelats</hi> &amp; their <hi>curats</hi>
do receive &amp; derive their Church Power from, &amp; are
subordinate in its exercise to, another Head then Christ:
Therefore they should not be received &amp;c. The first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
cannot be denyed. The Second is proved thus:
Those officers in the Church, Professing themselves such,
that derive their Church-Power from, &amp; are subordinate
in its exercise to, a Power truly Architectonick &amp; Supreme
in the Church (to wit the Magistrate) beside Christ; Do
derive their Power from &amp; are subordinate in its exercise
to another Head than Christ Jesus: But so it is that
Prelats &amp; their Curats do derive &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi>—The <hi>Major</hi> is
evident: for whosoever hath a Supreme Architectonick
Power in &amp; over the Church, must be a <hi>Head</hi> to the same,
and the fountain of all Church Power. The <hi>Minor</hi> is also
clear, from the foregoing Historical Deduction, manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Present Prelacy to be Gross <hi>Erastianisme:</hi> for the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41139:128"/>
disposal of the Government of the Church is declared by
Law to be the <hi>Croun right</hi> and an inherent perpetual Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
and thereupon the Bishops are restored to the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
function; And it is expressly Declared, that there is
no Church Power in the Church-office bearers, but what
depends upon &amp; is subordinate unto the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and
authorized by the Bishops, who are declared accountable
to the King for the Administration. By virtue of which
<hi>Ecclesiastick Supremacy,</hi> He put excomunication &amp; spiritual
Censures, &amp; consequently the Power of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> into
the hands of Persons meerly Civil, in the Act for the <hi>High
Commission.</hi> Hence it is clear, that as the fountain of all
Church Government, he imparts his Authority to such as
he pleases, and the Bishops are nothing else but his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
in the exercise of that Ecclesiastick power, which
is originally in Himself, and that the Curats are only His
under Clerks. All the stress will lie in proving, that this
Monster of a <hi>Supremacy,</hi> from which the Prelats &amp; their
Curats have all their Authority, is a Great Encroachment
on the Glory of Christ as <hi>King:</hi> which will appear if we
briefly consider these Particulars. 1. It usurps upon Christs
<hi>Prerogative,</hi> who only hath all undoubted right to this
Architectonick &amp; Magisterial Dominion over the Church,
His oun Mediatory Kingdom: not only an <hi>Essential</hi> right
by His Eternal <hi>Godhead,</hi> being the <hi>Everlasting Father,</hi> whose
goings forth hath been of old from Everlasting <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 6.
<hi>Mic.</hi> 5. 2. in recognizance of which, we oune but <hi>one
God</hi> the Father, and <hi>one Lord,</hi> by whom are all things &amp;
we by Him 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. But also a <hi>Covenant-right,</hi> by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact

Throne, by virtue of the Counsel of Peace between them
both <hi>Zech.</hi> 6. 13. A <hi>Donative</hi> right by the Fathers Delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by which He hath <hi>all power</hi> given in Heaven &amp; in

<hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 35. and <hi>all judgment</hi> &amp; <hi>Authority</hi> to execute it, even
because He is the <hi>Son of man, Iohn.</hi> 5. 22, 27. and to be

right, by the Fathers inaugaration, who hath set Him as

                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:41139:128"/>
that shall rule His people <hi>Israel Math.</hi> 2. 6. An <hi>Acquisite</hi>
right, by His oun <hi>purchase,</hi> by which He hath merited &amp;
obtained, not only subjects to Govern, but the Glory of
the Sole Soveraignty over them in that relation, A <hi>name
above every name Phil.</hi> 2. 9. which is, that He is the <hi>Head of the
Church,</hi> which is as much His Peculiar Prerogative, as to
be <hi>Saviour</hi> of the body <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 23. A <hi>Bellical</hi> right by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi>
making the people fall under Him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 4. and

being the <hi>first born</hi> higher then the Kings of the Earth, <hi>Psal.</hi>

He might have the <hi>preeminence, Col.</hi> 1. 18. An <hi>Elective</hi> right,

His <hi>Mother</hi> Crouned Him, in the day of His <hi>Espousals
Cant,</hi> 3. ult. By all which undoubted Titles, It is His Sole
incommunicable Prerogative, without a Copartner or
Competitor, Coordinate or subordinate, to be <hi>Iudge,</hi>
&amp; only <hi>Lawgiver</hi> &amp; King in Spirituals, <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 22. to be
that <hi>one Lawgiver, Iam.</hi> 4. 12. who only can give the power
of the <hi>keyes</hi> to His officers, (which Comprehends all the
power they have) <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 19. to be that <hi>one Master</hi> over
all Church officers, who are but <hi>brethren, Math.</hi> 23. 8, 10.
in whose <hi>Name</hi> only they must perform all Church Acts,
and all Parts of their Ministry, and not in the Name of any
Mortal, <hi>Math. 28. 18. 19. Math.</hi> 18. 20. from whom only
they <hi>receive</hi> what ever they have to <hi>deliver</hi> to the Church
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. To be the only Instituter of His Officers,
who hath <hi>set</hi> them in the Church 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. and <hi>gave</hi>
them to the Church <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. whose <hi>Ambassadours</hi> only
they are 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. from whom they have <hi>authority</hi> for
edification of the Church 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 8. 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 10. in
whose <hi>Name</hi> only they are to assemble, and keep &amp; fence
their <hi>Courts,</hi> both the least, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 20. and the Greatest
<hi>Act.</hi> 15. But now all this is usurped by one who is not so
much as a Church member, let be a Church Officer, as
such: for the Magistrate is neither, as he is a Magistrate,
otherwise all Magistrats would be Church members.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:41139:129"/>
Hence they that have all their power from a meer usurper
on Christs Prerogative, who is neither member nor officer
of the Church, have none at all to be ouned or received as
His Lawful Ambassadours: But the Prelats &amp; their Curats
have all their power from a meer usurper on Christs Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
who is neither Member nor officer of the Church:
<hi>Ergo</hi>—2. It confounds the Mediatory Kingdom of
Christ with, &amp; subjects it to, the Kingly Government of
the world, removes the Seripture <hi>Land Marks</hi> &amp; Limits
between <hi>civil</hi> &amp; <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> Powers; in making the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the State to be Governours of the Church, and
denying all Church Government in the hands of Church
officers, Distinct from &amp; independent upon the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat:
which clearly derogats from the Glory of Christs
Mediatory Kingdom, which is altogether distinct from &amp;
not subordinate to the Government of the world, both in
the Old Testament &amp; in the New. For, they have distinct
<hi>fountains</hi> whence they flow: civil Government flowes
from God Creator, Church Government from Christ the
Lord Redeemer, Head &amp; King of His Church, whose
Kingdom is not of <hi>this world, Iohn.</hi> 18. 36. though for this
end He came into the world, that He should have a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
there, <hi>vers.</hi> 37. They have distinct <hi>Objects:</hi> civil
Government hath a civil object, the <hi>out ward</hi> man;
Church Government a Spiritual object, men considered
as <hi>Christians:</hi> In the Old Testament, the <hi>matters of the Lord</hi>
are clearly distinguished from the <hi>matters of the King 2 Chron.</hi>
19. ult. In the new Testament, there are matters of Church
Cognizance which do not at all belong to the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate;
as in the case of <hi>offence,</hi> they must tell the Church,
not the civil Magistrate <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 15. 20. In the case of
<hi>Excommunication,</hi> the Church is to act by virtue of the power
of our Lord Jesus Christ 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4, 5. not by the Magistrats
power; In the case of <hi>Absolution,</hi> the Church is to Iudge
what Punishment is sufficient, and what evidence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is sufficient to remove it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. 7. So in the
case of <hi>Tryal</hi> &amp; <hi>ordination</hi> of Ministers &amp;c. None of these
belong to the Magistrate. They have distinct <hi>Natures:</hi> The
civil is a Magisterial, the Ecclesiastick is a Minsterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41139:129"/>
the one is the power of the <hi>sword,</hi> the other of
the <hi>Keyes;</hi> The one put forth in Political Punishments,
the other in Ecclesiastick Censures: In the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Magistrats power was Coactive, by death,
banishment, Confiscation &amp;c. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 7. 26. The Church,
by puting out of the Synagogue, interdiction from Sacred
things &amp;c. In the New Testament, The Magistrats power
is described <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. to be that of the <hi>sword</hi> by punishment;
the power of the Church only <hi>in binding</hi> &amp; <hi>Loosing, Math.</hi>
16. 19. They have distinct <hi>Ends:</hi> the end of the one being
the good of the Common wealth, the other the Churches
Edification: In the Old Testament, the end of the civil
Government was one thing, and of the Church another, to
wit, to <hi>warn not to trespass against the Lord,</hi> in that forecited
2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 10. In the New Testament, the end of
Magistratical power is to be a <hi>terror to evil works,</hi> &amp; a praise
te the good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3. but the end of Church power is
<hi>Edification 1 Cor. 5. 5. 2 Cor. 10. 8. 2. Cor.</hi> 13. 10. They have
distinct <hi>Courts</hi> of officers: In the Old Testament, the
distinction of the civil &amp; Ecclesiastick <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> is known,
where there were distinct <hi>causes,</hi> &amp; Persons set over them
to judge them respectively 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. ult. In the New
Testament, we find officers given unto the Church 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 28. with no mention of the civil Magistrate at all, And
Church-Assemblies distinct from <hi>Parliaments</hi> or <hi>senats</hi> (yea
when the Magistrate was an Enemy) determining que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
that did not belong to the Magistrate at all <hi>Act.</hi> 15.
we have Rulers distinct from the Rulers of the Common
wealth 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12. whom we are to obey and submit our
selves as those who are accountable to Christ only, for to
whom else can they give account of souls? <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. we
have Rulers inferiour to Labourers in word &amp; doctrine,
not to be honoured so much as they: Sure these cannot be
civil Rulers 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. we have Rulers commended for
trying Impostors, which were not Magistrats, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2.
And others who are rebuked for suffering Hereticks <hi>ibid.
vers.</hi> 14, 15, 20. which supposes they had Authority to do
it; yet distinct from &amp; not depending on the Magistrate.
Besides from this confusion of the two Governments to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41139:130"/>
and making the Supreme Magistrate to be Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Governour of the Church, would follow many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities;
as that They who are not Church members
should be Church officers, even Heathen Magistrats; yea
women should be Church officers; and none should be
chosen for Magistrats, but such as have the qualifications
of Church officers. <hi>Sic Apol. Relat. Sect. 12. pag. 190. Rectius
Instruen. Confut. 1 Dial. chap. 6. pag.</hi> 50. Hence, they that
in deriving their Authority do confound the tuo Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
civil &amp; Ecclesiastick, and take it all from a meer
civil power, cannot be ouned as having any Authority of
Christs Institution: But the Prelats &amp; their Curats, in
deriving their Authority, do confound the tuo Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
civil &amp; Ecclesiastick and take it all from a meer civil
power. This same Argument equally militates against
hearing the <hi>Indulged</hi> Ministers who have taken a Licence
&amp; warrand from the Usurper of this Supremacy: because
it is highly injurious to Christs Headship; very contrary to
to Presbyterian Principles; clearly Homologatorie of the
Supremacy; plainly Prejudicial to the power of the
people; very much establishing <hi>Erastianisme;</hi> Sadly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
&amp; destructive to the good of the Church; wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our cause &amp; ground of suffering; Strengthening the
Prelats hands; contradictory to our Covenants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prejudging
the Meetings of Gods people; and heinously Scandalous
&amp; offensive: As is clear by, &amp; unanswerably poven in the
<hi>History of the Indulgence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. There is a necessity that any man whom we may
Joine with as a Minister, must not only be a minister, and
a Minister cloathed with Christs commission <hi>then</hi> when
we Joins with Him, but He must also have a right to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
<hi>there where</hi> we Ioin with Him. Else we can look
upon him no otherwise than a thief &amp; a robber. whom
Christs sheep should not <hi>hear Io.</hi> 10. 1-5. Now the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats
&amp; Curats, though they should he accounted &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
Ministers, yet they have not <hi>a right</hi> to officiate
where they have intruded themselves. Hence we have
several Arguments, as. 1. They who have no just Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
nor right to officiate fixedly in this Church as the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41139:130"/>
proper Pastors of it, ought not to be Received but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen
from: But the Prelats &amp; their Curats have no just
Authority, or right to officiate in this Church as her proper
Pastors: Therefore they ought not to be received, but
withdrawen from. All the debate is about the <hi>Minor,</hi> which
may thus be made good. They who have entered into &amp;
do officiate fixedly in this Church, without her Authority
&amp; Consent, have no right so to do: But the Prelats &amp;
their Curats have entered into &amp; officiate fixedly in this
Church, without her Authority &amp; Consent: <hi>Ergo</hi>—
The <hi>Major</hi> is manifest: for if this Church have a just right
&amp; power of Electing &amp; Calling of Ministers, then they
who enter into &amp; officiate fixedly in this Church, without
her Authority &amp; Consent, have no just Authority or right
so to do: But this Church hath a just right &amp; power of
Electing &amp; Calling of Ministers, as all true Churches have
And, if it were not evident from what is said above, might
be easily demonstrated from Scripture. The <hi>minor,</hi> to wit,
that the Prelats &amp; their Curats have entered into &amp; officiate
fixedly in this Church, without her Authority &amp; consent,
is evident, from matter of fact: for there was no Church
Judicatory called or convocated, for bringing of Prelats
in to this Church; but on the contrary her Judicatories
were all cashiered &amp; discharged, and all her officers turned
out to let them in; And all was done immediatly by the
King &amp; Acts of Parliament without the Church; A practice
wanting a Precedent in this and (for any thing we know)
in all other Churches: All that the Curats can say is, that
they came in by the Bishop &amp; <hi>Patron,</hi> who are not the
Church, nor have any power from her for what they do;
all their right &amp; power is founded upon &amp; derived from
the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> whereby the Diocesan Erastian Prelat is
made the Kings Delegate &amp; substitute, only impowered
thereto by his Law. This is <hi>Mr Smiths</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> &amp; 6 <hi>Argum.</hi> 
                  <q>If
we suppose a particular Congregation acknowledging
their oun Lawful Pastor, and a few violent Persons arise
and bring in a Minister by plain force, and cast out their
Lawful Pastor; Are not the faithful in that Church obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to relinquish the Intruder, and not only Discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

him, but endeavour his ejection? This is our
case <bibl>
                        <hi>Napth. Pag.</hi> 106. § 5. <hi>Prior Edit.</hi> 2.</bibl>
                  </q> If we cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to these Curats, without consenting to the great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
made upon the Priviledges of this Church,
then we cannot submit to them without sin: But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
submit to them without consenting to the great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
made upon the Priviledges of this Church:
Therefore we cannot submit to them without sin. The
<hi>Minor</hi> is all the question: but instances will make it out.
As first, The robbing of the Church of the Priviledge of
<hi>Election</hi> of her Pastors, and substituting the bondage of
<hi>Patrons presentations,</hi> is a great Encroachment upon the
Priviledge of this Church: But accepting of Curats as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
Lawfully called, notwithstanding that they want
the Election of the people, and have nothing for their
warrant but a presentation from the Patron, were a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to that Robberie and wicked Substitution. It will
be of no force to say, our forefathers did submit to this,
and to a Ministry who had no other Call. This is answered
above in the <hi>Narrative:</hi> Its a poor Consequence to say, the
posterity may return backward, because their forefathers
could not advance further forward. Secondly, the thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of Lawfull Ministers without any Cause but their
adhering to the Covenanted work of Reformation, and
the thrusting in others in their rooms who denyed the same,
is a great Encroachment on the Churches Priviledges; But
embracing &amp; encouraging Curats by countenancing their
pretended Ministry were a consenting to this violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion
&amp; intrusion. The <hi>minor</hi> is proven thus. They who
leave the extruded &amp; countenance the Intruded, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the extrusion &amp; intrusion, and declare they confess
the Intruded his right is better than his who is extruded;
But they who embrace &amp; encourage Curats by counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing
their pretended Ministry, do leave the extruded,
to wit, their old Ministers, and countenance the intruded:
<hi>Ergo</hi>—To say, that people in this case should protest
against these Encroachments, is frivolous; for withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is the best protestation: And if after their protestation
they still countenance the Encroachment, they should
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:41139:131"/>
undo their oun protestation. The same Argument will
militate against countenancing the <hi>Indulged,</hi> or any that
obtained Authority to Preach in any place by a power en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching
on the Churches Liberties. There is an <hi>objection</hi>
to be removed here, from <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 2, 3. The <hi>Scribes &amp;
Pharisees sit in Moses Chair,</hi> therefore whatever they bid yow
observe, <hi>that observe &amp; do;</hi> therefore they who without a
title usurpe the office may be heard. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The case is no
wayes alike; for then the Lord had no other Church in the
world but that, which was confined in its Solemnities of
worship to that place, where they intruded themselves:
He had not yet instituted the New Testament forme of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
in its ordinances &amp; Officers. Therefore the
Head of the Church being present might give a Toleration,
<hi>Durante beneplacito:</hi> But it is not so now. But 2. Our Lords
words bears no command for the people to <hi>hear</hi> them at all,
but only not to reject sound Doctrine, because it came
from them: Surely he would not bid them hear such, as
He calls Plants that His Father had never planted, whom
He bids <hi>let alone, Math.</hi> 15. 13, 14. and who were <hi>Thieves</hi>
&amp; <hi>Robbers</hi> whom His Sheep should <hi>not hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. They must not only be Ministers, &amp; acknowledged as
such <hi>then</hi> and <hi>there, when</hi> &amp; <hi>where</hi> we joine with them;
but they must be such as we can oune Church Communion
with in the Ordinances administrated by them, as to the
<hi>matter</hi> of them. Otherwise if they <hi>pervert</hi> &amp; corrupt their
Ministrie, by preaching &amp; maintaining <hi>errors,</hi> either in
Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, or Government, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare
to the Scriptures, our Confessions, &amp; principles of
our Covenanted Reformation, and contradictory to our
Testimony founded thereupon &amp; aggreable thereunto,
maintaining errors condemned thereby, or condemning
Truths maintained thereby, we must withdraw from them.
For if any seek to turn us away from the Lord our God,
we most put away that evil &amp; not consent nor <hi>hearken</hi> to
them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 5, 8. We must <hi>cease to hear</hi> the instruction
that <hi>causeth to erre</hi> from the words of knowledge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.
27. we must have a care of these Leaders that will <hi>cause us
to erre</hi> lest we be <hi>destroyed</hi> with them <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 16. we must <hi>mark</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:41139:132"/>
these who contradict the Doctrine that we have Learned,
&amp; <hi>avoid</hi> them <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. If any man teach otherwise we
must <hi>withdraw</hi> our selves from such 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3, 5. If there
come any &amp; bring not this Doctrine, we must not <hi>receive
him, nor bid him God speed,</hi> in that work of his preaching or
practising against any of the Truths, we have received
from the word 2 <hi>Iohn</hi> 10, 11. Hence we most not hear
false Teachers, who in preaching &amp; prayer bring forth
false Doctrine contrary to the principles of our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But the Curats are false Teachers, who in preaching
&amp; prayer bring forth salse Doctrine &amp;c. Therefore we must
not hear them. The <hi>Minor</hi> is certain, in that not only many
of them are tainted with points of <hi>Poperie</hi> &amp; <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inianisme;</hi>
but all of them do teach false Doctrine tending to seduce
the hearers; when in their preaching they cry up the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse
of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and vent bitter invectives against <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>
Government, condemn the work of Reformation,
and enveigh against the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and so teach &amp; encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
people to follow them in open perjurie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
all our Testimony, as nothing but Treason &amp; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
which we are perswaded is Truth, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are Blasphemers: And in their prayers, stuffed
with error &amp; larded with Blasphemy, they reproach the
work of Reformation, &amp; the power of Godlyness, and
pray for a blessing on the <hi>Prelats,</hi> and on their courses
which are cursed; besides their parasitick prayers for the
King, to be blessed in his Government when stated in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to Christ, and severall other things that tender
consciences cannot go along with them therein. And yet
if they hear them they must go along and actively concur
with them, as their mouth to God. If it be <hi>obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cted</hi> here:
That this doth not strike against all, nor against any at all
times, because some Preaches always sound Doctrine,
and all preach sometime sound Doctrine; and the like may
be said of their prayers: Therefore sometimes at least they
may be heard. I <hi>ans.</hi> 1. This may be alledged for all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
who do all at sometimes preach sound Doctrine,
and yet these Scriptures are stringent against them at all
times, which I have adduced: for by these fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>its which
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:41139:132"/>
they bring forth at sometimes, they shew themselves to
be such as we must beware of at all times. 2. We cannot
know when they will Preach sound Doctrine, seeing by
their subjection to that Government, they are obliged
to maintain Prelacy, and impugne our Covenanted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
               <p>VI. They must not only be such as we can Joine with in
the Ordinances as to the <hi>Matter</hi> of them, but in the <hi>manner</hi>
also they must be such Administrators, as we are obliged in
charity to think the Lord will approve of them, &amp; their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations,
&amp; of us in our Communion with them; Or at
least that in their manner of Dispensing ordinances, they
be not such as we find are under a recorded sentance of
dreadful punishment, both against them &amp; their partakers:
for if it be so, it is as sufficient a ground to withdraw from
them, as for men to withdraw from a Company staying
in a house, that they see will fall &amp; smother them in its
ruin; yea it is as warrantable to separate from them, as
for <hi>Israel</hi> to separate themselves from the Congregation of
the Rebells who were to be <hi>consumed</hi> in a moment, <hi>Numb.</hi>
16. 21. or for the Lords people to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that
they <hi>receive not of her plagues Rev.</hi> 18. 4. Now we find that
not only the Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> and Inticers to Idolatrie,
and Leaders to error upon the matter are threatened,
and the people for adhering to them but we find also (as
is observed by <hi>Rect. Instruend. confut. dial. chap. 1. pag.</hi> 21.)
many terrible charges &amp; Adjurations laid upon Ministers,
in reference to a faithful Diligence in their Ministerial fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and a suitable Testimony concerning the sin &amp; duty
of the time, that they are commanded to <hi>cry aloud</hi> and
shew the people their sin, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 1. and as they would not
have the <hi>blood of souls</hi> upon them, to give faithful <hi>warning</hi>
touching the peoples case &amp; hazard, sin, &amp; duty, especially
in times of great sin &amp; judgment, when God is terribly
pleading His Controversie with them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 17. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they must be <hi>instant in season &amp; out of season 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 2.
And for their negligence &amp; unfaithfulness herein, we find
many Scripture woes &amp; threatenings thundered against
them. When in the deceit of their oun heart they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41139:133"/>
assured <hi>Peace,</hi> when the Lord is pleading against a
Generation, they are threatened to be <hi>consumed</hi> with sword
&amp; famine, and the <hi>people to whom they Prophecie shall be cast out
in the Streets, Ier.</hi> 14. 13. 15. 16. therefore we dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to Prophecie to us. When they <hi>strengthen the hands</hi>
&amp; harden the hearts of evil-doers, that none doeth return
from his wickedness, the Lord threatens to <hi>feed them with
wormwood,</hi> &amp; commands not to <hi>hearken</hi> to them, <hi>Ier.</hi>
23. 14-16. their <hi>blood</hi> shall be required at their hands
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 18. one builds a wall, and another <hi>daubs</hi> it with
untempered morter, then <hi>ye o great hailstones shall fall,</hi> and
they shall be <hi>consumed</hi> in the midst thereof <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 10, 11,
14, 18, 22. we dare not joine with either builders or dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of such a work, as is carried on to the dishonour of
Christ &amp; ruining of Reformation, nor by our countenance
&amp; concurrence strengthen either builders or daubers. lest
we also be consumed in the midst thereof. When there is a
Conspiracy of the Prophets, and the Priests violate the
Law, and profane holy things, and shew no difference
between the unclean &amp; the clean then the Lord will <hi>pour
out His Indignation</hi> upon all, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 25—ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fin. We
would endeavour to keep our selves free of having any
hand in that Conspiracy. These Scriptures do give the
perfect pourtracture of our Curats, in the conviction of all
that know them. Hence we draw a complexe Argument:
Such Ministers as can do no good by their Ministrie, but
a great deal of hurt to their hearers, and expose themselves
&amp; them both to the Indignation of a jealous God, are not
to be heard: But the Curats are such as can do no good by
their Ministrie, but a great deal of hurt to their hearers,
and expose themselves and them both to the Indignation
of the jealous Lord: Therefore they are not to be heard.
The connexion of the <hi>Major</hi> is clear from what is said
above. The <hi>Minor</hi> is also evident from the application of
these Scriptures, thus: They that in the deceit of their oun
heart promise Peace to, and strengthen the hands of evil
doers, and give them not warning, but seduce them by
daubing their wickedness, and shew no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the unclean &amp; the clean &amp;c. are such as can do no
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:41139:133"/>
good by their Ministrie, but a great deal of hurt to hearers,
and expose themselves and them both to the Indignation
of God: But the Curats are such: and all others who are
so unfaithful as give no warning against but Justifie the sins
of the times. To be short, the <hi>Minor</hi> of both these fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Arguments is evident from the experience of all that
go to the Curats, who wrong thereby their oun souls, mar
their edification, &amp; run to Cisterns without water. What
blessing can be expected upon the labours of such, who
having perjured themselves in taking on with the Prelats,
are prosecuting that Course of defection, and making
themselves Captains to lead the people back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
profanity &amp; wickedness, being themselves Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns
&amp; Patrons of the times corruptions? And seeing a
blessing cannot be expected upon their labours, but rather
a curse, as daylie experience maketh good, when instead
of any work of conversion or conviction among people,
there is nothing seen but a fearful hardening in profanity
ignorance &amp; Atheisme; so that many that seemed to have
somewhat like Religion before, through hearing of them,
are turned loose &amp; laxe in all Duties: yea never can it be
instanced these 27 years, that they have brought one soul to
Christ, from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan
unto God; but many instances might be given of their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
souls, as indeed they can not be free of it, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
warn nor declare the whole Counsel of God. Hence
these who cannot but be soul-Murderers, may not be heard
nor intertained as Soul-Phisicians: But the Curats cannot
but be soul-Murderers: Again we can expect no good
from them, but a great deal of hurt: Seeing their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie
is not the Lords Ordrnance, which He will approve,
and no performances can be acceptable unto the Lord
which are not, in manner as well as in matter aggreeable
to His will: hence the wickedness even of the Lords Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Priests, not only caused the people to <hi>abhor</hi> the offerings
of the Lord, but even the Lord Himself to abhor His San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
and to account their incense an abomination, so
that He could not away with the Calling of their Assemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
which yet upon the matter were duties. Should
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:41139:134"/>
not we then hate that which the Lord hates, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from that which He hath forsaken? But the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Curats for Administration of Ordinances in their
way, the Lord hates, and hath signally forsaken: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we should hate &amp; forsake them. This is confirmed
by what <hi>Mr Durham</hi> sayes in that digression about hearing
<q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Revel. 1. pag. 55. in</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">to.</hi>
                     </bibl> seeing edification is Gods gift, can
it be expected but in his way, Or can that be accounted
His way which He hath not warranted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>VII. As we would not partake of their Judgment in
countenancing of their Administration of Ordinances, so
we would keep our selves free from all participation of
their <hi>sin.</hi> For we must not be <hi>partakers</hi> with any in <hi>sin,</hi> nor
have <hi>fellowship</hi> with the unfruitful works of darkness, that
we must <hi>reprove,</hi> and that we find the Lord reproves &amp;
condemns, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 7, 11. And not only Ministers in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining,
but people in hearing, may be in hazard of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of some mens sins</hi> who enter into the Ministry 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.
22. we must keep at the greatest distance from sin. Hence
if we cannot hear the Curats without partaking of their sin,
then we must not hear them: But we cannot hear the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats
without partaking of their sin. Therefore we must
not hear them. The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove. If hearing of them
be a <hi>Tessera</hi> of our Incorporation with them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Test of our
Submission to them, a badge of our comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yance with
them, and sign of our Approbation of them, then we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hear them without partaking of their sin: But hearing
of them is such: The <hi>Major</hi> cannot be denyed, if Prelacy
&amp; conformity therewith be sin, as is in part proven above:
for if these be sins, then we must not incorporate with,
nor submit to them, nor comply with them, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them. The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove by Parts. 1. Hearing
of Curats is a <hi>Tessera</hi> of our Incorporation with them. For
Communion in Sacred things doth infer an incorporation
of the Communicants or Joiners in all cases, both in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
&amp; unlawful Communions 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17-20. All
partakers of the bread are <hi>one body,</hi> and they which eat of
the Sacrificies are <hi>partakers of the Altar;</hi> And also they that
partake of the Sacrifice offered to <hi>Devils,</hi> though they do
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41139:134"/>
not offer it so themselves, yet they are incorporate and
have fellowship with Devils. And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14-17.
where they that do not <hi>come out,</hi> and are <hi>separate</hi> from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Communions, are expostulated with as making an
unequally yoked <hi>fellowship,</hi> between righteousness &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness,
light &amp; darkness; Christ &amp; <hi>Belial,</hi> the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God &amp; Idols. Hence then, if we cannot partake
of their Sacred things without partaking of their Altar,
and becoming one body with them; and making such an
unequally yoked Mixture with them, then we must be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate:
But the first is true from these places. This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
concludes with equal force, against joyning with
any deeply engaged in the gross defections of the time. 2.
Hearing of Curats is a <hi>Test</hi> of our <hi>Submission</hi> to them, &amp;
Complyance with them: for so it is required by Law, as
the Acts themselves say, <q>that a chearful concurrence,
countenance, &amp; assistence given to such Ministers, and
attending all the ordinary Meetings for divine worship,
is an evidence of a due ackowledgment of &amp; hearty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with his Maj. Government Ecclesiastical &amp; civil,
as now established by Law within this Kingdom, <bibl>
                        <hi>Act of
Parl. Iul.</hi> 10. 1663.</bibl>
                  </q> And themselves look on all such
as obey this Act, as their friends, Hence if this be sinful
to submit to them, and comply with their establishment,
in obedience to a sinful Act of Parliament, then it is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to hear them: But the former is true, as hath been
shown. <hi>Ergo</hi>—3. Hence it followes by native con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that hearing of Curats is a sign of our Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them: for he that gives that which is required, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
&amp; Interpreted as an evidence of a due acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp; of complyance with the Government Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
gives the sign of his Approbation of it: But the hearer
of Curats does that in obedience to the Act, requiring,
accepting, &amp; expressly interpreting it so: Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>VIII. As we would be free of their sin, in approving of,
&amp; complying with their course; so we must endeavour to
stand at the greatest Distance from <hi>all appearance</hi> of sin in our
selves, either by commission or omission, in which our
Joining with them in these circumstances would involve
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41139:135"/>
us. For we must astain from <hi>all appearance of evil 1 Thess.</hi> 5.
22. and from every thing that circumstances may make
sinful: for otherways suppose a thing might be materially
Lawful &amp; not simply sinful, yet circumstances may make
it sinful, and a countenancing it so circumstantiated, doth
infer a Communion in these Circumstances that make it
sinful. They that eat of the sacrifice are Partakers of the
Altar, and if the Altar be not of Gods Approbation, the
thing offered though otherwise Lawful to be eaten, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
justify the eaters, so circumstantiated. An Idol is
<hi>nothing,</hi> and that which is offered in Sacrifices to Idols is
<hi>nothing,</hi> yet they who eat of it, when they know it is so
circumstantiated, have <hi>fellowship with Devils 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 18,
19, 20, 21. And it is called <hi>Idolatry</hi> comp. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. which
provokes the Lord to jealousie <hi>vers.</hi> 22. Especially when
an action is so circumstantiated, that it would infer an
omission of our Duty, and a declining from or denying of
our Testimony, then it is clearly sinful. For whosoever
shall <hi>deny</hi> the Lord <hi>before men,</hi> him will He deny before His
Father, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 33. And we must <hi>hold fas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

3. 10, 11. <q>All Truth must be avowed, &amp; practically
avowed, on the greatest hazard: And as this Testimony
must be full, so must it be also constant. It was <hi>Demass</hi>

the Apostle, after great appearances for Christ:
And therefore whatever Truth or Duty is opposed, that
becomes the special object of this Testimony. <bibl>

Hearing of the Curats would infer &amp; involve us under the
guilt both of commission of sin, and omission os Duty, then
we cannot hear them without sin: But the former is true:
Therefore also the Latter. I prove the <hi>Minor</hi> by Parts. First,
that it would infer &amp; involve us under the guilt of <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion</hi>
of sin, All that is said above doth evince it: And besides,
palpable breach of Covenant, hereafter to be charged &amp;
cleared: And, <hi>Idolatrie</hi> is a great sin of that na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur: but the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:41139:135"/>
hearing of the Curats doth infer this. Which may be made
out, thus: The breach of the sceond Commandment is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie
(for to make the sins against that Command odious,
they are all commprehended under that odious name of
<hi>worshipping Images;</hi> as the sins against the seventh are called
<hi>Adultrie,</hi> comprehending all unchast thoughts, words,
&amp; actions) Hearing of Curats is a breach of the second
Command: <hi>Ergo</hi>—The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus: Every
worship not according to Christs appointment, is a breach
of the second Commandment: But hearing of Curats is
a worship not according to Christs appointment. Which
I prove thus: A worship enjoined by and performed in
obedience to a Law, establishing a humane Ordinance in
the Church, besides and against the Institution of Christ,
is a worship not according to Christs appointment: But
the hearing of Curats is a worship enjoined by and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in obedience to a Law establishing a humane Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
to wit, <hi>Diocesan Erastian</hi> Prelacy, with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats
their substitutes. Hence also the second doth follow
by necessary consequence, that it would infer &amp; involve us
under the guilt of <hi>Omission</hi> of Duty. For first, if reduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively
it may involve us under the guilt of Idolatrie &amp; breach
of the second Commandment, then it will infer the guilt of
omission of these necessary Duties incumbent to the Lords
people with a reference to Idolatry; to make <hi>no Covenant</hi>
with them nor with their Gods, nor <hi>let them dwell</hi> in the
Land lest they make us sin, <hi>Exod. 23. 32, 33 Exod.</hi> 34.

inspire all with an unanimous aversion against the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane

these plants which our heavenly Father never planted,

                  </q> The least Duty that can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
is that of the Apostles, <hi>flee from Idolatry 1 Co,.</hi> 10.
14. which Idolatry there mentioned to be avoided, is to
eat of the sacrifices offered to Idols: whence we infer that
if to eat of things consecrated to Idols be Idolatrie, then
also to partake of Sacred things consecrated by Idols must
be Idolatry; as the Curats dispensing of Ordinances is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated

                  </gap>ol of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan
Erastian Prelacy: But we see the Apostle expresses
the former: Therefore we may infer the Latter. Further
it will also infer a declining from &amp; denying a Necessary
<hi>Testimony,</hi> in the case circumstantiated. Even the smallest
matter is great, when a Testimony is concerned in it, were
it but the circumstance of an <hi>open window; Daniel</hi> durst not
omitt it upon the greatest hazard. And now this is clearly
come to a <hi>case of confession,</hi> 
                  <q>when there is no other way to
exoner our consciences befor God &amp; the world, and
declare our <hi>Non-conformity</hi> to this course of backsliding,
no getting of wrongs redrest or corruptions in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry

way we must give publick Testimony against these cours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,

whereby the difference shall be kept up betuixt such as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly

the corrupt Prelatical &amp; Malignant Enemies. but this
Argument also will infer the expediency of withdrawing,
from all Ministers with whom our circumstantiat Joyning
would involve us in a participation with their defections.</p>
               <p>IX. As we would endeavour to avoid Sin in our selves;
So we must have a care to give no <hi>occasion</hi> of <hi>others</hi> sinning,
by our taking Liberty in a promiscuous Joining in Church
Communion, whereby we may <hi>offend</hi> &amp; stumble the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:41139:136"/>
of others: for to that, in this as well as in other
things, we must have a special respect, and forbear things
not only for our oun unclearness, but for the sake of <hi>others</hi>
also. If therefore the Hearing of Curats be a <hi>Scandal,</hi> we
must refuse it, be the hazard what will. For who so shall
<hi>offend</hi> one of Christs little ones, it were better for him that
a milstone were hanged about his neck <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 6. No
man must put a <hi>stumbling block</hi> or an <hi>occasion</hi> to fall in his
brothers way, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 13. They that sin so against the
brethren, and wound their weak Conscience, they sin
against Christ 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. we must forbear somthings for
conscience sake, conscience, I say, <hi>not our oun</hi> but <hi>of
others,</hi> giving none offence neither to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> nor to
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor to the Church of God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 28, 29,
32. and so cut off all occasion from them that desire occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 12. <q>These Commands discharge whatever
Practice give occasion of our brothers sinning, of calling
Truth in question, of acting with a doubting conscience,
or which weakens his Plerophory or assurance; And
neither the Lawfulness nor indifferency of the thing it
self, nor mens Authority commanding it, nor the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
yea or wickedness of those in hazard to be stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
will warrand the doing of that out of which offence
arises, <hi>Rectius Instruend. Confut. 3. Dial. chap. 1. pag.</hi> 19.</q>
                  <hi>Mr Durham</hi> in that forecited place saith, <q>It carries offence
along with it; in reference to the partie who runs unsent,
it proves a strengthening &amp; confirming of him, and so a
partaking of his sin; in reference to others, either
strengthens them by that example to cast themselves in
that snare, which possibly may be their ruine, or it grieves
them and makes them sad who are tender of such things,
or gives occation to make all difference of that kind to be
thought light of.</q> Hence, If Hearing of the Curats be an
offence or Scandal, both in reference to Malignants, and
in reference to the Godly, and in reference to the Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Then it must be avoided: But the former is true: which
is evidenced by parts. First, in reference to <hi>Malignants,</hi>
it hardens &amp; encourages them in their opposition to the
work of God, and all backsliders &amp; Complyers with them
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:41139:137"/>
in their Apostasie; This strengthens their hands in their
wicked courses, when they see how they are countenanced
by all, and that there is no disrespect put upon them, nor
dissatisfaction evinced against their courses, then they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that they are approven of all: And this hardeneth
them, so that they never once think of the evil of their
wayes. Next in reference to the <hi>Godly,</hi> it stumbles the truly
tender, by encouraging them to do contrare to their light
&amp; conscience, even when they are not clear to hear them,
then they are emboldened thereunto when they see others
doing so; and so it tends to the wounding of their Peace,
and makes them halt in the wayes of the Lord. Lastly with
a re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erence to <hi>Posterity,</hi> it would prejudge them very much:
Though now the honest party be not in a capacity to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the work of Reformation unto their Posterity, in such
a manner as were to be wished; Yet they should do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for keeping fresh the memory of the good old cause,
by keeping up some footsteps of a standing Controversy for
<hi>Zions</hi> Interest against the common enemy: But now let all
Joine with, &amp; oune the Curats, what appearance of this
shall the Posterity see? shall not they conclude that the day
is lost, &amp; the cause is gone, when they see that this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath fled the fields, or rather sold &amp; betrayed the cause,
by ouning, countenancing, &amp; complying with the enemy,
and no standing Testimony against these corruptions?
whereas if there were but this much of a standing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
betwixt the People of God &amp; the common Enemies
of God, to be seen; Posterity shall in some measure be
kept from being deceived, and shall see the Interest of
Christ not killed nor buried quick, but living though in a
bleeding condition, and this will occasion their engaging
for Christ, and interesting themselves in the quarrel; and
it is far better to see the cause of Christ ouned though, by
suffering &amp; blood, then sold &amp; betrayed by base flenching
&amp; complying with Persecuters. This Argument may also
found &amp; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter a withdrawing from the <hi>Addressing</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
who to the Great Scandal of Presbyterians give forth
their Addresses in the name of all of that perswasion.</p>
               <p>X. Our duty to themselves, yea our greatest office of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:41139:137"/>
                  <hi>Love</hi> we owe to them in order to their conviction, does
oblige us to withdraw from them. This may seem a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
yet it will be apparent; if we search the Scriptures,
to see what we owe to Scandalous Brethren. There we
find, it is a duty to endeavour by all Lawful means to shame
them out of their sin: And it is an argument of <hi>hatred,</hi> when
we do not <hi>rebuke</hi> our Neighbour or when we suffer sin upon
him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17. If we consider them then as neighbours
&amp; friends, we must use endeavours to take away their sin
from them; if we consider them not as such but as enemies,
then we must avoid them, and not be mingled with them,
as I could adduce many Scriptures for that. But I suppose
all that will oppose my <hi>Thesis,</hi> would have them considered
as friends. Well then, if they be scandalous Brethren, this
is the way prescribed by the Apostle to deal with them, in
order not to suffer sin upon them, that we should <hi>withdraw</hi>
from them our Company: and if we must withdraw our
Company, then also <hi>a fortiore,</hi> we must deny them our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Communion; for that must either be included there,
or necessarly inferred. He writes, not to <hi>keep Company</hi> if
any man that is called <hi>a Brother</hi> (mark that speciality) be a
fornicator, or covetous, or an Idolater, or a railer, or
an extortioner, with such an one no not to eat 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11.
And I presume they that know them best, will grant,
that it would not be hard to prove that all the Curats in
<hi>Scotland</hi> were chargable with some of these, or at least
Partakers with them. And that if they were all impartially
impannelled, they would be rare ones whom an honest
Jury would not bring in guilty of this lybel. Then we are
expressly Commanded, in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to <hi>withdraw</hi> our selves from every <hi>brother</hi> that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>disorderly,</hi> and not after the received Tradiction; and
if any man obey not the word, to <hi>note</hi> him and have <hi>no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi>
with him, that he may be ashamed 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 6. 14.
Sure neither their office nor their innocency, can exempt
them from these rules. For either they must be considered
as our brethren, or not: If not, then we oune no Church
Communion with them, for that is only among brethren
that are so in Sympathie, &amp; affection, &amp; affinity, having
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:41139:138"/>
one father, and one mother: If they be brethren, Then
all Scandalous brethren are to be withdrawn from; But
they are Scandalous brethren: Therefore they are to be
withdrawn from. The <hi>Minor</hi> will not be doubted by any
but such as are strangers to them, who both in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
&amp; Personal Capacity are so scandalous to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of all, that Profanness hath gone forth from them
unto all the Land, and they as much as ever the Profane
Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> have made men to <hi>abhor</hi> the offering of the Lord
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 17. But even strangers that are unacquaint with
their Personal Profligatness &amp; ignorance &amp;c. cannot be
altogither ignorant of the <hi>Scandal</hi> of <hi>Prelacy</hi> &amp; <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>astianisme,</hi>
in which they are all involved, of the Scandal of Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
Perjurie, &amp; breach of Covenant, which is their
brand, and the Nations bane, that hath countenanced
them. And none can doubt, but if our Church were dwely
constitute and invested with the orderly power of Christ,
and in capacity to exerce &amp; improve it, they would soon be
censured every Soul of them as Scandalous, as they have
been also Previously sentanced as such, by the Acts of our
General Abssemblies. This Argument levells also against
all Complying, <hi>Indulged, Addressing</hi> Ministers, who by these
Courses have incurred the Character of disorderly Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>XI. Our faithfulness to God, and to one another inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in our Covenants, doth oblige us to turn away from
them who have broken it, and so classed themselves
among these <hi>Truce-breaking</hi> Traitors, who make our times
Perillous, from whom we must <hi>turn away</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 1-5.
It appears from the foregoing deduction, how solemnly
these Nations were engaged both to keep out &amp; put out this
Generation of Prelatists, now prevailing; The obligation
of which yet lyes upon all the Inhabitants of the Land,
with a binding force, both in regard of their forme, and
object, and end. Hence if the Curats be Covenant break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and we also in ouning them, then we cannot oune
them without sin; But the Curats are Covenant breakers,
and we also in ouning them. <hi>Ergo</hi>—The <hi>Minor</hi> may be
manifest by an indiction of all the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Solomn
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:41139:138"/>
League &amp; Covenant,</hi> broken by them, and all that oune them
1. That Doctrine, worship, discipline, &amp; Government
in the 1. <hi>Ar:.</hi> sworn to be preserved &amp; propagated, was
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> then established, which our Church was in
possession of, which they have opposed, &amp; their ouners
resiled from, and have not maintained. 2. We are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in 2. <hi>Art.</hi> to endeavour the <hi>extirpation of Prelacy,</hi> and
its dependents; which is diametrically opposite to ouning
of Curats: can we oune them whom we are bound to ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hor?
and submit to them whom we are bound to extirpate?
Surely this were to rebuild what we have destroyed see
<hi>Napht. p.</hi> 104. And since in relation to <hi>Poperie,</hi> Heresie,
&amp; Schisme, this Article obliges us to disoune, &amp; not to
hear Papists &amp; Schismaticks, why not also in relation to
Prelatists, who are the greatest Schismaticks? 3. They
have established &amp; homologated an <hi>Erastian Supremacy,</hi> to
the Prejudice of true Religion and the Liberties of the
Church &amp; Kingdom, and their ouners have abetted &amp;
contenanced the same, and not preserved either the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Church or Kingdom, contrary to the 3. <hi>Art.</hi> 4. They
have not only concealed &amp; Countenanced Malignant Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to this Church &amp; Kingdom, but have themselves been
reall Incendiaries hindering the Reformation of Religion,
making factions &amp; Parties amongst the People, contrary
to this League &amp; Covenant, And their hearers are so far
from bringing them to <hi>Condign Punishment.</hi> that they have
strengthened their hands in their avowed opposition to the
Covenants, contrary to the 4 <hi>Art.</hi> 5. They have broken
our <hi>Conjunction</hi> in firme peace &amp; union; and yet their hearers
have not marked &amp; avoided these Causers of Divisions,
contrary to Scripture, and the 5 <hi>Art.</hi> 6. Instead of <hi>assisting</hi>
&amp; defending all these that entered into this League &amp; Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
&amp;c. they have been the greatest Persecuters of all them
that adhered to it; And their ouners have suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by combination or perswasion or terror, to be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi>
&amp; withdrawn from their suffering Brethren, and
have made defection to the contrary part, and given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to a detestable indifferency in this cause, contrary to
the 6. <hi>Art.</hi> 7. Instead of humbling themselves for their
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:41139:139"/>
sins, and going before others in the example of a real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
they have obstinately defended their breach of
Covenant, and have been Patrons &amp; Patterns of all defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;
And their ouners &amp; hearers have not repented of
that neither, when they countenance such Covenant-breakers
&amp; profane persons, nor of their not labouring
for the purity &amp; power of the Gospel, when they seek it
from such impure hands: Neither do they go before others
in Reformation, when they are such bad examples of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
contrary to the conclusion of the Covenant. This
Argument will also strike against hearing of such Ministers
that have made themselves guiltie of the same, or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
breaches of Covenant.</p>
               <p>XII. Finally, for <hi>Unions</hi> sake, and to avoid <hi>Schisme</hi> in
the body, we must withdraw from them. This may seem
another Paradox: but it is apparent, if we consider, that
there should be <hi>no Schisme in the body,</hi> but that the members
should have the same <hi>care one for another, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 25. And
that for to prevent &amp; remede this, the Apostle beseeches
us to <hi>mark them which Cause Divisions,</hi> &amp; offences contrary
to the Doctrine which we have learned, &amp; <hi>avoid them,
Rom.</hi> 16. 17. Now then, if the Prelats and their Curats be
<hi>Schismaticks,</hi> &amp; Separatists, and dividers, then we must
avoid &amp; withdraw from them: But so it is that the Prelats
&amp; their Curats are Schismaticks, &amp; Separatists, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
Therefore we must avoid &amp; withdraw from them.
The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove from all the Constituents of a formed
<hi>Schisme,</hi> Separation, &amp; sinful division. 1. They that start out
from under due relations to a Church, and from her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
are Schismaticks, Separatists, &amp; dividers, But the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats
and their Curats have started out from under due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
to the Covenanted Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; from her
Ministry, in being so unnatural rebellious Children, as
have broken their Mothers beauty &amp; bands, order &amp;
Union, &amp; razed her Covenanted Reformation, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
worship, Discipline, &amp; Government: 2. These
who withdraw from the Communion of a true Church,
and therefore are Censureable by all her standing acts, are
Schismatical Separatists: But the Prelats and their Curats
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:41139:139"/>
have withdrawn from the Communion of the true
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore are censureable by all
her standing acts, in that they have made a faction &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
repugnant to the Communion of this Church,
and all her established order: 3. Those who Separate
from a Church, whose Principles &amp; Practices are subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to that Churches true Union &amp; Communion and
right establishment, are properly Schismaticks: But the
Prelats and their Curats have Separated from this Church,
whose Principles &amp; practices are subservient to its true
Union &amp; Communion and right establishment; for they
could never yet impeach or challenge any Principle or
practice, contrary to the word of God, or not subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to true Union &amp; order, but their Principles &amp; practices
are stated in opposition to her purity &amp; Reformation.
4 Those who innovate the worship &amp; Government,
ouned &amp; established in a true Church, are Schismaticks:
But the Prelats and their Curats have innovated the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
&amp; Government of the true Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in
bringing a Doctrine new &amp; odd, and not the voice of this
Church; and their worship, over and above the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
adhering to it, is the worshiping of an innovating
party, contrary to our Churches established order: 5. They
that make a rent in the bowels of the true &amp; genuine
Church, are the Schismaticks: But the Prelats and their
Curats have made a rent in the bowels of this Church, and
have caused all the divisions in this Church. 6. Those that
divide themselves from the fellowship of a pure Church,
either in her Ministry, Lawful Courts, &amp; Ordinances,
are the Schismaticks: But the Prelats and their Curats have
divided themselves from the fellowship of this pure
Church, in her Ministry, Lawful Courts &amp; Ordinances,
in that they have caused the ejection of her Ministry, dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of her Assemblies, and subversion of her pure Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.
7. Those that break union with such, to whom
they were under obligations to adhere, are Schismatical
dividers: But the Prelats and their Curats have broken
Union with such to whom they were under obligations to
adhere, both from the antecedent morally obliging duty,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:41139:140"/>
and from the superadded obligation of the Covenants,
neither could they ever pretend any thing that might loose
the obligation: 8. That party in a Reformed Church,
which having overturned her Reformation, hath shut out,
laid aside, &amp; persecute away sound adherers thereunto,
both Ministers &amp; Professors, &amp; will not admit Ministers
to officiate but upon the sinful termes of complyance with
their way, are Schismaticks: But the Prelats and their
Curats are that party in this Reformed Church, which
having overturned her Reformation, hath shut out, laid
aside, and Persecute away sound adherers thereunto &amp;c.
Therefore they are the Schismaticks to be withdrawn
from, and their way is the Schisme, which we are bound
to extirpate in the Covenant.</p>

               <p>THe other Grand Ordinance of God, <hi>Magistracy,</hi>
which He hath in His Soveraign Wisdom, Justice,

for the demonstration, illustration, &amp; vindication of His
oun Glory, and the Communication, Conservation, and
Reparation of the Peace, safety, order, Liberty, and

of Greatest Concern: wherein not only the Prudence,
Policie, Propertie, &amp; Libertie of men, but also the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
Duty, &amp; Religion of Christians, have a special
Interest. And therefore it is no less important, pertinent,
profitable, &amp; necessary for every one that hath any of these
to care &amp; contend for, keep or recover, to inquire into
and understand somthing of the institution, constitution,
nature, &amp; boundaries of the Sacred ordinance of <hi>Magistracy,</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:41139:140"/>
than into the holy ordinance of the Ministry; So far at least
as may consist with the sphere of every ones Capacity &amp;
Station, and may conduce to the satisfaction of every ones
conscience, in the discharge of the duties of their relations.
Every private man indeed hath neither capacity, concern,
nor necessity, to study the <hi>Politicks,</hi> or search into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
or <hi>Intrigues</hi> of Government, no more then he is to
be versed in all the Administrations of Ecclesiastical Policy,
and Interests of the Ministry: yet every mans <hi>Conscience</hi> is
no less concerned, in distinguishing the Character of Gods
Ministers of Justice, the <hi>Magistrats,</hi> to whom he owes &amp;
ounes allegiance, that they be not usurping <hi>Tyrants,</hi> evert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ordinance of the <hi>Magistracy;</hi> than in acknowledging
the Character of Christs Ministers of the Gospel, to whom
he owes &amp; ounes obedience, that they be not usurping
<hi>Prelats</hi> or Impostors, perverting the Ordinance of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</hi>
The Glory of God is much concerned, in our ouning
&amp; keeping pure &amp; intire, according to His will &amp; word,
both these Ordinances. And our <hi>Conscience</hi> as well as <hi>Interest</hi>
is concerned in the advantage or hurt, profit or prejudice,
of the right or wrong, observation or prevarication, of
both these ordinances; being interested in the advantage of
<hi>Magistracy,</hi> and hurt of <hi>Tyrannie</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> as well as in
the advantage of the <hi>Ministry,</hi> and hurt of Diocesan or
Erastian <hi>Supremacy</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> in the advantage of <hi>Lt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
and hurt of <hi>slavery</hi> in the State, as well as in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of <hi>Religion</hi> and hurt of <hi>Profaneness</hi> in the Church;

Loyalty, and prejudice of oppression and Rebellion in
the State, as well as in the profit of <hi>Purity</hi> &amp; Unity,
and prejudice of Defection &amp; Division or Schisme, in the
Church. So that in Conscience, we are no more free to
Prostitute our Loyalty &amp; Liberty <hi>absolutely,</hi> in ouning every
Possessor of the Magistracy; than we are free to Prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
our Religion &amp; faith <hi>implicitely,</hi> in ouning every Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
to the Ministry. This may seem very Paradoxical
to some, because so dissonant &amp; dissentient from the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:41139:141"/>
yea almost Universal and invetrate opinion &amp; Practice
of the world, that hitherto hath not been so precise in the
matter of <hi>Magistracy.</hi> And it may seem yet more strange,
that not only some should be found to assert this; but that
any should be found so strict and strait-laced, as to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon suffering, and even to Death, for that which
hath hitherto been seldom scrupled, by any that were forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to subjection under a yoke, which they had no force
to shake off, and wherein Religion seems litle or nothing
concerned; for not ouning the authority of the present
Possessors of the place of Government: which seems to be
a Question not only excentrick &amp; extrinsick to Religion,
but such <hi>a State question,</hi> as for its thorny Intricacies &amp;
difficulties, is more proper for <hi>Politicians</hi> &amp; Lawyers to
dispute about (as indeed their debates about this head of
Authority, have been as manifold &amp; multiplied as about
any one thing) than for Private <hi>Christians</hi> to search into,
and suffer for, as a Part of their Testimony. But if we will
cast off Prejudices, and the Tyrannie of Custom, and the
bondage of being bound to the worlds Mind in our inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
about <hi>Tyrannie,</hi> and suffer our selves to Ponder impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
the importance of this matter; And then to state the
question right; We shall find Religion &amp; Conscience hath
no small interest in this business. They must have no snall
Interest in it, if we consider the importance of this matter,
either extensively, or objectively, or Subjectively. <hi>Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively</hi>
considered, it is the Interest of all mankind to know
and be resolved in Conscience, whether the Government
they are under be of Gods Ordination or of the Devils ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration;
whether it be Magistracy or Tyrannie; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it gives security for Religion &amp; Liberty, to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their posterity, or whether it induces upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and entails upon the posterity, slavery as to both
these invaluable Interests; whether they have matter of
praise to God for the blessings &amp; mercies of <hi>Magistracy,</hi> or
matter of Mourning for the plagues &amp; miseries of <hi>Tyrannie,</hi>
to the end they may know both the sins &amp; snares, Duties
&amp; dangers, Case &amp; <hi>Crisis,</hi> of the times they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive in. All
men that ever enjoyed the mercy of a right Constitute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:41139:141"/>
have experienced, and were bound to bless God
for the blessed fruits of it: And on the other hand, the world
is full of the Tragical Monuments of <hi>Tyrannie,</hi> for which
men were bound bath to search into the Causes, and see
the effects of such plagues from the Lord, to the end they
might mourn over both. And from the begining it hath
been observed, that as Peoples sins have alwayes procured
the Scourge of <hi>Tyrannie;</hi> So all their miseries might be
refounded upon <hi>Tyrants</hi> encroachments, Usurping upon
or betraying their Trust, and overturning Religion,
Lawes, &amp; Liberties. Certainly Mankind is concerned in
point of Interest &amp; Conscience, to inquire into the cause
&amp; Cure of this <hi>Epidemick</hi> distemper, that hath so long held
the world in miserie, and so habitually, that now it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as it were Natural to lye stupidly under it; that is,
that old Ingrained Gangrene of the <hi>Kings Evil,</hi> or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with Tyrannie; that hath long afflicted the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the world, and affected not only their <hi>backs</hi> in
bearing the burden thereof; but thir <hi>hearts</hi> into a Lethargick
stupor of insensibleness; and their <hi>heads</hi> in infatuating &amp;
intoxicating them with Notions of the Sacredness &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulablness
of Tyrannie; and their <hi>hands</hi> in infeebling
and fettering them from all attempts to work a Cure:
Or else it hath had another effect on many that have been
sensible of a touch of it; even equivalent to that, which
an ingenious Author <hi>Mr Gee</hi> in his Preface to the <hi>Divine
right &amp; Original of the Civil Magistrate</hi> (to which <hi>Mr Durham</hi>
is not absonant) expounds to be the effect of the <hi>fourth vial,
Rev.</hi> 16. 8, 9. when in these <hi>Dog-dayes</hi> of the world, power
is given to the <hi>Sun</hi> of Imperial, especially Popish, <hi>Tyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi>
by their exorbitant streaches of absolute Prerogative,
to <hi>scorch men with fire</hi> of furious oppressions, they then
<hi>blaspheme the Name of God which hath power over these Plagues,</hi>
in their Mal-content Complaints, grumblings, grudgings,
and Murmurings under the miserie, but they do not repent
nor give Him Glory, in mourning over the causes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meriting
such a Plague, and their oun accession in exposing
themselves to such a scorching sun, nakedly without a
Sconce. Certainly this would be the remedy that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:41139:142"/>
would suggest, and Interest would incite to, an
endeavour either of allaying the heat, or of subtracting
from it under a shelter, by declining the oblique Malignity
of its Scorching rayes. But will the world never be a wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
out of this Dream &amp; dotage, of Dull &amp; stupid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to every Monster that can Mount a Throne? Sure
at length it may be expected, either <hi>Conscience</hi> from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
as Gods deputy, challenging for the palpable perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this His excellent Ordinance, Or <hi>Iudgments</hi> from
without, making sensible of the effects of it, will convince
&amp; confute these old inveterate Prejudices. And then these
<hi>Martyrs</hi> for that universal Interest of mankind, who got
the fore-start and the first sight of this, will not be so flouted
as fools, as now they are. And who knoweth, what Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
or Preparative, fore-boding &amp; presaging the doun fal
of Tyranny, may be in its aspirings to this hight of arbitrary
<hi>absoluteness,</hi> and in the many questions raised about it, and
by them imposed upon Consciences to be resolved. If we
consider the <hi>object</hi> of this question; as Conscience can only
clear it, so in nothing can it be more concerned. It is that
Great <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, most signally impressed by a very
Sacred &amp; illustrious Character of the Glorious Majestie of
the Most High, who hath appointed Magistracy; in which,
considering either its fountain, or Dignity, ends, or
effects, Conscience must have a very great Concern. The
<hi>fountain</hi> or efficient cause of Magistracy, is high &amp; sublime.
<hi>The powers that are be of God,</hi> not only by the all disposing
hand of God in His <hi>Providence,</hi> as Tyranny is, nor only by
way of naked <hi>approbation,</hi> but by Divine <hi>institution;</hi> And
that not only in the general, by at least a Secondary Law
of Nature, but also the special investiture of it, in Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
&amp; Constitution, is from God; and therefore they
are said to be <hi>ordained of God,</hi> to which Ordinance we must
be subject, <hi>not only for wrath but also for Conscience sake;</hi> which
is the Great Duty required in the <hi>fifth Command,</hi> the first
Commandment with Promise; that hath the Priority of
Place befor all the Second table, because the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
respect each some one Interest, this hath a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent
influence upon all. But Tyrannical powers are
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:41139:142"/>
not of God in this sense. And it were Blasphemie to assert
they were of the Lords Authorization, Conscience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bind to a subjection to this. Again the <hi>Dignity</hi> of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy,
ordained for the maintenance of Truth &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
the only foundations of peoples felicity, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
temporal or eternal, including the bonds &amp; bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of all obedience &amp; subjection, for which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
&amp; to which they refer, is <hi>supereminent;</hi> as that Epithet
of <hi>higher</hi> added to the <hi>powers</hi> that are <hi>of God,</hi> may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
making them high &amp; sublime in Glory, whose
highest prerogative is, that being Gods Ministers, they
sit in the <hi>Throne of God,</hi> anointed of the Lord, judging not
for man but for the Lord, as the Scripture speaks. To this
Conscience is concerned in duty to render honour as due,
by the Prescript of the fifth Commandment: but for Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
Conscience is bound to deny it, because not due;
no more than obedience, which Conscience dare not pay
to a Throne of Iniqulty, and a Throne of the Devil, as
Tyranny may be called as really as Magistracy is called the
Throne of God. Next Conscience is much concerned in
the <hi>ends</hi> of Magistracy, which are the Greatest, the Glory
of God and the good of Mankind. And in the <hi>effects</hi> of it,
the maintenance of Truth, Righteousness, Religion,
Liberty, Peace, &amp; Safety, and all choicest external bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings:
But the ends &amp; effects of Tyranny are quite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
Domineering for pleasure, and destroying for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
Can we think that Conscience is nothing Concerned
here, that these great ends shall be subverted, and the
effects precluded; and to that effect, that Tyrannie not
only be shrouded under a Priviledge of impunity, but by
our subjection &amp; acknowledment of it, as a Lawful power,
encouraged into all enormities, and Licensed to usurpe,
not only our Liberties, but Gods Throne by an uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Soveraignty? But if we Consider the <hi>subjective</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of Conscience, it must be very great: when it is the
only thing that prompts to subjection, that regulats sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and is a bottom for subjection to lawful powers.
If it were not out of Conscience, men that are free born
are naturally such Lovers of Liberty, and under Corruption
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:41139:143"/>
such lusters after Licenciousness, that they would never
come under the Order of this Ordinance, except constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for wraths sake: but now, understanding that they
that resist the power resist the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, and they
that resist shall receive to themselves <hi>Damnation,</hi> they must
needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
sake. If Conscience were not exercised in regulating
our duty to Magistrats, we would either obey none, or
else would observe all their Commands promiscously,
Lawful or unlawful, and would make no difference
either of the matter commanded, or the power comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
but now, understanding that we must obey God
rather then man, and that we must render to all their
dues, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour,
Conscience regulats us what &amp; whom to obey. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conscience there is litle hope for Government to prove
either beneficial or permanent: litle likelyhood of either
a reall, regular, or durable subjection to it. The discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible
standing of Government upon conscientious grounds,
is the only thing that can bring in conscience, &amp; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
submission to it; it being the highest &amp; most
kindly principle of, and the strongest &amp; most lasting obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to, any relative duty. It will not be <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
(as sayeth the late <hi>Declaration</hi> for it) but <hi>reality</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and Government founded upon a bottom of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that <hi>will Unite the Governed to the Governours by incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
as well as duty.</hi> And if that be, then there is needful
a rule of Gods revealed preceptive will (the only <hi>Cynosure</hi>
&amp; Empress of conscience) touching the founding &amp;
erecting of Government, that it have the stamp of Gods
Authority. It must needs then follow that conscience hath
a very great concernment in this question in the General,
and that before it be forced to an abandoning of its light
in a matter of such moments, it will rather oblige people
that are conscientious to suffer the worst that Tyrants can
do; especially when it is imposed &amp; obtruded upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scince,
to give its suffrage &amp; express acknowledment that
the present <hi>Tyranny</hi> is the <hi>Authority</hi> of God, which is so
visible in the view of all that have their eyes open, that the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:41139:143"/>
meanest capacity that was never conversant in Lawes &amp;
Politicks can give this verdict that the Constitution &amp; admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the Government of the tuo <hi>Royal Brothers,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whose burthen the earth and we have been groaning
these 27 years past, hath been a compleat &amp; Habitual Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
and can no more be ouned to be Magistracy the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Robbery can be acknowledged to be a rightful possession.
It is so plain, that I need not the help of Lawyers &amp; Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians
to demonstrate it, nor lanch into the Ocean of their
endless debates in handling the head of Magistracy &amp; Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie:
yet I shall improve what help I find in our most
approved Authors who have enlarged upon this Question
(though not as I must state it) to dilucidate the matter in
<hi>Thesi,</hi> and refer to the foregoing Deduction of the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Testimonies against Tyranny, to clear it in <hi>Hypothesi.</hi>
Whence we may see the occasion, and clearly gather the
solution of the Question, which is this.</p>
               <p>Whether a people, long oppressed with the encroachments of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
&amp; Usurpers, may disoune their pretended Authority; &amp; when
imposed upon to acknowledge it; may rather chiefe to suffer than to
oune it?</p>
               <p>To clear this question: I shall first premit some <hi>conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
and then come more formally to resolve it.</p>
               <p>I. It must be granted the Question is <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and
never so stated by any writer on this head; which makes
it the more difficult, and odious, because odd &amp; singular,
in the esteem of those who take up opinions rather from
the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>votes</hi> than from the weight of the reasons of
the asserters of them. It will also be yeelded, that this
was never a <hi>case of confession</hi> for Christians to suffer upon.
And the reason of both is, because, before these seven years
past, this was never imposed upon private &amp; common
subjects to give an account of their thoughts &amp; conscience
about the Lawfulness of the Government they lived under.
Conquerers &amp; Usurpers sometimes have demanded an
acknowledgment of their Authority; from men of greatest
note &amp; stroke in the Countries they have seised: but they
never since the Creation urged it upon common people,
as a Test of Loyalty; but thought alwayes their Lawes,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:41139:144"/>
&amp; power to execute them on offenders, did secure their
subjection. Or otherwise to what purpose are Lawes
made, and the execution of them committed to men in
power, if they be not thought a sufficient fence for the
Authority that makes them; except it also have the actual
acknowledgment of the subjects to ratify it? Men that are
really invested with Authority, would think it both a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragment
to their Authority, and would disdain such a
suspicion of the questionableness of it, as to put it as a
queston to the subjects, whether they ouned it or not. But
the Gentlemen that rule us, have fallen upon a piece of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented
Policy: wherein they think both to involve
the Nation in the guilt of their unparalelled Rebellion
against the Lord, by ouning that Authority that promotes
it, and so secure their Usurpations, either by the suffrage of
all that oune them, or by the exstirpation of the Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
that dare not, with the odium &amp; obli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uie of being
enemies to Authority; by which Trick they think to bury
the honour of their Testimony. Yet in sobriety without
Prophecying it may be presumed, at the long run this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
will prove very prejudicial to their Interest: and herein
they may verify that Scots Proverb, <hi>ov'r fast ov'r loose,</hi> and
accomplish these Divine sayings <hi>He disappointeth the devices of
the Crafty, He taketh the wise in their oun Craftiness, and the
Counsel</hi> of the froward is <hi>carried head long.</hi> For as they
have put people upon this question, who would not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have made such inquiries into it; and now finding
they must be resolved in conscience to answer it, when
ever they shall be brought before them; upon a very overly
search, they see terrible <hi>Tyranny</hi> witten in legible bloody
Characters almost on all administrations of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so come to be fixed in the verdict that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
&amp; the word of God gives of it: So it may be thought,
this question now started, for as despicable beginings it hath,
yet ere it come to a ful &amp; final Decision, will be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
into through the world, and at length prove as fatal
to Tyranny, as ever any thing could be, and then they
may know whom to thank. But however though the
question be extraordinary, and the sufferings thereupon be
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:41139:144"/>
unprecedented; And therefore among other contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
that may be objected, that neither in History nor
Scripture we can find instances of private people their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to oune the Authority they were under, nor of their
suffering for that refusal: yet nevertheless it may be duty
without example. Many things may be done; though not
against the Law of God, yet without a precedent of the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the people of God. Though we could not adduce an
example for it, yet we can gather it from the Law of
God, that Tyranny must not be ouned, this will be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to a thousand examples. Every age in somethings
must be a precedent to the following, and I think never
did any age produce a more honourable precedent, than
this begining to decline a yoke under which all ages have
groaned.</p>
               <p>2. It will be also granted, It is not always indispensablie
necessarie, at all times. for a people to declare their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
of the Tyranny they are under, when they cannot
shake it off; nor, when they are staged for their duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wicked &amp; Tyrannical Judges, is it always necessarie
to disoune their pretended Authority positively; when
either they are not urged with questions about it, then
they may be silent in reference to that; or when they are
imposed upon to give their judgment of it, they are not
alwayes obliged, as in a <hi>case of confession,</hi> to declare all their
mind, especially when such Questions are put to them
with a manifest design to entrap their lives, or intangle
their Conscience. All Truth is not to be told at all times;
neither are all questions to be answered when impertinently
interrogate, but may be both Cautiously &amp; Conscienciously
waved. We have Christs oun practice, &amp; his faithful servant
<hi>Pauls</hi> example, for a Pattern of such prudence &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
caution. But yet it were cruel &amp; unchristian rigour,
to censure such as out of a pious principle of zeal to God
&amp; conscience of duty, do freely &amp; positively declare their
judgment, in an absolute disouning of their pretended Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
when posed with such Questions, though to the
manifest detriment of their lives, they Conscienciously
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:41139:145"/>
looking upon it as a case of confession. For where the
Lord hath not peremptorily astricted His Confessors to
such rules of prudence, but hath both promised and usually
gives His Spirits Conduct, encouraging &amp; animating them
to boldness, so as before hand they should not take thought
how or what they shall speak, and in that same hour they
find it given them, it were presumption for us to stint them
to our rules of prudence. We may indeed find rules to
know, what is a case of confession; but hardly can it be
determined, what Truth or duty we are questioned about
is not, or may not be, a case of confession. And who
can deny, but this may be in some circumstances a case of
confession, even Positively to disoune the pretended Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a bloody Court or Council? when either they
go out of their Sphere, taking upon them Christs Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
and the Cognizance of the concerns of His Croun,
whereof they are Judges no ways Competent; then they
must freely &amp; faithfully be declined. Or when, to the
dishonour of Christ, they blaspheme His Authority, and
the Sacred boundaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He hath prescribed to all humane
Authority, and will assert an illimited <hi>absolute</hi> Authority,
refusing &amp; discharging all offered Legal &amp; Scriptural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions
to be put thereupon (as hath been the case of the
most part of these worthy though poor Martyrs, who have
died upon this head) then they must think themselves
bound to disoune it. Or when they have done some cruel
indignity &amp; despight to the Spirit of God, and to Christ
His prerogative &amp; Glory, and work of Reformation, and
people, in murdering them without Mercy, and imposing
this ouning of their King, by whose Authority all is acted,
as a condemnation of these witnesses of Christ their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and a justification of their bloody cruelties against
them, which hath frequently been the case of these poor
people that have been staged upon this account: In this
case, and several others of this sort that might be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then they may be free &amp; Positive in disouning this Test
of wicked Loyaltie, as the <hi>mark</hi> of the <hi>Dragon</hi> of the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
beast of Tyranny. And in many such cases, when the
Lord gives the Spirit, I see no reason but that Christs wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:41139:145"/>
must follow His Pattern of <hi>zeal</hi> in the case of confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which He witnessed before <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> in asserting
His oun Kingship, as they may in other cases follow His
Pattern of <hi>Prudence.</hi> And why may we not imitate the
zeal of <hi>Stephen,</hi> who called the Council before whom he
was staged <hi>stiff necked resisters of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Persecuters
of the Prophets, and betrayers &amp; Murderers of Christ the
Just one, as well as the Prudence of <hi>Paul?</hi> But however
it be, the present Testimony against this pretended Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
Lies in the <hi>Negative,</hi> which obliges alwayes, <hi>semper</hi> &amp;
<hi>ad semper;</hi> that is to say, we plead, that it must <hi>never be
Ouned.</hi> There is a great difference between a Positive <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouning,</hi>
and a <hi>not Ouning:</hi> though the first be not alwayes
necessary, the Latter is the Testimony of the day, and a
negative case of confession, which is allwise clearer than
the Positive. Though we must not allwise confess every
Truth, yet we must never deny any.</p>
               <p>3. It is confessed, we are under this sad disadvantage
besides others, that not only all our Brethren, groaning
under the same yoke with us, will not take the same way
of declining this pretended Authority, nor adventure
when called to declare their judgment about it (which we
do not condemn, as is said, and would expect from the
rules of equity &amp; charity, they will not condemn us, when
we find our selves in conscience bound to use greater free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
But also some when they do declare their judgment,
give it in termes condemnatory of, &amp; contradictory unto
our Testimony, in that they have freedom positively to
oune this Tyranny, as Authority, and the Tyrant as their
Lawful Soveraign. And many of our Ministers also are
of the same mind. And further as we have few expressly
asserting our part of the debate, as it is now stated: so we
have many famous &amp; learned divines expressly against, us
in this point, as especially we find in their Comments
upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. among whom I cannot dissemble my sorrow
to find the great <hi>Calvin,</hi> saying, <q>
                     <hi>saepe solent inquirere</hi> &amp;c.
men often inquire, by what right they have obtained
their power who have the rule! It should be enough to
us that they do govern, for they have not ascended to this
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:41139:146"/>
eminency by their oun power, but are imposed by the
hand of the Lord.</q> As also <hi>Pareus</hi> saying too much against
us. For answer to this I refer to <hi>Mr Knox</hi> his reply to
<hi>Lithingtoun,</hi> producing several Testimonies of Divines
against him upon this very same head; wherein he shewes,
that the occasions of their Discourses &amp; Circumstances
wherein they were stated were very far different, from
those that have to do with Tyrants &amp; Usurpers, as indeed
they that are most concerned and smart most under their
scourge are in best case to speak to the purpose. I shall only
say, Mens averment in a Case of Conscience is not an
oracle, when we look upon it with an impartial eye, in
the case wherein we are not prepossessed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it will bear no
other value, than what is allayed with the imperfections
of fallibility; and moreover is contradicted by some others,
whose Testimony will help us as much to confirm our
persuasion, as others will hurt us to infirm it.</p>
               <p>4. But now when Tyrants go for Magistrats; lest my
plea against ouning Tyranny, should be mistaken as if it
were a pleading for Anarchy: I must assert, that I and all
those I am vindicating are for Magistracy, as being of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Original, institute for the common good of humane
&amp; Christian Societies, whereunto <hi>every soul</hi> must be subject,
of whatsoever quality or Character, and not only for
wrath but also for conscience sake (though as to our soul &amp;
conscience, we are not subject) which whosoever resisteth
resisteth the ordinance of God, and against which Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
is a damnable sin, Whereunto (according to the fifth
Commandment, and the many reiterated exhortations of
the Apostles) we must be subject, and obey Magistrates,
and submit ourselves to every Ordinance of man for the
Lords sake, whether it be unto the King as Supreme &amp;c.
And we account it a hateful brand of them that walk after
the flesh, to <hi>despise Government,</hi> to be presumptuous, self
willed, and not afrayed to <hi>speakevil of dignities</hi> and that they
are filthy dreamers who despise <hi>Dominion</hi> &amp; speakevil of
dignities, and of those things which they know not. We
allow the Magistrate, in whatsoever form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
all the power the Scripture, Lawes of Nature or
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:41139:146"/>
Nations, or Municipal do allow him: Asserting that he is
the keeper &amp; avenger of both the Tables of the Law, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a power over the Church as well as the state suited to
his Capacity, that is; not <hi>formally</hi> Ecclesiastical but objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely
for the Churches good; an <hi>external</hi> power, of Providing
for the Church, &amp; Protecting her from outward violence,
or in ward disorder; an <hi>imperate</hi> power, of commanding
all to do their respective duties; a <hi>Civil</hi> power of Punishing
all, even Church officers, for Crimes; a <hi>Secundary</hi> power
of Judicial approbation or condemnation, or discretive,
in order to give his Sanction to Synodical results; a <hi>Cumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative</hi>
power, assisting &amp; strengthening the Church in all
her Priviledges, subservient though not servill, Coordinate
with Church power not Subordinate (though as a Christian
he is subject) in his oun affairs, to wit Civil, not to be
declined as Judge, but to be obeyed in all things Lawful,
and honoured &amp; strengthened with all his dwes. We would
give unto <hi>Cesar</hi> the things that are <hi>Cesars,</hi> and to God the
things that are Gods But to <hi>Tyrants,</hi> that usurpe &amp; pervert
both the things of God &amp; of <hi>Cesar,</hi> and of the peoples Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
we can render none of them, neither Gods, nor
<hi>Cesars,</hi> nor our oun; Nor can we from conscience give
him any other deference, but as an enemy to all, even to
God, to <hi>Cesar,</hi> &amp; the people. And in this, though it doth
not sound now with Court parasites, nor with others that
are infected with Royal <hi>Indulgences</hi> &amp; <hi>Indemnities,</hi> we bring
forth but the transumpt of old Principles, according to
which our fathers walked when they still contended for
Religion &amp; Liberty, against the attemptings &amp; aggressions of
Tyranny against both.</p>
               <p>5. It must be conceded, it is not an easie thing to make
a man in the place of Magistracy a Tyrant. For as every
escape, error, or act of unfaithfulness, even known &amp;
continued in, whether in a Ministers entry to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
or in his Doctrine, doth not unminister him, nor
give sufficient ground to withdraw from him, or reject
him as a Minister of Christ: So neither does every enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
misdemeanure, or act of Tyranny, Injustice, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidie,
or profanity in the Civil Magistrate, whether as to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:41139:147"/>
his way of entry to that office, or in the execution of it,
or in his private or personal behaviour, denominate him a
Tyrant or usurper, or give sufficient ground to divest him
of Magistratical power, and reject him as the Lawful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.
It is not any one or tuo Acts contrary to the Royal
Covenant or office, that doth denude a man of the Royal
dignity, that God &amp; the people gave him: <hi>David</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
tuo acts of Tyranny, <hi>Murder</hi> &amp; <hi>Adultery;</hi> yet the
people were to acknowledge him as their King (and so it
may be said of some others, ouned still as Kings in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
the reason is, because though he sinned against a man
or some particular persons, yet he did not sin against the
State, and the Catholick good of the Kingdom, subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Law; for then he would have turned Tyrant, and
ceased to have been Lawful King. There is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between a Tyrant in <hi>act,</hi> and a Tyrant in <hi>habit,</hi> the
first does not cease to be a King. But on the other hand,
as every thing will not make a Magistrate to be a Tyrant:
So nothing will make a Tyrant <hi>habitu,</hi> a Magistrate. And
as every fault will not unminister a Minister; So some will
oblige the people to reject his Ministry, as if he turn He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical,
&amp; Preach Atheisme, <hi>Mahumetanisme,</hi> or the like,
the people, though they could not formally depose him,
or through the corruption of the times could not get him
deposed; yet they might reject &amp; disoune his Ministry: So
it will be granted, that a people have more power in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Magistrate than in making a Minister, and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they have more right and may have more light in
disouning a King, as being unkinged; than in disouning a
Minister, as being un-ministerd. It will be necessary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for clearing our way, to fix upon some ordinary
Characters of a Tyrant, which may discriminate him from
a Magistrate, and be ground of disouning him as such. I shall
rehearse some, from very much approved Authors; the
application of which will be as apposite to the <hi>tuo Brothers,</hi>
that we have been burthened with, as if they had intended
a particular &amp; exact description of them. <q>

                     </hi> was at first
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:41139:147"/>
honourable, being attributed to them that had the full
power in their hands, which power was not astricted by
any bonds of Lawes, nor obnoxious to the Cognition
of Judges, and that it was the usual denomination of
<hi>Heroes,</hi> and thought at first so honourable that it was attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the <hi>Gods:</hi> But as <hi>Nero</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudas</hi> were sometimes
among the <hi>Romans</hi> &amp; <hi>Iewes</hi> names of greatest account,
but afterwards by the faults of tuo men of these names, it
came to pass that the most flagitious would not have these
names given to their Children; So in process of time,
Rulers made this name so infamous by their wicked
deeds, that all men abhorred it as contagious &amp; Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentious,
and thought it a more light reproach to be called
a hangman then a Tyrant. Thereafter he Condiscends
upon several Characters of a Tyrant. 1. He that doth not
receive a Government by the will of the people, but by
force invadeth it, or <hi>intercepteth</hi> it by fraud, is a Tyrant;
and who domineers even over the unwilling (for <hi>Rex vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentibus
Tyrannus invitis imperat</hi>) and procures the Supreme
rule without the peoples Consent, even though for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
years they may so govern, that the people shall not
think it irksome.</q> Which very well aggrees with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Gentleman that rules over us, who, after he was by
publick vote in Parliament secluded from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of which the standing Lawes of both Kingdoms
made him incapable for his Murthers, Adulteries, &amp; Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries,
by force &amp; fraud did intercept first an <hi>Act</hi> for His
Succession in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and then the actual Succession in
<hi>England,</hi> by blood &amp; treacherie usurping &amp; intruding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the Government, without any Compact with, or
Consent of the people; though now he studies to make
himself like another <hi>Syracusan Hiero,</hi> or the <hi>Florentine Cosino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
Medices,</hi> in a mild Moderation of his usurped power,
but the <hi>West</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>West</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> both, have
felt the force of it. 2. <q>
                     <hi>Tyrannus non civibus sed sibi gerit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium,
neque publicae utilitatis sed suae voluptatis rationem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
&amp;c.</hi> He does not govern for the subjects well-fare or
publick ultility but for himself, having no regard to that
but to his oun lust; Acting in this like robbers, who cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:41139:148"/>
disposing of what wickedly they have acquired,
do seek the praise of Justice by injury, &amp; of Liberality by
robbery; So he can make some shew of a Civil mind, but
so much the less assurance gives he of it, that it is manifest
he intends not thereby the subjects good, but the greater
security of his oun lusts, and stability of empire over po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
having some what Mitigated the peoples hatred,
which when he hath done he will turn back again to his
old manners, for the fruit which is to follow may easily
be known both by the seed and by the sower there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</q>
An exact Copy of this we have seen within these
tuo years, as oft before in the rule of the other Brother.
After God hath been robbed of His prerogatives, the
Church of her Priviledges, the State of its Lawes, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of their Libertie &amp; property, he is now affecting the
praise &amp; captating the Applause of tenderness to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and Love of Peace, by offering now <hi>Liberty</hi> after all
his <hi>Cruelties;</hi> wherein all the thinking part of men do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
he is prosecuting that hellish Project, introducing
Popery &amp; slaverie; and overturning Religion, Law, &amp;
Liberty. 3. <q>
                     <hi>Regium imperium secundum Naturam est, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicum
contra, Regium Liberi inter Liberos est Principatus,
Tyrannus domini in servas &amp;c.</hi> Tyranny is against Nature,
and a Masterly Principality over slaves. Can he be called
a father, who accounts his subjects slaves? or a Shepherd,
who does not feed but devours his flock? or a Pilot, who
doth allwise study to make shipwrack of the goods, and
strikes a leak in the very ship where he sails? what is he
then that bears Command, not for the peoples advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
but studies only himself, who leadeth his subjects
into manifest snares? he shall not verily be accounted by
me either Commander.</q> Emperour, or Governour?
King <hi>Iames</hi> the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> also, in a speech to the Parliament <hi>anno</hi>
1609. makes this one Character of a Tyrant, <hi>when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to invade his subjects rights &amp; Liberties.</hi> And if this be true,
then we have not had a King these many years: the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
deduction will demonstrate, what a slavery we have
been under. 4. <hi>Quid qui non de virtute certet c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<q>What is he then, who doth not contend for vertue with
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:41139:148"/>

yow see then any usurping the Royal name, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
in any virtue, but striving to exceed all in base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
not tendering his subjects good with native affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,
but pressing them with proud domination, esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the people committed to his trust not for their

man is truly a King, albeit he vapours with a numerous
Lieveguard, and makes an ostentation of gorgeous
Pomp?</q> The learned <hi>Althusius</hi> likewise in his <hi>Politicks cap.
38. Num.</hi> 15. (as He is cited by <hi>Ius Populi chap. 16. Pag.</hi>
347.) makes this one Character of a Tyrant, that <q>
                     <hi>liveing in
Luxury, whoredome, greed, &amp; idleness, he neglecteth or is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit

what effrontry of impudence is it, for such monsters
to pretend to rule by virtue of any Authority derived from
God, who pollute the world with their Adulteries &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cests,
and Live in open defyance of all the Lawes of the
universal King; with whom to exceed in all villanies is
the way to purchase the Countenance of the Court, and to
aspire to preferment? No <hi>Heliogabulus</hi> &amp;c. could ever come
up the length in wickedness, that our Rulers have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed.

he leaveth to rule by Law. Althusius</hi> also <hi>loc. cit.</hi> saith, <q>there is
one kind of Tyranny which consisteth in violating,
changing, or removing of fundamental Lawes, specially
such as concern Religion; such, saith he, <hi>Philip</hi> the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who, contrare to the fundamental <hi>Belgick</hi>
Lawes, did erect an administration of Justice by force of
armes; and such was <hi>Charles</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> that thought

have been subverted, the Reformation of Religion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,

the word of God. But if it be to be <hi>Legibus solutus,</hi> loosed

Creature. Where was there ever such an arbitrary &amp; abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
power arrogated by any Mortal, as hath been claimed
by our Rulers these years past? especially by the present
Usurper, who, in this Liberty of conscience now granted

who yet upon these termes of keeping that Covenant only
was admitted to the Government? And what shall we say
of his Brother succeeding, who disdains all bonds, whose
professed principle is, as a Papist to keep no faith to Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks?
9. In the same place he makes this on Character:
<q>a Tyrants is he, who takes away from one or moe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the common wealth the free exercise of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Religion,</q> And the Grave Author of the <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

<hi>pag.</hi> 3, 4.</bibl> whensoever a Prince becomes depraved to
that degree of wickedness, as to apply &amp; employ his
power &amp; Interest, to debauch &amp; withdraw his subjects
from their fealty &amp; obedience to God, or sets himself to
extirpate that Religion which the Lord hath revealed &amp;
appointed to be the rule of our living &amp; the means of our
happiness, he doth <hi>ipso facto</hi> depose himself, and instead
of being ouned any longer for a King, ought to be treated
as a Rebel &amp; Traiter against the Supreme &amp; Universal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</q>
This is the perfect Protracture of our Princes;
the former of which, declared an open war against Religion
&amp; all that professed it; and the Latter did begin to prosecute
it with the same cruelty of persecution, and yet continues
without relenting against us; though to others he tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
it under the Notion of a Crime, to be for the present
dispensed with, until he accomplish his design. 10. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
he tells us, that for corrupting of youth <q>he erecteth stage
plages, Whore-houses, &amp; other Play-houses, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the Colledges &amp; other Seminaries of Learning to be
corrupted.</q> There was never more of this in any age, than
in the conduct of our Court, which like another <hi>Sodom</hi>
profess it to be their design to debauch mankind in to all
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:41139:150"/>
villanies, and to poison the fountains of all learning &amp; vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
by intruding the basest of men into the place of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
both in Church &amp; University, and precluding all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to honest men. 11. Further he sayes, <q>he is a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
who doth not defend his subjects from injuries when
he may, but suffereth them to be oppressed</q> (and what
if he oppress them himself?) It was one of the Lawes of
<hi>Edward the Confessor, Quod si Rex desit officio, nomen Regis in
eo non constabit.</hi> If the King fail in the discharge of his Trust
&amp; office, he no longer deserves nor ought to enjoy that
name. What name do they deserve then, who not only
fail in the duty of defending their subjects, but send out
their <hi>Lictors</hi> &amp; bloody Executioners to oppress them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will suffer them to defend themselves! But <hi>Althusius</hi>
makes a distinct Character of this. 12. Then in fine,
he must certainly be a Tyrant, who will not suffer the
people, by themselves nor by their Representatives, to
maintain their oun rights, neither by Law nor force:
for, sayeth my Author Forecited, <q>he is a Tyrant who
hindereth the free suffrages of members of Parliament,
so that they dare not speak what they would; And chiefly
he who takes away from the people all power to resist
his Tyranny, as Armes, strengths, &amp; chief men, whom
therefore though innocent he hateth, afflicteth, &amp; perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth,
exhausts their goods &amp; livelyhoods, without right
or reason.</q> All know that our blades have been all alongs
enemies to Parliaments; and when their Interest forced to
call them, what means were used always to pacque &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limit
them and over-aw them, and how men who have
faithfully discharged their trust in them have been prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
with the hight of envy &amp; fury, and many murthered
thereupon; And how all the armed force of the Kingdoms
have been inhanced into their hand, and the people kept
so under foot, that they have been rendered incapable
either to defend their oun from intestine Usurpers, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Invaders. All that is said amounts to this, that when
ever men in power do evert &amp; subvert all the ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and intrude themselves upon it, and abuse it,
to the hurt of the Common wealth, and the destruction of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:41139:150"/>
that for which Government was appointed; They are then
Tyrants, and cease to be Magistrates. To this purpose I shall
here append the words of that forecited Ingenious Author
of the <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Impartial Enquirie Pap.</hi> 13. 14.</bibl> There can be nothing
more evident from the light of reason as well as Scripture,
than that all Magistracy is appointed for the benefite
of mankind and the common good of Societies: God
never gave any one power to reign over others for their
destruction (unless by His providence where He had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
a people for their sins to ruine) but on whomsoever
He confers Authority over Cities or Nations, it is with
this Conditional <hi>Proviso</hi> &amp; Limitation, that they are to
Promote their Prosperity &amp; good, and to study their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
&amp; Protection: All Princes are thus far Pactional—And
whosoever refuseth to perform this fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
condition, he degrades &amp; deposes himself, nor is it
rebellion in any to resist him; whensoever Princes ceases
to be for the common good, they answer not the end
they were instituted unto, and cease to be what they were
chosen for.</q>
               </p>
               <p>6. It will not be denyed but when the Case is so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiate,
that it would require the arbitration of judgment
to determine whether the King be a Tyrant or not, that then
people are not to disoune him: for if it be a question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the people be really robbed of their rights &amp; Liberties,
and that the King might pretend as much reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the people their doing indignity to his Soveraignty,
as they might of his Tyranny; Then it were hard for them
to assume so for the umpirage of their oun Cause, as to
make themselves absolute judges of it, and forth with to
reject his Authority upon these debateable grounds. But
the Case is not so with us: no Place being left for doubt or
debate, but that our fundamental rights &amp; Liberties Civil &amp;
Religious are overturned, and an absolute Tyranny exactly
Characterized as above is established on the ruines thereof.
Hence we have not disouned the pretended Authority,
because we judged it was Tyrannical, but because it was
really so. Our discretive judgment in the case was not our
rule, but it was our understanding of the rule, by which
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:41139:151"/>
only we could be regulated and not by the understanding of
another, which cannot be better nor so good of our grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
which certainly we may be supposed to understand
best our selves, and yet they are such as are understood
every where. To the question then, who shall be Judge
between these Usurping &amp; Tyrannizing Rulers &amp; us? we
answer briefly &amp; plainly, We do not usu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p a judgment in
the case, pretending no more Authority over them in our
private Capacity than we allow them to have over us, that
is none at all? Nor can we admit that they should be both
Judges &amp; party; for then they might challenge that prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
in every case, and strengthen themselves in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable
immunity &amp; impunity to do what they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
But we appeal to the fundamental Lawes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
aggreeable to the word of God, to Judge, and to
the whole world of impartial Spectators to read &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the judgment. <q>

answer to this: There is a Court of Necessity no less than
a Court of Justice; And the fundamental Lawes must
then speak, and it is with the people in this extremity as
if they had no ruler. And as to the doubtsomness of these
Lawes he sayeth (1) As the Scriptures in all fundamentals
are clear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; expone themselves, &amp; <hi>actu primo</hi> condemn
Heresies: So all Lawes of men in their fundamentals,
which are the Law of Nature &amp; Nations, are clear (2)
Tyranny is more visible &amp; intelligible than Heresie, and
its soon discerned—The people have a Natural Throne
of Policy in their conscience, to give warning, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
sentence against the King as a Tyrant—where
Tyranny is more obscure; and the thread smal that it
escape the eye of man, the King keepeth Possession, but
I deny that Tyranny can be obscure long.</q>
               </p>
               <p>7. I shall grant that many things are yeeldable even to
a Grassant Dominator, &amp; Tyrannical Occupant of the
place of Magistracy, as 1. There may be some cases,
wherein its Lawful for a people to yeeld <hi>subjection</hi> to a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Tyrant, when groaning under his overpouring yoke,
under which they must patiently bear the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>nation of the
Lord, because they have sinned against Him, until He
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:41139:151"/>
arise &amp; plead His oun Cause &amp; execute judgment in the
earth (<hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 9.) until which time they must kiss the rod
as in the hand of God, and oune &amp; adore the holyness &amp;
Soveraignty of that Providence that hath subjected them
under such a slavery; and are not to attempt a violent
ejection or excussion, when either the thing attempted is
altogether impracticable, or the means &amp; manner of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuating
it dubious &amp; unwarrantable, or the necessary
Concomitants &amp; consequents of the cure more hurtful or
dangerous than the disease, or the like. As in many cases
also a man may be subject to a robber prevailing against
him: So we find the people of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egyt</hi> &amp; <hi>Babylon</hi> &amp;c.
yeelded subjection to Tyrants. But in this case we deny two
things to them (1) Allegiance or active &amp; voluntary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
so as to oune them for Magistrats (2) Stupid
<hi>Passive obedience,</hi> or suffering without resistence. For the
first, we owe it only to Magistrats, by virtue of the Law
either Ordinative of God, or Constitutive of man. And it
is no Argument to infer; as a mans subjecting himself to a
Robber assaulting him, is no soild proof of his approving
or acknowledging the injury &amp; violence committed by the
robber, therefore a Persons yeelding subjection to a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
a Publick robber does not argue his acknowledging or
approving his Tyranny &amp; oppression. For, the subjection
that a Tyrant requires, and which a Robber requires, is
not of the same nature: the one is <hi>Legal</hi> of subjects, which
we cannot oune to a Tyrant; the other is <hi>forced</hi> of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
which we must acknowledge to a Robber. But to
make the Paralell; If the Robber should demand, in our
subjecting our selves to him, an ouning of him to be no
robber but an honest man, as the Tyrant demands in our
subjecting our selves to him in ouning him to be no Tyrant
but a Magistrate, then we ought not to yeeld it to the one
no more than to the other. For the Second, to allow them
<hi>Passive obedience</hi> is in-intelligible <hi>Non-sense,</hi> &amp; a meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction:
for nothing thats meerly passive can be obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
as relative to a Law, nor can any obedience be meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passive, for obedience is always active. But not only is
the inaccuracy of the Phrase excepted against, but also that
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:41139:152"/>
position maintained by many, that in reference to a yoke of
Tyranny there is a time which may be called the proper
season of suffering, that is, when suffering (in opposition
to acting or resisting) is a necessary &amp; indispensible duty,
and resisting is a sin: For if the one be an indispensible duty,
the other must be a sin at the same time: But this cannot be
admitted. For, though certainly there is such a season of
suffering, wherein suffering is Lawful, laudable &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and all must lay their account with suffering, and
litle else can be attempted but which will encrease suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;
yet even then we may resist as well as we can: and
these two, Resistence &amp; Suffering at the same time, are
not incompatible: <hi>David</hi> did bear most patiently the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
of his Sons usurpation, when he said, <hi>let the Lord do
to me as seemeth Him good 2 Sam.</hi> 15. 26. ch. 10. 12. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh
himself to fervent prayers <hi>Psal.</hi> 3. and yet these were
not all the weapons he used against him, Neither did he
ever oune him as a Magistrate. We are to suffer all things
patiently as the Servants of the Lord, and look to Him for
Mercy &amp; relief (Psal. 123. 2.) but we are not obliged to
suffer even in that season, as the slaves of men. Again,
suffering in opposition to resistence, does never fall under
any moral Law of God, execept in the absolutely extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Case of Christs passive obedience, which cannot
fall under our deliberation or imitation; Or in the case of a
positive Law, as was given to the <hi>Iewes</hi> to submit to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi>
which was express &amp; peculiar to them, as
shall be cleared. That can never be commanded as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible
duty, which does not fall under our free will
or deliberation, but the enemies will as the Lord permits
them, as the Case of suffering is. That can never be indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensible
duty which we may decline without sin, as we
may do suffering if we have not a call to it; yea in that case
it were sin to suffer, therefore in no case it can be formally
indispensibly commanded, so as we may not shift it if we
can without sin. Suffering simply the evil of punishment,
just or unjust, can never be a conformity to Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive
Will but only to His Providential disposal, it hath
not <hi>voluntas signi</hi> for its rule, but only <hi>voluntas beneplaciti.</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:41139:152"/>
All the Commands that we have for suffering, are either
to direct the <hi>manner</hi> of it, that it be Patiently &amp; Chearfully,
when forced to it wrongfully 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19, 20. or <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively</hi>
to determine our <hi>choise</hi> in an unavoidable alternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,
either to suffer or sin: and so we are commanded
rather to suffer than to deny Christ, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 33. and we
are commanded upon these termes to follow Christ to take
up His Cross, when He layes it on in His Providence
<hi>Math.</hi> 16. 24. See at length this cleared <hi>Lex rex Q. 30. Pag.</hi>
317-320. otherwise in no case subjection even Passive
can be a duty; for it is allwise to be considered under the
notion of a plague, Judgment, &amp; Curse to be complained
of as a burden, never to be ouned as a duty to Magistrats.
As we find the Lords, people resenting it as a servitude,
under which they were servants even in their oun Land,
which did yeeld increase unto the Kings whom the Lord
had set over them because of their sins, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 36. 37.
2. In diverse cases there may be some <hi>Complyance</hi> with a meer
occupant, that hath no right to reign; as upon this account
the Noble Marquis of <hi>Argyle</hi> and Lord <hi>waristoun</hi> suffered
for their Complyance with the Usurper <hi>Cromuel.</hi> Such may
be the warrantableness, or goodness, or necessity, or
profitableness of a Complyance, when people are by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
brought under a yoke which they cannot shake off,
that they may part with some of their Priviledges for the
avoidance of the loss of the rest, and for the conveniency
&amp; profit, peace &amp; safety of themselves and their Countrey,
which would be in hazard if they did not comply; they may
do whatsoever is due from them to the Publick weal, what
soever is an office of their station or place, or which they
have any other way a call unto, whatsoever may make
for their oun honest interest, without wronging others
or the Countries Liberties in their transactions with these
Powers, even though such a Complyance may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally
to the advantage of the Usurpers: Seeing good &amp;
necessary actions are not to be declined for the ill effects
that are accidental to them, and arise from the use which
others make of them. But though this may be yeelded in
some cases to such Usurpers, especially Conquerers, that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:41139:153"/>
have no right of occupying the empire, but are Capable of
it by derivation from the peoples consent: yet it must not
be extended to such Usurpers as are also Tyrants, that
have no right of their oun, nor are capable of any, and that
overturn all rights of subjects. To such we can yeeld no
Complyance, as may infer either transacting with them,
or ouning them as Magistrates. We find indeed the Saints
enjoyed Places under these, who were not their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates;
as <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and <hi>Esther</hi> was Queen
to <hi>Ahaswerus.</hi> But here was no Complyance with Tyrants
(for these Heathens were not such) only some of them were
extraordinary Persons, raised up by an extraordinary spirit,
for extraordinary ends, in extraordinary times, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be brought to an ordinary rule, as <hi>Esthers</hi> Mariage; and
all of them in their places kept the Law of their God, serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the work of their generation, defiled not themselves
with their Customes, acted against no good, and engaged
to no evil, but by their Complyance promoted the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of their Countrey, as <hi>Argyle</hi> &amp; <hi>waristoun</hi> did under
<hi>Cromuel.</hi> Again, we find they payed Custom to them, as
<hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 36. 37. and we read of <hi>Augustus</hi> his taxation uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
complyed with <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 1-5. and Christ payd it.
This shall be more fully answered afterwards. Here I shall
only say (1) It can never be proven that these were Tyrants.
(2) Christ Paid it with such a Caution, as Leaves the title
unstated; not for conscience (as tribute must be paid to
Magistrats <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5, 6.) but only that he might <hi>not offend</hi>
them (3) Any other instances of the Saints taxations are
to be judged forced acts, badges of their bondage, which
if they had been exacted as <hi>tests</hi> of their <hi>allegiance,</hi> they
would not have yeelded. Strangers also, that are not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
use to pay Custom in their trafficquing, but not as tests
of their allegiance. 3. There may be also in some cases <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
allowed to their Lawful Commands, because of the
Lawfulness of the thing commanded, or the coincidency of
another Just &amp; obliging Authority commanding the same.
We may do many things <hi>Tyranno Iubente</hi> which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and <hi>Tyranno premente</hi> which he enforces, and many
things also <hi>ipso sou volente seu nolente</hi> whether he will or not
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:41139:153"/>
But we must do nothing <hi>Tyranni jussu</hi> upon the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Command, in the acknowledgment of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
due by virtue of Allegiance, which we oune of
Conscience to a Lawful Magistrate. We must do nothing
which may seem to have an accessoriness to the Tyrants
unlawful occupancy, or which depends only on the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of his Authority to do it, or may entrench on the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Institution of Magistracy, or bring us into a Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Usurpers sin. In these cases we can neither yeeld
obedience in Lawful things, nor in unlawful: <q>Nor can
we oune absolute subjection, no more then we can oune
absolute obedience; for all subjection is enjoined in order
to obedience: And to plead for a Priviledge in point of
obedience, and to disclaim it in point of subjection, is
only the flattery of such, as having renounced with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
all distinction of obedience, would divest others
of all priviledges, that they may exercise their Tyranny
without Controll. <bibl>

                  </q> There
may be <hi>Addresses</hi> made, to such as are not rightful Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors
of the Government, for justice, or mercy, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
of some intollerable grievances, without scruple of
accepting that which is materially justice or mercy, or
seeking them at the hand of any who may reach them out
to us, though he that conveyes them to us be not interested
in the umpirage of them. Thus we find <hi>Ieremiah</hi> supplicated
<hi>Zedekiah</hi> for mercy, not to return to prison: and <hi>Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
to <hi>Cesar</hi> for justice. But in these Addresses, we may
not acknowledge the wicked Lawes that brought on these
grivances, nor conceal the wickedness no more than the
miserie of them which we have endured, nor may we oune
the Legal power of them that we address to take them off,
nor signify any thing, in the matter or manner of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations,
that may either import a declining our
Testimony for which we have suffered these grievances,
or a contradiction to our declinature of their pretended
Authority: Only we may remonstrate what cruelties we
have endured, and how terrible it will be to them to be
guilty of, or accessory to our blood in not pitying us; which
was all that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> did. And as for <hi>Pauls</hi> appeal, we find
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:41139:154"/>
he was threatened to be murdered by his Countrey-men
<hi>Act.</hi> 23. 14. from whose hands he was rescued, &amp; brought
before the judicatory of <hi>Festus</hi> the Roman deputy, not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarely;
thence also they sought to remand him to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
that they might kill him <hi>Act.</hi> 25. 3. whereupon he
demands in justice that he might not be delivered to his
accusers &amp; Murderers, but claims the benefite of the
Heathens oun Law, by that appeal to <hi>Cesar.</hi> which was
the only constrained expedient of saving his oun life <hi>Act.</hi>
28. 19. by which also he got an opportunity to witness for
Christ at <hi>Rome.</hi> But as shall be cleared further afterwards;
<hi>Cesar</hi> was not an Usurper over <hi>Iudea:</hi> which not obscurely
is insinuated by <hi>Paul</hi> himself, who asserts, that both his
person, &amp; his Cause Criminal of which he was accused (it
was not an Ecclesiastical Cause, &amp; so no advantage hence
for the <hi>Supremacy</hi>) appertained to <hi>Cesars</hi> Tribunal, and that
not only in fact but <hi>of right Act. 25. 10. I stand at Cesars
judgment seat where I ought to be judged.</hi> We cannot say this of
any tribunal, senced in the name of them that Tyrannize
over us. 5. I will not stand neither upon the Names &amp;
Titles of Kings &amp;c. to be given to Tyrants &amp; Usurpers, in
speaking to them or of them, by way of appellation or

8. It will be yeelded very readily by us, that a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
is not to be disouned meerly for his <hi>differing in Religion</hi>
from us, yea though he were a Heathen. We do not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oune

our Adversaries have insulted, as if our Principles &amp; Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
were therby disproved. But it is easy to answer 1. let
the words be considered; and we are confident, that <q>no
sober man will think, the acknowledgment of just &amp;
legal Authority &amp; due obedience, a rational ground to
infer, that Tyranny is thereby either allowed or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,

                  </q> Though In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
or difference of Religion does not make void
Authority where it is Lawfully invested; yet it may inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate
a person, and Lawfully seclude him from Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
both by the word of God, which expressly forbids
to set a <hi>Stranger</hi> over us who is not our <hi>brother Deut.</hi> 17. 15.
Which includes as well a stranger of a strange Religion as
one of a strange Countrey, and by the Lawes of the Land,
which do incapitate a <hi>Papist</hi> of all Authority, Supreme or
subordinate. And so if this <hi>Iames</hi> the 7/2 had been King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, if we had no more to object,
we should not have quarrelled his succession. 3. We both
give &amp; grant all that is in the Confession, viz. <hi>Dominium non
fundari in gratia,</hi> that Dominion is not founded on Grace.
Yet this remains evident, that a Prince who not only is of
another religion, but an avowed enemy to &amp; overturner of
the Religion established by Law, and intending &amp; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to introduce a false, heretical, blasphemous, &amp; Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
religion, can claim no just &amp; legal Authority, but
in this case the people may very Lawfully decline his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Authority; Nay they are betrayers of their Countrey
&amp; Posterity, if they give not a timeous &amp; effectual Check to
his Usurpings, and make him sensible that he hath no such
Authority. Can we imagine, that men in the whole of that
blessed work so remarkably led of God, being convocate
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:41139:155"/>
by a Parliament of the wisest &amp; worthyest men that ever
was in <hi>England,</hi> whom they did encourage, by writing,
&amp; preaching, &amp; every way to stand fast in their opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the then King displaying a banner for his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
(a court dream) against Religion &amp; Liberty; should
be so far left, as to drop that as a principle &amp; part of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which would sacrifice Religion it self to the lust
of a raging Tyrant? Must we beleeve, that a Religion-destroying
Tyrant is a righteous Ruler? And must we onne
him to be a Nursing father to the Church? Shall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the common bounds &amp; Limits, whereby the
Almighty hath bounded &amp; Limited Mankind, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
by an Article of our confession of faith, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is turned into a Court creed? Then welcome <hi>Hobs de
Cive,</hi> with all the rest of <hi>Pluto's</hi> train, who would bable
us into a belief, that the world is to be governed according
to the pleasure of wicked Tyrants. I would fain hope at
length the world would be awakened out of such ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
dreams, &amp; be ashamed any more to oune such fooleries.
And it may be, our two <hi>Royal Brothers</hi> have contributed
more to cure men of this Moral madness, than any who
went before them. And this is the only advantage, I know,
that the Nations hath reaped by their reign.</p>
               <p>9. Though we deny that <hi>Conquest</hi> can give a just Title
to a Croun; yet we grant in some cases, though in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
it was unjust yet by the peoples after consent it may
be turned into a just Title. It is undenyable, when there is
just ground of the war; if a Prince subdue a whole Land,
who have justly forfeited their Liberties, when by his grace
he preserves them, he may make use of their right now
forefeited, and they may resign their Liberty to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and consent that he be their King upon fair &amp; Legal
&amp; not Tyrannical conditions. And even when the war is
not just, but successful on the invading Conquerours side,
this may be an inducement to the Conquered, if they be
indeed free and uningaged to any other, to a submission,
dedition, &amp; delivery up of themselves to be the subjects of
the victor, and to take him for their Soveraign: as it is like
the case was with the Jewes in <hi>Cesars</hi> time, whose Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:41139:155"/>
was translated by dedition to the <hi>Roman</hi> power;
in the translation when a doing there was a fault, but after
it was done it ceased; though the begining was wrong,
there was a post-fact which made it right, and could not
be dissolved without an unjust disturbance of publick order.
Whence, besides what is said above, in answer to that
much insisted Instance of <hi>Christs paying tribute,</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
it to be paid to <hi>Cesar,</hi> the difficulty of that instance
may be clearly solved. That Tribute which he paid, <hi>Math.</hi>
17. 24. &amp;c. and that about the payment whereof He was
questioned <hi>Math.</hi> 22. 21. seem to be two different Tributes.
Many think very probably they were not one &amp; the same
Tribute. Its a question, for whom &amp; by whom that of
<hi>Math.</hi> 17. was gathered; its most likely it was gathered by
the officers of the <hi>Temple</hi> for its service: however the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was made with such caution (tacitely declining the
strict right to exact it from him, but to avoid <hi>offence,</hi> in an
act in it self unobliging) that their claim is left as much
in the dark, as if the question had never been moved. The
other <hi>Math.</hi> 22. was exacted for <hi>Cesar:</hi> but to that captious
question our Lord returns such an Answer, as might both
solve it, and evade the snare of the proponders, giving a
general Rule of giving to God &amp; to <hi>Cesar</hi> each their oun,
without defining which of them had the right to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in question; whether <hi>Cesar</hi> should have it, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it should be payed only for the Temples use: Upon
which they marvelled; which they needed not do, if they
had understood in His words an express &amp; positive declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an obligation to make that payment to <hi>Cesar;</hi> for
then they would have obtained one of their ends, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Him odious to the people, who were not satisfied
with the payment of it. But however, the knot is loosed
by considering, that they were now Lawfully subject to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours as their Governours, to whom they
were obliged (I do not say Christ was) to pay tribute.
For they had yeelded themselves unto &amp; ouned the <hi>Roman</hi>
Dominion, in <hi>Pompey, Cesar Augustus, &amp; Tiberius,</hi> ere
this question about Tribute paying was proposed to our
Saviour, and therfore they who stuck at the payment of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:41139:156"/>
it were a seditious party dissenting from the body of the
Nation: Else it is not supposable readily, that their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
in <hi>Iudea</hi> could have been exercised long without
some consent, sufficient to legitimate it to the present Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
And this is the more likely, if we consider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the <hi>Iewes</hi> themselves, disavowing the power of
Capital punishment; <hi>It is not Lawful for us to put any man to
death,</hi> And ouning <hi>Cesar</hi> as their King, with an exclusive
a brenounciation of all other, <hi>we have no King but Cesar:</hi> As
<hi>Paul</hi> also acknowleeges he <hi>ought to be judged</hi> at <hi>Cesars</hi> bar,
in his appeal to <hi>Cesar.</hi> It is also acknowledged by very
good Authors, that this was the tribute which <hi>Iudas</hi> the
<hi>Galilean</hi> stood up to free the people from, and that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of those <hi>Iewes</hi> that folowed him mentioned <hi>Act.</hi>
5. 37. who mutinied upon this occasion, was according to
<hi>Gamaliels</hi> speech disallowed by that <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> or Council
of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> And it may be gathered out of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that
the <hi>Iewes</hi> of <hi>Hircanus</hi> his party came under the <hi>Roman</hi> power
by consent &amp; dedition; while they of <hi>Aristobalus</hi> his party
looked upon the <hi>Romans</hi> as Usurpers. Which difference
continued till our Saviours time, when some part of them
acknowledged the <hi>Cesarean</hi> Authority, some part looked
upon it as an Usurpation, and of this generally were the
<hi>Pharisees.</hi> To confirm this, <hi>Calvins</hi> Testimony may be
adduced, upon <hi>Math.</hi> 22. who sayeth, <q>the Authority of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Emperours was by common use approved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> whence it was manifest that
the <hi>Iewes</hi> had now of their oun accord imposed on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a Law of paying the tribute, because they had
passed over to the <hi>Romans</hi> the power of the sword.</q>And
<q> 
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Chamiers Panstrat Tom. 2. lib. 15. cap. 16. pag.</hi> 635.</bibl> what
then? if <hi>Cesars</hi> Authority were from bad beginings, did
therefore Christ untruly say it was from above? Can no
power at first unjust, afterward become just? if that
were so, then either none, or very few King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>10. As Tyranny is a destructive plague to all the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of men &amp; Christians; So <hi>Anarchy,</hi> the usual product
of it, is no less pernicious, bringing a Community into a
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:41139:156"/>
Paroxysme as deadly &amp; dangerous. We must oune Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to be absolutely necessary, for the constitution
&amp; conservation of all Societies. I shall not enter into a
disquisition, let be determination, of the <hi>Species</hi> or Kind
of Magistracy, whether <hi>Monarchy, Aristocracy,</hi> or <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi>
be preferable. My dispute at present is not levelled
against <hi>Monarchy,</hi> but the present Monarch: Not against
the Institution of the Species (though I beleeve, except
we betake our selves to the Divine allowance &amp; permission;
we shal be as pusled to find out the Divine Original of it,
as Cosmographers are in their search of the Spring of <hi>Nilus</hi>
or Theologues of the Father of <hi>Melchizedeck</hi>) but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of this Individual Monarchy established among
us; which in its root &amp; branch, Spring &amp; streams, in its
Original, Nature, ends, &amp; effects, is Diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to Religion &amp; Liberty; And because its Contagion,
universally perverting &amp; corrupting all the ends &amp; Orders of
Magistracy, doth affect &amp; infect all the subordinate offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
deriving their power from such a filthy fountain;
we must also substract &amp; deny their demanded ackowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as any way due, so long as they serve the pride
&amp; projects of such a wicked power: And do not reckon
our selves obliged by Covenant, or any otherways (though
in the <hi>third Article</hi> of the Solemn League, we are bound
to preserve the rights &amp; priviledges of our Parliaments, &amp;
consequently the honour &amp; deference thats due to our
Peers, or other Parliament men, acting according to the
trust committed to them, but not when they turn Traitors
ingaged in a Conspiracy with the Tyrant) to oune or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
a Soul-less shadow of a Court Cabal, made up of
persons who have sold themselves to work wickedness,
in conspiring with this throne of iniquity against the Lord,
which is all we have for a Parliament, whom we can in
no ways oune as our Representatives, but must look upon
them as perjured &amp; perfidious Traitors to God &amp; their
Countrey, which they have betrayed into the hands of a
Tyrant; And therefore divested of that power &amp; Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which they had of the people as their Representatives,
which now is returned to the fountain. And therefore
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:41139:157"/>
we must act as we can against them, and also what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for securing of our selves, Religion &amp; Liberty,
without them. We would think <hi>Nobles,</hi> ennobled with
virtue, a great Mercy &amp; encouragment. And if they would
concur in the Testimony for Religion &amp; Liberty, we
would be glad that they should lead the van and prove
themselves to be powers appointed by God, in acting for
Him &amp; His Interest. But for the want of their Conduct,
we must not surcease from that duty that they abandon,
nor think that the Concurrence of Peers is so necessary to
legitimate our actions, as that without that formality our
resolutions to maintain the Truth of God on all hazards,
in a private Capacity, were unlawful in the Court of God
&amp; Nature: But on the contrare must judge, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishing
or opposing their duty, which before God they
are obliged to maintain, preserve, &amp; promove, is so far
from loosing our obligation, or eximing us from our duty,
that is should rather press us to prosecute it with the more
vigour, without suspending it upon their precedency. For
now they can pretend to no precedency, when they do not
answer the end of their erection, and do not seek the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
good but their oun private advantage, they cease to
be the Ministers of God &amp; of the people, and become pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
persons. And reason will conclude, that <q>when the
<hi>Ephori</hi> or <hi>Trustees</hi> betray their Trust, and sell or basely
give away the Liberties &amp; Priviledges of the people,
which they were entrusted with, the people cannot be
brought into a remediless condition; if a Tutor waste &amp;
destroy the pupills estate,the Law provides a remedy
for the pupil</q>  
                  <hi>Ius popu. vind. cap. 15. pag.</hi> 335. 336. <q>The
remedy in this case can only be, as every one must move
in his oun sphere, while all concur in the same duty;
So if any in higher place become not only remiss, but
according to the influence of their power would seduce
others into their Apostasie, it is their duty to resist &amp;
endeavour their Reformation or removal: And if these
more eminently entrusted shall turn directly Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
&amp; obstructive &amp; destructive to common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the people of an inferior degree may step forward
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:41139:157"/>
to occupy the places, &amp; assert the Interests, which they
forefault &amp; desert. Neither is this a breach of good order;
for <hi>Ordor</hi> is only a mean subordinate to, &amp; intended for the
Glory of God &amp; the peoples good, and the regulation
thereof must only be admitted as it is conducible &amp; not
repugnant to these ends. A Generals command to his
souldiers in battel, does not impede the necessity of
succession, in case of vacancy of any charge, either
through death or desertion, even of such as in quality
may be far inferior to those whose places they step into,</q>
                  <hi>Naph. Pag. 151. Prior Edition.</hi> I do not assert this for private
peoples aspiring into the Capacity of <hi>Primores</hi> or <hi>Peers;</hi> but
that they may do that which the Peers desert, and dare not
or will not do, if the Lord put them in a Capacity to do it.
And more plainly I assert, that if the Peers of the Land,
whose duty it is principally to restrain &amp; repress Tyranny,
either connive at it or concur with it, and so abandon or
betray their Trust, then the Common people may do it;
at least are obliged to renounce, reject, &amp; disoune allegiance
to the Tyrant, without the peers. For which I offer these
reasons 1. Because all men have as much freedom &amp;
Liberty by nature as Peers have, being no more slaves than
they; because slavery is a penal evil contrare to nature,
and a miserie consequent of sin, and every man created
according to Gods image is <hi>res Sacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> a Sacred thing; And
also no more subjects to Kings &amp;c. than they; freedom
being natural to all, (except freedom from subjection to
Parents, which is a Moral duty &amp; most kindly &amp; natural,
and subjection of the wife to the husband &amp;c.) but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
as to Civil &amp; Politick subjection, man by nature is
born as free as beasts; No Lyon is born King of Lyons, nor
no man born King of men, nor Lord of men, nor Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
of men, nor Rulers of men, either supreme or
subordinate; because none by nature can have those things
that essentially constitute Rulers, the calling of God,
nor gifts and qualifications for it, nor the election of
the People. 2. The original of all that power, that

of Parliaments or publick Conventions for affairs of State,
necessity put the people, who could not so conveniently
meet all, to confer that honour &amp; burden upon the best
qualified, &amp; who had chief Interest, by Delegation. Hence
if the people give such a power, they may wave it when
perverted, and act without their oun impowered Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
3. The peoples power, is greater than the power
of any delegated or constituted by them; the Cause is more
than the effect; Parliament-men do represent the people,
the people do no not represent the Parliament: They are
as Tutors &amp; Curators unto the people, and in effect their
servants deputed to oversee their publick affairs, therefore
if their power be less the people can act without them. 4. It
were irrational to imagine, the people committing the
administration of their weighty affairs unto them, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nude
themselves of all their <hi>radical</hi> power; or that they can
devolve upon them, or they obtain, any other power but
what is for the good &amp; advantage of the people; therefore
they have power to act without them, in things which they
never resigned to them: for they cannot be deprived of that
natural aptitude, &amp; natures birth right, given to them by
God &amp; Nature, to provide the most efficacious &amp; prevalent
means for the preservation of their Rights &amp; Liberties.
5. As the people have had power before they made Peers,
and have done much without them; So these <hi>Primores</hi>
could never do without them, therefore in acts of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Interest, the Peers depend more upon the people than
the people does upon them. 6. All these primeve rights,
that gave rise to Societies, are equal to both People &amp;
Peers, whereof the Liberty to repress &amp; reject Tyranny is
a chief one. The People as well as Peers have a hard in
making the King, and other Judges also, as is clear from
<hi>Deut. 17. 14. Iudg. 9. 6. 1 Sam. 11. 15. 2 King.</hi> 14. 21.
therefore they may unmake them as well as they. To seek
to preserve the ends of Government, when they are over-turned,
is essentially requisite to all Societies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
common &amp; competent to all Constituents of these
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:41139:160"/>
Societies, Superiours or inferiours. The Glory of God &amp;
Security of Religion, the end of all Christian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
doth concern all equally. As every one equally is
bound to obey God rather than man, so violence in this
case, destroyes both the Commonwealth, &amp; maketh the
end &amp; the means of Government, and the injured persons
obligation thereto to cease, and this equally to every man
of Private or publick Capacity. In the Concern of Religion
at least, We must not think, because we are not Nobles
or in Authority, that the care of it or Reformation thereof
does nothing pertain to us; Nay in that, and carrying on
the work thereof, there is an equality; As in the erection
of the Old Testament <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> all the people were to
contribute a like, half a <hi>shekel Exod.</hi> 30. that it might be for
a rememberance before the Lord. Hence it followes, if
we disoune the Supreme Ruler, and the inferior confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with him, and cannot have the Concurrence of others;
<q>Now through the manifest &amp; notorious Perversion of the
great ends of Societie &amp; Government, the bond thereof
being dissolved, we Liberated there-from, do relapse
into our Primeve Liberty &amp; Priviledge, and accordingly
as the similitude of our Case &amp; exigence of our Cause
doth require, may upon the very same Principles again
joine &amp; associate, for our better defence &amp; Preservation,
as we did at first enter into Societies <bibl>
                        <hi>Naph. P.</hi> 150.</bibl>
                  </q> yet,
whatever we may do in this case; We are not for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
Assumptions of Authority, which maleversers
have forefaulted: Neither are we for new erections of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but are for keeping the Societie of which we are
members intire, in an endeavour to have all our fellow
members united unto God &amp; to one another, in Religion
&amp; Liberty, according to the bond of the Solemn League
&amp; Covenant. Certain it is that Greater Societies under one
Government, may in some cases make a Secession, &amp;
divide into Lesser without sedition: or else, how would
there be now so many distinct Common-wealths in the
world? seeing at first all was under one head: and how
comes it to pass, that there are so many Kingdoms in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
when it can be instanced when all, or the most part,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:41139:161"/>
were under on <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour? But this in our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is no way expedient, neither was it ever in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
But our aim is to abstract our selves inoffensively,
and maintain our rights that remain unrobbed, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
clossly to the fundamental Constitutions, Lawes, &amp;
Laudable Practices of our native Kingdome.</p>
               <p>11. We oune the obligation of our Sacred <hi>Covenants,</hi>
unrepealably &amp; indispensibly binding to all the duties of
Christian subjection to Magistrates. But we deny, that
hereby we are bound either to maintain <hi>Monarchy,</hi> especially
thus perverted; nor to oune the Authority of either of the
two Monarchs that have <hi>Monarchized</hi> or Tyrannized over
us these 27 years past. For as to the first we assert, that
that which is in its oun nature Mutable, cannot be simply
sworn unto to be maintained &amp; preserved, but <hi>Hypothetically</hi>
it most, else it were simply sinful; since it were to make
things, in their oun nature and in the Providence of God
changable, unchangable; yea it were a doun right swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not to comply with, but to spurn against, the various
vicisitudes of Divine Providence, the great Rector of the
Universe. And it is unquestionable, that when things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
&amp; unalterable are put in the same Oath, to make the
Engagment Lawful the things must be understood, as they
are in their oun nature and no otherwise: else both the
Imposer &amp; the Taker grievously transgress; the former,
in taking upon him what is in the power of no Morta, and
a Contradicton to the Prerogative of the Immorta God;
and the other, in ouning that power as just. Hence when
these two fall to be in the same Oath, they must be so under<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stood
as it may not be made a snare to the conscience of the
Sweaer. For it may fall so out in the Providence of God,
that the Preservation of both is in all respects made imposs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible:
And an adhesion to the one, may so far interfere
with the Preservation of the other, as if the <hi>Mutable</hi> and
that which hath no objective obligation be stuck to, the
other, which with the loss of all Interests we are to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
must be abandoned; yea, that which was sworn to
be maintained as a mean only, &amp; a mutable one too, may
not only cease to be a mean, but may actually destroy the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:41139:161"/>
main end, and then it is to be laid aside, because then it
inverts the order of things. Hence also it may be question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if it were not more convenient, to leave out those
things that are alterable in themselves, out of the same
Oath with things unalterable, and put them in a distinct
Oaths or Covenant by themselves; as we see <hi>Iehojadah</hi> did
2 <hi>King. 11. 17. He made a Covenant between the Lord and the
King &amp; the people, that they should be the Lords people; between
the King also &amp; the People.</hi> Here are two distinct Covenants;
the one made with God, about things eternally obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
wherein King &amp; people engage themselves upon
level ground, to serve the Lord, and Joash the King his
treacherous dealing with God in that matter brought the
Curse of that Covenant upon him: The other Covenant
was Civil, about things alterable, relating to Points of
Government &amp; Subjection. And as he, by virtue of that
prior Covenant, had obliged himself, under the pain of
the Curse thereof, to carry as one Covenanted to God
with the people, and so not to Tyrannize over his brethren:
So the people, by virtue of that same Covenant, were to
yeeld obedience, but in nothing to acknowledge him as
having power or Authority to countermand Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
Neither had it been an act of disloyaltie, to have
broken doun his Groves, which he had with the addition
of the guilt of Perjurie set up, and to have bound his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
hands from the blood of the Gracious <hi>Zechariah:</hi>
A perfect parallel to our Case under the former domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
save that it was out-done as to all dimensions of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
by him. To speak more plainly, the Religious
part of our Covenant is of an Eternal obligation: but as to
the Civil part, it is impossible it can ever be so, unless it be
well &amp; Cautiously understood, that is, unless instead of
any species of Government, as <hi>Monarchy,</hi> &amp;c. we put in
<hi>Magistracy</hi> it self. For this is that power which is of God:
but Monarchy &amp;c. is only a humane Creature, about the
creation whereof men take a Liberty, according to what
suits them best in their present Circumstances. And as to
this <hi>Species</hi> of Monarchy; men are never left at Liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to cloath therewith any inept or impious Person. And
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:41139:162"/>
they are perfectly loosed from it. 1. when that <hi>Species</hi> of
Government becomes opposite to the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and is turned Tyranny, especially when a legal
establishment is pretended; then it affects with its contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the very species it self: The house is to be pulled doun,
when the Leprosie is got into the walls &amp; foundation.
2. when as it is exercised, it is turned inept for answering
the end of its erection, and prejudicial to the main thing
for which Government is given, to wit, the Gospel and the
coming of Christs Kingdom: hence it is promised to the
Church, <hi>Isai. 49. 23. Kings shall be nursing fathers to the
Church</hi>—And <hi>Isai.</hi> 52. 15. It is promised to the Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iator,
that <hi>Kings shall shute their mouths</hi>—I. e. never a word in
their head, but out of reverence &amp; respect to His absolute
Soveraignty, they shall take the Law from Him, without
daring to contradict, far less to take upon them to prescribe
in the House of God, <hi>as they in their wisdom think fit.</hi>
3. when Providence, without any sinful hand, makes that
<hi>species</hi> impossible to be kept up, without the ruine of that for
which it was erected: when things come to this push &amp;
pinch, whosoever are cloathed with the power are then
under an obligation to comply with that alteration of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
for the safety of the people; else they declare
themselves unworthy of rule, and such who would sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
the interest of the people to their particular interest; in
which case the people may make their <hi>Publick servant</hi> sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible,
he is at his highest elevation but a <hi>Servant.</hi> Hence, now
when this <hi>species</hi> named in the Covenant, <hi>viz, Monarchy,</hi>
is by Law so vitiate, as it is become the mean &amp; instrument
of the destruction of all the ends of that Covenant, and now
by Law transmitted to all successors as a hereditary, pure,
perfect, &amp; perpetual opposition to the coming of Christs
kingdom; So that as long as there is one to wear that
Croun (but <hi>Iehavah</hi> will in righteousness execute <hi>Coniahs</hi>
doom upon the race <hi>Ier. 22. ult. write this man childless</hi>—)
and enter heir to the Government as now established, he
must be an enemy to Christ; there is no other way left,
but to think on a new Modell moulded according the true
Pattern. As to the <hi>Second,</hi> we are far less obliged to oune
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:41139:162"/>
&amp; acknowledge the interest of any of the two Monarchs,
that we have been Mourning under these many years,
from these Sacred Covenants. For as to the <hi>first</hi> of them,
<hi>Charles the</hi> 2. Those Considerations did cassate his Interest,
as to any Covenant obligation to oune him. 1. In these
Covenants we are not sworn <hi>absolutely</hi> to maintain the Kings
Person &amp; Authority, but only <hi>Conditionally,</hi> in <hi>the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
&amp; defence of Religion &amp; Liberties.</hi> Now when this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was not performed, but on the contrare professedly
resolved never to be fulfilled; And when he laid out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the full of his power &amp; Authority, for the destuction
of that Reformed Religion &amp; Liberties of the Kingdom;
which he solemnly swore to defend when he received the
Croun, only in the termes that he should be a Loyal subject
to Christ, and a true &amp; faithful Servant to the people, in
order to which a Magistrate is chosen, and all his worth,
excellency, &amp; valuableness consists in his answering that
purpose; for the excellency of a mean, as such, is to be
measured from the end, and its answerableness thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
We were not then obliged, to maintain such an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to these precious Interests. 2. Because, as the people
were bound to him, so he was bound to them by the same
Covenant, being only on these termes entrusted with the
Government: All which Conditions he perfidiously broke,
whereupon only, his Authority &amp; our Allegiance were
founded; And thereby we were loosed, from all recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
obligation to him by virtue of that Covenant. 3. Though
he and we stood equally engaged to the duties of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
only with this difference, that the Kings Capacity
being greater, he was the more obliged to have laid out
that power, in causing all to stand to their Covenant En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagments,
as <hi>Iosiah</hi> did 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 31, 32, 33. (But alas
there was never a <hi>Iosiah</hi> in the race) yet he rose up to the
hight of rebellion against God and the people, in heaven-daring
insolency, and not only brake but burnt that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and made Lawes to case &amp; rescind it, and made a
not-concurring in this Conspiracy a note of incapacity for
any Trust, in Church or State. Therefore to plead for an
ouning of him in this case, were only concludent of this,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:41139:163"/>
that the Generation had dreamed themselves into such a
distraction, as may be feared will be pursued with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and make such dreamers the detestation of
posterity, and cause all men Proclaim the righteousness of
God, in bringing ruine upon them by that very power &amp;
Authority they ouned in such circumstances. 4. It is a
known maxime, <hi>Qui non implet conditionem a se promissam cadit
beneficio; &amp; qui remittit obligationem non potest exigere.</hi> He that
does not fulfill the conditions falls from the benefit of it,
and whoso remitts the obligation of the party obliged upon
condition, cannot exact it afterwards. So then it is evident
that the subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were by King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">de</hi> his
consent, yea express command, disengaged from so much
of that Covenant as could be alledged in favors of himself:
So that all that he did, by burning &amp; rescinding these Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
and pursuing all who endeavoured to ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere to
them, was a most explicite Liberating his subjects from,
&amp; remission of their Allegiance to him (and in this we had
been fools, if we had not taken him at his word) yea he
rescinded his very <hi>Coronation,</hi> by an act of his first Parliament
after his return, which did declare null &amp; void all Acts,
Constitutions, &amp; establishments, from the year 1633 to
that present session, not excepting those for his oun Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
after which he was never recrouned, And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we could not oune that right, which himself did
annul. But as for his <hi>Royal Brother, Iames</hi> the 7/2 we cannot
indeed make use of the same reasons &amp; arguments, to
disoune him, as we have now adduced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet, as we shall
prove afterwards, this Covenant does oblige to renounce
him. So it is so clear, that it needs no Illustration, that
there lies no obligation from the Covenant to oune him:
And also that for this cause we are obliged not to oune
him. 1. Because as he is an enemy to the whole of our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and especially to these terms upon which Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is to be ouned therein: So he will not come under
the bond of this Covenant, nor any other compact with
the people, but intrude himself upon the Throne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n such
a way as overturns the Basis of our Government, and
destroyes all the Liberties of a free people, which by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:41139:163"/>
we are bound to preserve, and consequently as
inconsistent therewith, to renounce his Usurpation.
For, a Prince that will set himself up without any trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
with the people, or conditions giving Security for
Religion &amp; Liberty, is an Usurping Tyrant, not bounded
by any Law but his oun lusts. And to say to such an one,
<hi>Reign thow over us,</hi> is all one as to say, come thow and
play the Tyrant over us, and let thy lust &amp; will be a Law
to us: which is both against Scripture &amp; Natural-sense. If
he be not a King upon Covenant termes, either expressly
or tacitely, or general stipulations according to the word
of God &amp; Lawes of the Land, he cannot be ouned as a
father, Protector, or Tutor, having any fiduciary power
entrusted to him over the Commonwealth, but as a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
&amp; absolute Dominator, assuming to himself a power
to rule or rage as he lists: whom to oune were against our
Covenants; for there we are sworn to <hi>Maintain his Maj.
just &amp; Lawful Authority,</hi> and by consequence not to oune
<hi>Usurpation &amp; Tyranny,</hi> stated in opposition to Religion &amp;
Liberty, which there also we are engaged to maintain.
Sure, this cannot be Lawful Authority which is of God,
for God giveth no power against Himself; Nor can it be
of the people, who had never power granted them of God
to create one over them, with a Liberty to destroy them,
their Religion &amp; Liberty, at his pleasure. 2. As he is not
nor will not be our <hi>Covenanted</hi> &amp; sworn King (and therefore
we cannot be his Covenanted &amp; sworn subjects) So he is
not nor can not be our <hi>Crouned King,</hi> and therefore we
must not be his <hi>Liege subjects,</hi> ouning fealty &amp; obedience to
him. For according to the National Covenant; as <q>all
Lieges are to maintain the Kings Authority, consistent
with the subjects Liberties; which if they be innovated
or prejudged, such Confusion would ensue, as this
realme could be no more a free Monarchy—So for the
Preservation of true Religion, Lawes, &amp; Liberties of
this Kingdom, it is statute by the 8 <hi>Act. Parl. 1, repeated
in the 99 Act. Parl. 7. ratified in the 23. Act. Parl.</hi> 11.
<hi>and 114 Act. Parl. 12. of King Iames 6. and 4 Act of K.
Charles</hi> 1. that all Kings &amp; Princes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> at their coronation &amp;
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:41139:164"/>
reception of their Princely, Authority, shall make their
faithful Promise by their solemn Oath, in the presence of
the Eternal God; That enduring the whole time of their
lives, they shall serve the same Eternal God, to the
utter-most of their power, according as He hath required
in His most holy Word, contained in the Old &amp; new
Testaments, and according to the same Word, shall
maintain the true Religion of Christ Jesus, the preaching
of His holy Word, the due &amp; right Ministration of the
Sacraments, now received &amp; Preached within this realme
(according to the Confession of faith immediatly preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
and shall abolish &amp; gainstand all false religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the same; And shall rule the people committed
to their charge, according to the will &amp; Command of
God, revealed in His fore-said Word, and according to
the Laudable Lawes &amp; Constitutions received in this
realme, no wayes repugnant to the said Will of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
God; And shal procure, to the uttermost of their
power, to the Kirk of God &amp; whole Christian people,
true &amp; perfect peace in all time coming; And that they
shall be careful to root out of their Empire all Hereticks
&amp; Enemies to the true Worship of God, who shall be
convicted by the true Kirk of God of the foresaid Crimes.</q> 
Now this <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> he hath not taken, he will not,
he cannot take; and therefore cannot be our Crouned
King according to Law. As there be also many other Lawes
incapacitating his admission to the Croun, being a Professed
Papist, and no Law for it at all, but one of his oun making
by a Pacqued Cabal of his oun Complices, a Parliament,
wherein himself presided as Commissioner, enacting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
his succession, and rescinding all these Ancient
Lawes: which <hi>Act of Succession</hi> (which is all the legal right
he can pretend to in <hi>Scotland</hi>) because it cannot be justified,
therefore his right cannot be ouned, which is founded upon
the subversion of our Ancient Lawes. But as he cannot be
our Legally Crouned King, so he is not so much as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
Crouned. And therfore before his Inauguration,
whatever right to be King (whom the Representatives may
admit to the Government) he may pretend to, by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:41139:164"/>
Succession; yet he cannot formally bemade King, till
the people make a <hi>Compact</hi> with him, upon termes for the
safety of their dearest &amp; nearst Liberties, even though he
were not disabled by Law. He might, as they say, pretend
to some <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> but he could have no <hi>jus in re.</hi> The Kings
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> while uncrouned, can exerce no Royal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
for the Coronation in Concret, according to
the substance of the Act, is no <hi>Ceremonie</hi> (as they, who
make Conscience it self but a Ceremony, call it) nor an
accidental ingredient in the Constitution of a King, but as
it is distinctive, so it is Constitutive: it distinguished <hi>Saul</hi>
from all <hi>Israel,</hi> and made him from no King to be a King,
it is <hi>dative</hi> &amp; not only <hi>Declarative;</hi> it puts some honour upon
him that he had not before. 3. Though the Lawes should
not strike against his Coronation, And though the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives
Legally should take the same measures with
him that they took with his brother, and admit him upon
the termes of the Covenant; yet after such doleful experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of such transactions with these Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> who
must not be taken with hands, nor by the hand, it were
hard to trust, or entrust them with the Government, even
though they should make the fairest Professions: Since they
whose Principle is to <hi>keep no faith to Hereticks</hi> (as they call us)
and who will be as absolute in their promises as they are in
their power, have deservedly forefeited all Credit &amp; Trust
with honest men; so that none could rationally refer the
determination of a <hi>half Croun reckoning</hi> to any of them, far
less oune them &amp; their Government in the Managment of
the weightiest affairs of State, since their Male-versations
are written in such bloody Characters, as he that runs
may read them. At least it were wisdom, &amp; is our duty, to
take our Measures from the General Assemblies Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
with the other <hi>Brother,</hi> before his admission to the
Government, to suspend our Allegiance to him until
Authority be Legally devolved upon him, and founded
upon &amp; bounded by termes giving all security for Religion
&amp; Liberty.</p>
               <p>12. As I said before; wary <hi>Prudence,</hi> in waving such an
impertinent &amp; Ticklish Question, cannot be condemned:
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:41139:165"/>
since what ever he may be in conscience, no man in Law
can be obliged, so far to surrender the common Priviledge
of all Mankind, to give an account of all his inward
thoughts, which are alwise said to be <hi>free.</hi> And as in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
they are more various, so in nothing they can be
more violented, than to have our opinion &amp; sentiments of
the current Government extorted from us; a declining of
which Declaration of thoughts, where no <hi>overt Act</hi> in
project or practice can be proven against it, cannot be <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
in any Law in the world: So a Cautelous Answer, in
such a ticklish &amp; entrapping imposition, cannot be censured
in point of Lawfullnesse of expediency, even though
much be concedded, to stop the Mouths of these bloody
Butchers, gaping greedily after the blood of the Answerer;
if he do not really <hi>oune,</hi> but give them to understand he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>approve</hi> of, this Tyranny. But as these poor faithful
Witnesses, who were helped to be most free, have alwise
been honoured with the most signal Countenance of the
Lord in a happy issue of their Testimony: So those that
used their Prudentials most, in seeking shifts to sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and studying to satisfie these <hi>Inquisitors</hi> with their
stretched Concessions, were ordinarly more exposed to
snares, and found less satisfaction in their Sufferings, even
though they could say much to justify, or at least extenuate
their Shiftings. I knew one, who had proof of this, who
afterwards was ashamed of this kind of Prudence. A short
account of whose managing of Answers to this Question,
because it may conduce somewhat to the explication of it,
may here be hinted. The question moved after the usual
forme, was, <hi>Do ye onne the Authority of King Iames the</hi> 7?
In answer to which, he pleaded first, for the immunity of
his thoughts, which he said were not subject to theirs or any
Tribunal. When this could not be an evasion from their
extortions, he objected the ambiguity of the termes in
which the Question was conceived, being capable of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
senses: And inquired, what they meant by <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</hi>
what by <hi>ouning</hi> Authority? By Authority, whether
did they mean the <hi>Administration</hi> of it, as now improved?
if so, then he was not satisfied with it: or the <hi>right</hi> as now
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:41139:165"/>
established? if so, then he was not clear to give his opinion
of it; as being neither significant nor necessary, and that it
was fitter for Lawyers, and those that were better acquaint
with the <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> than for him to dispute it. Again
he asked, what they meant by <hi>ouning?</hi> either it is <hi>Passive
subjection;</hi> that he did not decline: or <hi>Active acknowledgment</hi>
of it; and that he said he looked upon as all the <hi>suffrage</hi> he
could give to its establishment in his station, which he must
demur upon some scruple. The replies he received were
very various, and some of them very rare, either for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or imposture. Sometimes it was answered: To oune
the Kings Authority, is to take the <hi>Oath of Allegiance;</hi> this
he refused. Some answered, it is to engage never to rise in
Armes against the King upon any pretence whatsoever;
this he refused likewise. Others explained it to be, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his right to be King: To this he answered,
when the Authority is Legally devolved upon him by the
Representatives of both Kingdoms, it was time enough
for him to give account of his sentiments. Others defined
it, to oune him to be Lawful King by succession: To this
he Answered, he did not understand succession could make
a man formally King, if there were not some other way of
Conveyance of it; it might put him in the nearest Capacity
to be King, but could not make him King. Some did thus
Paraphrase upon it, that he must oune him to be his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Lord under God, and Gods vicegerent, to be obeyed
in all things Lawful: To this he answered, whom God
appoints, and the People choose according to Law, he
would oune. When those shifts would not do, but
from time to time being urged to a <hi>Categorical</hi> Answer;
he told them, he was content to live in subjection to
any Government Providence set up, but for ouning
the present Constitution as of God and according to
Law, he durst not acknowledge it, nor oune any Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
as his Lawful Soveraign, but in termes consistent
with the Covenant securing Religion and Liberty.
This not satisfying, when he came to a more pinching
Trial; he declared, he ouned all Lawful Authority ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Word of God, and all Authority that was
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:41139:166"/>
the Ordinance of God by His Preceptive Will, and he
could be subject to any; but further to acknowledge it,
he behooved to have more clearness, for sometimes a
Nation might be charged with that, <hi>ye have set up Kings and
not by me</hi> &amp;c Further he conceded, he ouned his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
Advancement to the Throne; he ouned as much
as he thought did oblige him to subject himself with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
he ouned him to be as Lawful as providence pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
him of the Throne of his Ancestors, and Lineal
succession, as presumed next in blood &amp; line, could make
him: But still he declined to oune him as <hi>Lawful King,</hi> and
alledged that was all one, whether he was Lawful or not,
he refused not <hi>subjection,</hi> distinguishing it always from <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance.</hi>
But all these concessions did not satisfie them,
&amp; they alledged he might say all this of a <hi>Tyrant:</hi> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
commanded him to give it under his hand, to oune
not only the <hi>Lineal</hi> but the <hi>Legal</hi> succession of King <hi>Iames</hi>
the 7. to the Croun of <hi>Scotland:</hi> which he did, upon a
fancy that <hi>Legal</hi> did not import <hi>Lawful,</hi> but only the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
of their Law; withal protesting, he might not be
interpreted to <hi>approve</hi> of his succession. But this was a vain
<hi>Protestatio contra factum.</hi> However by this we see, what
is <hi>ouning this Authority,</hi> in the sense of the <hi>Inquisitors.</hi> The
result of all is, to acknowledge Allegiance to the present
possessor, and to approve his pretended Authority as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
Rightful, &amp; Righteous: which indeed is the true
sense of the Words, and any other that men can forge or
find out is strained. For, to speak properly, if we oune
his Authority in any respect, we oune it to be Lawful:
for eyery <hi>Authority,</hi> that is ouned to be Authority indeed,
is Lawful; <hi>Authority</hi> alwayes importing <hi>Authorization,</hi>
and consisting in a <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Call</hi> to rule, and is formally &amp;
essentially contradistinct to <hi>Usurpation:</hi> wherever the place

equivocal Authority, no real denomination: if we
then oune this Mans Authority, we oune it to be Lawful
Authority: And if we cannot oune it so, we cannot oune
it at all. For it is most suitable, either to manly ingenuity,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:41139:166"/>
or Christian simplicity, to speak properly, and to take
words always in the sense that they to whom they are speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will understand them, without equivacating.</p>
               <p>These Preliminaries being thus put by, which do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to clear somewhat in this Controversie, and both
furnish us with some Arguments for, and solutions in most
of the objections against, my <hi>Thesis</hi> in answer to the
Question above stated. I set it doun thus. <hi>A people long
oppressed with the Encroachments of Tyrants &amp; Usurpers, may
disoune all Allegiance to their pretended Authority, and when
imposed upon to acknowledge it, may &amp; must ratber chuse to suffer,
than to oune it.</hi> And consequently we cannot as matters
now stand oune, acknowledge, or approve the pretended
Authority of King <hi>Iames</hi> the 7. as Lawful King of <hi>Scotland;</hi>
as we could not as matters then stood oune the Authority
of <hi>Charles</hi> the 2. This consequence is abundantly clear from
the foregoing deduction, demonstrating their Tyranny
&amp; usurpation. In prosecuting of this General <hi>Thesis,</hi> which
will evince the particular <hi>Hypothesis:</hi> I shall. 1. Adduce
some <hi>Historical</hi> Instances, whence it may be gathered,
that this is not altogether without a precedent, but that
people have disouned Allegiance to Tyrants &amp; Usurpers,
before now. 2. Deduce it from the Dictates of <hi>reason.</hi> 3.
Confirme it by <hi>Scripture</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <p>I. Albeit, as was shewed before, this Question as now
stated, is in many respects unprecedented; yet the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
which in our day hath been the result of it, to wit,
to <hi>disoune</hi> or <hi>not to oune</hi> Prevailing Dominators Usurping
the Government or abusing it, is not so alien from the
examples of <hi>History,</hi> but that by Equivalency or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it may be collected from, &amp; confirmed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
               <p>1. To begin at home, besides many Passages related al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
for confirmation, we may adde (1) That for about
1025. years, the people had in their choise whom to oune
ar admit to succeed in the Government, even though<q> the
 Kingdom was hereditary; and used to elect, not such
who were nearest in blood &amp; line, but these that were
judged most fit for Government, being of the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:41139:167"/>
of <hi>Fergus, Buchan.</hi>

3.</bibl>
                  </q> This continued until the dayes of <hi>Kenneth</hi> the 3.
who to cover his villanous Murder of his Brothers Son
<hi>Malcolm,</hi> and prevent his and secure his oun sons succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
procured this Charter for Tyranny, the settlement
of the succession of the next in line from the Parliament:
which, as it pretended the prevention of many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
arising from Contentions &amp; Competions about
the succession; So it was limited by Lawes, Precluding
the succession of Fools or Monsters, and preserving the
peoples liberty to shake off the yoke, when Tyranny
should thereby be introduced: Otherwise it would have
been not only an irrational surrender of all their oune
Rights, &amp; enslaving the posterity, but an irreligious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Providence, refusing &amp; anticipating its Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
in such a case. However it is clear, before this
time, that as none but the fittest were admitted to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
So if any did usurpe upon it, or afterwards
did degenerate into Tyranny, they took such order with
him, as if he had not been admitted at all; as is clear in the
instances of the <hi>first Period,</hi> and would never oune every
pretender to hereditary succession. (2) As before <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths</hi>
dayes, it is hard to reckon the numerous Instances of
Kings that were dethroned, or imprisoned, or slain, upon
no other account than that of their oppression &amp; Tyranny:
So afterwards, they maintained the same power &amp; privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of repressing them, when ever they began to encroach.
And although no Nation hath been more patient towards
bad Kings, as well as Loyal towards good ones; yet in
all former times, they understood so well their Right
they had, and the duty they owed to their oun preservation,
as that they seldom failed of calling the exorbitantly flagi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tious
to an account. And albeit, in stead of condoling or
avenging the death of the Tyrannous, they have often both
excused &amp; justified it, yet no Kingdom hath inflicted se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
Punishments upon the Murderers of just &amp; righteous
Princes: And therefore, though they did neither enquire
after, nor animadvert upon those that slew <hi>Iames</hi> the 3. a
flagitious Tyrant, yet they did by most exquisite Torments
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:41139:167"/>
put them to death who slew <hi>Iames</hi> the 1. a vertuous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.
Hence, because these &amp; other instances I mind
to adduce of deposing Tyrants, may be excepted against, as
not pertinent to my purpose, who am not pleading for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auctoration
&amp; deposition of Tyrants, being impracticable
in our case: I shall once for all remove that, and desire
it may be considered. [1] That though we cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
exauctorate a Tyrant; yet he may <hi>ipso jure</hi> fall from
his right, and may exauctorate himself, by His Law by
whom Kings reign; and this is all we plead for as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of not ouning him. [2] Though we have not the
same power, yet we have the same grounds, and as great
&amp; good if not greater &amp; better reasons to reject &amp; disoune
our Tyrant, as they whose example is here adduced had to
depose some of their Tyrannizing Princes. [3] If they
had power &amp; ground to <hi>depose</hi> them, then a <hi>fortiori</hi> they
had power &amp; ground to <hi>disoune</hi> them; for that is less &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culded
in the other, and this we have. [4] Though it
should be granted, that they did not disoune them <hi>before</hi>
they were deposed; yet it cannot be said that they did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oune
them only <hi>because</hi> they were deposed: for it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that makes a Tyrant; it only declares him to be
justly punished, for what he was before. As the sentance
of a Judge does not make a man a murderer or Thief, only
declares him convict of these Crimes, &amp; punishable for
them; its his oun committing them that makes him Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal:
And as before the sentance, having certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the fact, we might disoune the Mans innocency
or honesty; So a Rulers Acts of Tyranny &amp; Usurpation
make him a Tyrant &amp; Usurper, and give ground to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oune
his just &amp; legal Authority; which he can have no more
than a Murtherer or Thief can have innocency or honesty.
(3) We find also examples of their disouning Kings
undeposed; as King <hi>Baliol</hi> was disouned with his whole
race, for attempting to enslave the Kingdoms Liberties to
forreign power. And if this may be done for such an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
as the greatest Court parasites &amp; Sycophants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
what then shall be done for such as attempt to subject
the people to Domestick or Intestine Slaverie? Shall we
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:41139:168"/>
refuse to be slaves to one without, and be, &amp; oune our
selves contented Slaves to one with in the Kingdom? It
is known also that King <hi>Iames</hi> the 1. his Authority was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
by his subjects in <hi>France,</hi> so long as he was a Prisoner
to the <hi>English</hi> there, though he charged them upon their
Allegiance, not to fight against the party who had his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
Prisoner: They answered, they ouned no Prisoner
for their King, nor owed no Allegiance to a Prisoner.
Hence Princes may learn, though people submit to their
Government; yet their resignation of themselves to their
obedience is not so full, as that they are obliged to oune
Allegiance to them, when either Morally or Physically
they are incapacitate to exerce Authority over them. They
that cannot rule themselves, cannot be ouned as Rulers
over a people.</p>
               <p>2. Neither hath there been any Nation, but what at
one time or other hath furnished examples of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The <hi>English</hi> History gives account, how some
of their Kings have been dealt with by their Subjects, for
impieties against the Law &amp; Light of Nature, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
upon the Lawes of the Land. <hi>Vortigernu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was dethroned for incestously marying his oun Sister. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did ever Blasphemies, Adulteries, Murders, Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
against the lives of Innocents, and taking them away
by <hi>Poison</hi> or <hi>Razor,</hi> use to escape the animadversion of
men, before they were Priest-ridden unto a belief that
Princes persons were sacred. And if men had that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
now, this man that now reigns might expect some
such animadversion. And we find also King <hi>Edward,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Richard</hi> the 2. were deposed, for Usurpation upon Lawes
&amp; Liberties, in doing whereof the people avowed. <hi>They
would not suffer the Lawes of England to be changed.</hi> Surely
the people of <hi>England</hi> must now be far degenerate, who
having such Lawes transmitted to them from their worthy
Ancestors, and they themselves being born to the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of them without a Change, do now suffer them to be so
encroached upon, and mancipate themselves, &amp; leave their
Children vassals to Poperie, &amp; slaves to Tyranny.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Dutch</hi> also, who have the best way of guiding
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:41139:168"/>
of Kings of any that ever had to do with them (witness
their having so many of them in Chains, now in <hi>Batavia</hi> in
the <hi>East Indies</hi>) are not wanting for their part to furnish
us with examples. When the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would not
condescend to govern them according to their Ancient
Lawes, and rule for the good of the people, they declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to be <hi>fallen from the Seigniorie of the Netherlands,</hi> and so
erected themselves into a flourishing Common-wealth. It
will not be amiss to transcribe some of the words of the
Edict of the <hi>Estates General</hi> to this purpose. <q>It is well known,
(say they) that a Prince &amp; Lord of a Countrey is Ordained
by God to be Soveraign &amp; Head over his subjects, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
&amp; defend them from all injuries, force, &amp; vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and that if the Prince therefore faileth therein,
and in stead of preserving his subjects, doth outrage &amp;
oppress them, depriveth them of their Priviledges &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Customs, commandeth them and will be served
of them as slaves; they are no longer bound to respect
him as their Soveraign Lord, but to esteem of him as a
Tyrant, neither are they bound to acknowledge him as
their Prince, but may abandon him &amp;c.</q> And with this
aggrees the answer of <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to the Edict
of <hi>Proscription,</hi> published against him by <hi>Philip. the</hi> II. <q>There
is, sayes he, a Reciprocal Bond betwixt the Lord &amp; his
vassal; so that if the Lord break the Oath, which he
hath made unto his vassal, the vassal is discharged of the
Oath made unto his Lord.</q> This was the very Argument
of the poor suffering people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereupon they
disouned the Authority of <hi>Charles the Second.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The Monarchy of <hi>France</hi> is very <hi>absolute;</hi> yet there
also the State hath taken order with their Tyrants; not
only have we many instances of resistances made against
them, but also of disouning, disabling, &amp; invalidating
their pretended Authority &amp; repressing their Tyranny. So

               <p>11. If we will revolve the old Roman Histories, we
shall find no small store of such examples, both in the time
of their Kings, Consuls, &amp; Emperours. Their seventh
King <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> was removed by the people, for
his evident Usurpation: <hi>Neque enim ad jus regni quicquam

for a right to the Government, but meer force, and got
the rule neither by the peoples consent &amp; choise, nor by
the Authority of the Senators. So afterwards the Empire

               <p>12. But it will be said. Can there be any Instances of
the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> adduced? Did ever they, while
groaning under the most insupportable Tyranny of their
Persecuting Emperours, disoune their Authority, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for not ouning it? To this I answer. 1. What they
did or did not of this Kind, is not of moment to inquire:
seeing their practice &amp; Example, under such disavantages,
can neither be known exactly, nor what is known of it be
accommodated to our case: for (1) they were never
forced to give their judgement, neither was the question
ever put to them, whether they ouned their Authority or
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:41139:172"/>
not: if they transgressed the Lawes, they were lyable to
the punishment, they craved no more of them. (2) They
confess themselves to be <hi>strangers,</hi> that had no establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by Law, and therefore they behoved to be passively
subject, when in no capacity to resist; there was no more
required of them. Yet <hi>Lex Rex Quest. 35. pag.</hi> 371. cites

                  </gap>ence: Many
of them refused to flee from the fury of Persecuters: They
ran to Martyrdom, when neither cited nor accused; And
to obtain the Croun thereof they willingly yeelded up their
lives &amp; Liberties also to the rage or Tyrants. We cannot
be obliged to all these. 2 Yet we find some examples not
altogether unapplicable to this purpose. When <hi>Baroch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach,</hi>
the pretended King of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> after the destruction
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> set himself up as King in <hi>Bitter</hi> a City in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia;</hi>
the Christians that were in his precincts, refused to
oune him as King; which was one great cause of his perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
them. Its true he persecuted them also for other
things, as for their not denying Christ; So are we perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for many other things, than for our simple disouning
of the King: yet this is reckoned as a distinct cause of their
suffering, by <hi>Mr Mede</hi> on the <hi>Revel. Part. 1. Pag. 43. Gees
Magist. Origin. ch. 10. Sect. 7. Pag.</hi> 361. The same last cited
Author shewes, that when <hi>Albinus, Niger;</hi> &amp; <hi>Cassius,</hi>
successively usurped the Empire, having none of them any
Legal investure, the Christians declined the recognition
of their Claim, and would not oune them; and that upon
this <hi>Tertulian</hi> sayes, <hi>Nunquam Albiniani, nec Nigriani, vel

could never be found to be <hi>Albinians,</hi> or <hi>Nigrians,</hi> or <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
meaning they were never ouners of these men for

that it is not without a Precedent for a Minister to
disoune a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> to refuse favour from him, yea and to
excommunicate him, yea even without the concurrence
of his fainting brethren; for all which some of our faithful
Ministers have been much condemned in our day, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Mr Donald Cargil</hi> for excommunicating <hi>Charles the
Second</hi> &amp; <hi>Iames Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> as if such a thing had never been
done before: Whereas we see what <hi>Ambrose</hi> did to <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
And this same faithful Minister <hi>Ambrosius</hi> Minister
at <hi>Millain,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> did also hold out of the Assembly of
the Christians <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour though a most
vertuous Prince, for that grievous Scandal committed by
him, against the innocent people at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> in killing
so many of them in a Passionate transport. But 3. since
this objection of the Primitive Christians is much insisted
on, both against this and the head of defensive Armes: I
shall further take notice of several distinctions, that do
make the difference between their case &amp; Ours very vast.
(1) There is a great difference betuixt a Prince of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Religion of his Subjects, but distinct from some of
them, whom yet he does not seek to entice to his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but gives them liberty &amp; the benefite of the Law as
other Subjects: (which was the case of many in these pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times sometimes.) And a Prince by all means, both
foul &amp; fair, pressing to a revolt from the true and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
a false Religion. In this case (which is ours with a
witness) it must be granted we should be wary, that we
neither engage with him, nor oune Allegiance to him, when
he would withdraw us from our Allegiance to God. (2)
There is a great difference betuixt a Prince, persecuting
the true Religion, which only a few of his subjects here &amp;
there did profess, who in regard of their Paucity were
never in capacity to be looked upon as the body of the
people, impowering him as their publick Servant: (which
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:41139:173"/>
was their case) And a Prince persecuting that Religion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
which was professed by the body of the Nation, when they
sett him up. In this Latter case, men of great sense have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
he should be ouned for a Prince, because then he is
stated against the Common good. This was our case under
the former King, and yet under this, though all Professors be
not now persecuted, the publick Religion &amp; Ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
is persecuted in a few, whom he intends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,
and in their destruction to bury it. (3) There is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
betwixt a Prince Persecuting Religion publickly oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
&amp; received of his subjects, yet never approved nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by <hi>Law</hi> (as it was not in the primitive times) And a
Prince persecuting Religion ratified &amp; established by the
Laws of the Land, which is our case. It will seem clear
to every soul, not benighted with Court darkness, that
he then <hi>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>acto</hi> and <hi>ipso jure</hi> falleth from his right in this case,
because now he is not only stated against the common
good, but against the very Laws by which the Subjects
must be ruled. Then he ruleth not as a Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom
the Law giveth his Measures &amp; Bounds, but rageth as a
Tiger &amp; Tyrant, and ought to be carried towards as such.
(4) There is a difference, betwixt a Prince suppressing
that Religion established by Law, which he never <hi>professed,</hi>
nor never gave his consent to these Laws (as might be
the case of some of the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperours) though it be
unlawful for any people to set up any Mortal over them,
who is not in this case bound to the good behaviour; And
a Prince, opposing, &amp; oppressing that Religion, which
himself hath <hi>professed</hi> and is ratified by Laws with his oun
consent: which was our case under the former King, who
did give the most solemn Ratification of them that ever
was given, but afterwards most perfidiously retracted it.
As also this <hi>Apostate Papist,</hi> did somtime profess himself
Protestant, and consented to the Laws establishing it,
and the Penal Statutes against Papists, though now he is
going about to raze all, and ruine that alone valuable
Treasure of our Nation, Religion. (5) There is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
betwixt a Prince consenting to Laws establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Religion which he now <hi>persecuteth</hi> (which might have
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:41139:173"/>
been the case of <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostate</hi>) And a Prince who
not only consented to these Laws, but who did upon
these very terms &amp; no other get &amp; receive his Croun &amp;
Scepter, that he should preserve the Religion as Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and protect as a Father the Professors thereof, and
maintain the Laws establishing it, which yet he perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously
&amp; perniciously, being once settled in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Breaks, Casts, Cassats, &amp; Overturns (which
was done by <hi>Charles</hi>) Or, And a Prince who will neither
be bounded by the Laws he consented to, nor be bound
to the Observation of any Laws whatsoever; but chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
it as his prerogative Royal, to be <hi>absolute</hi> above all
Laws, and denying all Security upon terms, is free to
destroy Religion &amp; Liberty, and all the valuable Interests of
the Nation, when he pleases. This is <hi>Iames</hi> his Character
(6) There is a difference, betwixt a Prince breaking the
main &amp; only Article of his Covenant, in a fit of fury &amp;
rage, being transported upon some Mistakes (which was
the case of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour) And a Prince not
only violating this upon deliberation, but plainly Declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that neither Oath nor Declaration can or will bind
him, but these being made void, he will destroy without
restraint all these Covenanted priviledges (This was the
case of <hi>Charles</hi>) Or, And a Prince, who, as he never
will come under the bond of a Covenant with his people,
So thô he make never so many fair promises with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Solemnities, maintains a principle that he will keep no
promises, but when &amp; with whom he pleases, and can get
a Dispensation to break all when he likes. (This is <hi>Iames</hi>
his Ingenuity.) Sure in this case, Such as are so Character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized
Declare themselves so far from being Princes, that
they profess befor the world, they are no more men to be
conversed with: for if neither their words, Writs, vowes,
promises, Oaths, Declarations, nor Protestations, can
bind them; what Society can be had with them? Are they
not to be looked upon &amp; carried towards as Common
Enemies of Morality, Religion, Righteousness, Liberty,
Humanity, yea even of Mankind it self? Now then, let
the world be Judge, if the people of <hi>Scotland</hi> can be judged
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:41139:174"/>
in Conscience, Reason, Prudence, Policie, or any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
way, bound to oune their Authority, being so
Stated, and by the Act Rescissory all humane ground re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinded,
that ever it shall be otherwise. let them go seek
other slaves where they can find them, for we will not sell
our selves &amp; posteritie to Tyrants as slaves, nor give up our
Religion and the exercise of it to the Mouldings of the
Court.</p>
               <p>II. In the <hi>Second</hi> place: It being clear from these fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Instances, that Tyrants &amp; Uusurpers have been
disouned; And it being also as clear as light can make any
thing, from the foregoing Account of their Government,
and all the Characters of Truculency Treachery, &amp; Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
conspicuously relucent therein, that these two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
whose Authority we are pressed to oune, were Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
&amp; Usurpers: It remains therefore to prove from
all dictates of Reason about Government, that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Authority could not nor cannot be ouned. For
the Argument runs thus; The Authority of Tyrants &amp;
Uusurpers cannot be ouned: But the Authority of <hi>Charles</hi>
&amp; <hi>Iames</hi> was &amp; is the Authority of Tyrants &amp; Usurpers:
Ergo their Authority cannot be ouned. Now its the <hi>Major</hi>
of this <hi>Syllogisim</hi> that I under take to prove. The <hi>Minor</hi> being
so clear from their History, that to prove it by witnesses
were <hi>actum agere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. All Authority to be ouned of men must be <hi>of God,</hi>
and <hi>ordained of God:</hi> for so the Apostle teacheth Expressly
Rom. 13. 1. &amp;c. Which is the alone formal reason of our
Subjection to them, and that which makes it a damnable
sin to resist them, because it is a resisting the <hi>Ordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce of
God.</hi> The Lord ounes Himself to be the Author of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats,
<hi>Prov. 8. 15. By me Kings reign and Princes decree Iustice.</hi>
As He is the Author of man and hath made him a sociable
Creature so He is the Author of the Order of humane
Society which is necessare for the Preservation of Mankind
He being the God of Order &amp; not of Confusion. And this
must hold not only of the Supreme Authority, but of
subordinate Magistrates also; for they must be included in
the higher Powers to whom we must be <hi>subject</hi> Rom. 13.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:41139:174"/>
And they that resist them resist Gods Ordinance too. Their
judgment is <hi>Gods,</hi> as well as the judgment of the Supreme
Magistrate <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 17. 2 Chron. 19. 6, 8. They are called
Gods among whom the Lord judgeth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 1. He
speaketh not there of a Congregation of Kings. We are to
be subject to them for the Lords sake, as well as to the
Supreme Magistrat 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. Therefore all Magistrats
superior &amp; Inferior are ordained of God in the respective
Places. Its true, <hi>Peter</hi> calls every degree of Magistracy,
an <hi>Ordinance of man,</hi> not that he denies it to be an Ordinance
of God (for so he would cantradict <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 13.) but
termes it so Emphatically, to commend the worth of
obedience to Magistrats though but men, when we do it
for the Lords sake: Not <hi>effectively</hi> as an invention of men,
but <hi>subjectively</hi> because exercised by men, &amp; created &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
by humane suffrages considered as men in Societie,
and <hi>objectively</hi> for the good of man, and for the external
Peace &amp; safety of man thereby differenced from the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
an Ordinance of Christ, for the spiritual good of
mens souls. Hence, Those Rulers that are not of God
nor ordained of God, cannot be ouned without sin: But
Tyrants &amp; Usurpers are the Rulers, that are not of God
nor ordained of God, but are set up and not by Him &amp;c.
Hos. 8. 1-4. Therefore they cannot be ouned without
sin. I refer it to any man of conscience &amp; Reason to judge,
if these Scriptures proving Magistracy to be the Ordinance
of God, for which alone it is to be ouned, can be applyed
to Tyrants &amp; Usurpers: How will that <hi>Rom,</hi> 13. read of
Tyrants? <hi>let every soul be subject to Tyrants, for they are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of God as His Ministers of Iustice</hi> &amp;c. and are a terror to
evil works and a praise to the good, would not every man
nauseate that as not the Doctrine of God? Again, how
would that sound <hi>Prov. 8. By me Tyrants reign &amp; Usurpers
decree injustice?</hi> harsh to Christian ears. Can they be said to
be <hi>Gods</hi> among whom the Lord judgeth? If they be, they
must be such as the witch of <hi>Endor</hi> saw, Gods coming out
of the earth, when she raised the Devil; in a very Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrestical
meaning, as the Devil is called the <hi>God of this
world.</hi> And indeed they have no more power, nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:41139:175"/>
to be ouned, than he hath: for this is a Truth, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
is a work of Satan &amp; not from God; because sin
either habitual or actual is not from God; Tyranny is sin in
habit &amp; act: Ergo—The Magistrate as Magistrate is
good in nature &amp; end, being the Minister of God for good,
A Tyrant as a Tyrant is quite contrary. <hi>Lex Rex</hi> saith well
<q>A power Ethical, Politick, or Moral, to oppress, is
not from God, and is not a power but a Licentious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation
of a power, and no more from God but from
sinful Nature &amp; the old Serpent, than a licence to sin,
<bibl>
                        <hi>Quest. 9. Pag.</hi> 59.</bibl>
                  </q> Hence sin, a Licence to sin, a Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
sinning, cannot be from God: But Tyranny, Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
absolute power encroaching upon all Liberties,
Laws, Divine &amp; humane, is sin, a Licence to sin, a
Licencious sinning. Ergo—But to make this clear, and
to obviate what may be said against this: let it be Considered
how the powers that be are <hi>of God</hi> &amp; <hi>ordained of God.</hi> Things
are said to be <hi>of God</hi> and <hi>ordained of God</hi> two wayes; by His
purpose &amp; <hi>providence,</hi> and by His <hi>Word</hi> &amp; Warrant. Things
may be of God, either of His <hi>Hand</hi> working or bringing
them about ordaining &amp; ordering them to be to His Glory;
either by a holy overruling Providence, as <hi>Samsons</hi> desire
of a wife was of God <hi>Iudg.</hi> 14. 4. and <hi>Amaziahs</hi> insolent
&amp; foolish rejection of <hi>Ioash</hi> his Peaceable overture 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
25. 20. Or by a powerful effective providence, So <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.
36. <hi>Of Him &amp; through Him are all things 1 Cor.</hi> 8. 6. One God
<hi>of whom are all things.</hi> Or things be of God of His <hi>Word</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranting
&amp; Authorizing. So we are commanded to try the
spirits whether they be <hi>of God</hi> (1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4. 1.) So in this sense,
sin, tentation, lust, Corruptions of the world are not of
God <hi>Iam. 1. 13. 1 Iohn.</hi> 2. 16. Again, things are ordained
of God, either by the order of His Counsel or Providential
will, either effectively by way of Production or Direction,
or Permissively by way of non-impedition: Or they are
ordained by the order of His Word &amp; Preceptive will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The
former is Gods Rule, the latter is ours: The former is
alwise accomplished, the latter is often contradicted: The
former orders all actions even sinful, the latter only that
which is good &amp; acceptable in the sight of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:41139:175"/>
                  <hi>Israel</hi> rejected Samuel, by the latter they should have
continued <hi>Samuels</hi> Government, and not sought a King:
By the former, <hi>Athaliah</hi> usurped the Government, by the
latter, she should have yeelded obedience &amp; resigned the
Government to the posterity of <hi>Ahaziah:</hi> By the former
all have a physical subordination to God as Creatures, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to His All-disposing will; by the latter, Those whom
He approves have a moral subordination to God, as
obedient subjects to His Commanding will. Now Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats
are of God and ordained by Him both these wayes,
Tyrants but one of them. I say, Magistrats, the higher
Powers, to whom we owe &amp; must oune subjection are of
God both these wayes, both by His purpose &amp; Providence,
and that not meerly eventual but effective &amp; executive of
His Word, disposing both of the Title &amp; Right, &amp; Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the power, to them whom He approves, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the People under a consciencious subjection, And by
His Word &amp; warrant. So <hi>Adonijah</hi> the Usurper (though
he had the pretence of Hereditary right, and also possession
by Providence) was forced to oune King <hi>Solomon</hi> in these
termes upon which only a Magistrate may be ouned: <hi>The
Kingdome,</hi> sayes he, <hi>was mine,</hi> and all <hi>Israel</hi> set their faces
on me that I should reign, howbeit <hi>the Kingdom is turned
about and become my brothers for it was his from the Lord, 1 King.</hi>
2. 15. He had both Providence turning about the Kingdom
to him, and also the Warrant of the Lords Approbative &amp;
preceptive will. But Tyrants &amp; Usurpers are only of God
and ordained of God, by His overruling purpose &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive
Providence, either for performing His holy purpose
towards themselves; as <hi>Rehoboams</hi> professing he would
be a Tyrant, and refusing the Lawful desires of the people
was of God 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. 15. Or for a judgment &amp; ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
upon them that are subject to them, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11: 6:
whereby they get a power in their hand, which is the <hi>Rod
of the Lords Indignation,</hi> and a Charge &amp; Commission against
a Hypocritical Nation <hi>Isa.</hi> 10. 5. 6. This is all the power
they have from God, who gives <hi>Iacob</hi> to the spoil &amp; Israel
to the Robbers, when they sin against Him <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 24.
This doth not give these Robbers any right, no more than
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:41139:176"/>
they whose Tabernacle prosper, into whose hand God
bringeth abundantly <hi>Iob.</hi> 12. 6. Thus all Robbers, and the
great Legal Robbers, Tyrants, and their Authorized
Murderers, may be of God, to wit, by His Providence.
Hence those that are not ordained of Gods preceptive will,
but meerly by His Providential will, their Authority is not
to be ouned: But Tyrants &amp; Usurpers are not ordained of
Gods Preceptive, but meerly by His Providential will.
The <hi>Minor</hi> needs no proof: yet will be cleared by many
folowing Arguments. The <hi>Major</hi> will be afterwards more
demonstrated. Here I shall only say, They that have no
other ordination of God impowering them to be Rulers,
than the devil hath, must not be ouned: But they that have
no other than the ordination of Providence, have no other
ordination of God impowering them to be Rulers than the
devil hath: Ergo they that have no other than the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Providence must not be ouned.</p>
               <p>2. But let us next consider, what is comprehended in
the Ordination of that Authority which is to be ouned as
<hi>of God:</hi> And it may be demonstrated there are two things
in it, without which no Authority can be ouned as of God,
<hi>viz. Institution</hi> &amp; <hi>Constitution:</hi> So as to give him, whom
we must oune as Gods Minister, Authority both in the
<hi>Abstract</hi> &amp; <hi>Concrete,</hi> that is, that he should have Magistracy
by Gods Ordination, and be a Magistrate by &amp; according
to the will of God. All acknowledge that Magistracy hath
Gods <hi>Institution,</hi> for the Powers that be are <hi>ordained of God:</hi>
which contains not only the Appointment of it, but the
qualification &amp; forme of it. That Government is appointed
by Divine Precept all agree, but whether the Precept be
Moral Natural, or Moral Positive, Whether it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in the State of Innocency, or since disorder came
in the world, Whether it be <hi>Primario</hi> or <hi>Secundario,</hi> from
the Law of nature is not agreed upon, It may possibly be all
these wayes; Government in the General may be from the
Law and light of Nature appointed in Innocency, because
all its relative duties are enjoined in the fifth Command,
and all Nations Naturally have an esteem of it, Without
which ther could be no order, distinction, or Communion
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:41139:176"/>
in humane Societies, But the Specification or Individuation
may be by a Postnate Positive &amp; Secundary Law, yet Natural
too, for though ther be no reason in Nature why any man
should be King &amp; Lord over another, being in some sense
all Naturally free but as they yeeld themselves under Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:
The exalting of <hi>David</hi> over Israel is not ascribed
to Nature, but to an act of divine bounty which took him
from following the Ewes and made him feeder of the
People of Israel, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 70, 71: yet Nature teacheth
that <hi>Israel</hi> and other <hi>People</hi> should have a Government,
and that this should be subjected to. Next, not only is it
appointed to be, but qualified by Institution, and the <hi>Office</hi>
is defined, the <hi>End</hi> prescribed, and the measures &amp; <hi>Bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries</hi>
thereof are limited, as we shall hear. Again the formes
of it, though Politically they are not stinted, that People
should have such a forme &amp; not another: yet <hi>Morally,</hi> at
least Negatively, whatever be the forme, it is limited to
the Rules of equity &amp; justice, and must be none other than
what hath the Lords Mould &amp; Sanction. But there is no
Institution any of these wayes for Tyranny. Hence, that
Power that hath no Institution from God, cannot be ouned
as His ordinance: But the Power of Tyrants is that Power,
being contrary in every respect to Gods Institution, and a
meer deviation from it, &amp; eversion of it. <hi>Ergo</hi>—To the
<hi>Minor</hi> it may be replyed; Though the Power which Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
may exerce &amp; Usurpers assume, may be in <hi>Concret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
contrary to Gods Institution, and so not to be ouned: yet <hi>in
abstracto,</hi> it may be acknowledged of God. Its but the <hi>abuse</hi>
of the Power, and that does not take away the <hi>use.</hi> We
may oune the Power, though we do not oune the abuse
of it. I <hi>ans.</hi> 1. I acknowledge the distinction as to Magistrats
is very pertinent: for it is well said by the <hi>Congregation</hi> in a
Letter to the Nobility, <hi>Knox Hist. of Scot. lib.</hi> 2. That <q>there
is a great difference betwixt the Authority which is Gods
ordinance, and the persons of these who are placed in
Authority; the Authority &amp; ordinance of God can never
do wrong, for it commandeth that vice be punished &amp;
virtue maintained;</q> But the Corrupt Person placed in this
Authority may offend—Its certain higher Powers are
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:41139:177"/>
not to be resisted but some persons in Power may be resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Powers are ordained of God, but Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
unjust things are not ordained of God to do such
things. But to apply this to Ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ants, I do not understand:
Magistrats in some Acts may be guilty of Tyranny, and yet
retain the Power of Magistracy; but Tyrants cannot be
capable of Magistracy, nor any one of the Scripture Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of Righteous Rulers. They cannot retain that
which they have forefeited, and which they have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
And Usurpers cannot retain that which they never
had. They may act &amp; enact some things materially just,
but they are not formally such as can make them Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats,
no more then some unjust actions can make a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
a Tyrant. A Murderer, saying the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ife of one &amp;
killing another, does not make him no Murderer: Once
a Murderer ay a Murderer, once a Robber ay a Robber,
till he restore what he hath robbed: So once a Tyrant ay a
Tyrant, till he make amends for his Tyranny, and that
will be hard to do. 2. The Concrete does specificate the
Abstract in actuating it, as a Magistrate, in his exercising
Government makes his Power to be Magistracy; a Robber
in his robbing, makes his Power to be Roberie; an Usurper
in his usurping makes his Power to be Usurpation; So a
Tyrant in his Tyrannizing can have no Power but Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.
As the Abstract of a Magistrate is nothing but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy,
So the Abstract of a Tyrant is nothing but Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.
Its frivolous then to distinguish between a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
power in the Concrete, &amp; Tyranny in the Abstract;
the power &amp; the abuse of the power: for he hath no power
as a Tyrant, but what is abused. 3. They that objects thus,
must either mean, that power in its general Notion is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
of God, but this particular Power ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sed by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
and assumed by Usurpers, is not ordained: Or
they must mean, that the very Power of Tyrants &amp; Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
is ordained of God, but the way of holding &amp; using it is
not of God. If the first be said, they grant all I plead for:
for thô the Power in general be ordained, yet what is this
to Tyrants &amp; Usurpers? would not this Claim be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
for any man to say, God hath ordained Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:41139:177"/>
to be, therefore I will challenge it? God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
Marriage, therefore any may cohabit together as
man &amp; wife, without formal Matrimony? If the Second
be alledged, that the Power of these prevailing Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
is ordained, but not their holding &amp; using of it: This
is Non-sense, for how can a Power be ordained and the
use of it be unlawful? For, the abuse &amp; use of Tyrannical
Power is all one and reciprocal: an Usurper cannot use his
Power but by Usurpation. Again is it not plain, that the
<hi>Abstract</hi> &amp; the <hi>Concrete,</hi> the act or habit, and the subject
wherein it is, cannot have a contrary Denomination? if
Drunkenness and Thieft, Lying or Murder, be of the
Devil; then the Drunkard, the Thief, the Lyar, &amp; the
Murderer, are of the Devil too: So if Tyranny and
Usurpation, or the use or abuse of Tyrants &amp; Usurpers,
be of the Devil; Then must the Tyrants &amp; Usurpers also
be of him: None can say, the one is of the Devil, and the
other of God. Wherefore it is altogether impertinent to
use such a Distinction, with application to Tyrants or
Usurpers, as many do in their pleading for the ouning of
our Oppressors: for they have no power, but what is the
abuse of power.</p>
               <p>3. As that Authority which is Gods Ordinance must
have His <hi>Institution:</hi> So it must have His divine <hi>Constitution</hi>
from Himself and by the people. Wherever then there
is Authority to be ouned of men, there must be these tuo,
Constitution from God and Constitution from the people.
For the <hi>first,</hi> God hath a special Interest in the Constitution
of Authority, both Immediatly &amp; Mediatly. <hi>Immediatly,</hi>
He declares such &amp; such formes of Government to be
Lawful &amp; Eligible, and does order whom &amp; who and how
people shall erect Governours. And so, He confers Royal
Graces &amp; Enduements &amp; Gifts for Government on them,
as on <hi>Ioshua</hi> &amp; <hi>Saul:</hi> So they become the <hi>Lords Anointed,</hi>
placed &amp; <hi>set on the Throne of the Lord, 1 Chron.</hi> 29. 23. and
honoured with Majestie as His deputies &amp; vicegerents,
having their <hi>Croun set</hi> on by God <hi>Psal.</hi> 21. 3. But in regard
now He doth not by any special Revelation determine,
who shall be the Governours in this or that place; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:41139:178"/>
He makes this Constitution by mediation of men;
giving them Rules how they shall proceed in setting them
up. And seeing by the Law of Nature He hath enjoined
Government to be, but hath ordered no particular in it
with application to singulars, He hath committed it to the
positive transaction of men, to be disposed according to
certain General Rules of Justice. And it must needs be so,
for 1. without this Constitution, either all or none would
be Magistrats: if He hath ordained Civil Power to be, and
taken no order in whom it shall be, or how it shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed,
any might pretend to it; and yet none would have
a right to it, more than another. If then He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath affixed it
to a peculiar <hi>having</hi> &amp; <hi>holding,</hi> by virtue whereof this man
is enstated &amp; entitled to the office, and not that man, there
must be a Law for Constituting him in Authority, which
will discover in whom it is. 2. If it were not so, then a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of a particular Magistrate would not be a resisting of
the ordinance of God, if a particular Magistrate were not
Constitute of God, as well as Magistracy is Institute of
God: for still it would be undetermined, who were the
Power; and so it would be left as free &amp; Lawful for the
resister to take the place, as for the resisted to hold it; the
institution would be satisfied if any possessed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: therefore
there must be Constitution to determine it. 3. No Common
Law of Nature can be put into practice, without particular
Constitution regulating it. That Wives &amp; Children oune
their superior relations, is the Law of Nature; but there
must be such a relation first fixed by humane transaction,
before they can oune them; there must be Marriage Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
of God, there must be Children begotten, and
then the Divine Ordination of these relative duties take
place. So the Judges of <hi>Israel</hi> for 450 years were given of
God, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 20. not all by an immediate express de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation,
but a mediate Call from God by men, as <hi>Ieph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah
Iudg.</hi> 11. 6. 11. Inferior judges also are Magistrats ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God, yet they have their Deputation from men.
Our Saviour speaks of all Magistrats, when he applies that
of the 82. <hi>Psalm</hi> to them, <hi>I said ye are Gods;</hi> and shewes
how they were <hi>Gods,</hi> because unto them the <hi>Word of God
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:41139:178"/>
came, Iohn.</hi> 10. 35. that is, by His Word &amp; Warrant He
Authorized them, not by immediate designation in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the most of them, but the Word of God comes
to them, or His Constitution is past upon them, who are
advanced by men according to His Word. When men
therefore do act according to the Divine Rule, in the
Moulding &amp; Erecting of Government &amp; Governours,
there the Constitution is of God, though it be not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate.
And where this is not observed, whatever power
(so named or pretended) there may be, or what-soever
persons there be that take upon them to be the power, and
are not thereto appointed or therein instated, and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erce
such a power as God hath not legitmated, they are
not a power ordained of God. Hence, whatsoever power
hath no Constitution from God, eather Immediate or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
cannot be ouned: But the Authority of Tyrants &amp;
Usurpers, is a power that hath no Constitution from God,
either Immediate or Mediate: <hi>Ergo</hi> it cannot be ouned.
The <hi>Major</hi> is cleared above. The <hi>Minor</hi> is also unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable:
For, either they must pretend to an Immediate
Constitution by revelation, that <hi>Iames Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> a vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of Antichrist, had by all his plots &amp; pranks Merited the
Crown of <hi>Britain,</hi> and therefore must be Constitute King:
And this I hope they will not pretend to, except the <hi>Pope</hi>
hath gotten such a Revelation from <hi>Pluto's</hi> Oracle: Or
they must have recourse to the Mediate Constitution by
men: And if so; Then, either this Mediate Constitution
of God is left undetermined, indefinitely &amp; absolutely
giving way to any that will assume what power they please
&amp; can: And then, I confess, Tyrants may have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;
but this confusion cannot be of God: Or else,
it is fixed by a Rule, regulating the succession or Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Governours, and obliging the people to oune
the Government so constituted, with exclusion &amp; disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of any other. And so, if in that Constitution
there be a Substantial Deviation from the Rule, as when
incompetent or unallowed persons be the advancers of
themselves, or others, into that place by illegal &amp; sinis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
means, in as much as in that case there is the Divine
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:41139:179"/>
disapprobation, it may be said there is no Ordinance of
God, but a Contradiction &amp; Contraordination to Gods
Order. <hi>Gee's Magist. Origin. chap. 5. Sect. 4. subject 3. pag.</hi> 135.
This will shake off this of ours, and all other Tyrants &amp;
Usurpers, that come into the Government, &amp; hold it not
according to Gods Rule.</p>
               <p>4. It is clear also in the <hi>second</hi> place, that the Authority
which we can oune out of conscience, must have <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
by the people. The special way by which men should
be called into the place of Soveraign power, may perhaps
not be found so expressly defined in Scripture, as mens
Call to the other Ordinance of the Ministrie is; yet in this
two things are essentially necessary to the Constitution of a
Magistrate, The peoples <hi>consent</hi> &amp; <hi>compact</hi> either formal
or virtual. And without these we can oune consciencious
subjection &amp; Allegiance to no man living. That the first
is necessary will be evident, from the Law of Nature &amp;
Nations, and from Scripture. First the light &amp; Law of
Nature dictates, that the Right &amp; Interest of Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Magistrats is in the Elective vote or suffrage of the
people. This will Appear. 1. If we consider, The
Original of Government among men, especially after they
were so multiplied, that there was a necessity of a reduction
into diverse Communities; which, whatever was before
the flood, yet after it, behoved to be by a Coalition with
consent under an Elective Government. The Scripture
makes it more than probable, that the first partition of
Common-wealths was in <hi>Pelegs</hi> dayes, in whose time the
earth was <hi>Divided Gen.</hi> 10. 25. occasioned by the Confusion
of Languages at Babel which did dissolve their union and
scatter them abroad upon the face of all the eath <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 9.
Then was it that we may conceive, as <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Buchanan</hi> sayes <hi>de
Iure Regni apud Scot.</hi>
                     </bibl> the time was, when men dwelt in
cottages &amp; caves, and as strangers did wander to &amp; fro
without Laws, and such as could converse together of
the same language assembled together as their humors did
lead them, or as some common Utilitie did allure them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
A certain instinct of Nature did oblige them to desire
Converse &amp; Societie.</q> But this confusion of Languages,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:41139:179"/>
and Communion of Language, in several divided Parcels,
could not incorporate these several Parties into Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities;
that behoved to be the effect of some other cause:
&amp; what should that be, but the joint will, consent &amp; aggree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the severally Languaged? It could not be by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity;</hi>
for there is no direction from Nature for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
of that into such &amp; such degrees, to make out
the bounds of a Common-wealth, or Possibility of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all with in such degrees; besides all within these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
might not be of the same Language. Now the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
sayes, they were divided every one after his <hi>tongue,</hi>
after their families, in their Nations <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 5. Next it
could not be by <hi>Cohabitation:</hi> for how that must go to be
the boundaries of a Common-wealth, inclusively or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusively,
is not defined by nature, nor can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
determined than by humane choise. Then, it could
not be by mens <hi>belonging to such a Soveraign:</hi> for after that
Division &amp; Confusion, they could not all be under one
Soveraign, nor under the same that they were subject to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and a Soveraign cannot be before the aggregation of
the Subjects whereof he is head, they must first be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
before they can belong to it. Again it cannot
be founded upon the Right of <hi>fatherhood:</hi> for in that scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
such a Right could not be uninterruptedly preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And then <hi>Noah</hi> should also have been the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Magistrate, which he could not be in these multiplied
secessions. And further if it be refounded on the Right of
fatherhood; either every Company had one Common
Father over all, or every Father made a Common-wealth
of his oun Children: The Latter cannot be said, for that
would multiply Common-wealts <hi>in infinitum:</hi> Neither
can the first be said, for if they had one Common Father,
either this behoved to be the Natural Father of all the
Company, which none can think was so happily ordered
by <hi>Babels</hi> confusion: Or else the eldest in age, and so he
might be incapable for Government, and the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
does not direct that the Government should alwise
be astricted to the eldest of the Community: Or else finally
he behoved to be their <hi>Political</hi> Father, by <hi>consent.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:41139:180"/>
this consent, they were uningaged as to common or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Government; none of the Community having any
legal Claim to Soveraignity more than the rest. When
therfore they were forced to conclude upon Association
for their Mutual Preservation, they must be thought to act
rationally, and not to make their condition worse but rather
better by that conclusion, and, if they found it worse, to
resume their radical Right which they had conferred upon
men, subject to Law not to Tyrannize over them: And
in this case, certainly they had the power of choosing what
Kind of Government suited most to their advantage, and
would best preserve their Liberties, and how far this
should be extended, and who should be assumed into this
Combination; still with a reservation of the Priviledge to
their oun safety, if their Associates should not do their
duty: And so they might also reserve to themselves a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
to alter the forme when they found it productive of
more prejudice than advantage, and never to leave their
condition remedieless; And to pitch upon this way of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
and not another, the way of free election of every
successor, or of definite election limited to one line, or
to the nearest in line, And <hi>e contra</hi> with a reserve still of
their primeve Priviledges, to secure themselves from the
inconveniences of that determination, or to change it;
And to make choise of such a family &amp; line and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and whether the eldest alwise of that family or the
fittest is to be chosen: And however it be, yet still by the
peoples consent: And in all this to have respect to some
good, great, &amp; Necessary Ends, which if they should
be disappointed of, and find these means useless or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to, they were to be loosed from their obligation
to use or to oune them. See <hi>Ius populi vindicat. ch. 5. pag.</hi>
80. &amp;c. 2. If we consider how Nature determines the
peoples Interest in the constitution of Governours: whence
comes it that this man and not that man, this race &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
and not that, is invested with that Title? It will be
found there is no Title on earth now to the Crowns to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
to persons, but the peoples suffrage: for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Magistracy in general does, not make <hi>Iames
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:41139:180"/>
Stewart</hi> a King, no more than <hi>Iohn Chamberlain:</hi> Neither
do <hi>qualifications</hi> make one, otherwise there might be many
better than is this day extant, for there are many men bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
qualified: And there is no Prophetical or immediate
Callings to Kingdoms now: And as for Conquest without
consent, and having no more for a Title, it is no better
than <hi>Royal Latrocinie.</hi> It is certain God would not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
us to obey Kings, and leave us in the Dark that we
should not know him that hath a reall call to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: And if he
have not the peoples Call, where shall we find another?
It remains therefore they must have it from the people,
who have it to give <hi>Radically</hi> &amp; <hi>virtually;</hi> having a power
to preserve themselves, and to put it in the hands of one
or more Rulers, that they may preserve themselves by them.
All men are born alike as to Civil power (no man being
born with a Croun on his head) and yet men united in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
may give it to this man &amp; not to that man, therefore
they must have it virtually; for they can not give what
they have not. And as Cities have power to choose their
Magistrats, so many Cities have power to creat an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Ruler over them all. The people also have power
to Limit the Magistrats power, with conditions; so that
the present Ruler shall not have so much prerogative as his
predecessor, as Royalists cannot deny, therefore they must
have given that power which they can Limit See <hi>Lex Rex
Quest. 4. pag.</hi> 10. &amp;c. Secondly the Scripture also gives
Light in this particular. 1. In giving directions &amp; Rules
about their Orderly calling their Governours; Impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, to take wise men, &amp; understanding, &amp; known
among their tribes, to be <hi>made Rulers D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

make Judges &amp; Officers in all their gates <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 18. To
<hi>set</hi> one among their brethren King over them and not a
<hi>stranger Deut.</hi> 17. 15. To what purpose are these Rules
given them, if they had no interest to choose their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats?
Would God command them to set a King over
them, if they had not power to do it? And to set such a
man over them and not such an one, if they had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
in making one at all? And accordingly that wise
Statist sayes very well 2 <hi>Sam. 16. 18. Hushai</hi> to <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>salem,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:41139:181"/>
Nay, but whom the Lard &amp; this people and all the men of Israel
choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</hi> Which will
also hold in the Negative, whom the Lord &amp; the people
and all the men of the Kingdom do not choose, his we will
not be, nor with him will we abide. 2. The Scripture
expressly attributeth the <hi>making of Kings</hi> to the people. All
the people of <hi>Iuda</hi> took <hi>Azariah</hi> and made him King, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of his Father <hi>Amaziah,</hi> whom they had executed
2 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 21. They came with a perfect heart to make
<hi>David</hi> King in <hi>Hebron 1 Chron.</hi> 12. 38. So they made <hi>Ioash</hi>
King 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 11. 3. Even these that were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
designed of God &amp; chosen to be Rulers, yet were not
formally invested with power, before the people confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it upon them. <hi>Gideon</hi> was called of God to it, but was
not Judge till the people said, <hi>Rule thow over us, both thow
&amp; thy Son, giving</hi> him an hereditary right for his Children,
<hi>Iudg. 8. 12. Saal</hi> was appointed to be King, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Samuel</hi> honoured him, because he was marked out
of God to be King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 24. and anointed him with
oyl 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 1. after which he was gifted &amp; qualified for
Government, God gave him another heart <hi>vers.</hi> 9. yet all
this did not make him King, till the people met for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration
<hi>vers.</hi> 17. &amp;c. and Crowned him &amp; made him
King in <hi>Gilgal 1 Sam. 11. ult. David</hi> was anointed by <hi>Samuel,</hi>
and yet was a persecuted fugitive for several years, and
never acknowledged formally King, till the men of <hi>Iudah</hi>
came &amp; anointed him 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 4. for if he had been King
before, then there were two Kings in <hi>Israel</hi> at one time,
and <hi>David</hi> failed of his Royal duty in not punishing the
Murderer <hi>Saul;</hi> whereas himself sayes, he would not <hi>touch
the Lords <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Therefore the people made all these
Kings, and that by choise &amp; consent, without which they
were no Kings. Hence I argue, If the consent &amp; choise
of the people be so essentially necessary to the making of
Kings; then they who set up themselves against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the body of the Land, and without the choise of
any, must be Usurpers, not to be acknowledged for Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Kings: But the former is true as is proven above:
Ergo—Now Plain it is that this <hi>Duke</hi> set up himself
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:41139:181"/>
against the consent of the body, being excluded from the
Government by the Representatives of <hi>England,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
hated of all; who disdaining to wait upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
choise of any, but after he had paved his passage to the
Throne upon his Brothers blood, did usurpe the Title
without all Law.</p>
               <p>5. The <hi>second</hi> thing necessary for the Legal Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a King by the people, is their <hi>Compact</hi> with him:
which must either be <hi>Express</hi> or <hi>Tacite,</hi> Explicite or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite.
Two things are here to be proven, that will
furnish an Argument for disouning both the Brothers. First,
That there must be a <hi>Conditionall</hi> reciprocally obliging
<hi>Covenant</hi> between the Soveraign and the Subjects, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which there is no such relation to be ouned. Secondly
That when this compact is broken in all or its chiefest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
by the Soveraign, the peoples obligation ceases.
The <hi>first.</hi> I shall set doun, in the words of a famous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
our Renouned Country man <hi>Buchanan</hi> in his Dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
de <hi>Iure Regni apud Scotos. Mutua igitur Regi cum Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
est pactio</hi> &amp;c. There is then (or there ought to be) a
Mutual compact between the King and his subjects &amp;c.
That this is indispensibly necessary &amp; essential to make up
the Relation of Soveraign &amp; Subjects, may be proved both
from the Light of Nature, &amp; Revelation. First it may
appear from the Light of Natural reason. 1. From the
Rise of Government, and the Interest people have in
erecting it by consent &amp; choise (at is shewed above) If a
King cannot be with out the peoples <hi>making,</hi> then all the
power he hath must either be by <hi>compact</hi> or <hi>gift:</hi> If by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
then we have what we proposed: And if by <hi>gift,</hi>
then if abused they may recall it or if they cannot recover
it, yet they may &amp; ought to hold their hand, and give
him no more that they may retain, that is no more honour
or respect, which is in the honourer before the honoured get
it. Can it be imagined, that a people acting rationally
would give a power absolutely without restrictions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all their oun rights? Could they suppose this bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
&amp; Lawless Creature, left at Liberty to Tyrannize,
would be a fit mean to procure the the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:41139:182"/>
for this were to set up a rampant Tyrant to rule as
he listeth, which would make their condition a great deal
worse then if they had no Ruler at all, for then they might
have more Liberty to see to their safety. See <hi>Ius populi ch.
6. pag.</hi> 96. 97. 2. This will be clear from the nature of
that Authority, which only a Soveraign can have over
his Subjects; which whatever be the Nature of it, it cannot
be <hi>absolute,</hi> that is against Scripture, Nature, &amp; Common
sense, as shall be proven at more length. That is to set up
a Tyrant, one who is free from all conditions, a roaring
Lyon &amp; a ranging Bear to destroy all if he pleases. It must
be granted by all, that the Soveraign Authority is only
<hi>fiduciarie,</hi> entrusted by God &amp; the people with a great
Charge: A great Pledge is impauned &amp; committed to the
Care &amp; Custody of the Magistrate, which he must take
special care of, and not abuse; or waste, or alienate or
sell (for in that case <hi>Royalists</hi> themselves grant he may be
deposed) He is by Office a Patron of the Subjects Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Keeper of the Law both of God &amp; Man, the
Keeper of both Tables. Sure he hath no power over the
Lawes of God but a Ministerial power, he may not stop &amp;
disable them as he pleases; Of the same nature is it, over
all other Parts of his Charge. He is rather a <hi>Tutor,</hi> than
an Inheritor &amp; <hi>proprietor</hi> of the Common-wealth, and may
not do with his pupils interest what he pleases. In a word
the Nature &amp; whole significancy of his power lyes in this,
that he is the <hi>Nations publick Servant,</hi> both Objectively in that
he is only for the good of the people, and Representative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that the people hath impauned in his hand all their
power to do Royal Service. The Scripture eaches this,
in giving him the Titles of Service, as <hi>Watchman</hi> &amp;c. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
him Royal <hi>wages</hi> for his Royal work <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. he is
Gods Minister attending continually on this thing, There
is his <hi>work, for this cause pay yow tribute also,</hi> There is his
<hi>wages</hi> &amp; maintinance. He is called so in that transaction
with <hi>Rehoboam;</hi> The old men advised him to be a <hi>Servant</hi>
unto the People, then they should be his Servants 1 <hi>King.</hi>
12. 7. There was a conditional bargain proposed: As to
be a Servant, or Tutor, or Guardian upon Trust, always
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:41139:182"/>
implies Conditions &amp; Acconntableness to them that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
them. 3. It must needs be so otherwise great absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
would follow. Here would be a voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
Relation, obliging as to relative duties, to a man
that ouwed none correlative to us, and yet one whom we
set over us. It were strange, if there were no Condition
here; and no other voluntarly suscepted Relations can be
without this, as between Man &amp; Wife, Master &amp; Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
&amp;c. This would give him the disposal of us &amp; Ours,
as if both we and what we have were his oun, as a mans
goods are, against which he does not sin whatever he do
with them. So this would make a King that could not sin
against us; being no ways obliged to us, for he can no
otherwise be obliged to us but upon Covenant conditions;
he may be obliged &amp; bound in duty to God otherwise, but
he cannot be bound to us otherwise: And if he be not
bound then he may do what he will, he can do no wrong
to us to whom he is no wayes bound. This also is point
blank against the Law of God, which is the Second way
to prove it, by the Light of Revelation or Scripture. 1.
In thevery directions about making &amp; seting up of Kings,
the Lord shewes what conditions shall be required of them
<hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15. &amp;c. and in all directions for obeying them,
the qualifications they should have are rehearsed as <hi>Rom.</hi>
13. 3, 4. Therefore none are to be set up but on these
conditions, and none are to be obeyed but such as have
these qualifications. 2. In His promises of the succession
of Kings, He secures their continuation only <hi>Conditionally,</hi>
to establish the Kingdom <hi>if</hi> they be constant to <hi>do His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>
&amp; Judgements 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 7. There shall not
fail a man to sit upon the Trone <hi>yet so</hi> that they take heed
to their way to walk in Gods Law, as <hi>David</hi> did 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
6. 16. Now He was not otherwise to perform these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
but by the action &amp; suffrage of the people seting
him up, (which He had appointed to be the way of calling
Kings to Thrones) if therefore the Lords promise be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional,
the peoples actions also behoved to be suspended
upon the same conditions. 3. We have many express
Covenants, between Rulers &amp; Subjects in Scripture. <hi>Ieph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah</hi>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:41139:183"/>
was fetcht from the Land of <hi>Tob,</hi> and made the head
of the <hi>Gileadites</hi> by an explicite mutual stipulation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Lord was invocated as a Witness, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 11. 6, 8, 9,
10, 11. So all the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> came to make <hi>David</hi>
King, and King <hi>David</hi> made a <hi>League</hi> with them in <hi>Hebron</hi>
before the Lord, and then they anointed him over <hi>Israel
2 Sam.</hi> 5. 3. he made there a <hi>Covenant</hi> with them before
the Lord 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11, 3. He was no King before this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and so it was a Pactional Oath between him &amp; the
Kingdom, upon termes according to the Law <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.
he was only a King <hi>in fieri;</hi> one who was to be King, but
now actually inaugurate a <hi>Covenanted King</hi> upon termes
that satisfied them. Its true they came to recognosce his
Right from the Lord; But so did they recognosce <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi>
Right, and came to <hi>Shechem</hi> to make him King 1 <hi>King.</hi>
12. 1. and yet when he would not enter in Covenant
terms with them, to satisfie their just demands, the people
answered the King, saying, <hi>what portion have we in David,
neither have we inheritance in the Son of Iesse, to your tents O
Israel vers.</hi> 16. They refused to acknowledge such an
Usurper, and we find no Prophets ever condemning them
for it. So when <hi>Iehoash</hi> or <hi>Ioash</hi> was Crowned, <hi>Iehojada</hi>
made a <hi>Covenant</hi> between the Lord and the King &amp; the
people, that they should be the Lords people, between
the King also and the people 2 <hi>King. 11. 17. 2 Chron.</hi> 23. 11,
16. From all these Reasons &amp; Scriptures, It is clear
there must be a Mutual <hi>Compact.</hi> between the Subjects and
every Soveraign they oune subjection to, which if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse,
and usurp the Sword, they are under an Anterior
obligation to substract their Allegiance, and to make use
of their Sword, if they be in capacity, to pull it out of his
hands and use it against him. And of this we are put in mind
by the <hi>Motto</hi> of our old <hi>Coronation pieces,</hi> which have these
Words about the Sword. <hi>pro me, si mereor in me,</hi> that is,
<hi>for me but if I deserve against me:</hi> And surely to him that hath it
now in his hands, it may be said, <hi>tu meruisti &amp; adhuc meres.</hi>
We see then, the Allegiance that this Usurper alledges is
his due, wants a bottom, to wit a compact with the people.
Whence I argue, If there must of necessity be a compact
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:41139:183"/>
between the King &amp; the people when, he is advanced to
the Government; then he that advances himself, without
&amp; against this compact, is an Usurper not to be ouned:
But the former is true: <hi>Ergo</hi> he that advances himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
&amp; against this compact, is an Usurper not to be ouned.
And who more Notoriously deserving such a signature,
than <hi>Iames the</hi> 7/2 who hath made horns of his oun strength,
or the <hi>Popes Biills,</hi> to push his Brother out and himself in
to the Throne, upon no termes at all, or any security for
Religion &amp; Liberty. One <hi>Objection</hi> is to be removed here:
Can the Customs of the <hi>Iewes</hi> be binding to all Nations?
The Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> made such Covenants, shall therefore
all Kings do so? <hi>Ans.</hi> why not this Custom, as well as
<hi>Crowing,</hi> which they used likewise? These Rules are not
<hi>Typical</hi> or Cermonial, nor only so <hi>Iudicial</hi> as to be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<hi>Iudaical,</hi> but are matters of moral equity, bearing a
standing reason founded upon that Law <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15. &amp;c.
Limiting the Prince to stand to conditions. If we cast at
Divine Laws for Rules of Government, where wil we
find better Laws? It is recorded of the first of the <hi>British</hi>
Kings who was Christian, that writing to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Rome</hi> (before Antichrist took that seat) for the <hi>Roman</hi>
Laws, he received this Answer; <q>By Divine Clemency
ye have received the Law &amp; faith of Christ, yow have the
Old &amp; New Testaments, out of them in Gods Name by
Counsel of your State take Laws, &amp; Govern your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</q>
And of another, that he began his Laws thus, <hi>God
speake all these words</hi> &amp;c. And so repeated the Laws of God.
The <hi>Second</hi> thing I undertook to prove, is that Assertion
of <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Buchanan ubi supra, de Iure Regni. Qui prior a Conventis
recidit</hi> &amp;c.</bibl> There being a paction between the King &amp;
Subjects, he who first recedes from what is Covenanted,
and doth Counteract what he hath Covenanted, he
looses the contract; and the bond being loosed which
did hold fast the King with the people, whatever right
did belong to him by virtue of that compact, he looses
it, and the people are as free as before the stipulation.</q>
Which is also asserted by the Author of <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Ius populi ch. 6. pag.</hi>
112.</bibl> It is no less clear, that when the Soveraign doth
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:41139:184"/>
not performe the principal main &amp; most necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
condescended &amp; aggreed upon, <hi>de jure</hi> he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
from his Soveraignity: and <hi>pag.</hi> 117. when the Prince
doth violate his compact, as to all its conditions, or
as to its chief main &amp; most necessary condition, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are <hi>de jure</hi> free from subjection to him, and at Liberty
to make choise of another.</q> This is so clear that it needs
no labour to prove it, that upon this head we were loosed
from all Allegiance ro the former Tyrant, who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
upon terms of an explicite Covenant, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
whereof he did as explicitely break. There are
two cases wherein Subjects are loosed from Covenanted
Allegiance to their Princes. 1. When the Prince remitts
the obligation of the Subjects, and refuses Allegiance upon
that <hi>basis;</hi> then he can no more demand it by virtue of that
compact. He that remitts &amp; will not have that Allegiance,
that the Subjects Covenanted upon such &amp; such conditions
to him, these Subjects should not give it that they so Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted,
for they should not prostitute it to a Refuser
&amp; Remitter: But <hi>Charles the Second</hi> remitted and would
not have that Allegiance, which we Covenanted upon
such &amp; such conditions <hi>viz.</hi> upon the terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
which he cassed, &amp; annulled, and made Criminal
to oune: <hi>Ergo</hi> to him we should not have given it, which
we so Covenanted. 2. When the Prince did enter into
a Mutual Covenant with the people upon Mutual condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and does not only cease to performe the conditions,
but simply denies all obligation to do it, and makes it a
quarrel to insinuate so much, yea persecutes all who
dare assert the obligation of that Covenant; and yet demands
Allegiance, not upon the obligation of that Covenant
which he hath remitted, but absolutely upon the grounds
of his prerogative. In this case it will be evident also, the
subjects are not bound either to oune their formerly Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
Allegiance to him, Or that which he demands on
other grounds. <hi>Grotius de Iure belli</hi> is clear as to this <hi>Lib.
1. Cap. 4. Num. 12. Si ex Clausula posita in ipsa delatione Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii,
ut si Rex hoc aut hoc faciet subditi omni obedientiae vinculo
solvuntur, tunc quoque Rex in privatam personam recidit.</hi> If
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:41139:184"/>
there be such a Clause or condition in the very devolution
of the Government upon a Prince, as if he do so &amp; so the
subjects shall be loosed from all bonds of obedience, then
when he does so he becomes a meer private person. <hi>Grotius</hi>
there supposes the power is transferred upon a <hi>resolutive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
that is if he transgress the condition the power shall
be resolved into its first fountain: much more if it be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
expressly also upon a <hi>suspensive condition,</hi> that he shall
continue to maintain the ends of the Covenant, defend
Religion &amp; the Liberties of the Subjects, in the defence
whereof we shall oune Allegiance to him, otherwise not
in that case if he do not maintain these ends, plain it is our
obligation ceases; for how can it stand upon a conditional
obligation, when his performance of the condition sists?
But whatever be the conditions Mutual, it flowes Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely
from the Nature of a Mutual compact, that <hi>qui non
praestat officium promissum cadit beneficio hac lege dato,</hi> he who
doth not perform the conditions aggreed upon hath no
right to the benefite granted upon condition of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of these conditions; especially if he performe not,
or violate these conditions upon supposition whereof he
would not have gotten the benefite: It were very absurd
to say, in a Mutual conditional compact one party shall
still be bound to perform his conditions, though the other
perform none but break all. Were it the act of rational
Creatures to set up a Soveraign, upon conditions he shall
not play the Tyrant, and yet be bound to him thô he Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize
never so much? We have the Nature of Mutual
compacts in the <hi>Spies Covenant with Rahab Iosh. 2. 20. If
thow utter this our business, then we will be quite of thine Oath,
which thow hast made us to swear:</hi> if she should break condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then the obligation of the Oath on their part should
cease. But next all the stress will ly in proving that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
on such &amp; such conditions between a Prince &amp;
Subjects, doth equally &amp; <hi>mutually oblige</hi> both to each other:
for if it equally oblige both, then both are equally disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
from other by the breach on either side, and either
of them may have a just claim in Law against the other for
breach of the conditions. But Royalists &amp; Court-slaves
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:41139:185"/>
alledge, that such a Covenant obliges the King to God;
but not to the people at all; so that he is no more account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to them, than if he had made none at all. But the
contrare is evident: For [1] If the compact be Mutual,
and if it be infringed on one side, it must be so in the other
also; for in contracts, the parties are considered as equalls,
whatever inequality there may be betwixt them otherwise:
I speak of contracts among men. [2] If it be not so, there
is no Covenant made with the people at all: And so <hi>David</hi>
did no more Covenant with <hi>Israel.</hi> than with the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans:</hi>
for to all with whom the Covenant is made it
obliges to them. Otherwise it must be said, he only
made the Covenant with God, contrary to the Text;
for he made it only <hi>before</hi> the Lord as a Witness, not <hi>with</hi>
Him as a party. <hi>Ioashs</hi> Covenant with the Lord is expresly
distinguished from that with the people. [3] If it be not
so, it were altogether non-sense to say, there were any
Covenant made with the King, on the other hand: for
he is supposed to be made King on such &amp; such terms,
and yet by this after he is made King he is no more
obliged unto them, than if there had been no compact
with him at all. [4] If he be bound as <hi>King,</hi> and not only
as a <hi>man</hi> or Christian, then he is bound with respect to the
people; for with respect to them he is only King: But he
is bound as King, and not only as a man or Christian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is only with him as King that the people Covenant,
and he must transact with them under the same considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Next, that which he is obliged to, is the specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
act of a King, to defend Religion &amp; Liberty, &amp; Rule
in Righteousness; And therefore his Covenant binds him
as King. Again, if he be not bound as King, then as a
King he is under no obligation of Law or Oath, which is
to make him a Lawless Tyrant, yea none of Gods subjects.
It would also suppose that the King as King could not sin
against the people at all, but only against God: for as King
he could be under no obligation of duty to the people, and
where there is no obligation there is no sin; by this he
would be set above all obligations to love his neighbour as
himself, for he is above all his neighbours, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:41139:185"/>
and only less than God; and so by this doctrine he
is loosed from all duties of the Second Table, or at least
he is not so much obliged to them as others. But against
this it is <hi>Objected:</hi> both Prince &amp; people are obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
their part to each other, and both are obliged to
God, but both are not accountable to each other; there
is not mutual power in the parties to compell one another
to performe the promised duty; the King hath it indeed
over the people, but not the people over the King, and
there is no indifferent Judge Superior to both to compell
both, but God. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. What if all this should be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
yet it doth not infringe the proposition: what if the
people have not power to compell him? yet <hi>Iure</hi> he may
fall from his Soveraignity, though <hi>de facto</hi> he is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed:
he loses his right to our part, when he breaks his
part. 2. There is no need of a Superior Arbiter: for as
in contracting they are considered as <hi>equal,</hi> so the party
keeping the contract is <hi>Superior</hi> to the other breaking it:
3. There may be Mutual Coactive Power, where there
is no Mutual relation of Superiority &amp; Inferiority: yea in
some cases Inferiours may have a Coactive Power by Law,
to compell their Superiours failing in their duty to them;
As a Son wronged by his Father may compel him to repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
by Law; And independent Kingdoms, nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to each other, being in Covenant together, the
wronged may have a Coactive power to force the other
to duty, without any Superior Arbiter. 4. The bond of
suretyship brings a man under the obligation to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Creditor, though the surety were never so high
and the Creditor never so low: <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes in General
without exception of Kings, yea including them because
he was a King that spake it <hi>Prov. 6. 1, 2. My son if thow be
Surety for thy friend—thow art snared with the words of thy
Mouth.</hi> Now a Kings power is but fiduciary; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he cannot be unaccountable for the power concredited
to him. And if the Generation had minded this, our
<hi>Stewarts</hi> should have been called to an account for their
<hi>Stewardship</hi> ere now. Hence I argue, If a Covenanted
Prince, breaking all the Conditions of his compact, doth
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:41139:186"/>
forfeit his right to the Subjects Allegiance, then they are
no more to oune him as their Soveraign: But the former
is proved, that a Covenanted Prince breaking all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of his compact doth forfeit his right to the Subjects
Allegiance: Ergo—And Consequently when <hi>Charles</hi>
the <hi>Second,</hi> expressly bound by Covenant to defend &amp;
promote the Convenanted Reformation &amp; Liberties of
the Kingdom, to whom only we were bound in the terms
of his defending &amp; promoting the same, did violently &amp;
villainously violate &amp; vilify these conditions, we were no
more bound to them. Somewhat possibly may be <hi>Objected</hi>
here. 1. If this be the sense of the Covenant, then it
would seem that we were not bound to oune the King,
but only when &amp; while he were actually promoving &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on the ends of the Covenant. <hi>Ans.</hi> It does not
follow, but that we are obliged to preserve his Person &amp;
Authority in these necessary intervalls, when he is called
to see to himself as a man; for we must preserve him as a
mean, because of his aptitude &amp; designation for such an
End, albeit not alwayes formally prosecuting it: we do
not say, that we are never to oune him, but when actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exercised in prosecuting these ends: but we say, we are
never to oune him, when he is Tyrannically &amp; Treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
abusing his Authority for destroying &amp; overturning
these ends, and violating all the conditions of his compact.
It may be <hi>Obj. 2. Saul</hi> was a Tyrant, and a breaker of his
Royal Covenant, and persecuter of the Godly, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
of the Priests of the Lord, usurper upon the Priests
Office, and many other wayes guilty of breaking all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:
And yet <hi>David</hi> and all <hi>Israel</hi> ouned him as the
<hi>Anointed of the Lord. Ans. 1. Saul</hi> was indeed a Tyrant,
rejected of God, and to be ejected out of his Kingdom in
His oun time &amp; way, which <hi>David</hi> a Prophet knowing
would not anticipate. But he was far short, and a meer
<hi>Bungler</hi> in acts of Tyranny in comparison of our Grassators:
he broke his Royal Covenant in very gross particular acts,
but did not cass &amp; rescind the whole of it, did not burn it,
did not make it Criminal to oune its obligation, nor did
he so much as profess a breach of it, nor arrogate an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:41139:186"/>
prerogative, nor attempt arbitrary Government,
nor to evert the fundamental Laws and overturn the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of Israel, &amp; bring in Idolatry, as Ours have done:
He was a Persecuter of <hi>David</hi> upon some private quarrels,
not of all the Godly upon the account of their Covenanted
Religion: He Murdered 85 Priests of the Lord, in a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of fury, because of their kindness to <hi>David;</hi> but he
did not make Laws adjudging all the Ministers of the
Lord to death, who should be found most faithful in their
duty to God &amp; His Church, as Ours have done against all
Field Preachers: He Usurped upon the Priests Office, in
one elicit act of Sacrificing; but he did not usurp a <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi>
over them, and annex it as an inherent right of his
Crown. 2. He was indeed such a Tyrant, as deserved to
have been dethroned &amp; brought to condign punishment,
upon the same accounts that <hi>Amaziah</hi> &amp; <hi>Uzziah</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for afterwards: And in this the people failed in their
duty, and for it they were plagued remarkably; shall their
Omission be an Argument to us? 3. As the question was
never put to the people, whether they ouned his Authority
as Lawful or not? So we do not read, either of their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
ouning him, or their positive disouning him: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
Thats no good Argument, which is drawen <hi>a non facto
ad faciendum;</hi> because they did it not, therefore it must not
be done. 4. They ouned him; but how? as the Minister
of God, not to be resisted or revolted from under pain of
damnation? (as all Lawful Magistrats ought to be ouned
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2, 4.) This I deny: for <hi>David</hi> &amp; his six hundred
men resisted him resolutely; And though the body of the
Nation did long Lazily lye &amp; couch as Asses under his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
yet at length, weary of his Tyranny, many revolted
from under him, and adjoined themselves to David at <hi>Zik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag,</hi>
while he kept himself close <hi>because</hi> of <hi>Saul the Son of
Kish 1 Chron.</hi> 12. 1. who are commended by the Spirit of
God for their valour vers. 2. &amp;c. and many out of <hi>Manasseh</hi>
fell to him, when he came with the <hi>Philistims</hi> against <hi>Saul</hi>
to battel <hi>vers.</hi> 19. This was a practical disouning of the
Tyrant, before the Lord deposed him. 5. <hi>David</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
pay him &amp; his Character some deference, as having
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:41139:187"/>
been the <hi>Anointed of the Lord;</hi> yet perhaps his honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him with that title, the <hi>Lords anointed 1 Sam.</hi> 24.
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. and calling him so often his <hi>Lord the King</hi> cannot
be altogether Justified, no more than his using that same
language to <hi>Achish</hi> King of <hi>Gath. 1 Sam.</hi> 29. 8. I shew
before how titles might be allowed: but this so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiate,
does not seem so consistent with his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precatory
prayer, for the Lords avenging him on him.
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 12. and many other imprecations against him in
his <hi>Psalms;</hi> in some of which he calls the same man, whom
here he stiles the Lords anointed, a <hi>Dog;</hi> as <hi>Saul</hi> &amp; his
Complices are called <hi>Psal.</hi> 95. 6, 14. and the <hi>evil</hi> violent &amp;
<hi>wicked</hi> man <hi>Psal</hi> 140. 1, 4. and the <hi>vilest of men Psal. 12. ult.</hi>
However it be, there can be no Argument from hence, to
oune the Authority of Tyrants &amp; Usurpers.</p>
               <p>6. Though this Necessary conditional compact, which
must alwayes be in the constitution of Lawfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Rulers, be
not alwayes <hi>express</hi> &amp; explicite, so that a written Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Copy of it cannot be always produced; yet it is alwise
to be understood <hi>implicitely</hi> at least transacted, in the Rulers
admission to the Government, wherein the Law of God
must regulate both parties; and when he is made Ruler,
it must natively be understood that it is upon terms to be a
Father, feeder, &amp; Protector, and not a Tyrant, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
&amp; Destroyer. All Princes are so far pactional,
that they are obliged, by the high &amp; absolute Soveraign
from whom they derive their Authority, to reign for the
Peace &amp; profit of the people: this is fixed unalterably by
the Laws of the Supreme Legislator, and solemnly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
unto at the <hi>Coronation:</hi> and whosoever declines or
destroyes this fundamental condition, he degrades &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
himself. It is also not only the Universal practice,
but necessary for the Constitution &amp; Conservation of all
Common-wealths, to have <hi>fundamental Laws</hi> &amp; Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
about Government, both for the upholding &amp; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
&amp; transfering it as occasion calls, and preventing
&amp; punishing violations thereof, that there be no invasion
or intrusion upon the Government, and if there be any
entrance upon it not according to the Constitution, that
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:41139:187"/>
it be illegitimated, and the Nations Liberties always se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.
This doeth infer &amp; regulate a conditional compact
with all that are advanced to the Government, albeit it
should not be expressed. For it is undenyable that in the
erection of all Governours, the grand Interests of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
must be seen to by <hi>Legal Securities</hi> for Religion &amp;
Liberty, which is the end &amp; use of fundamental Laws.
Now how these have been unhinged &amp; infringed, by the
introduction &amp; present establishment by Law of that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the prerogative, enacted in Parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 1661.
the <hi>Apologetick Relation</hi> doth abundantly demonstrate, <hi>Sect.
10. Concerning the Kings Civil Supremacy,</hi> enhancing all the
Absoluteness that ever the Great <hi>Turk</hi> could arrogate,
and yet far short of what hath been Usurped since, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
proclaimed to the world, especially by him who
now domineers, in his Challenges of <hi>Soveraign Authority,
prerogative Royal,</hi> &amp; <hi>Absolute Power, which all are to obey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reserve,</hi> whereby the whole basis of our Constitution,
and Bulwark of our Religion, Laws, &amp; Liberties, is
enervated, and we have security of no Law but the Kings
lust. Hence I argue, Those Princes, that, contrary to
their virtual compact (at least) at their coming to the
Crown, have overturned all fundamental Laws, cannot
be ouned: But our Princes have contrary to their virtual
compact (at least) at their coming to the Crown over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
all fundamental Laws: <hi>Ergo</hi> they cannot be ouned.
<q>The <hi>Major</hi> is plain: for they that overturn fundamental
Laws are no Magistrats; thereby all the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being subverted, and the subverter cannot be ouned
as a Father or friend, but an open enemy to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
nor looked upon as Magistrats doing their
duty, but as Tyrants seeking themselves with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Common-wealth.: And in this case the
compact, the ground of the Constitution, being violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they fall from their right, and the people are Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from their obligation, and they being no Magistrats
the people are no subjects, for the relation is mutual,
and so is the obligation <bibl>
                        <hi>Ius populi chap. 9. pag.</hi> 183.</bibl>
                  </q> The
<hi>Minor</hi> is manifest, both from the matter of fact, and the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:41139:188"/>
Mischiefs framed into Laws, by the <hi>Soveraign Authority,
Prerogative Royal,</hi> &amp; <hi>Absolute Power</hi> foresaid: whereby
what remains of our fundamental Constitutions, either in
Religious or Civil Settlements, unsubverted as yet, may
be subverted when this Absolute Monarch pleases. Which
<hi>Absolute Authority</hi> we cannot in conscience oune, for
these Reasons, taken both from Reason &amp; Scripture. First
its against Reason. 1. A power contrare to Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ouned: Absolute power is such: for that which
takes away, and makes the people to give away, their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
power of preserving their lives &amp; Liberties, and sets
a man above all rule &amp; Law, is contrare to Nature; such
is Absolute power, making people resign that which
is not in their power to resign, an absolute power to
destroy &amp; Tyrannize. 2. A power contrare to the first
rise of its Constitution cannot be ouned: Absolute power
is such: for, The first rise of the Constitution is a peoples
seting a Soveraign over them, giving him Authority to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
justice over them; But it were against this, to set
one over them with a power to rage at randome, and rule
as he lists: Its proven before, a King hath no power but
what the people gave him, but they never gave, never
could give an absolute power to destroy themselves. 3.
That power which is against the ends of Government can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ouned: Absolute power is such: for, that which
will make a peoples condition worse then before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and that mean which they intended for a bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to turn a plague &amp; scourage to them, and all the subjects
to be formal slaves at the Princes devotion, must needs be
contrare to the ends of Government: But Absolute power
is such: for, against the exorbitance thereof no means would
be left to prevent its obstructing all the fountains of Justice,
and commanding Laws &amp; Lawyers to speak, not justice
righteousness &amp; reason, but the lust &amp; pleasure of one man,
and turning all into Anarchy &amp; confusion: Certainly it
could never be the intention either of the work or workers,
at the Constitution of Government, to set up a power to
enslave the people, to be a Curse to them; but their ends
was to get comfort, safety, &amp; Liberty, under the shadow
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:41139:188"/>
of Government. 4. That power which invalidates, and
is inconsistent with the Kings compact with the people,
cannot be ouned: Absolute Power is such: for, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of that is alwise to secure Laws &amp; Liberties, to rule
according to Law; but to be Absolute invalidates &amp; is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with that: That which were an engagment into
Contradictories cannot consist with that compact; but to
engage to be absolute, and yet to rule by Law, is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagment
into Contradictories, which no people could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
for a security: Its inconsistent with this compact, to
give the King Absolute Power to overturn Religion &amp; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and to assume it which was never given, were to
invalidate this compact, and to make himself no King;
but to restore unto the people the power they conferred
upon him, for the defence of Religion &amp; Liberty. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That
power which is not from God, nor of God, cannot be
ouned: But Absolute Power is not of God; because it is a
power to Tyrannize &amp; Sin, which if it were of God He
should be the Author of Sin; for if the Moral Power be of
God, so must the acts be; but the acts of Absolute Power,
being Lawless, cannot be from God: <hi>Ergo</hi> neither the
Moral Power to commit these acts. 6. That Ruler who
cannot be <hi>Gods Minister</hi> for the <hi>peoples good</hi> cannot be oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
(for that is the formal reason of our consfiencious sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to Rulers <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4, 5.) But Absolute Soveraigns
are such as cannot be Gods Ministers for the peoples good;
for if they be Gods Ministers for good, they must admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
justice, preserve peace, rule by Law, take directions
from their Master; and if so, they cannot be absolute. 7.
A Tyrant in <hi>actu signato</hi> &amp; <hi>exercito</hi> cannot be ouned: But an
Absolute Prince is such; being a power that may play the
Tyrant if he pleases, and <hi>jure</hi> as King: And so if Kings be
<hi>actu primo</hi> Tyrants, then people are <hi>actu primo</hi> Slaves; and
so Royal Power cannot be a blessing to them: yea a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
breaker of all bonds, promises, &amp; Oaths, cannot be
ouned as Lawful Power: But Absolute Power is such:
for, it cannot be limited by these Obligations, at least
people cannot have any seurity by them. 8. A Lawless
Power is not to be ouned: An Absolute Power is a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:41139:189"/>
power: <hi>Ergo</hi> not to be ouned. The <hi>Major</hi> is plain.
<hi>Cicero</hi> sayes <hi>Lib. 2. de officio Eadem constituendarum Legum cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa
fuit, quae Regum</hi> The reason of making Lawes was the
same, as of the creation of Kings. And <hi>Buchanan de jure
Regni</hi> very excellently; <q>when the lust of Kings was in
stead of Laws, and being vested with an infinite &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
power, they did not contain themselves within
bounds—the insolency of Kings made Laws to be
desired; for this cause Laws were made by the people,
and Kings constrained to make use, not of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencious
wills in judgment, but of that right &amp; priviledge
which the people had conferred upon them, being taught
by many experiences, that it was better that their Liberty
should be concredited to Laws, than to Kings; better
to have the Law which is a <hi>dumb King,</hi> than a King who
is not a <hi>speaking Law.</hi>
                  </q> If then Laws be necessary for the
making of Kings, and more necessary than Kings, And
the same cause requirs both, then a King without Laws
is not to be ouned. <hi>Rex</hi> must be <hi>Lex loquens;</hi> a King must
be a speaking &amp; living Law, reducing the Law to practice:
So much then as a King hath of Law, so much he hath of a
King; and he who hath nothing of the Law, hath nothing
of a King. <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of <hi>England</hi> saith, <hi>the King can do
nothing but by Law, and no obedience is due to him but by Law.
Buchanan</hi> rehearses the words of the most famous Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
<hi>Theodosius</hi> &amp; <hi>Valentinianus</hi> to this effect, <hi>Digna vox
Majestate regnantis, legibus se alligatum Principem fateri; &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vero
Imperio majus ost, submittere legibus Principatum.</hi> It is,
say they, a word worthy of the Majestie of a King, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
he is a tyed Prince to the Laws, and indeed it is more to
submit a Principality to the Laws, than to enjoy an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
But now that an absolute power must be a Lawless
power, is also evident; for thats a Lawless power that
makes all Laws void, needless &amp; useless: but such is
absolute power: for, it cannot be confined to the observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Laws. 9. That power which is destructive to the
peoples Liberties cannot be ouned: Absolute power is
such: for, such a Licencious freedom as is absolute, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist with the peoples Liberties; for these he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:41139:189"/>
when he pleases: Now these, in their oun Nature,
and in all respects, being preferable to the Kings preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
And it being no prerogative which is not consistent
with, yea in its oun nature adapted to, the precious Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of Religion &amp; Liberty, when the Kings Absolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is stated in contradictory terms to these, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
oune that Authority: for now he hath another Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
than could be given him for the preservation of these
Interests, in the preservation whereof he can only have an
Authority to be ouned, seeing he claimes a power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them if he please. 10. If we should oune Absolute
Authority; then we should oune a Royal prerogative in
the King to <hi>make</hi> &amp; <hi>dispense</hi> with Laws: Now that cannot
be ouned: for, it would infer that the King had a Masterly
Dominion over his subjects, to make Lawes, &amp; inflict
Penalties without their consent. And plain it is, they that
make Kings must have a Coordinate power to make Laws
also; but the people in their Representatives make Kings,
as is proven. Next a prerogative to dispense with Laws,
except such Laws as are in their oun nature dispensable,
without prejudice to any Law of God or Liberties of men,
cannot be ouned: for any power to dispense with Reason
&amp; Law, not grounded on any other reason but meer will
&amp; absolute pleasure, is a brutish power. It cannot be <hi>jus
Coronae,</hi> a right annexed to the Crown, to do so: for a
King as a King <hi>illud tantum potest quod jure potest</hi> can do noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but what he may do by Law. Nay this is not only a
Brutish power, but a Blasphemous power, making him
a Kind of God on earth illimited, that can do what he
pleases: And to dispute it further, were to dispute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God hath made all under him slaves by their oun con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
Or whether he may encroach on the prerogative of
God, or not. By this prerogative, he arrogates a power
to dispense with the Laws of God also, in pardoning Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
&amp;c. which no man hath power to do: the Law of
God being so peremptorly indispensable <hi>Gen. 9. 6. whoso
sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed. Numb.</hi> 35. 30.
31. <hi>Who so killeth any person, the murderer shall he put to death—more
over ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:41139:190"/>
but he shall be surely put to death.</hi> These pardons are acts of
blood to the Community. If the Judgment be Gods, as
it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 17. and not for man but <hi>for the Lord 2 Chron.</hi> 19.
6. then no King can arrogate a power to dispense with it, no
more then an inferior Judge can dispense with the Kings
Laws: for the King is but a Minister, bearing the Sword not
in vain, but as a revenger to execute wrath upon them
that do evil <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. They are but <hi>bastard Kings</hi> who
give out sentances out of their oun mouth, contrary to
Gods mind. And if he may do acts of grace by Prerogative
above Law, then may he also do acts of Justice (so pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
by the same Prerogative; and so may murder Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
as well as pardon Murderers, he may condemn
the just as well as justify the wicked, both which are
alike abomination to the Lord <hi>Pro.</hi> 17. 15. This
power cannot be ouned in any man. 11. To oune Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
power, were to recognosce the King as the proper
&amp; sole <hi>Interpreter</hi> of the Law. This <hi>Buchanan</hi> shews
to be very absurd: <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Cum regi Legum interpretationem</hi> &amp;c.</bibl>when yow grant the interpretation of Laws to a King;
yow give him such a Licence, that the Law should not
speak what the Lawgiver meaneth but what is for the
Interpreters Interest; so that he may turn it to all actions,
as a <hi>Lesbian</hi> rule, for his oun advantage; And so what he
pleases the Laws shall speak, and what he will not it
shall not speak.</q> Now the Kings absolute pleasure, can no
more be the sense of the Law, than it can be the Law it
self: He is King by Law, but he is not King of Law: No
mortal can make a sense to a Law, contrare to the Law;
for it involves a Contradiction; the true meaning is only
the Law. This also would take away the use of all Laws;
for they could not declare what were just &amp; unjust, but as
the King pleased; their genuine sense could not be the
rule. 12. If we oune the Law to be above the King, then
we cannot oune the King to be absolute: But the former
is true: For, he must be under it several wayes: (1) under
its <hi>Directive</hi> power; that will not be denyed. (2) under its
<hi>Constitutive</hi> power: he is not a King by Nature, but by
Constitution &amp; Law: therefore the Law is above the King;
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:41139:190"/>
because its only from the Law that there is a King, and
that such a man and not another is King, and that the King
must be so &amp; so qualified, and they that made him a King
may also unmake him by the same Law. (3) under its <hi>Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
&amp; <hi>Restrictive</hi> power, as a man he cannot be absolute,
nor as a King by Law. (4) under its <hi>Coactive</hi> power. A <hi>Law
maker,</hi> said King <hi>Iames the 6. should not be a Law breaker:</hi>
but if he turn an overturner of the fundamental Laws, that
Law or Covenant that made him King, doth oblige to
unmake him. Whatever power he hath it is only a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,
<hi>fiduciary</hi> power, as the Nations <hi>Publick servant:</hi>
and that which was lent him in Pledge or paun, may be
reclaimed, when abused by him. Especially if he turn par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide,
Kill his brother, murder his nobles, burn Cities,
then he may &amp; ought to be punished by Law. Otherwise,
God should have provided better for the safety of the part,
than of the whole, though that part be but a mean for the
safety of the whole: for if he turn Tyrant in his absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the people must be destroyed, if they may not repress
him; thus he is secured, and the whole exposed to ruine.
Yea, if he be a man as well as a King, he must be under
rule of Law; and when he transgresses, either his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
are punishable <hi>by</hi> men, or they are not transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<hi>with</hi> men, See many Arguments to this purpose in <hi>Lex
Rex Quest.</hi> 14. 19. 22. 23. 24. 26. 27. But <hi>Secondly</hi> I prove it
by <hi>Scripture</hi> 1. Even as King he is regulated by Law, not
to multiply horses, nor wives, nor money, but to keep
the words of the Law, and not lift up himself above his
brethren, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 16, 17, 19, 20. he must observe to do
according to the Law, and not turn from it to the right
hand or to the left <hi>Iosh. 1. 7. Ergo</hi> he must not be absolute.
2. He is certainly under that Law, <hi>Math. 7. 12. what so ever
ye would that men should do to yow do ye even so to them:</hi> which
is the universal fundamental Law. If then he would have
us keeping in our line of subordination to him, he must
keep his line, and so cannot be absolute. 3. What is Gods
dwe &amp; peculiar Prerogative, can be ouned in no Mortal:
But Absolute power is Gods due &amp; peculiar Prerogative.
He alone does <hi>whatsoever pleaseth Him Psal.</hi> 115. 3. He alone
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:41139:191"/>
worketh alle things <hi>after the Counsel of His oun will Eph.</hi> 1.
11. Acts or Commands founded upon the sole pleasure of
the Agent, are proper to God. Its Gods will and not the
Creatures, that can make things good or just. Its Blasphemy
therefore to ascribe absolute power to any Creature.
4. That which the spirit of God condemned as a point of
Tyranny in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> that is no prerogative to be
ouned: but the Spirit of God condemned this in him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from absolute power, that <hi>whom he would</hi> he slew,
and <hi>whom he would</hi> he kept alive, whom he would he set
up, and whom he would he put doun, And his heart was
lifted up <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 19. 20. 5. That which God condemns &amp;
threatens in Tyrants in the Word in General, cannot be
ouned: but Absolute power, God condemns &amp; thereatens
in the word in general; that they <hi>turned Iudgement into Gall,</hi>
and said, <hi>have we not taken to us horns by our oun strength?
Amos.</hi> 6. 12. 13. 6. The Word of God speaks nothing of
the Kings Absolute prerogative, to make Laws as he will.
It is plain the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> had it not; but the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi>
had a great part of the Nomothetick power, and of the
punitive power in a special manner: the Princes &amp; people
had it by <hi>Ieremahs</hi> acknowledgment <hi>Ier.</hi> 26. 14. And
<hi>Zedekiah</hi> confesses to them; <hi>the King is not he that can do any
thing against yow Ier.</hi> 38. 5. 7. we find the King in Scripture
had not an absolute power, to expone or execute the Law
as he would: <hi>Saul</hi> made a Law 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Cursed be
the man that eats any food until evening.</hi> But expening it, &amp;
thinking to execute it after a Tyrannical manner, he was
justly resisted by the people, who would not let him kill
innocent <hi>Ionathan.</hi> 8. Nor had he the <hi>sole</hi> power of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
it: for inferior Judges were Interpreters, who are
no less essential Judges than the King, who are set to Judge
<hi>for the Lord,</hi> and not for the King 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 19. 6. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were to expone it according to their oun con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and not the Kings. They were to speak righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
&amp; <hi>Iudge uprightly Psal.</hi> 58. 1. hence called <hi>Gods,</hi> as
well as Kings <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 1. There was no essential Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between a King of Gods approving and a Judge;
there being but one Law to both <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 9. he was <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:41139:191"/>
to judgment as well as others: for being but a <hi>brother,</hi>
even while on the throne, who was not to lift up his heart
above his brethren, <hi>Deut. 17. ult.</hi> When his Cause was to
be judged, his person though never so great was not to be
respected; nor were they to be afrayed of the face of man,
for the <hi>judgment was Gods Deut.</hi> 1. 17. therefore the Judges
were to give out sentence in judgment, as if the Lord were
to give it out: There was no exception of Kings there.
Yea, we find according to common Law, they judged &amp;
punished offending Kings, as shall be made appear. 10. If
they were under <hi>Church Censures,</hi> then they were not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute:
but we find Kings were under Church Censures; not
only rebuked sharply to their face, of which we have many
instances; but also subjected to Church discipline, as
<hi>Uzziah</hi> shut up for his Leprosie. And certainly at all times
this must be extended to all: for the King is either a brother,
or not: If not, then he should not be King, according to
the Scripture <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15. then also he is not a Christian,
nor can he say the <hi>Lords Prayer:</hi> If he be, then <hi>if a brother
offend,</hi> he is subject to the Church <hi>Math.</hi> 18. there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of Kings there. The <hi>Objection</hi> from <hi>Eccles, 8. 3. 4.
—he doth whatsoever pleaseth him</hi> where the word of a King
is there is power, and <hi>who may say unto him, what doest thow?</hi>
is of no significancy here. For. 1. This Argument will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
absolute <hi>obedience,</hi> if the power be to be taken ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for it is obedience that is there commanded: and
so we must not only oune the absolute Authority, but obey
it without reserve, which never any yet had the impudence
to plead for, until <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>unjust</hi> claimed it in a <hi>Scots</hi>
Proclaimation: but we answer, <hi>It is better to obey God than
man,</hi> 2. If he may do whatsoever pleases him, then he may
turn <hi>Priest,</hi> then he may kill whom he pleases, &amp; take
possession; and yet for <hi>Saules</hi> Usurpation <hi>Samuel</hi> could say
more than <hi>what doest thow?</hi> even to tell him, he had done
<hi>foolishly,</hi> and his Kingdom should not continue 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.
13. 14. And for <hi>Ahabs</hi> Tyranny, <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>the dogs shall lick thy blood even thine 1 King.</hi> 21. 19. And <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi>
thow <hi>profane wicked-Prince of Israel Ezek.</hi> 21. 25. 3. The
meaning is then only this; that a righteous King, his just
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:41139:192"/>
power may not be controlled; he is armed with power
that may not be resisted, for he beareth not the Sword in
vain, and therefore we must not stand in an evil matter
against them I conlude then this Argument, with the words
of an Ingenious Author, upon this same subject, both in
<hi>Thesi</hi> &amp; <hi>Hypothesi:</hi> 
                  <q>whosoever shall offer to rule Arbitrarly,
does immediatly cease to be King <hi>de jure.</hi> seeing by the
fundamental, Common &amp; Statute-Laws of the Realme,
we know none for Supreme Magistrate &amp; Governour
but a limited Prince, and one who stands circumscribed

               <p>7. From what is said this is the result, that it is essentially
necessary to a <hi>Moral power</hi> &amp; Authority, to have a <hi>right</hi> &amp;
<hi>title,</hi> without which we can oune none, but as a Tyrant
<hi>sine Titulo.</hi> For what is Authority, but a right to rule? if
then it have not a right, it is not Authority. This will be
undeniable, if we consider, that as Private dominon,
or <hi>Property,</hi> consists in a right to enjoy; So Publick domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
in a right to rule. Some things indeed are exposed
to the common &amp; arbitrary use of every man, and also at
the begining, by reason of the fewness of mankind, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
was not reduced to distinct Property; yet now,
upon the Multiplication of Occupants, of necessity it must
be stated by peculiar appropriation, from the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and by the Grant of the Supreme King, who hath
given the <hi>earth to the Children of men Psal.</hi> 115. 16, not to be
catched up as the food of beasts, which the stronger seise,
and the weaker get only what the other leave them, but
divided by right as an Inheritance, by Him who <hi>separated
the Sons of Adam and set the bounds of the People Deut.</hi> 32. 8.
Especially Publick Dominion cannot be without a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for its relation to the subjected, and must be so tied
up, that it may be said, this man is to command and these
are to obey. I shew that Authority is from God both by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
&amp; Constitution; so that the Subjects are given to
understand, such an one is singled out by God to sustain
this Authority, by prescribing a rule for mens entry into the
Authoritative relation, whereby He communicates that
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:41139:192"/>
power to them which is not in others, and which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
would not be in them. Hence it is that Orderly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
that must give the <hi>right,</hi> and upon mens having or
not having such an entrance to it depends the reality or
nullity of the power they challenge. Where therefore
there is no Lawful Investure, there is no <hi>Moral power</hi> to
be ouned; otherwise <hi>Iohn of Leyden</hi> his Authority might
have been ouned: the unlawfulness of such a power consists
in the very tenore it self, and if we take away the use or
holding of it, we take away the very being of it: it is not
then the abuse of a power Lawfully to be used, but the very
use of it is unlawful. But in the Usurpation of this Man,
or Monster rather that is now mounted the Throne, there
is no Lawful investure in the way God hath appointed, as
is shewed above. <hi>Ergo</hi> there is no Moral power to be
ouned. To clear this alitle further, it will be necessary to
remove the ordinary Prentences, pleaded for a Title to
warrant the ouning of such as are in power. Which are
three chiefly <hi>viz. Possession, Conquest,</hi> and <hi>Hereditary Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</hi>
The <hi>first</hi> must be touched more particularly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath been the originate error, &amp; spring of all the
stupid mistakes about Government, and is the pitiful plea
of many even Malecontents, why this Mans Authority is
to be ouned, asserting that a person attaining &amp; occupying
the place of power (by whatsoever means) is to be ouned
as the Magistrate. But this can give no right: for. 1. If Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
cannot signify Gods approbative ordination, it can
give no right; for without that there can be no right: But
Providence cannot signify His approbative Ordination:
because that, without the warrant of His Word, cannot
signify either allowance or dissallowance, it is so various,
being often the same to Courses directly contrary, and
oftentimes contrary to the same Course: sometimes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
it, sometimes crossing it, whether it be good or
bad: And the same Common Providence may proceed
from far different Purposes, to one in Mercy, to another
in Judgment; And most frequently very disproportionable
to mens wayes: Providence places sometimes <hi>wickedness in
the place of Iudgment, and iniquity in the place of righteousness
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:41139:193"/>
Eccless.</hi> 3. 16. that is not by allowance. By Providence it
happens to the just according to the work of the wicked,
and to the <hi>wicked</hi> according to the <hi>work of</hi> the <hi>righteous Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cless.
8. 14. No man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them,</hi> all things come alike to all, there is one event to
the righteous and to the wicked <hi>Eccel.</hi> 9. 1. It were a great
debasing of the <hi>Lords anointed</hi> to give him no other warrant
then sin hath in the world, or the falling of a Sparrow.
2. Either every Providential Possession, in every ease,
gives a title: Or God hath Declared it as a Law, that it
shall be so in this particular matter of Authority only. The
first cannot be said: for, that would justify all robbery:
Nor the second, for where is that Law found? Nay it
were impious to alledge it; for it would say, there is no
unjust Possessor or Disorderly occupant, but if he were
once in the Possession, he were right enough: And then
Usurpation would be no sin. 3. If none of the Causes
of Magistracy be required to the producing of this Possesso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
power, then it cannot give or have any right; for
without the true Causes it cannot be the true effect, and so
can have no true right to be ouned: But none of the Causes
of Magistracy are required to the production of this; neither
the Institution of God, for this might have been if Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy
had never been instituted; Nor the Constitution of
men, for this may usurp without that. 4. That which
must follow upon the right, and be Legitimated by it,
cannot be ouned as the right, nor can it give the title: But
the Possession of the power, or the Possessory exercise
thereof, must follow upon its right, and be legitimated
by it. <hi>Ergo</hi>—A man must first be in the relation of a Ruler,
before he can rule; and men must first be in the relation
of subjects, before they obey. The Commands of Publick
Justice, to whom are they given but to Magistrats? They
must then be Magistrats, before they can be ouned as the
Ministers of Justice: he must be a Magistrate before he can
have the power of the Sword, he cannot by the power of
the Sword make himself Magistrate. 5. That which
would make every one in the Possession of the Magistracy, a
Tyrant, can not be ouned: But a Possessory occupation
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:41139:193"/>
giving right, would make every one in Possession of
the Magistracy a Tyrant, can not be ouned: But a Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory
occupation giving right, would make every one in
Possession a Tyrant; for, that which enervats &amp; takes away
that necessary Distinction between the Kings personal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
&amp; his Legal Capacity, his natural &amp; his moral
power, will make every King a Tyrant (seeing it makes
every thing that he can do as a man, to be Legally done as
a King) But a Possessory occupation giving right, would
enervate &amp; take away that distinction: for how can these
be distinguished in a meer Possessory power? the mans Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
is all his legal power; and if Possession give a right,
his power will give legality. 6. What sort or size of Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
can be ouned to give a right? Either it must be partial
or plenary possession: Not partial, for then others may
be equally entitled to the Government, in competition
with that partial possessor, having also a part of it: Not
plenary, for them every interruption or Usurpation on a
part, would make a dissolution of the Government.
7. Hence would follow infinite absurdities: this would
give equal warrant in case of vacancy to all men to step to,
&amp; stickle for the throne, and expose the Common wealth
as a booty to all aspiring spirits; for they needed no more
to make them Soveraigns, and lay a tye of subjection upon
the consciences of people, but to get into possession: And
in case of Competition, it would leave people still in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
&amp; uncertainties whom to oune, for they behoved to
be subject only to the Uppermost, which could not be
known until the Controversy be decided: It would cassate
&amp; make void all preobligations, Cautions, &amp; restrictions
from God about the Government: it would Cancel and
make vain all other titles of any, or Constitutions, or
provisions, or Oaths of Allegiance: yea to what purpose
were Laws, or pactions made about ordering the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if possession gave right, &amp; laid an obligation on all
to oune it? yea then it were sinful to make any such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
to fence in &amp; limit the determination of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
if providential possession may authorize every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truesive
acquisition to be ouned: Then also in case of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:41139:194"/>
of two equal pretenders to the Government, there
would be no place left for arbitrations: If this were true,
that he is the power that is in possession, the difference
were at an end; no man could plead for his oun right then:
In this also it is inconsistent with it self, condemning all
resistence against the present occupant, yet justifying every
resistence that is but successful to give possession. 8. That
which would oblige us to oune the <hi>Devil</hi> &amp; the <hi>Pope,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a ground to oune any man: But if this were true,
that possession gave right, it would oblige us to oune the
Devil &amp; the pope. <hi>Satan</hi> we find claiming to himself the
possession of the worlds Kingdoms <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 6. which as to
many of them is in some respect true, for he is called the
<hi>God of this world,</hi> and the <hi>Prince of this world Iohn.</hi> 14. 30.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. Are men therefore obliged to oune his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?
or shall they deny his, and acknowledge his lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
who bears his name, and by whom all his orders are
execute, I mean the man that Tyranizes over the people of
God? for he is the <hi>Devil that casts some into prison Revel.</hi> 2.
10. Again the <hi>Pope,</hi> his Captain-General, layes claim to
a Temporal power &amp; Ecclesiastick both, over all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and possesses it over many; and again, under the
Conduct of his vassal the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> is attempting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the possession of <hi>Britain:</hi> Shall he therefore be ouned?
This Cursed Principle disposes men for Poperie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to strengthen Poperie &amp; Tyrannie both on the
stage, to the vacating of all the promises of their dispossess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.
9. That which would justify a Damnable sin, and
make it a ground of a duty, cannot be ouned: But this fancy
of ouning every power in possession would justify a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sin, and make it the ground of a duty: for, Resistence
to the powers ordained of God is a <hi>damnable sin Rom,</hi> 13. 2.
but the Resisters having success in providence may come to
the possession of the power, by expelling the just occupant;
and by this opinion that possession would be ground for the
duty of subjection for Conscience sake. 10. If a self-created
dignity be null and not to be ouned, then a meer possessory
is not to be ouned: But the former is ttue: as Christ saith,
<hi>Iohn.</hi> S. 54. <hi>If I honour myself my honor is nothing.</hi> 11. That
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:41139:194"/>
which God hath disallowed cannot be ouned: But God
hath expresly disallowed possession without right <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.
27. I will <hi>overturn, overturn, overturn it until He come whose
right it is, Hos. 8. 4. They have set up Kings &amp; not by me. Math.</hi> 26.
52. <hi>All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword;</hi> by
this the Usurper of the Sword is differenced from the true
ouner. 12. Many Scripture examples confut this; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the possession may be in one, and the power with
right in another. <hi>David</hi> was the Magistrate, and yet <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom</hi>
possessed the place 2 <hi>Sam. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. chap.
Shebah</hi> also made a revolt and Usurped the possession in a
great part, and yet <hi>David</hi> was King 2 <hi>Sam. 20. 2. Adonijah</hi>
got the start in respect of possession, exalting himself, saying,
<hi>I will be King:</hi> yet the Kingdom was <hi>Solomons from the Lord.
1 King. 1. ch.</hi> The house of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> had not power to keep
still the Kingdom 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 9. and <hi>Athaliah</hi> took the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of it, yet the people set up <hi>Ioash</hi> 23. 3. Next we have
many examples of such who have invaded the possessor,
Witness <hi>Iehoram</hi> &amp; <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> their expedition against
<hi>Mesba</hi> King of <hi>Moah, Elisha</hi> being in the expedition 2 <hi>King.</hi>
3. 4, 5. Hence we see the first pretence removed. The
<hi>Second</hi> is no better; which <hi>Augustine</hi> calls <hi>Magnum Latro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinium
a Great Robberie;</hi> I mean <hi>conquest;</hi> or a power of the
Sword gotten by the Sword: which that it can give no right
to be ouned, I prove. 1. That which can give no signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of Gods approving will, cannot give a <hi>Title</hi> to be
ouned: But meer conquest can give no signification of
Gods approving will, as is just now proven about posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
for then the Lord should have approven all the unjust
conquests that have been in the world. 2. Either conquest
as <hi>conquest</hi> must be ouned, as a just Title to the Crown; and
so the <hi>Ammonites, Moabites, Philistims</hi> &amp;c. prevailing over
Gods people for a time; must have reigned by <hi>right:</hi> or as
a <hi>just</hi> conquest, in this case conquest is only a mean to the
conquerours seising &amp; holding that power, which the State
of the war entitled him unto, And this ingress into Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over the conquered is not grounded on <hi>conquest</hi> but
on <hi>justice,</hi> and not at all privative but Inclusive of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the people;</hi> and then it may be ouned; but without a
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:41139:195"/>
compact, upon conditions of securing Religion &amp; Liberty,
the posterity cannot be subjected without their consent:
for, what ever just quarrel the conquerour had with the
present Generation, he could haue none with the Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
the Father can have no power to resign the Liberty
of the Children. 3. A King as King, and by virtue of his
Royal Office, must be ouned to be a Father, Tutor, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
Shepherd, &amp; Patron of the people: But a mere
conquerour without consent cannot be ouned as such. Can
he be a Father &amp; Patron to us against our will, by the sole
power of the sword? a Father to these that are unwilling
to be Sons? an head over such as will not be members? and
a defender through violence? 4. A King as such is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
gift of God, and blessing not a judgement: But a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
as such is not a blessing but a judgement, his native
end being not Peace but fire &amp; sword. 5. That which
hath nothing of a King in it, can not be ouned to make a
King: But conquest hath nothing of a King in it; for it
hath nothing but violence &amp; force, nothing out what the
bloodyest villain that was never a King may have, nothing
of Gods approving &amp; regulating Will, nothing of Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or constitution; and a plain repugnancy to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of God, for God hath said, <hi>thow shalt not kill;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
sayes, <hi>I will kill,</hi> and Prosper, &amp; reign. 6. A Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Call to a Lawful Office may not be resisted: But a Call
to conquest, which is nothing but ambition or revenge,
ought to be resisted; because not of Gods preceptive will,
otherwise He should be the Author of sin. 7. That power
which we must oune to be the Ordinance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God, must
not be resisted <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2. But conquest may be resisted in
defence of our King &amp; Country: Therefore it must no be
ouned to be the Ordinance of God. 8. That which God
condemns in His Word cannot be ouned: But Dominion
by the sword God condemns in His Word <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 26.
<hi>ye stand upon your sword</hi>—and <hi>shall possess the Land, Amos</hi>
6. 13. ye rejoice in a thing of naught which say, <hi>have we not
taken horns to us by our oun strength. Habhak.</hi> 2. 5, 6—Wo <hi>to
him that encreaseth that which is not his, how long</hi> &amp;c. 9. We
have many examples of invading Conquerours: as <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:41139:195"/>
for the rescue of <hi>Lot</hi> pursued the Conquering Kings unto
<hi>Dan. Gen. 14. 14. Ionathan</hi> smote a Garison of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queering
<hi>Philistims 1 Sam.</hi> 13. 3. The Lord ouning &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing
them so to do. The people did often shake off
the yoke of their Conquerours in the history of the Judges:
But this they might not do to their Lawful Rulers. What
is objected from the Lords people Conquering <hi>Canaan</hi> &amp;c.
is no Argument for conquest: for He, to whom belongs
the earth and its fullness, disponed to <hi>Israel</hi> the Land of
<hi>Canaan</hi> for their Inheritance, and ordained that they should
get the possession thereof by conquest: It followeth not,
therefore that Kings now, wanting any word of promise
or divine Grant to any Lands, may ascend to the Thrones
of other Kingdoms than their oun, by no better title than
the bloody sword. See <hi>Lex Rex Quest</hi> 12. The <hi>Third</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
of <hi>Hereditary Succession</hi> remaines to be removed:
which may be thus disproven. 1. This clashes with the
former, though commonly asserted by Royalists. For
either <hi>Conquest</hi> gives a right, or it does not: If it does, then
it looses all allegiance to the heirs of the Crown disposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thereby: If it does not give a right, then no Hereditary
Succession founded upon conquest can have any right,
being founded upon that which hath no right: And this will
shake the most part of Hereditary Successions that are now
in the world. 2. If Hereditary Succession have no right,
but the peoples consent; then of it self it can give none to
a man that hath not that consent: But the former is true.
For, it is demanded, how doth the Son or Brother suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed?
by what right? It must either be by divine promise;
Or by the Fathers will; Or it must come by propogation
from the first Ruler, by a right of the Primogeniture: But
none of these can be. For the first, we have no imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Divine Constitution tying the Crown to such a race,
as in <hi>Davids</hi> Covenant: It will be easily granted, they fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not their Charter from Heaven immediatly, as <hi>David</hi>
had it, a man of many peculiar prerogatives, to whose
line the promise was astricted of the Coming of <hi>Messias,</hi>
and <hi>Iacobs</hi> Prophesie that the <hi>Scepter</hi> should not depart from
<hi>Iudah</hi> until His coming <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. was restricted to his
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:41139:196"/>
family afterwards: Wherefore he could say, <hi>The Lord God
of Israel chose me befor all the house of my father to be King over Israel
for ever, for He hath chosen Iudah to be the Ruler, and of the house of
Iudah the house of my father, and among the sons of my father He
liked me to make me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> King over Israel, and of all my Sons He hath
chosen Solomon 1 Chron.</hi> 28. 4. 5. All Kings cannot say this;
neither could <hi>Saul</hi> say it, though immediatly called of
God as well as <hi>David:</hi> yet this same Promise to <hi>David</hi> was
Conditional, <hi>if His Children should keep the Lords wayes
2 Chron.</hi> 6. 16. Next it cannot be said this comes from
the <hi>will of the father;</hi> for according to the Scripture, no
King can make a King, though a King may appoint &amp;
design his son for succession, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Solomon,</hi> but
the people make him. The father is some way a Cause
why his son succeedeth, but he is not the Cause of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yaltie
conferred upon him by line: for the question will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,
who made him a King? and his father? &amp; grand father?
till we come up to the first father. Then, who made him a
King? not himself: therefore it must be refounded upon the
peoples choise &amp; constitution: And who appointed the
lineal succession, and tyed the Crown to the line, but
they? It is then at the best, the Patrimony of the people,
by the fundamental Law of the Kingdom, conferred upon
the successor by consent. And generally it is granted, even
where the succession is lineal, he that comes to inherit,
Doth it not <hi>jure hereditario</hi> but <hi>vi legis,</hi> he does not succeed
by heritage but by the force of Law; the Son then hath not
his Kingdom from his father but by Law, which the people
made &amp; stand to, as long as it may consist with the reasons
of publick advantage, upon which they condiscended to
establish such a family over them. Neither can it be said,
It is by a right of <hi>Primogeniture</hi> propogated from the first
Ruler; for this must either be <hi>Adam</hi> the first of the world;
or <hi>Fergus</hi> v. G. the first of this Kingdom. It could not come
from <hi>Adam</hi> as a Monarch &amp; father of all: For that behoved
to be, either by order of Nature, or his volun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ary assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
It could not be transferred by order of Nature; for
besides the difficulty to find out <hi>Adams</hi> successor, in the
universal Monarchy, and the absurdity of fixing it on <hi>Cain</hi>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:41139:196"/>
(who was a Cursed vagabond, afraied of every man, and
could not be an universal Monarch yet <hi>Adams</hi> first born)
It will be asked, how this passed from him unto others?
whether it went by <hi>father-hood</hi> to all the Sons, fathers to their
Posterity? which would multiply as many Common
wealths, as there have been fathers since: Or if it went by
<hi>Primogeniture</hi> only to the first born, that he alone could
claim the power which would infer the necessity of an
universal Monarchy, without multiplication of Common-wealths.
If it was by his voluntary assignment, to whom
&amp; in what proportion he pleased; then the universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
died with himself, and so could not be conveyed at
all: for, either he behoved to give each son a share, to be
conveyed dounwards to their children in that proportion;
or whole &amp; solide to one: So also the former dilemma
recurs, for if the first be said, it will make as many litle
Kingdoms as there have been sons of <hi>Adam;</hi> if the second,
the world should be but still one Kingdom. But however it
be, this could never be the way that God appointed, either
for raising a Magistratical power where it is wanting, or
deriving a right to any in being; Considering the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
division, confusion, &amp; Extinction of families that
have been. If it be from <hi>Fergus</hi> the first of this line; then
either it comes from him as a King, or as a Father: not
the first, for the reason above hinted: nor as a father; for
a father may defraud his son of the heritage, a King cannot
deprive his son of the Crown; a father may divide his heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
a King cannot divide the Kingdom among his sons;
It must then be at length refounded on the peoples Consent
3. If even where lineal succession is Constituted by Law,
for eviting the inconveniences of frequent elections, people
are not tied to admit every first born of that line; then that
birth righr, where there is no more, cannot make a King:
But the former is true; for they are tied only conditionally,
so he be qualified, and have a head to sit at the helme, and
not a fool or monster, neither are they free to admit Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
or Idolaters by the Laws of God and of the Land:
It is not birth then, but their admission being so qualified,
that makes Kings. Hence. 4. That which takes away
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:41139:197"/>
the peoples birth-right, given them of God to provide for
their liberties in the fitest Government, that is not to be
ouned: But to make birth alone a tile to the Crown, takes
away the peoples birth-right given them of God of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for their liberties in the fitest Government, and fetters
their choise to one destructive to these. Certainly where
God hath not bound the conscience, men may not bind
themselves nor their posterity: But God hath never fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
men to a choise of a Government or Governing
line, which contrary to the intention of the Oath may
prove destructive to the ends thereof. Nor can the fathers
leave in legacy by Oath, any chains to fetter the after wits
of posterity to a choise destructive to Religion &amp; liberty.
<hi>Israel</hi> was bound by Covenant not to destroy the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi>
but if they had risen to cut off <hi>Isael,</hi> who can doubt but they
were loosed from that obligation? for to preserve Cut-throats
was contrary to the intention of the Oath: so when
either Monarchy, or the succeeding Monarch, proves
destructive to the ends of Government, the Choice, Law,
or Oath of our fathers, cannot bind us. 5. If we are tied
to the hereditary succession, not for the right the successor
hath by birth, but for our Covenanted allegiance to them
whose successor he is; then cannot his birth-right be the
ground of our Allegiance, And consequently hereditary
succession cannot make a King: But the former is true; for
in hereditary Crowns, the first family being chosen by the
suffrages of the people, for that Cause the hereditary
Prince comes to the Throne, becanse his first father, and
in him the whole line, was chosen: The hereditary suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
hath no priviledge or prerogative, but from him
who was chosen King. Therefore the obligation to the
son, being no greater than the obligation to the father,
which is the ground of that, if the father then was ouned
only because he was <hi>chosen</hi> &amp; qualified for Government,
the Son cannot be ouned for any other Cause, but as cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
<hi>in him,</hi> and also qualified and admitted with Consent.
We cannot choose the father as qualified, and tye our
selves to the Successors, be what they will. 6. If a King be
not born heir of a Kingdom, then is he not King by birth;
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:41139:197"/>
But he is not born heir of a Kindom: for, a mean cannot
be born to inherit the end, the King is but a mean for the
Kingdoms preservation. If the Kingdom be his by birth as
an inheritance, why may he not upon necessary occasions
sell his inheritance? but if he sell it, then all confess he is
no more King. 7. If that which makes a King cannot be
transmitted from father to son; then succession by birth
cannot make a King: But the former is true. The Royal
faculty of Governing cannot be transmitted: <hi>Solomon</hi>
asked it from God, he had it not from his father: nor can
he be born to the <hi>honour</hi> of a King, because not born with
either the gift or honour to be a <hi>Iudge.</hi> God <hi>maketh high &amp;
low,</hi> not birth. Nor can the <hi>Call</hi> &amp; <hi>Constitution</hi> of a King
according to the will of God be transferred from father to
son, for that cannot be in Gods way without the interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Consent of the people, that cannot make him a <hi>born
King.</hi> 8. If no Dominion can come by Nature, as is
proven before, then can no man be a born King: Nature
&amp; birth cannot give them a Scepter in their hand; nor
Kingly Majestie they must have that alone from God &amp;
the people, and may only expect honour from their oun
good Government: Kings (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> sayes) must be like
dogs that are best hunters, not these who are born of best
dogs. 9. The peculiar Prerogative of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> must not
be ascribed to any other: But this is His peculiar Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
to be a <hi>born King</hi> of whom it might be truely faid,
<hi>Where is He that is born King of the Iewes?</hi> And for this end
was He born, who came out of the womb with a Crown
on His Head, which no Creature can bear. 10. In Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
we find that a King was to be so &amp; so qualified, not a
<hi>stranger,</hi> but a reader of Gods Word &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15. &amp;c.
he was not qualified by naked birth. Hence, if all the
qualifications requisite in an heir cannot make a King qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
according to the Institution of God, then his being
heir cannot make him King: But the first is true; an heir
may be an heir without these qualifications. 11. We find
in the Scripture, the people were to make the Kings by
that Law <hi>Deut. 17. thow shalt choose him whom the Lord
chooseth:</hi> yea neither <hi>Saul</hi> nor <hi>David</hi> were Kings, till the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:41139:198"/>
people met to make them: Therefore birth never made
them Kings, even though the Kingdom was tied to <hi>Davids</hi>
line. That was only a Typical designment by special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
because Christ was to come of that line; it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
established in <hi>Davids</hi> family for Typical reasons, that
cannot be now alledged. 12. We find in the disposal of
Government among brethren, this birth-order was not
seldom inverted; as when <hi>Iacoh</hi> was preferred before
<hi>Esaw, Iudah</hi> before all the elder sons of <hi>Iacob. Ephraim</hi>
before <hi>Manasseh, Solomon</hi> before <hi>Adonijah.</hi> Hence if this
Gentleman now regnant, have no better pretences than
these now confuted, we cannot recognosce his right to
reign: yea though this last were valid, yet he cannot plead
it, it being expressly provided in our Laws against the
succession of a Papist. But there is one Grand <hi>Objection</hi>
against all this. The Jewes and other Nations are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to bring their necks under the yoke of the King of
<hi>Babilon</hi> and to serve him, and yet he had no other right to
these Kingdom, then the Lords Providential disposal,
because the Lord had <hi>given all these Lands into his hand,
Ier. 27. 6, 7, 12. Ans.</hi> 1. He was indeed an unjust Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and had no right but the Lord providential gif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; which
sometimes makes the tabernacles of Robbers prosper into
whose hand God bringeth abundantly <hi>Iob.</hi> 12. 6. and gives
<hi>Iacoh</hi> sometimes for a spoil and <hi>Israel</hi> to the Robbers <hi>Isai.</hi>
42. 24. and <hi>giveth power to the Beast</hi> to continue forty &amp; two
Moneths, and to have power over all kindreds &amp; tongues
&amp; Nations <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 5, 7. His Tyranny also was very great
<hi>extensively,</hi> in respect of his oppressions &amp; usurpations by
Conquest: but it was not so great <hi>intensively,</hi> as our Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
&amp; Spoilers may be charged with; he was never such a
Perverter of all the ends of Government, nor a treachrous
overturner of all Conditions, he was never a Persecuter
of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion, he never oppressed them upon
that account, nor endeavoured its extirpation, he never
enacted such mischiefs by Law. The Lord only made use
of him to bring about the holy ends of the Glory of His
Justice &amp; Wisdom, in which respect alone he is called
His <hi>Servant,</hi> as else where His <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:41139:198"/>
him a <hi>charge</hi> against an Hypocritical Nation to trample
them doun in His holy Providence, and accordingly there
was no resistence could prevail, they must be trampled
upon, no help for it; but no subjection was required,
acknowledging his Magistratical right by divine <hi>Ordinance,</hi>
but only a submissive stooping to the holy disposal of divine
<hi>Providence;</hi> no ouning was exacted either of the equity of
that power, or of fealtie to the administrator. 2. This
behoved to be a particular Command, by Positive Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given at that time, not binding to others in the like
Condition; which I refer to the judgment of the objectors:
put the case, and make it run paralel, If the King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
were in league with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and breaking
that league should provoke that aspiring Prince, growing
potent by many Conquests, to discover his designs, make
preparations, and give out threatenings for the Conquest
of <hi>England</hi> &amp; all <hi>Brittain;</hi> were the people of <hi>England</hi>
bound to surrender themselves as Servants &amp; tributaries to
him, for 70 years or for ever, under pain of destruction,
if they should not? This were one of the most ridiculous
inferences, that ever was pleaded: nay it would make
all refusal of subjection to invaders unlawful. 3. I will
draw an Argument from this to confirm my Plea: for these
Commands of subjection to <hi>Babilon,</hi> were not delivered
until after the King of <hi>Iudah</hi> had surrendered to <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
and entered into Covenant with him to be subject
to him 2. <hi>King.</hi> 24. chap. in keeping which Covenant the
Kingdom might have stood, and after he had Rebelled
against him and broken that Covenant, when <hi>lo he had given
his hand;</hi> after which he could not prosper, or escape, or
be delivered, <hi>Ezek. 17. 14, 15, 18, 2 Chron.</hi> 36. 13. Then
the Commandment came, that they should disoune their
<hi>oune King Zedekiah,</hi> now forefeiting his right by breach of
Covenant, and be subject to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> Whence I
argue, If people are commanded to disoune their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breaking
Rulers, and subject themselves to Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours;
then I have all I plead for: But the former is true,
by the truth of this objection: Ergo also the Latter. There
is a 2 <hi>Obj.</hi> from <hi>Rom. 13. 1. let every soul be subject to the higher
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:41139:199"/>
powers, the powers that be are ordained of God:</hi> yet the <hi>Roman</hi>
Emperour, to which they were to be subject, was an
usurper. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It cannot be proven that the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
here the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour as the higher power:
There were at this time several Competitions for the
Empire, about which Christians might have their oun
scruples whom to oune; the Apostle does not determine
their litigations, nor interest himself in parties, but gives
the General Standart of Gods Ordinance they had to go by.
And the best Expositors of the place do alle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge, the
question &amp; doubt of Christians then, was not so much in
whom the Supremacy was? as whether Christians were
at all bound to obey Civil power, especially Pagan? which
the Apostle resolves, in giving general directions to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
to obey the ordinance of Magistracy, conforme
to its original, and as it respects the end for which he had
&amp; would set it up, but no respect is there had to Tyrants.
2. It cannot be proven that the Supreme power then in
being was usurpative: there being then a Supreme <hi>Senate,</hi>
which was a Lawful power; nor that <hi>Nero</hi> was then an
usurper, who came in by choise &amp; consent, and with
the good liking of the people. 3. The Text means of
Lawful <hi>powers,</hi> not unlawful <hi>force,</hi> that are ordained of
God by His <hi>Preceptive</hi> will not meerly by His <hi>Providential</hi>
disposal, and of consciencious subjection to Magistracy,
not to Tyranny, describing &amp; characterizing the powers
there, by such qualifications as Tyrants &amp; Usurpers are
not capable of. But I mind to improve this Text more fully
hereafter, to prove the quite contrary to what is here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <p>8. From the <hi>Right</hi> of Magistracy, flowes the Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<hi>Relation;</hi> which is necessary to have a bottom, before
we can build the relative duties thereof. This brings it
under the <hi>fifth Commandment,</hi> which is the Rule of all rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
duties between Inferiours &amp; Superiours, requiring ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be given to Fathers, Masters, Husbands &amp;c. and
to rightful Magistrates, who are under such political rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as do infer the same duties; and prohibiting not only
the omission of these duties, but also the committing of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:41139:199"/>
contrary sins; which may be done, not only by <hi>contrary acts,</hi>
as dishonouring &amp; rebelling against Fathers, Magistrats &amp;c.
but also by performing them to <hi>contrary objects,</hi> as by giving
the Fathers due to the Fathers opposite, and the Magistrats
due to Tyrants who are their opposites. Certainly this
Command prescribing honour, doth regulate to whom it
should be given; And must be understood in a consistency
with that duty, and Character of one that hath a mind to
be an inhabitant of the Lords <hi>holy Hill Psal. 15. 4. in whose
eyes a vile person is contemned but he honoureth them that fear the
Lord.</hi> So that we sin against the <hi>fifth</hi> Command, when we
honour them that we are obliged to contemn by <hi>another</hi>
Command. Hence I argue, If ouning or honouring of
Tyrants be a breach of the fifth Command; then we cannot
oune their Authority: But the former is true: Ergo the
latter. I prove the Assumption. A honouring the vile to
whom no honour is due, and who stand under no relation
of Fathers as Fathers, is a breach of the fifth Command:
But the ouning of Tyrants Authority is a honouring the
vile to whom no honour is due, and who stand under no
relation of Fathers, and is yet a honouring them as Fathers:
<hi>Ergo</hi> the ouning of Tyrants Authority is a breach of the
fifth Command. The <hi>Major</hi> is clear: for if the honouring
of these to whom no honour is due, were not a breach of
the fifth Command; that precept conld neither be kept at
all, nor broken at all. It could not be kept at all: for, either
it must oblige us to honour all indefinitely, as Fathers, and
other relations, which cannot be: or else it must leave us
still in suspence &amp; ignorance, who shall be the object of
our honour; and then it can never be kept: or finally it
must astrict our honouring to such definite relations, to
whom it is due; &amp; then our transgression of that restriction,
shall be a breach of it. Next if it were not so, it could not
be broken at all: for if prostituting &amp; abusing honour be not
a sin, we cannot sin in the matter of honour at all; for if
the abuse of honour be not a sin, then dishonour also is not
a sin, for that is but an abuse of the duty, which is a sin as
well as the omission of it. And what should make the
taking away of honour from the proper object to be sin,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:41139:200"/>
and the giving it to a wrong object to be no sin? Moreover
if this Command do not restrict honour to the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
we shall never know who is the object: how shall
we know who is our Father, or what we owe to him, if
we may give another his due? The <hi>Minor</hi> also is manifest:
for if Tyrants be <hi>vile,</hi> then no honour is due to them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 4. And yet it is a honouring them
as <hi>Fathers</hi> if they be ouned as Magistrats; for Magistrats are
in a politick sense <hi>Fathers:</hi> But certain it is that Tyrants are
vile, as the Epithets &amp; Characters they get in Scripture
prove. But because, in contradiction to this, it may be
said; though Fathers be never so wicked, yet they are to
be honoured because they are still Fathers, And though
Masters be never so vile and froward, yet they are to be
subjected unto 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18-20. and so of other relations,
to whom honour is due by this Command, therefore
though Tyrants be never so vile they are to be ouned under
these relations, because they are the higher Powers in place
of Eminency, to whom the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> commands to
yeeld subjection <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and <hi>Peter</hi> to give <hi>submission</hi> &amp; <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
1 Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 17. Therefore it must be considered, that
as the <hi>relative</hi> duty of honouring the relations to whom it is
due, must not interfere with the <hi>moral</hi> duty of contemning
the vile, who are not under these relations; So this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Moral of contemning the vile, must not ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sate the
obligation of relative duties, but must be understood with
a Consistency therewith, without any prejudice to the duty
it self. We must contemn all the <hi>vile</hi> that are not under a
relation to be <hi>honoured,</hi> and these also that are in that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>in so far as</hi> they are <hi>vile.</hi> But now Tyrants do not come
under these Relations at all that are to be honoured by this
Command. As for the higher Powers that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. they are not those which are higher in <hi>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce,</hi> but
higher in <hi>Power,</hi> not <hi>in potentia</hi> but <hi>in potestate,</hi> not in a
Celsitude of prevalency but in a precellency of dignity, not
in the pomp &amp; pride of their prosperity &amp; possession of the
place, but by the virtue &amp; value of their office, being ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of God not to be resisted, the Ministers of God for good,
terrors to evil doers, to whom honour is due, those are
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:41139:200"/>
not Tyrants but Magistrats. Hence it is a word of the same
root which is rendered <hi>Authority,</hi> or an <hi>Authorized Power
1 Tim.</hi> 2. 2. And from the same word also comes that <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi>
to whom <hi>Peter</hi> commands subjection &amp; honour 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 13. Now these he speaks of have the Legal Constitution
of the people, being the <hi>ordinance of man</hi> to be subjected to
<hi>for the Lords sake.</hi> and who sends other inferior Magistrats
for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them
that do well, who are to be honoured as Kings or Lawful
Magistrats: this cannot be said of Tyrants. But more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
to evince that Tyrants &amp; Usurpers are not to be
honoured according to this Command, and that it is a
breach of it so to do; let us go through all these Relations
of Superiority that come under the obligation of this
Command, and we shall find Tyrants &amp; Usurpers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
out of all. <hi>First,</hi> they cannot come under the
<hi>Parental</hi> relation: We are indeed to esteem Kings as
Fathers, though not properly but by way of some
Analogy, because it is their office to care for the
people, and to be their Counsellers, and to defend
them, as Fathers do for Children: but <hi>Roaring Lyons</hi>
&amp; <hi>Ranging Bears,</hi> as wicked Rulers are, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 15.
cannot be Fathers. But Kings cannot <hi>properly</hi> be ouned
under this Relation, far less Tyrants (with whom the
Analogy of Fathers cannot consist) there being so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
notable disparities betwixt Kings &amp; Fathers. 1. A Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may be a Father to one Child; but a King cannot be a
King or Politick Father to one only, but his Correlate
must be a Community; a Tyrant can be a Father to none
at all in a Politick sense. 2. A Father is a Father by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to all coming out of his loyns; a King not so, he
doth not beget them, nor doth their relation flow from
that; a Tyrant is a destroyer not a Procreator of people. 3.
A Father is the cause of the Natural being of his Children;
A King only of the Politick well being of his subjects; but
Tyrants are he cause of the ill being of both. 4. A Father
once a Father, as long as his Children live, retains still
the relation, thô he turn mad and never so wicked; A King
turning mad may be served as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was, at least
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:41139:201"/>
all will grant in some cases the subjects may shake off th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
King; and if in any case, it is when he turns Tyrant. 5.
A Fathers relation never ceases, whither soeuer his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
go; but subjects may change their relation to a King,
by coming under another King in another Kingdom; a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
will force all lovers of freedom to leave the Kingdom
where he Domineers. 6. A Fathers relation never changes,
he can neither change his children nor they change their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but a King may naturalize new subjects, and subjects
may also change their Soveraign, Royalists will grant a
State or Common-wealth way make a King, and there is
great reason sometimes that a Monarchy be turned into a
Common-wealth; but a Tyrant changes those that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, expells the natives, brings in forreigners, and
all good Patriots do pant for a Change of him every day.
7. A Father hath no power of life &amp; death over his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
a King hath it over his subjects according to Law; a
Tyrant Usurps it over the innocent against Law. 8. A
Father is not a Father by consent of his Childeren; as a
King is by consent of his subjects; a Tyrant is neither a
Father with it nor without it. 9. A Father is not made by
the Children; as a King is by his subjects as was shewed; a
Tyrant is neither a Natural, nor by compact, but a self
created power. 10. A Father is not chosen conditionally
upon compact, as a King is by the free suffrages of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity;
A Tyrant in this Differs from a King that he is not
chosen, and in Tyranny from a Father. 11. Children
wanting a Father cannot choose whom they will to be
their Father; as subjects wanting a King may choose whom
they will, and what form they please; but though they
can, yet if they be rational, they will never choose a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
nor a Tyrannical form of Government. 12. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
cannot restrict their Fathers power to what degrees
they please; as subjects may limit their Kings, at their first
erection; but a Tyrant though he ought yet he will not be
limited, and if he might he should be restrained. 13.
Children cannot set bounds how long they will have their
Fathers to continue; Subjects may condescend upon the
time, in making Laws how long such an one shall be their
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:41139:201"/>
Soveraign, ad <hi>vitam</hi> or ad <hi>culpam,</hi> according as the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Law is made at first; Tyrants ought every day to
be repressed, that they should not continue at all. Yet
giving and not granting, that a King were to be ouned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the relation of a Father; though every man be bound
to oune &amp; mantain his Fathers parental Authority, yet let
the case be put, that the Father turns a Robber, murderer,
an avowed enemy to God and the country, is his person &amp;
Authority in that case to be ouned, to the dishonour of
God, and hurt &amp; hazard of the country? or ought he not
rather to be delivered up even by the Son to Justice? Much
more then will it follow, that a King who turns the more
dangerous because the more powerfull Robber, &amp; Legal
Murderer, and enemy to God &amp; the country, cannot be
ouned; seeing the relation betwixt Father &amp; Son is strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
&amp; stricter, as having another Original, than can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
King &amp; subjects, and stands unremoved as long as
he is Father, though turning such they ought to contribute
(in moral duty, to which their relative duty must cede)
that he should no more be a Father, nor no more a living
man, when dead by Law. Secondly, They cannot come
under the <hi>herile</hi> or <hi>Masterly</hi> relation, though Analogically
also sometimes they are stiled so, and subjects are called
<hi>Servants,</hi> by reason of their subjection, and because it is the
Office of Kings to command &amp; subjects to obey, in this
there is some Analogy. But Kings cannot properly be
ouned under this relation, as Masters over either persons
or goods of subjects, far less Tyrans, yea Kings assuming
a Masterly power turn Tyrants. Now that the Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
relation is not that of a <hi>Master,</hi> is clear from many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parities
&amp; absurdities, whether we consider the state of hired
Servants or Slaves. For <hi>hired Servants,</hi> the difference is
vast betwixt them &amp; subjects. 1. The hired Servant gets
reward for his service, by compact; the subjects none,
but rather gives the Royal reward of Tribute to the King
for his service; the Tyrant exacts it to maintain his Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
2. The hired Servant is maintained by his Master; the
subjects maintain the King; the Tyrant Robbes it from
them by force. 3. The hired Servant bargains only for a
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:41139:202"/>
time, and then may leave him; the subject cannot give up
his Covenanted allegiance, at that rate and for these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as the servant may his service; a Tyrant wil make nor
keep no such bargain. 4. The hired Servant must have
his Masters profit mainly before his eyes, and his oun only
secundarly; but the Magistrates power is primarly ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
to the publick good of the Community<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and only
consequentially to the good of himself. 5. The Master
hath a greater power over the hired Servant, to make &amp;
give out Lawes to him, which if they be Lawful he must
obey; than the King hath over the Nation, to which he is
not the sole Lawgiver, as is shewed. 6. The hired Serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
his subjection is Mercenary &amp; servile; but the subjects
subjection is civil, free, voluntary, liberal, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oving to
a Lawful King. Again for Slaves, the difference between
them &amp; subjects is great. 1. Slavery being against Nature,
rational people would never choose that life if they could
help it; but they gladly choose Government, &amp; Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.
2. Slavery would make their condition worse
then when they had no Government, for Liberty is alwise
preferable; Neither could people have acted rationally in
seting up Government, if to be free of oppression of others
they had given themselves up to slavery, under a Master
who may do what he pleases with them. 3. All Slaves
are either taken in war, or bought with money, or born
in the house where their parents were slaves, as <hi>Abraham</hi>
&amp; <hi>Solomon</hi> had of that sort; But subjects are neither captives,
nor bought, nor born slaves. 4. Slavery is not Natural,
but a penal fruit of sin, and would never have been if sin
had not been; But Government is not so, but Natural &amp;
necessary. 5. Slaves are not their Masters brethren; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are the Kings brethren; over whom he must not lift
up himself <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 20. 6. Masters might purchase and sell
their slaves, <hi>Abimelech</hi> took sheep &amp; men servants &amp; gave

in the case of necessity, the King may make use of all goods
in common, for the good of the Kingdom: For 1. The
introduction of Kings cannot overturn natures foundation;
by the Law of Nature property was given to man, Kings
cannot rescind that. 2. A man had goods ere ever there
was a King; a King was made only to preserve property,
therefore he cannot take it away. 3. It cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that rational people would choose a King at all, if
he had power to turn a greater Robber to preserve them
from lesser Robberies &amp; oppressions: would rational men
give up themselves for a prey to one, that they might be
safe from becoming a prey to others? 4. Then their case
should be worse by erecting of Government, if the Prince
were proprietor of their goods, for they had the property
themselves before. 5. Then Government should not be
a blessing but a curse, and the Magistrate could not be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
for good. 6. Kingdoms then should be among
<hi>bona fortunae,</hi> the goods of fortune, which the King might
sell &amp; dispone as he pleased. 7. His place then should not
be a function, but a possession. 8. People could not then,
by their removes or otherwise, change their Soveraigns.
9. Then no man might dispose of his oun goods without
the Kings consent, by buying or selling, or giving almes,
nay nor pay tribute, for they cannot do these things except
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:41139:203"/>
they have of their oun. 10. This is the very Character
of a Tyrant, as described 1 <hi>Sam. 8. 11. he will take your sons</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Zeph. 3. 3. her Princes are roaring Lyons, her Iudges are

giving and not granting that he were really a Master in all
these respects; Notwithstanding if he turn to pursue me
for my life, because of my fidelity to my Master &amp; his both,
&amp; will withdraw me from the service of the Supreme Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Master, I may Lawfully withdraw my self from
his, and disoune him for one, when I cannot serve two
Masters. Sure he cannot be Master of the <hi>conscience.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
They cannot come under the <hi>conjugal</hi> relation, though
there may be some proportion between that and subjection
to a Lawful Ruler, because of the Mutual Covenant trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
betwixt them; but the Tyrant &amp; Usurper cannot
pretend to this, who refuse all Covenants. Yet hence it
cannot be inferred, that because the wife may not put away
her husband. Or renounce him, as he may do her in the
case of Adultery, therefore the people cannot disoune the
King in the case of the violation of the Royal Covenant.
For the Kings power is not at all properly a <hi>husbands</hi> power.
1. The wife by nature is the weaker vessel; but the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is not weaker than the King. 2. The wife is given
as an help to the man; but here the man is given as an help
to the Common-wealth. 3. The wife cannot limit the
husbands power; as subjects may limit their Soveraigns.
4. The wife cannot prescribe the time of her continuing
under him; as subjects may do with their Soveraigns. 5.
The wife cannot change her husband; as a Kingdom can
do their Government 6. The husband hath not power
of life &amp; death; but the Soveraign hath it over Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors.
Yet giving and not granting, his power were
properly Marital; if the case be put, that the man do habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
break the Marriage Covenant, or take another wife,
and turn also Cruel &amp; intollerable in compelling his oun
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:41139:203"/>
wife to wickedness; and put the case also, that she should
not get a Legal divorce procured, who can doubt but she
might disoune him, and leave him? for this case is excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of that Command 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 10. let not the wife depart
from her husband,</hi> meaning for mere difference in Religion,
or other lesser causes; but Adulterie doth annual the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
relation, See <hi>Pool Synopsis Critic. in Locum.</hi> So when
a Prince breaks the Royal Covenant and turns Tyrant, or
without any Covenant committs a rape upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
that pretended relation may &amp; must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouned.
Hence we see, there is no relation can bring a
King or Ruler under the object of the duty of the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
except it be that of a <hi>fiduciary Patron</hi> or <hi>Trustee</hi> and
<hi>Publick Servant:</hi> for we cannot oune him properly either
to be a Father, or a Master, or a husband. Therefore
what can remain, but that he must be a fiduciary Servant?
Wherefore if he shall either treacherously break his trust,
or presumptously refuse to be entrusted, upon terms &amp;
conditions to secure &amp; be accountable for (before God &amp;
man) Religion &amp; Liberty, we cannot oune his usurped
Authority. That Metaphore which the learned <hi>Buchanan</hi>
uses, <hi>de Iure Regni,</hi> of a Publick &amp; Politick <hi>Phisician,</hi> is
not a relation different from this of a fiduciary Servant;
when he elegantly represents him as entrusted with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
&amp; restauration of the health of the politick body,
and endued with shill &amp; experience of the Laws of his
Craft. If then he be orderly called unto this charge, and
qualified for it, and discharges his duty faithfully, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
and we are obliged to give him the deference of an
honoured Physician: But if he abuse his Calling and not
observe the rules thereof, and in stead of curing go about
wilfully to kill the body he is entrusted with, he is no more
to be ouned for a Physician but for a Murderer.</p>
               <p>9. If we inquire further into the nature of this Relation
between a King (whose Authority is to be ouned) and
his subjects; we can oune it only as it is <hi>Reciprocal</hi> in respect
of Superiority &amp; Inferiority, that is, whereby in some
respects the King is Superior to the people, and in some
respects the people is Superior to him. The King is Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:41139:204"/>
&amp; <hi>Supreme</hi> as he is called 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. in respect of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Soveraignty, and executive Authority, and Majestick
Royal dignity, resulting from the peoples devolving upon
him that Power, and constituting him in that relation over
themselves, whereby he is higher in place &amp; power than
they, and in respect of his Charge &amp; conduct is <hi>worth ten
thousands of the people 2 Sam.</hi> 18. 3. and there is no formally
regal Tribunal higher than his; And though he be <hi>Minor
universis</hi> yet he is <hi>Major singulis,</hi> greater than any one, or
all the people distributively taken; And though he be a
Royal Vassal of the Kingdom, &amp; Princely Servant of the
people; yet he is not their <hi>deputy,</hi> because he is really their
Soveraign, to whom they have made over their Power
of governing &amp; protecting themselves irrevocably, except
in the case of Tyranny; and in acts of Justice, he is not
countable to any, and does not depend on the people as a
deputy. But on the other hand, the people is superior to
the King, in respect of their fountain power of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that remains radically &amp; virtually in them, in that they
make him their Royal Servant, and him rather than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and limit him to the Laws for their oun good &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and though they give to him a Politick Power
for their oun safety; yet they keep a Natural Power which
they cannot give away, but must resume it in case of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;
And though they cannot retract the power of Justice
to govern righteously, yet it is not so irrevocably given
away to him, but that when he abuseth his power to the
destruction of his subjects, they may wrest a sword out of
a mad mans hand, though it be his oun sword and he hath a
just power to use it for good, but all fiduciary power abused
may be repealed. They have not indeed Soveraignity or
power of life &amp; death <hi>formally;</hi> yet in respect they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
a Magistrate with Laws, which if they violate they
must be in hazard of their lives, they have this power <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently</hi>
&amp; <hi>virtually.</hi> Hence in respect that the Kings Power is
and can be only <hi>fiducial,</hi> by way of trust reposed upon him,
he is not so superior to the people, but he may &amp; ought to
be <hi>accountable</hi> to them in case of Tyranny; which is evident
from what is said, and now I intend to make it further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:41139:204"/>
But first I form the Argument thus; We can oune no
King that is not accountable to the people: <hi>Ergo</hi> we cannot
oune this King. To clear the Connexion of the antecedent
&amp; consequent, I adde; Either he is accountable to the people,
or he is not: If he be accountible to all then he is renounci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by a part, when the Collective body either wil not, or
cannot exact an account from him, when the Community
is defective as to their part, it is the interest of a part, that
would but cannot do their duty, to give no account to such
as they can get no account from for his Maleversations,
This is all we crave: If he be not accountable, then we
cannot oune him, because all Kings are accountable: for
these reasons. 1. The Inferior is accountable to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior:
the King is inferior, the people superior: <hi>Ergo</hi>
the King is accountable to the people. The proposition is
plain; if the Kings superiority make the people accountable
to him, in case of transgressing the Laws; then, why
should not the peoples superiority make the King account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to them, in case of transgressing the Laws? especially
seeing the King is inferior to the Laws: because the Law
restrains him, and from the Law he hath that whereby he
is King; the Law is inferior to the people, because they
are as it were its parent, and way make or unmake it upon
occasion: and seeing the Law is more powerful than the
King, and the people more powerful than the Law, we
may see before which we may call the King to answer in
Judgment, <hi>Buchan Iure Regni apud Scot.</hi> That the King
is inferior to the people is clear on many accounts: for
these things which are institute for others sake, are inferior
to those for whose sake they are required or sought; a horse
is inferior to them that use him for victory; A King is only
a mean for the peoples good; A Captain is less then the
Army, a King is but a Captain over the Lords Inheritance
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 1. He is but the Minister of God for their good
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. Those who are before the King, and may be a
people without him, must be superior to him who is a
posteriour and cannot be a King without them: let the
King be considered either Materially as a Mortal man, he
is then but a part inferior to the whole; or formally under
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:41139:205"/>
the reduplication as a King, he is no more but a Royal
Servant, obliged to spend his life for the people, to save
them out of the hand of their enemies 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. A
part is inferior to the whole, the King is but a part of the
Kingdom: A Gift is inferior to them to whom it is given,
a King is but a gift given of God for the peoples good: That
which is Mortal &amp; but accidental, is inferior to that which
is eternal &amp; cannot perish Politically; a King is but mortal,
and it is but accidental to Government that there be a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Kings; but the people is eternal, <hi>one generation
passeth away &amp; another generation cometh Eccles.</hi> 1. 4. especially
the people of God, the portion of the Lords inheritance,
is superior to any King, and their ruine of greater moment
than all the Kings of the world; for if the Lord for their
sake <hi>smite great Kings,</hi> &amp; slay famous Kings, as <hi>Sihon</hi> &amp; <hi>Og
Psal.</hi> 137. 17-20. if he <hi>give</hi> kings &amp; famous kingdoms for
their <hi>ransome Isai.</hi> 43. 3, 4. then His people must be so much
superior than kings, by how much His Justice is active to
destroy the one, and His Mercy to save the other. All
this proves the people to be superior in dignity, And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
even in that respect its frivolous to say, the king can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be accountable to them, because so much superior in
Glory &amp; Pomp; for they are superior every way in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency;
And though it were not so, yet Judges may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
in rank considered as men, but they are superior in
Law over the greatest as they are Judges, to whom far
greater than they are accountable. The low &amp; mean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them to whom belongs the power of Judgment
does not diminish its dignity: when the king then is
Judged by the people, the Judgment is of as great dignity
as if it were done by a superior king; for the Judgment is
the sentence of the Law, 2. They are superior in <hi>power:</hi>
because every constituent cause is superior to the effect,
the people is the constituent cause, the king is the effect,
and hath all his Royaltie from them, by the Conveyance
God hath appointed; so that they need not fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch it from
Heaven, God gives it by the people, by whom also his
power is limited and, it need be, diminished from what
they gave his Ancestors: Hence, if the people constitute
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:41139:205"/>
&amp; limit the power they give the King, then they may call
him to an account, and judge him for the abuse of it: But
the first is true as is proven above: <hi>Ergo</hi>—The <hi>Major</hi> is
undenyable, for sure, they may judge their oun Creature,
and call him to an account for the power they gave him,
when he abuses it, though there be no Tribunal formally
Regal above him, yet in the case of Tyranny and violating
his Trust there is a Tribunal virtual eminently above him,
in them that made him &amp; reposed that Trust upon him, as
is said. 3. The fountain power is superior to the power
derived: The people, though they constitute a King above
them, yet retain the fountain power, he only hath the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
power: Certainly the people must retain more power
eminently, than they could give to the King, for they
gave it, and he receives it, with limitations, if he turn
mad or uncapable they may put Curators &amp; Tutors over
him; if he be taken captive, they may appoint another to
exercise the power, if he die then they may constitute ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with more or less power; So then if they give a way
all their power, as a slave selleth his Liberty, and retain
no fountain power or radical right, they could not make
use of it to produce any of these acts: They set a King above
them only with an executive power for their good, but
the radical power remains in the people, as in an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
spring, which they communicate by succession to this
or that Mortal man, in the manner &amp; measure they think
expedient; for otherwise if they gave all their power away,
what shall they reserve to make a new King, if this man
die? What if the Royal line surcease, there be no Prophets
now sent to make Kings: And if they have power in these
cases, why not in the case of Tyranny? 4. If the King be
accountable by Law, for any act of Tyranny done against
one man, then much more is he accountable for many
against the whole state: But the former is true; a private
man may go to Law before the ordinary Judges for wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his inheritance, and the King is made accountable for the
wrong done by him. Now shall the Laws be like <hi>Spiders
webs,</hi> which hold flies, but let bigger beasts pass through?
Shall Sentence be past for petty wrongs against a man, and
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:41139:206"/>
none for Tyrannizing over Religion, Laws, &amp; Liberties
of the Kingdom? Shall none be past against parricide or
fratricide, for killing his Brother, Murdering the Nobles,
and burning Cities? Shall pettie Thieves be hanged for
stealing a Sheep, and does the Laws of God or man give
impunity, for robbing a whole Country of the nearest &amp;
dearest Interests they have to Crowned heads for the fancied
Character of Royalty, which thereby is forfeited? 5. If
there be Judges appointed of God independently, to give
out &amp; execute the Judgment of the Lord on all offenders,
without exception of the highest; then the King also must
be subject to that Judgment: But there are Judges appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of God independently, to give out &amp; execute the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord on all offenders, without exception of
the highest. Two things must be here proved; first, that
in giving Judgment they do not depend on the King, but
are the immediate vicars of God: Secondly that the King
is not excepted from, but subject to, their Judgment, in
case he be Criminal. First they cannot depend upon the
King, because they are more necessary then the King; and
it is not left to the Kings pleasure whether there be Judges
or not. There may be Judges without a King, but there
can be no King without Judges, nor no Justice but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion;
no man can bear the peoples burden alone <hi>Numb.</hi>
11. 14, 17, If they depended on the King, their Power
would die with the King; the streams must dry up with the
fountain: but that cannot be, for they are not <hi>Ministri regis</hi>
but <hi>regni,</hi> they are not Ministers of the King but of the
Kingdom, whose honour &amp; promotion, though by the
Kings external call, yet comes from God, as all honour
&amp; promotion does <hi>Psal.</hi> 75. 7, The King cannot make
Judges whom he will by his absolute Power, he must be
tied to that Law <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13. To take <hi>wise men</hi> &amp; <hi>understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>

for if these qualifications remain, there is no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

as well as he, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 3, 6. They are ordained of God for

be subject for Conscience sake, as being the Ministers
of God for good; they must be obeyed for the Lords sake,
as well as the King; though they are sent of him, yet they
Judge not <hi>for man</hi> but <hi>for the Lord 2 Chron.</hi> 19. 6. hence they
sit in his room, and are to act as if he were on the bench:
the King cannot say, the Judgment is mine, because it is
the Lords: neither can he limit their sentance (as he might,
if they were nothing but his deputies) because the Judgment
is not his: nor are their Consciences subordinate to him,
but to the Lord immediatly; otherwise if they were his
deputies, depending on him; then they could neither be
admonished, nor condemned for unjust Judgment,
because their sentence should neither be righteous nor
unrighteous, but as the King makes it; And all directions
to them were capable of this exception, do not so or so
<hi>except the King command yow,</hi> crush not the poor, oppress
not the fatherless, <hi>except the King command yow:</hi> yea then
they could not execute any Judgment, but with the Kings
Licence, and so could not be rebuked for their not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Judgment. Now all this is contrary to Scripture,
which makes the sentence of the Judges undeclinable
when just <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 11. the Lords indignation is kindled,
when He looks for <hi>Iudgment</hi> &amp; behold <hi>oppression,</hi> for <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>
&amp; behold a <hi>Cry Isai.</hi> 5. 7. neither will it excuse the
Judges to say, the king would have it so; for even they
that are subservient, to <hi>write grievousness,</hi> to <hi>turn aside the
needy from Iudgment</hi> &amp;c. are under the <hi>wo, as</hi> well as they
that <hi>prescribe</hi> it <hi>Isai.</hi> 10. 1, 2. The Lord is displeased when
<hi>Iudgment is turned away back ward,</hi> and Justice stands a far

Cause of it <hi>Isai.</hi> 59. 14, 15. The Lord threatens He will

<hi>execute Iudgment Ier.</hi> 5. 1, 9. And promises if they will
execute Judgment &amp; righteousness, and deliver the spoiled

send desolation <hi>ibid.</hi> He rebukes those that turn Judgment
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:41139:207"/>
to wormwood and leave of righteousness in the earth
<hi>Amos.</hi> 5. 7. He resents it when the Law is slacked and
Judgment doth not go forth freely without overawing or
overruling restraint <hi>Habb.</hi> 1. 4. Can these Scriptures consist
with the Judges dependence on the kings pleasure, in the
exercise &amp; execution of their Power? Therefore if they
would avoid the Lords displeasure, they are to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though the King should countermand it. Secondly,
that the King is not excepted from their Judgment, is also
evident from the General Commands <hi>Gen. 9. 6. whoso
sheddeth mans blood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<hi>whoso killeth any person the murderer shall be put to death, by the
mouth of witnesses—ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a
Murderer which is guilty of death, but he shall be surely put to
death.</hi> What should hinder then Justice to be awarded upon
a Murdering King? Shall it be for want of witnesses? It
will be easy to adduce thousands: Or shall this be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for his life, that he is a Crowned King? the Law
saith there shall no satisfaction be taken. The Lord speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to under Judges <hi>Levit. 19. 15. Ye shall do no unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

Mighty, how shall they be classed? <hi>Deut. 1. 17. Ye shall
not respect persons in judgment, but yow shall hear the small as well
as the great, yow shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the
judgment is Gods:</hi> if then no mans face can outdare the Law
&amp; Judgment of God, then the Kings Majestick face must
not do it, but as to the demerit of blood he must be subject
as well as another. Its no Argument to say, the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi>
did not punish <hi>David</hi> for his Murther &amp; Adulterie. <hi>Ergo</hi>
now it is not Lawful to punish a King for the same: a reason
<hi>a non facto</hi> is not relevant. <hi>David</hi> did not punish <hi>Ioab</hi> for his
Murder, but Authorized it, as also he did <hi>Bathsheba's</hi> Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie;
will that prove that Murders connived at, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the King, shall not be punished? or that Whores
of State are not to be called to an account? Neither will it
prove that a Murdering king should not be punished, that
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:41139:207"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> was not punished: because he got both the sin par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
and his life granted from the Lord, saying to him,
by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Nathan, Thow shalt not die:</hi>
But as for the demerit of that fact, he himself pronounced
the sentence out of his oun mouth 2 <hi>Sam. 12. 15. As the
Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die.</hi> 
                  <q>So
every king condemned by the Law, is condemned by
his oun mouth; for the Law is the voice of the king:
why then do we so much weary our selves concerning a
Judge? seeing we have the kings oun Confession, that is
the Law. <bibl>
                        <hi>Buchanan. de jure regni.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                  </q> And there needs be no
other difficultie, to find a Tribunal for a Murdering king,
than to find one for a Murderer; for a Judgment must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
but one name, to wit of the Crime; if a king
then be guilty of Murder, he hath no more the name of a
king but of a Murderer, when brought to Judgment; for
he is not Judged for his kingship, but for his Murther; as
when a Gentleman is Judged for Robbery, he is not hanged,
neither is he spared, because he is a Gentleman, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is a Robber. See <hi>Buchanan. ubi supra.</hi> 6. If the
Peoples Representatives be superior to the king in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and may execute Judgment without him, and
against his will, then they may also seek account of him,
for if he hath no Power but from them, and no Power
without them to act as king (no more than the eye or hand
hath Power to act without the body) then his Power must
be inferior, fiduciary, &amp; accountable to them: But the
former is true, The Peoples Representatives are superior
to the king in Judgment, and may execute Judgment
without him, and against his will. In Scripture we find
the Power of the <hi>Elders</hi> and heads of the People was very
great, and in many cases superior to the king: which the
Learned <hi>Dr Owen</hi> demonstrates in his Preliminary <hi>Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
on the Epist. to the Heb.</hi> and proves out of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>
that the kings of the <hi>Iewes</hi> might have been called to an
account, &amp; punished for transgressing of the Law. But in
the Scripture we find. (1) They had a Power of Judgment
with the Supreme Magistrate, in matters of Religion,
Justice &amp; Government. <hi>Hamor</hi> &amp; <hi>Shechem</hi> would not make
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:41139:208"/>
a Covenant with <hi>Iacobs</hi> Sons, without the consent of the
men of the Citie <hi>Gen. 34. 20. David</hi> behoved to consult
with the Captains of thousands, &amp; every Leader, if it
seemed good to them to bring again the Ark of God.
1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. So also <hi>Solomon</hi> could not do it without
them 1 <hi>King. 8. 1. Ahab</hi> could not make peace with <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad</hi>
against the consent of the People 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 8. The
men of <hi>Ephraim</hi> complain that <hi>Iephthah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
had gone to War against the Children of <hi>Ammon</hi>
without them, and threatened to burn his house with fire,
which he only excuses by the Law of necessity <hi>Iudg.</hi> 12.
1, 2, 3. The <hi>Seventy Elders</hi> are appointed by God, not to
be the Advisers only &amp; helpers of <hi>Moses,</hi> but to bear a part
of the burden of ruling &amp; governing the People, that <hi>Moses</hi>
might be eased <hi>Numb. 11. 14, 17. Moses</hi> upon his sole plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
had not power to restrain them, in the exercise of
Judgment given of God. They were not the Magistrats
depending deputies, but in the act of Judging they were
independent, and their Consciences as immediatly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to God as the Superior Magistrate, who was to
adde his approbative suffrage to their actings, but not
his directive nor imperative suffrage of absolute pleasure,
but only according to the Law; he might command them
to do their duty, but he could do nothing without them.
(2) They had Power, not derived from the Prince at all,
even a Power of <hi>life &amp; death.</hi> The rebellious Son was to be
brought to the Elders of the Citie, who had Power to stone
him <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 18, 24. They had Power to punish Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
with death <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 21. They had Power to cognosce,
whom to admit into and whom to seclude from the Cities
of refuge: So that if the King had commanded to take the
life of an innocent man, they were not to deliver him
<hi>Iosh. 20. per tot.</hi> But besides the Elders of Cities, there
were the Elders and heads of the People, who had judicial
Power to cognosce on all Criminal Matters, even when
<hi>Ioshua</hi> was Judge in <hi>Israel</hi> we find they assumed this Power,
to judge of that matter of the two tribes &amp; the half <hi>Iosh.</hi> 22.
30. And they had Power to make Kings, as <hi>Saul</hi> &amp; <hi>David,</hi>
as was shewed: and it must needs follow, they had Power
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:41139:208"/>
to unmake them in case of Tyranny. (3) They had Power
to conveen, even without the indiction of the Ruler, as
in that <hi>Iosh.</hi> 22. they convene without him: and without
advice or knowledge of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Ruler, they conveen
to <hi>ask a King 1 Sam.</hi> 8. And without any head or superior,
they convene &amp; make <hi>David</hi> King, notwithstanding of
<hi>Isbosheths</hi> hereditary right. Without &amp; against Tyrannous
<hi>Athaliah</hi> her consent, they convene &amp; make <hi>Ioash</hi> King,
and cared not for her <hi>Treason, Treason 2 King.</hi> 11. But now
the king alone challenges the Prerogative-power of calling
&amp; dessolving Parliaments as he pleases, and condemns all
meetings of Estates without his warrant, which is purely
Tyrannical: for in cases of necessity, by the very Law of
nature, they may &amp; must convene. The Power is given to
the king only by a positive Law, for orders sake; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
they have an intrinsical Power to assemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
All the forecited Commands, Admonitions, &amp;
Certifications, <hi>to execute Iudgement,</hi> must necessarly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
&amp; imply &amp; Power to convene, without which they
could not be in a Capacity for it: Not only unjust Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but <hi>no I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dgement,</hi> in a time when Truth is fallen in
the streets &amp; equity cannot enter, is charged as the sin of
the State; therefore they must convene to prevent this sin,
and the wrath of God for it: God hath committed the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Common-wealth, not to the king only, but also
to the peoples Representatives &amp; heads. And if the king
have Power to break up all Conventions of this nature,
then he hath Power to hinder Judgement to proceed, which
the Lord Commands: And this would be an excuse, when
God threatens vengeance for it, <hi>we could not execute Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because ehe King forbad us.</hi> Yet many of these foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
reproofs, threatenings, &amp; certifications were given,
in the time of Tyrannous &amp; Idolatrous kings, who no doubt
would inhibite &amp; discharge the doing of their duty; yet we
see, that was no excuse, but the Lord denounces wrath for
the omission. (4) They had Power to execute Judgement,
against the will of the Prince. <hi>Samuel</hi> killed <hi>Agag</hi> against
<hi>Sauls</hi> will, but according to the Command of God 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
15. 32. Against <hi>Ahabs</hi> will &amp; mind <hi>Elijah</hi> caused kill the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:41139:209"/>
Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> according to Gods express Law 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.
40. It is true it was extraordinary, but no otherwise than
it is this day, when there is no Magistrate that will execute
the Judgment of the Lord; then they who have Power to
make the Magistrate may &amp; ought to execute it, when
wicked men make the Law of God of none effect. So the
Princes of <hi>Iudah</hi> had power, against the kings will, to put
<hi>Ieremiah</hi> to death, which the king supposes, when he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
him what to say to them <hi>Ier.</hi> 38. 25. They had really
such a Power, though in <hi>Ieremiahs</hi> case it would have been
wickedly perverted, See <hi>Lex Rex Q.</hi> 19. 20. (5) They had
a power to execute Judgement upon the king himself: as in
the case of <hi>Amaziah</hi> &amp; <hi>Uzziah,</hi> as shall be cleared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
I conclude with repeating the Argument: If the
king be accountable, whensoever this Account shall be
taken, we are confident our disouning him for the present
will be justified, and all will be obliged to imitate it: If he
be not, then we cannot oune his Authority, that so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptously
exalts himself above the People.</p>
               <p>10. If we will further consider the nature of Magistracy;
it will appear what Authority can conscienciously be oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to wit, that which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Potestas,</hi> not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Potentia;</hi> Authorized Power, not Might or force; <hi>Moral</hi>
Power, not merely <hi>Natural.</hi> There is a great difference
betwixt these two: Natural Power is common to brutes,
Moral Power is peculiar to men; Narural Power is more
in the Subjects, because they have more strength &amp; force;
Moral Power is in the Magistrate, they can never meet
adequately in the same subject; Natural power <hi>can,</hi> Moral
only <hi>may</hi> warrantably exercise rule; Natural power is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to impotency &amp; weakness, Moral to illicitness or
unlawfulness; Natural power consists in strength, Moral
in righteousness; Natural power may be in a Reut of
Rogues making an uproar, Moral only in the Rulers;
they cannot be distinguished by their acts, but by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
from which the acts proceed; in the one from meer
force, in the other from Authority. The Principle of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
power is its oun might &amp; will, and the end only self;
Moral hath its rise from positive Constitution, and its end
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:41139:209"/>
publick safety. The strength of Natural power lies in the
<hi>Sword,</hi> whereby its might gives Law; the strength of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
power is in its <hi>Word,</hi> whereby reason gives Law, unto
which the Sword is added for punishment of Contraveners:
Natural power <hi>takes the Sword Math.</hi> 26. 52. Moral <hi>bears the
Sword Rom.</hi> 13. 4. In Natural power the Sword is the
Cause; in Moral it is only the Consequent of Authority:
In Natural power the Sword legitimates the Scepter; in
Moral the Scepter legitimates the Sword: The Sword of
the Natural is only backed with Metal, the Sword of the
Moral power is backed with Gods warrant: Natural
power involves men in passive subjection, as a traveller is
made to yeeld to a Robber; Moral power reduces to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious
subordination. Hence the power that is only
Natural not Moral, <hi>Potentia</hi> not <hi>Potestas,</hi> cannot be ouned:
But the power of Tyrants &amp; Usurpers is only Natural not
Moral, <hi>Potentia</hi> not <hi>Potestas: Ergo</hi> it cannot be ouned. The
<hi>Major</hi> cannot be denied; for it is only the Moral Power
that is ordained of God, unto which we must be subject
for Conscience sake. The <hi>Minor</hi> also; for the Power of
Tyrants is not Moral, because not Authorized nor war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
nor ordained of God by His preceptive Ordinance,
and therefore no Lawful Magistratical Power. For the
clearer understanding of this let it be observed, there are
four things required to the making of a Moral or Lawful
Power; the <hi>matter</hi> of it must be Lawful, the <hi>Person</hi> Lawful,
the <hi>Title</hi> Lawful, and the <hi>Use</hi> Lawful. 1. The <hi>matter</hi> of it,
about which it is exerted, or the work to be done by it,
must be Lawful &amp; warranted by God; and if it be unlawful,
it destroyes its Moral being. As the <hi>Popes</hi> power in dispens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Divine Laws, is null &amp; no Moral Power: And
so also the Kings power, in dispensing with both Divine
&amp; humane Laws is null. Hence, that power which is
in regard of matter unlawful, and never warranted by
God, cannot be ouned: But absolute power, which is the
power of Tyrants &amp; Usurpers (&amp; particularly of this of
ours) is in regard of matter unlawful &amp; never warranted by
God: <hi>Ergo</hi>—2. The <hi>Person</hi> holding the power must be such
as not only is capable of but competent to the tenure of it,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:41139:210"/>
and to whom the holding of it is allowed; and if it be prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
it evacuates the Morality of the power. <hi>Korah</hi> &amp; his
Company arrogated to themselves the Office of the <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
this power was prohibited to them, their power then
was a nullity. As therefore a person that should not be a
Minister, when he usurps that office is no Minister: So a
person that should not be a Magistrate, when he usurps
that Office, is no Magistrate. Hence, a person that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
&amp; incompetent for Government, cannot be ouned
for a Governour: But the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> is such a person, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not qualified as the Word of God requires a Magistrate
to be, but by the Laws of the Land declared incapable of
Rule because he is a <hi>Papist,</hi> a Murderer, an Adulterer &amp;c.
3. There must be in Moral Power, a Lawful <hi>Title</hi> &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesture,
as is shewed above; which if it be wanting, the
Power is null, and the person but a Scenical King, like <hi>Iohn.
of Leyden.</hi> This is essentially necessary to the being of a
Magistrate; which only properly distinguishes him from a
private man: for when a person becomes a Magistrate,
what is the change that is wrought in him? what new habit
or endewment is produced in him? he hath no more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
power than he had before, only now he hath the
Moral Power, right, &amp; Authority to Rule, Legally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering
him to Govern. Let it be Considered, what
makes a subordinate Magistrate, whom we may oune as
such: It must be only his Commission from a Superior
Power, otherwise we reject him: If one come to us of
his oun head, taking upon him the style &amp; office of a Bailif,
Sheriff, or Judge, and command our Persons, demand
our purses, or exact our Oaths; we think we may deny
him, not taking our selves to owe him any subjection,
not ouning any bond of conscience to him; why? because
he hath no lawful Commission. Now if we require this
qualification in the subordinate, why not in the Supreme?
Hence, that Magistrate that cannot produce his Legal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesture,
cannot be ouned: But the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
his Legal Investure, his admission to the Crown upon
Oath &amp; Compact, and with the consent of the subjects,
according to the Laws of the Land, as is shewed above:
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:41139:210"/>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi>—4. There must also be the Lawful <hi>Use</hi> of the
Power; which must be not only legal for its composure,
but right for its practice; its Course &amp; Process in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must be just, Governing according to Law, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it is meer Tyranny: for what is Government, but
the subjecting of the Community to the rule of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
for Peace &amp; Orders sake, and the security of all
their precious Interests? and for what end was it ordained,
and continued among men, but that the stronger may
not domineer over the weaker? And what is <hi>Anarchy,</hi>
but the playing the <hi>Rex</hi> of the Natural power over the
Moral? Hence, that Power which is contrary to Law,
evil &amp; Tyrannical, can tye none to subjection: But the
power of the King, abused to the destruction of Laws,
Religion &amp; Liberties, giving his power &amp; strength unto
the <hi>beast,</hi> &amp; making war with the <hi>Lamb Revel.</hi> 17. 13, 14.
is a power contrary to Law, evil &amp; Tyrannical: <hi>Ergo</hi> it
can tye none to subjection: wickedness by no imaginable
reason can oblige any man. It is <hi>Objected</hi> by some from
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. There is no power but of God: The Usurping
power is a power: Therefore it is of God, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
we owe subjection to it <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Original
reading is not Universal, but thus <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>for there is no power if not from God:</hi> which confirms
what I plead for, that we are not to oune any Authority,
if it be not Authorized by God. The words are only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
to <hi>higher powers,</hi> in a restricted sense, and at most are
but indefinite, to be determined according to the matter;
not <hi>all power</hi> simply, but all <hi>Lawful power.</hi> 2. It is a <hi>fallacia
a dicto secundum quid:</hi> There is no power but of God, that
is no Moral Power, as Universal negatives use to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
<hi>Heb. 5. 4. no man taketh this honour unto himself, but
he that is called of God;</hi> which is clear, must not be understood
for the negation of the fact, as if no man at all doth or ever
did take unto himself that honour, for <hi>Korah</hi> did it &amp;c. but,
no man taketh it <hi>warrantably,</hi> with a Moral right and Gods
allowance, without Gods call: So also the universal impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
in that same Text, must not be taken absolutely
without restriction; for if every soul without exception
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:41139:211"/>
were to be subject, there could be none left to be the higher
powers; but it is understood with restriction to the relation
of a subject. So here <hi>no Power but of God,</hi> to be understood
with restriction to the relation of a Lawful Magistrate. It
it also to be understood indiscriminately, in reference to
the diverse <hi>species,</hi> sorts, &amp; degrees of Lawful Power, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
&amp; subordinate, <hi>whether to the King as Supreme, or to
Governours</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Peter</hi> expresses it: Or whether they be
<hi>Christian</hi> or <hi>Pagan:</hi> It cannot be meant of all universally,
that may pretend to power, and may attain to prevailing
Potency; for then by this Text, we must subject our selves
to the <hi>Papacy</hi> now intended to be introduced; and indeed if
we subject our selves to this <hi>Papist,</hi> the next thing he will
require will be that. 3. To the Minor proposition, I
<hi>Answer.</hi> The usurping power is a power: It is <hi>Potentia,</hi> I
grant; that it is <hi>Potestas,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Authority, I deny.
Therefore it is <hi>of God,</hi> by His Providence, I concede; by
His <hi>Ordinance;</hi> I deny. Consequently we owe subjection
to it, I deny. We may be subject passively, I grant; Actively,
out of conscience I deny. But some will <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Though
the Power be Usurped, and so not Morally Lawful, in
all these respects; yet it may do <hi>good,</hi> its Laws &amp; administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be good. <hi>Ans.</hi> I grant, all is good that ends
well and hath a good begining. That cannot be good which
hath a bad principle, <hi>bonum ex integra causa.</hi> Some Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for constitution good, may in some acts be bad; but
a Government for constitution bad, cannot for the acts it
puts forth be good. These good acts may be good for <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
but <hi>formally</hi> they are not good, as done by the Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
They may be comparatively good, that is better so
then worse; but they cannot be absolutely, and in a Moral
sense good: for to make a Politick action good, not only
the matter must be warrantable, but the Call also. It may
indeed induce subjects to bear &amp; improve to the best, what
cannot be remedied; but cannot oblige to oune a Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Relation.</p>
               <p>II. The Nature of the power thus discovered, lets us
see the Nature of that relative duty, which we owe &amp; must
oune as due to Magistrates, and what sort of <hi>ouning</hi> we
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:41139:211"/>
must give them; which to inquire a litle into, will give
light to the question. All the duty &amp; deference the Lord
requires of us, towards them whom we must oune as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
is comprehended in these two expressions, <hi>honour</hi>
required in the <hi>fifth Command,</hi> and <hi>subjection</hi> required in
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. &amp;c. Whomsoever then we oune
as Magistrates, we must oune honour &amp; subjection as due
to them: And if so be we cannot upon a consciencious
ground give them honour &amp; subjection, we cannot oune
them as Magistrates. The least deference we can pay to
Magistrates is <hi>subjection,</hi> as it is required in these words;
<hi>Let every soul be subject to the higher Powers,</hi> and <hi>submit your selves
to every Ordinance of man for the Lords sake.</hi> But this cannot
be given to Tyrants &amp; Usurpers: <hi>Ergo</hi> no deference can
be paid to them at all, and consequently they cannot be
ouned. That this subjection, which is required to the
higher Powers, cannot be ouned to Tyrants, will be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
if we consider. 1. The Subjection required is <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
subjection</hi> to an <hi>orderly power,</hi> that we be regularly under
him that is regularly above: But Usurpation &amp; Tyranny
is not an Orderly Power, orderly placed above us: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we cannot be ordely under it. This is gathered from
the Original Language, where the powers to be subjected
to are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ordained of God,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God,</hi> and he that resisteth the Power is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>Counter-ordered,</hi> or contrary to his orderly duty:
So the duty is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>be subject.</hi> They are all words
coming from one root, which signifies to <hi>Order:</hi> So that
subjection is to be placed in order under another relative
to an Orderly Superiority: But to occupy the seat of dignity
unauthorized, is an <hi>Ataxie,</hi> a breaking of order, and
bringing the Common-wealth quite out of order. Whereby
it may appear, that in relation to an Arbitrary Government,
there can be properly no <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, no <hi>orderly</hi> subjection.
2. The thing it self must import that relative duty which
the fifth Command requires; not only a <hi>passive</hi> stooping en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance,
or a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eigned Counterfeit submission, but a real
<hi>Active</hi> duty including obedience to Lawful Commands;
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:41139:212"/>
and not only so, but support &amp; maintinance; and that both
to the acts of his administration, and to his standing &amp; keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his station, assisting him with all our abilities, both
humane &amp; Christian; And not only as to the external acts of
duties, but the inward motions of the heart, as consent,
Love, Reverence, &amp; Honour, and all sincere fealty &amp;
Allegiance. But can a subjection of this extent, be payed
to a Tyrant or Usurper? Can we support those we are
bound to suppress? Shall we love the ungodly, and help
those that hate the Lord? Can we consent, that we &amp; our
posterity should be slaves? Can we honour them who are
vile, and the vilest of men, how high soever they be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
3. The ground of this subjection is <hi>for conscience sake,</hi>
not for <hi>wrath,</hi> that is, so far &amp; so long as one is constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by fear, &amp; to avoid a greater evil, to stoop to him, but
out of conscience of duty, both that of Piety to God who
ordained Magistracy, and that of equity to him who is His
Minister for good, and under pain of <hi>damnation</hi> if we break
this orderly subjection <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2, 5. But can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that all this is due to a Tyrant &amp; Usurper? Can it be
out of conscience, because he is the Lords Minister for
good? the contrary is clear, that he is the Devils drudge
serving his Interest; Is resistance to Tyrants a damnable
sin? I hope to prove it to be a duty. 4. If subjection to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
&amp; Usurpers will inveigle us in their snares, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
us in their sin &amp; judgment, then it is not to be ouned
to them: But the former is true: Therefore the Latter. In
the foregoing head I drew an Argument, for withdrawing
from &amp; disouning the Prelatick Ministers, from the hazard
of partaking in their sin, and of being obnoxious to their
judgment, because people are often punished for their
Pastors sins; <hi>Aaron</hi> &amp; his sons polluting themselves, would
have brought wrath upon all the people, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>v.</hi> 10. 6. because
the Teachers had transgressed against the Lord, therefore
was <hi>Iacob</hi> given to the Curse &amp; <hi>Israel</hi> to reproaches <hi>Isai<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 43.
27, 28. and all these Miseries Lamented by the Church
were inflicted for the <hi>sins of her Prophets and the iniquites of her
Priests, Lam.</hi> 4. 13. the reason was, because they ouned
them, followed them, countenanced them, complyed
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:41139:212"/>
with them, or connived at them, or did not hinder or else
disoune them. The same Argument will evince, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of withdrawing our subjection from &amp; disouning
Usurping &amp; Tyrannical Rulers, when we cannot hinder
their wickedness, nor give any other Testimony against
them, to avert the wrath of the Lord. If the defections
of Ministers will bring on the whole Nation desolating
judgments; then much more have we reason to fear it,
when both Magistrates &amp; Ministers are involved in, and
jointly carrying on, and carressing &amp; encouraging each
other in promoting, a woful Apostasie from God: when
the heads of the house of <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp; Princes of the house of
<hi>Israeel,</hi> abhor judgement &amp; pervert all equity, the heads
Judge for reward, and the Priests teach for hire, and the
Prophets divine for money, and yet lean upon the Lord
and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come
upon us: Then we can expect nothing but that <hi>Zion for their
sake shall be plowed as a field &amp; Ierusalem become heaps and the
Mountain of the house as the high places of the forest, Mich.</hi> 3. 9,
11, 12. Certain it is that subjects have smarted sore for
the sins of their Rulers: for <hi>Sauls</hi> sin in breaking Covenant
with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> the Land suffered three years famine
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 1. and the wrath of the Lord could not be appeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
till seven of his sons were hanged up unto the Lord.
What then shall appease the wrath of God, for the unp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

breach of Covenant with God in our day? For
<hi>Davids</hi> sin of numbering the people, 70000 men died by
the Pestilence. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5. For <hi>Ieroboams</hi> sin of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
who made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin, the Lord threatens to give
<hi>Israel</hi> up because of the sins of <hi>Ieroboam 1 King.</hi> 14. 16. only
they escaped this Judgment, who withdrew themselves and
fell into <hi>Iudah.</hi> For <hi>Ahabs</hi> sin of letting go a man whom the
Lord had appointed to utter destruction, the Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
him, <hi>thy life shall go for his life,</hi> and <hi>thy people for his people
1 King.</hi> 20. 42. Because <hi>Manasseh</hi> King of <hi>Iudah</hi> did many
abominations, therefore the Lord threatened to bring such
evil upon <hi>Ierusalem</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudah</hi> that whosoever heard it his
ears should <hi>tingle</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 11, 12. and not withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his repentance, and the Reformation in the dayes
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:41139:213"/>
of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> notwithstanding the Lord turned not from
the fierceness of His great wrath, wherewith His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was kindled against <hi>Iudah, because of all the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
that Manasseh had provoked Him withall 2 King.</hi> 23.
26. which was accomplished by the hands of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi>
in <hi>Iehojakims</hi> time. Surely at the Commandment
of the Lord came this upon <hi>Iudah,</hi> to remove them out
of His sight, <hi>for the sins of Manasseh according to all that he
did, and also for the innocent blood which he shed</hi> ... which
the Lord would not pardon 2 <hi>King.</hi> 24. 3, 4. And <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
further threatens, that they should be removed
into all Kingdoms of the earth, <hi>because of Manasseh for that
which he did in Ierusalem Ier.</hi> 15. 4. Certainly these passages
were recorded for our Learning <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. and for our
examples, to the intent we should not do as they did 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
10. 6. and for our admonition <hi>vers.</hi> 11. Whence we may
be admonished, that it is not enough to keep our selves free
of publick sins of Rulers; Many of those then punished,
were free of all actual accession to them; but they became
accessory to and involved in the guilt of them, when they
did not endeavour to hinder them, and bring them to
condign punishment for them, according to the Law of
God which respecteth not persons; or at least, because they
did not revolt from them, as <hi>Libnah</hi> did: There might be
other provocations on the peoples part, no doubt, which
the Lord did also punish by these Judgments; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut when
the Lord specifies the sin of Rulers, as the particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
Cause of the Judgment, it were presumption to
make it the <hi>Occasion</hi> only of the Lords punishing them: for
plain it is, if these sins of Rulers had not been committed,
which was the ground of the threatening &amp; execution, the
Judgment would have been prevented; And if people had
bestirred themselves as became them, in repressing &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
such wickedness, they had not so smarted; And
when that sin so threatened &amp; punished was removed, then
the Judgment it self was removed or deferred. It is just &amp;
necessary, that the subjects being Jointly included with
their Rulers in the same bond of fidelity to God, be lyable
to be punished for their Rebellion &amp; Apostasie, when they
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:41139:213"/>
continue under the bond of subjection to them. But how
deplorable were our Condition, if we shold stand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxions
to divine Judgments, for the Atheisme, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Murders, &amp; Adulteries of our Rulers, and yet be
neither Authorized nor Capacitated to hinder it, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to withdraw our selves from subjection to them?
But it is not so; for, the Lords making us responsable for
their debt, is an impowering us either to repress their
wickedness when He gives us Capacity, or at least to save
our selves harmless from their Crimes, by disouning them;
that being the only way of standing no longer accountable
for their faults.</p>
               <p>12. It remains to Consider the <hi>Ends,</hi> for which Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was institute by God, and constitute by men: from
whence I Argue, That Government that destroyes the
Ends of Government, is not to be ouned: But Tyranny,
and especially this under which we houl, destroyes all the
Ends of Government: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not to be ouned. The
<hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus. That Government that destroyes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
&amp; Safety, destroyes all the Ends of Government:
But this <hi>Popish</hi> &amp; arbitrary <hi>Absolute</hi> power, destroyes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
&amp; Safety: <hi>Ergo</hi>—It is evident both from the Laws
of Nature &amp; Revelation, that the Ends of Government are
the Glory of God, &amp; the good of Mankind. The first is the
<hi>Glory of God,</hi> the ultimate end of all Ordinances; to which
whatever is opposite, is not to be ouned by them that fear
Him: whatever power then is destructive to Religion, and
is applyed &amp; imployed against the Glory of the Uuniversal
King, and for withdrawing us from our fealtie &amp; obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to Him, is nothing but Rebellion against the Supreme
Lord &amp; Lawgiver, and a Traiterous Conspiracy against
the Almighty; and therefore not to be ouned: And they
are enemies to Religion, or strangers to it, who are not
sensible this hath been the design of the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
at least these 27 years, to overturn the Reformed
Covenanted Religion, and to introduce <hi>Popery.</hi> Hence,
seeing a King at his best &amp; highest elevation is only a mean
for preserving Religion, and for this end only chosen of the
people to be <hi>Custos utriusque tabulae,</hi> keeper of both Tables
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:41139:214"/>
of the Law, he is not to be regarded but wholly laid aside,
when he not only moves without his sphere, but his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
infers the ruine of the ends of his erection, and when
he imployes all his power for the destruction of the Cause
of Christ, and advancement of Antichrists, giving his power
to the <hi>beast;</hi> he is so far from deserving the deference of the
power ordained of God, that he is to be looked upon &amp;
treated as a Traitor to God, and Stated enemy to Religion
&amp; all Righteousness, The Second End of Government
is the <hi>good of the people,</hi> which is the Supreme &amp; Cardinal
Law; <hi>Salus Populi est Suprema Lex.</hi> Which cannot be
denied, if it be considered. 1. For this only the Magistrate
is appointed of God to be His Minister, for the peoples
<hi>good Rom.</hi> 13. 4. and they have no goodness but as they
conduce to this end; for all the power they have of God is
with this <hi>Proviso,</hi> to promote His peoples prosperity. (It
were blasphemy to say, they are His Authorized Ministers
for their destruction) to which if their Conduct degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
they degrade themselves, and so must be disouned.
He is therefore; in his institution, no more than a mean
for this end; and himself cannot be either the whole or
half of the end, for then he should be both the end &amp; the
mean of Government; and it is contrary to Gods mould
to have this for his end, to multiply to himself silver &amp;
gold, or lift up himself above his brethren <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 17, 20.
if therefore he hath any other end than the good of the
people, he cannot be ouned as one of Gods moulding.
2. This only is the highest pitch of good Princes ambition,
to postpone their oun safety to the peoples safety. <hi>Moses</hi>
desired, rather than the people should be destroyed, that
his name should be razed out of the <hi>Book of life.</hi> And <hi>David</hi>
would rather the Lords hand be on him &amp; his fathers house,
than on the people that they should be plagued 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
21. 17. but he that would seek his oun ambitious ends with
the destruction of the people, hath the spirit of the <hi>Devil,</hi>
and is to be carried towards as one possessed with that
malignant spirit. 3. Originally their power is from the
people, from whom all their dignity is derived; with reserve
of their safety, which is not the donative of Kings, nor
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:41139:214"/>
held by concession from them, nor can it be resigned or
surrendered to the disposal of Kings; since God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
in His universal Laws, that no Authority make any
disposal, but for the good of the people. This cannot be
forfeited by the usurpation of Monarchs, but being alwise
fixed in the essential Laws of Government, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
&amp; recover it when they please. Since then we cannot
alienate our safety, we cannot oune that Authority which
is inconsistent with it. 4. The attaining this end was the
main ground &amp; motive, of peoples deliberating to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
a Goverment; and to choose such a forme, because
they thought it most conducible for their good; and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
such persons as fittest Instruments for compassing this
end; and to establish such a Conveyance, as they thought
most contributive for this end: When therefore Princes
cease to be what they could be constitute for, they cease
to have an Authority to be ouned; but ceasing to answer
these ends of Government, they cease to be what they
could be constitute for. 5. For no other end were Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
limited with Conditions, but to bound them that
they might do nothing against the peoples good &amp; safety:
Whosoever then breaking through all legal limitations,
shall became injurious to the Community, lists himself
in the number of enemies, and is only to be looked upon
as such. 6. For this end all Laws are ratified or rescinded,
as they conduce to this end, which is the soul &amp; reason of
the Law: then it is but reason, that the Law establishing
such a King, which proves an enemy to this, should be
rescinded also. 7. Contrary to this end no Law can be of
force; if then either Law or King be prejudicial to the
Realme, they are to be abolished. 8. For this end, in
cases of necessity Kings are allowed sometimes to neglect
the Letter of the Laws, or private Interests, for the safety
of the Community; but if they neglect the publick safety,
and make Laws for their oun Interests, they are no more
Trustees but Traitors. 9. If it were not for this end, it
were more eligible to live in deserts than to enter into
Societies: When therefore a Ruler, in direct opposition
to the ends of Government, seeks the ruine not only of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:41139:215"/>
Religion, but also of the peoples safety, he must certainly
forfeit his right to reign. And what a vast as well as innocent
number, have, for Religion and their adherence to their
fundamental rights, been ruined, rooted out of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
&amp; Possessions, oppressed, persecuted, Murdered,
&amp; destroyed by this and the deceased Tyrant, all <hi>Scotland</hi>
can tell and all <hi>Europe</hi> hath heard. If ever the ends of
Government were perverted &amp; subverted in any place,
<hi>Britain</hi> is the stage where this Tragedy hath been acted.</p>
               <p>13. I may argue from the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that to oune this
Authority is contrary to all the Articles thereof. 1. That
Authority which overturns the Reformation of Religion
in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, &amp; Government, which
we are sworn to preserve against the Common Enemies
thereof, in the <hi>first</hi> Art. cannot be ouned: But the present
pretended Authority overturned (and continues more to
overturn) the Reformation of Religion &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi> it cannot
be ouned: for against what common enemy must we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it, if not against him that is the chief Enemy thereof?
and how can we oune that Authority, that is wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
&amp; applied for the destruction of Religion? 2. If we
are obliged to exstirpate <hi>Poperie,</hi> without respect of persons,
lest we partake in other mens sins; then we are obliged to
exstirpate <hi>Papists</hi> without respect of persons, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the head of them. (For how otherwise can Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
be exstirpated? or how otherwise can we cleanse the
Land of their sins?) But in the 2d <hi>Art.</hi> we are obliged to
exstirpate <hi>Poperie</hi> without respect of persons, lest we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in other mens sins: <hi>Ergo</hi> we are obliged to exstirpate
Papists without respect of Persons and consequently the
<hi>Crowned Iesuite,</hi> and therefore cannot oune him; for how
can we oune him, whom we are bound to exstirpate? 3. If
we be engaged to preserve the Rights &amp; Liberties of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the Liberties of the Kingdoms, and the Kings
Authority only in the preservation &amp; defence of the true
Religion &amp; Liberties of the Kingdoms; then we cannot
oune his Authority, when it is inconsistent with, opposite
to, &amp; destructive of all these precious Interests, as now it
is with a witness: But in the 3. <hi>Art.</hi> we are engaged to
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:41139:215"/>
preserve the Rights &amp; Priviledges of Parliaments, &amp; the
Liberties of the Kingdoms, and the Kings Authority only
in the preservation &amp; defence of the true Religion &amp; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the Kingdoms: <hi>Ergo.</hi> All allegiance that we can
oune to any man, must stand perpetually thus qualified,
<hi>in defence of Religion &amp; Liberty;</hi> that is, so far as it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Religion &amp; Liberty, and no further, for if it be
destructive of these, it is null. If we should then oune this
man, with this restricted allegiance, and apply it to his
Authority (as we must apply it to all Authority that we can
oune) it were to mock God &amp; the world, and oune Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions:
for can we maintain the Destroyer of Religion,
in defence of Religion? And the Destroyer of all our
rights &amp; Liberties, and all our legal securities for them,
in the preservation of these rights &amp; Liberties? that were
pure <hi>Non-sense.</hi> 4. If we be obliged to endeavour, that
all Incendiaries &amp; Malignants &amp;c. be brought to condign
punishment, then we cannot oune the Authority of the
head of these Incendiaries &amp; malignant Enemies: But in
the 4. <hi>Art</hi> we are obliged to endeavour that all Incendiaries
&amp; Malignants &amp;c. be brought to Condign Punishment:
Ergo—The Connexion of the <hi>Major</hi> cannot well be
doubted: for is it imaginable, that the head of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed
Party, the Great malignant Enemy who is the
spring &amp; gives life unto all these Abominations, shall be
exempted from punishment? or ouned for a Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie?
shall we be obliged to discover, and bring to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
the litle petty Malignants, and this implacably stated
Enemy to Christ escape with a Crown on his head? Nay,
we are by this obliged, if ever we be in case, to bring these
stated Enemies to God &amp; the Country to condign punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
from the highest to the Lowest: And this we are
to do, as we would have the anger of the Lord turned
away from us, which cannot be without hanging up their
heads before the Lord against the sun, as was done in the
matter of <hi>Peor Numb.</hi> 25. 4. For hath not he &amp; his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
made the Kingdom a Curse? and we with our oun
consent have made our selves obnoxious to it, if we do
not procure, each in our Capacities, and pursue these
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:41139:216"/>
Traitors &amp; Rebells, that the Judgment of the Lord be
executed upon the accursed. 5. No wilful o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>poser of
Peace &amp; union between the Kingdoms is to be ouned; but
according to the 5. <hi>Art.</hi> we are obliged to ende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

been wilful opposers of Peace &amp; union between the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
all true Peace &amp; union, except an union in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
against the Lord; for they have taken Peace from
both the Kingdoms, and destroyed &amp; annulled that which
was the bond of their union, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Solemn League &amp; Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
6. If we are obliged to assist &amp; defend all those that
enter into this League &amp; Covenant, in the maintaining
&amp; pursuing thereof, and never to suffer our selves to be
divided, to make defection to the contrary part &amp;c. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the 6 <hi>Art.</hi> Then we must not oun the Butcher
of our Covenanted Brethren, who hath imbrued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is hands
in their blood, in the maintaining &amp; pursuing thereof, and
would have us withdrawn into so detestable a defection;
for we cannot both oune him as he requires to be ouned,
and as God requires every Magistrate to be ouned (so as
not to resist him under pain of damnation <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2) and
assist our Brethren too in resisting his Murders; and our
ouning of him were a dividing of our selves from our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
that oppose him, into a defection to the Contrary
part, whereof he is head &amp; Patron. Lastly in the <hi>Conclusion,</hi>
we are obliged to be humbled for the sins of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and to amend in a real Reformation: Whereof this
is one to be mourned for, that after the Lord had delivered
us from the yoke of this Tyrannical family, we again
joined in affinity with the people of these abominations,
and tooke these serpents into our bosome again which hath
bit us so sore, and where-with the Lord hath scourged us
severely. And if it was our sin to engage with them at first,
then it is our sin to continue under their subjection: And
is not consistent with that Repentance, that the Lords
Contendings call for, to continue ouning that Power
which was our sin to oune at first.</p>
               <p>III. In the <hi>Third</hi> place, I promised to confirme my <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
from more express Scripture Arguments. Therefore I
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:41139:216"/>
shall endeavour to gather them as briefly as may be 1.
from Scripture <hi>Inferences,</hi> nearly &amp; natively Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.
2. from Scripture <hi>Assertions.</hi> 3. from Scripture <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</hi>

6. from Scripture <hi>Threatenings.</hi> 7. from Scripture
<hi>Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I shall offer some Arguments deduced by way
of immediate <hi>Inference,</hi> from the grounds laid before us
in Scripture about Government: wherein I shall confine
my self to these Particulars.</p>
               <p>1. Let us Consider the <hi>Characters</hi> of a Magistrate, laid
doun in Scripture; and we may infer, if Tyrants &amp; U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers
are not Capable of these Characters, then they
cannot be ouned for Magistrates. For if they be not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
they cannot be ouned as Magistrats: but if they
be not capable of the Characters of Magistrates, they are
not Magistrates: <hi>Ergo</hi> if they be not capable of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of Magistrates, they cannot be ouned as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.
To find out the Characters of Magistrats, I need
seek no further than than full place <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. Which usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
is made a Magazine of Objections against this Truth;
but I trust to find store of Arguments for it from thence,
not repeating many that have been already deduced ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.
We find in this place many Characters of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
that are all incompatible with a Tyrant or U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper.

God Judgeth <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 1. so called because the <hi>Word of God
came unto them Iohn</hi> 10. 35. But Tyrants are rather <hi>Devils,</hi>
as one of them is called <hi>Lucifer Isai.</hi> 14. 12. and they that
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:41139:217"/>
persecute &amp; imprison the People of God, because acted by
the Devil, and acting for him, do bear his name <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.
10. They are <hi>Divels</hi> that cast the Lords witnesses into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
The Magistrats Judgement is <hi>Gods Iudgement Deut.</hi> 1.
17. because it is not <hi>for man</hi> but <hi>for the Lord 2 Chron.</hi> 19. 6.
and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> is said to have sat on the <hi>Throne of the
Lord 1 Chron.</hi> 29. 23. But it were blasphemy to say, that
Tyrants Judgement, usurping the place without His war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and giving forth Judgement against His Laws &amp; Cause
&amp; People, is the Lords Judgement, or for Him, or that
they sit on the Throne of the Lord. A Throne of iniquity
is not the Throne of the Lord, for He hath no <hi>fellowship</hi>
with it; The Tyrants Throne is a <hi>Throne of iniquity, Psal.</hi>
94. 20. Magistrats are truly to be subjected to &amp; obeyed, as
<hi>Principalities &amp; Powers Tit.</hi> 3. 1. it is a sin to speak evil of
them, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. for it is presumption to despise <hi>Dominion</hi> &amp;
speak evil of <hi>Dignities 2 Pet. 2. 10. Iude.</hi> 8. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are very Catechrestically &amp; abusively Principalities &amp;
Powers, no otherwise then the Devils are so termed <hi>Eph.</hi>
6. 12. and there is no argument to oune or obey the one
more than the other: for if all Principalities &amp; Powers are
to be subjected to &amp; ouned, then also the Devil must, who
get the same Title. To speak Truth of Tyrants indignities,
cannot be a speaking evil of Dignities; for Truth is no evil,
nor is Tyranny a Dignity. Hence they that are not capable
of the Dignity of Rulers, are not to be oune<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as such:
But Tyrants are not capable of the Dignity of Rulers, as
these places prove: <hi>Ergo</hi>—Against this it is <hi>Objected,</hi> that
<hi>Paul</hi> did apply this Character to the Tyrannical <hi>High Priest
Ananias,</hi> whom, after he had objurgated for mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
he honours with that Apologie, that he <hi>wist not
that he was the high Priest,</hi> for it is written, <hi>thow shalt not
speak evil of the ruler of thy people Act. 23. 5. Ans.</hi> Though
all should be granted that is in this Objection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet our
Argument would not be enervated: for grant we should
not speak evil of Tyrants, that does not evince that we
should hold them as Rulers; for we should bless our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. and speak evil of no man <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 2.
that does not say, we should hold every man, or our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:41139:217"/>
to be Rulers. The meaning must be, he knew
not that he was the high Priest, that is, he did not <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
him to be either high Priest or Ruler, he could
acknowledge or observe nothing like one of that Character
in him: for as the high Priests Office was now null &amp; ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so this <hi>Ananias</hi> was only an usurper of the Office, in
place of <hi>Ismael</hi> or <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who had purchased it by money:
And Paul had learned from his Master <hi>Gamaliel, Iudicem,
qui honoris consequendi causâ pecunias dederit, revera neque Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicem
esse, neque honorandum, sed Asini habendum Loco. Tit.
Talmud. de Synedrio.</hi> That a Judge who hath given money
for purchasing this honour, is neither a Judge, nor to be
honoured as such, but to be held in place of an Ass. And
it was common among the Jewes to say, if such be gods,
<hi>they are silver gods not to be honoured,</hi> as is quoted by <hi>Pool Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopsis
Criticorum &amp;c. in locum.</hi> And that this must be the sense
of it is plain; for he could not be ignorant that he was there
in place of a Judge, being called before him, and smitten
by him Authoritatively, whom therefore he did threaten
with the judgment of God; it were wicked to think, that
he would retract that threatening which he pronunced by
the Spirit of God. And therefore this place confirms my
<hi>Thesis:</hi> If a Tyrannical Judge, acting contrary to Law,
is not to be known or acknowledged to be a Ruler, but
upbraided as a <hi>whited wall;</hi> Then a Tyrant is not to be
known or acknowledged as such: But the former is true,
from this place: Therefore also the latter. <hi>Paul</hi> knew well
enough he was a Judge, and knew well enough what was
his duty to a Judge, that he should not be reviled; but he
would not acknowledge this Priest to be a Judge, or retract
his threatening against him.</p>
               <p>2. He is <hi>of God</hi> &amp; <hi>ordained of God:</hi> I proved before, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
are not capable of this; yea it were blasphemy to say,
they are Authorized or Ordained of God, by His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive
Will. Hence take only this Argument. All Rulers
that we must oune are ordained of God, do reign &amp; are
set up by God <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15. (for that &amp; this place are paralell)
But Tyrants do not reign nor are set up by God <hi>Hos.</hi> 8. 4.
They are set up (saith the Lord) <hi>but not by me:</hi> Ergo we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:41139:218"/>
oune them to be ordained of God. 3. Whosoever <hi>resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
this power ordained of God resisteth the Ordinance of
God, and they that resist shall receive to themselves damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>vers.</hi> 2. This cannot be ouned of a Tyrant, that it is a
damnable sin to resist him, for it is duty to resist &amp; also repress
him, as is proven already, and shall be afterwards. Hence,
whatsoever Authority we oune subjection to we must not
resist it: But we cannot oune that we must not resist this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
therefore we cannot oun it at all. Again, That can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the power not to be resisted, which is acquired &amp;
improved by resisting the Ordinance of God: But the power
of Usurpers &amp; Tyrants is acquired &amp; improved by resisting
the ordinance of God: Ergo their power cannot be the
power not to be resisted. The <hi>Major</hi> is manifest: for when
the Apostle sayes, the resisting of the power bring damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the resister, certainly that resistance cannot purchase
Dominion instead of damnation: And if he that resists in a
lesser degree, be under the doom of damnation: then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he that does it in a greater degree, so as to complete
it, in puting himself in place of that power which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
cannot be free. The <hi>Minor</hi> is also undenyable; for,
if Usurpers acquire their power without resistence forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
&amp; sensible, it is because they that defend the power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
are wanting in their duty; but however Morally the
Tyrant or Usurper is alwayes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
order</hi> to a Lawful Power. 4. <hi>Rulers are not a terror to
good works but to the evil,</hi> and they that <hi>doe that which is good
shall have praise of the same vers.</hi> 3. This is the Character &amp;
duty of righteous Magistrates, though it be not alwayes
their Administration: But an Usurper &amp; Tyrant is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
or susceptible of this Character, but on the contrary
is &amp; must be a terror to good works and a praise to the evil:
for, he must be a Terror to them that would secure their
rights &amp; Liberties in opposition to his encroachments,
which is a good work; &amp; he must be a fautor, Patron, &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of such, as encourage &amp; maintain him in his Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
&amp; Tyranny, which is an evil work: And if he were
a terror to the evil, then he would be a terror to himself &amp;
all his Complices, which he cannot be. Therefore, that
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:41139:218"/>
power which is not capable of the duties of Magistrates,
cannot be ouned: But the Power of Tyrants &amp; Usurpers is
such: <hi>Ergo</hi>—We find in Scripture, the best Commentare
on this Character, where the duties of a Magistrate are
described. They must justify the righteous &amp; condemn
the wicked <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 1. They must, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>deliver</hi>
the poor that cry and put on righteousness as a cloathing—
and be eyes to the blind &amp; feet to the lame, and a Father
to the poor—and break the Jawes of the the wicked <hi>Iob</hi>
29. 12-17. Their Throne must be established by right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness
<hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 12. a King sitting on the Throne of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must scatter away all evil with his eyes—then
Mercy &amp; Truth will preserve him and his Throne is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
by Mercy <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 8, 28. But Tyrants have a quite
contrary Character: The <hi>Throne of iniquity</hi> frames Mischief
by a Law, and condemns the innocent blood <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 20.
21. They judge not the fatherless, neither doeth the cause
of the widow come unto them <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. 23. They build
their house by unrighteousness, &amp; their chambers by wrong,
and use their neighbours service without wages <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. 13.
They oppress the poor &amp; crush the needy <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 1. They
turn judgement to Gall &amp; the fruit of righteousness to hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
and say, have we not taken horns to as by our oun
strength <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 12, 13. These contrary Characters can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist together. 5. <hi>He is the Minister of God for good vers.</hi>
4. not by <hi>Providential</hi> Commission, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was,
and Tyrants may be eventually, by the Lord making all
things turn about for the good of the Church; but he hath a
<hi>Moral</hi> Commission from God, &amp; is entrusted by the people
to procure their Publick &amp; Politick good at least. Now
this, and Tyranny &amp; Usurpation, are together incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible:
for if Tyrants &amp; Usurpers were Ministers for
good, then they would restore the publick &amp; personal
Rights, and rectify all wrongs done by them; but then
they must surrender their Authority, and resign it, or else all
rights cannot be restored, nor wrongs rectified. Hence,
these that cannot be ouned as Ministers of God for good,
cannot be ouned as Magistrates: But Tyrants &amp; Usurpers,
(and in particular this Man) are such as cannot be ouned as
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:41139:219"/>
Ministers of God for good: <hi>Ergo</hi>—Again, If Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy
be alwise a <hi>blessing,</hi> and Tyranny &amp; Usurpation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a <hi>Curse,</hi> then they cannot be ouned to be the same
thing, and the one cannot be ouned to be the other: But
Magistracy or the right-ful Magistrate, is alwise a blessing;
Tyranny &amp; Usurpation or the Tyrant &amp; Usurper, alwise
a curse: <hi>Ergo</hi>—That the former is true, these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
prove it. God provides him for the benefite of His
people 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 1. a just Ruler is compared to the <hi>light of
the morning,</hi> when the sun riseth, even a morning without
Clouds 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 4. So the Lord exalted <hi>Davids</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for His people <hi>Israels</hi> sake 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 12. because the
Lord <hi>Loved Israel</hi> for ever, therefore made He <hi>Solomon</hi> King
to do judgement &amp; Justice 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 9. when the righteous
are in Authority the people <hi>rejoice</hi>—the King by Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
stabilisheth the Land—<hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 2, 4. The Lord
promises Magistrates as a special blessing <hi>Isai. 1. 26. Ier.</hi> 17.
25. and therefore their continuance is to be praye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for, that
we may lead a quiet &amp; peaceable life in all godlyness &amp;
honesty 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. And they must needs be a blessing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
to have no Ruler is a Miserie; for when <hi>Israel</hi> had no
King every man did that which was right in his oun eyes
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 17. 6. and the Lord threatens it ar a Curse to take
away the <hi>stay &amp; the staff</hi>—the mighty man and the man of
war, the <hi>Iudge</hi> &amp; the Prophet &amp;c. <hi>Isai.</hi> 3. 1, 2 &amp;c. and that the
Children of <hi>Israel</hi> shall abide many dayes without <hi>a King,</hi>
and without a <hi>Prince Hos.</hi> 2. 4. But on the other hand Tyrants
&amp; Usurpers are alwayes a Curse, and given as such: It is
threatened among the Curses of the Covenant, that the
<hi>stranger</hi> shall get up above <hi>Israel</hi> very high—and that they
shall <hi>serve their enemies</hi> which the Lord shall send against
them—and He shall put a <hi>yoke of iron</hi> upon their neck,
until He hath destroyed them <hi>Deut. 28. 43, 48. As a roaring
lyon and a ranging bear so is a wicked Ruler over the poor people
Prov.</hi> 28. 15. and therefore, <hi>when the wicked beareth rule the
people mourn Prov.</hi> 29. 2. The Lord threatens it as a Curse,
that he will give Children to be their Princes, and babes
shall rule over them <hi>Isai.</hi> 3. 4. and if unqualified Rulers be a
curse, much more Tyrants. They are the rod of His anger,
and the staff in their hand is His indignation, His axe
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:41139:219"/>
&amp; saw &amp; rod <hi>Isai.</hi> 10. 5, 15. It is one thing to call a man
Gods instrument, His rod, axe, sword, or hammer; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to call him Gods Minister: there is a wide diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt the instruments of Gods Providence, and
the Ministers of His Ordinance; those fulfill His Purposes
only, these do His precepts. Such Kings are given in the
Lords anger <hi>Hos.</hi> 13. 11. therefore they cannot be ouned
to be Ministers of God for good. 6. <hi>He beareth not the sword
in vain for he is the Minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>im that doeth evil vers.</hi> 4. The Apostle doth not say, he that
beareth the sword is the Ruler, but he is the Ruler that
beareth the sword. This is not every sword; for there is
the sword of an enemy, the sword of a robber, the sword
of a common traveller, but this as a faculty of Political
rule &amp; Authoritative judgement. It is not said, he <hi>takes
the sword</hi> (as the Lord expresses the Usurpation of that
power, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 52.) but he <hi>beareth the sword,</hi> hath it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him into his hand by God, by Gods warrant &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
not <hi>in vain;</hi> to no end or without reason, or
without a Commission, as <hi>Pareus</hi> upon the place expones
it. He is a <hi>revenger</hi> to execute wrath, not by private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
for that is condemned <hi>Paulo ante Rom.</hi> 12. 19. not
by providential recompense, for when a private person so
revengeth, it is the providential repayment of God; but as
Gods M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nister, by Him Authorized, commissionated,
&amp; warranted to this work. Now this cannot agree with
a Tyrant or Usurper, whose sword only legitimates his
scepter, and not his scepter his sword, who takes the
sword rather then bears it, &amp; uses it without reason or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from God, in the execution of his lustful rage upon him
that doth well, and hath no right to it from God. Hence,
he that beareth the sword no other way but as it may be said
of a Murderer, cannot be a Magistrate bearing the sword:
But a Tyrant &amp; Usurper beareth the sword no other way
but as it may be said of a Murderer: <hi>Ergo</hi>—So much
for the Characters of a Magistrate, which are every way
inapplicable to Tyrants &amp; Usurpers, and as inapplicable
to this of ours as to any in the world.</p>

the duty of Magistrates, and the Contrary Comparisons
holding forth the sin, vileness &amp; villany of Tyrants &amp; Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
we may infer, that we cannot oune the last to be the

raised up a <hi>Mother in Israel Iudg.</hi> 5. 7. Kings are <hi>nursing fathers</hi>
by office <hi>Isai.</hi> 49. 23. But that Tyrants cannot be such I have
proved already; for they can no more be accounted fathers,
than he that abuseth or forceth our mother. 3. From the
Protection &amp; shelter that people find under their Conduct,
they are called <hi>Shields Psal. 47. Ult.</hi> The <hi>Princes of the people,</hi>
the <hi>Shields of the earth,</hi> belong unto God. But Tyrants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be such, because they are the subverters of the earth.
4. From the Comfort that attends them, they are resembled
to the <hi>morning light &amp; fruitful shours of rain 2 Sam. 23. 4. They
waited for me as for the rain,</hi> saith <hi>Iob.</hi> 29. 23. But Tyrants
cannot be resembled to these, but rather to darkness, and
to the <hi>blast of the terrible ones Isai. 25. 4. as a storm against the
wall,</hi> If darkness cannot be ouned to be light, then cannot
Tyrants be ouned to be Magistrats. 5. From their Pastoral
Care &amp; Conduct and duty, they are <hi>feeders.</hi> The Judges
of <hi>Israel</hi> are commanded to <hi>feed</hi> the Lords people 1 <hi>Chron.
17. 6. David</hi> was brought to <hi>feed Jacob</hi> His people, and
<hi>Israel</hi> His Inheritance <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 71. But Tyrants are wolves
not Shepherds. 6. By office they are physicians or <hi>healers
Isai.</hi> 3. 7. That Tyrants cannot be such is proven above.
Secondly on the other hand, the vileness, villany, &amp;
violence of Tyrants &amp; Usurpers, are held forth by fit resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:41139:220"/>
being Compared to these unclean creatures.
1. Tyrants are wicked <hi>Dogs,</hi> as they who compass about

<hi>Golden Psalm Psal. 59. 4. Saul</hi> &amp; his Complices, watching
the house to kill <hi>David,</hi> make a noyse like a dog &amp; go round

3. They are roaring <hi>Lyons.</hi> that are wicked Rulers over the

the <hi>Lyon,</hi> out of whose mouth he was delivered. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 17. 4. They are <hi>ranging bears Prov.</hi> 28. 15. So the <hi>Persian</hi>

the peercing <hi>Serpent</hi> &amp; <hi>Dragon Isai.</hi> 27. 1. and have great
affinity in name &amp; Nature with the Apocalyptick <hi>Dragon:</hi>
So also <hi>Isai.</hi> 51. 9. the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tyrant is called <hi>Dragon.</hi>
And <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> swallowed up the Church like a
<hi>Dragon Ier.</hi> 51, 34. See also <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29. 3. 6. They are

and Antichrist <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 2. 8. They are <hi>foxes:</hi> So Christ
calls <hi>Herod Luk.</hi> 13. 32. 9. They are <hi>Devils</hi> who cast the
Lords people into Prison <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 10, 13. Now can we
oune all these abommable Creatures to be Magistrates?
Can these be the fathers we are bound to honour in the
fifth Commandment? They must be esteemed sons of
dogs &amp; Devils that belive so, and oune themselves sones
of such fathers.</p>
               <p>If we further take notice, how the Spirit of God <hi>describes</hi>

holy ends by it, chiefly the procreation of the <hi>Messias</hi> from
a Kingly race, did permit the change, and gave directions
how he should be moulded &amp; bounded, that was to be
ouned as the Magistrate under a Monarchial forme: To

he should not multiply horses, nor wives, nor money

and the security of their Religion &amp; Liberty, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding

Lord did not approve the change of the form, which that

For long before <hi>Saul</hi> was made King, they profered an

                  </gap>ding out
the Nature of that Tyrannical usurpation, under the
Apologue of the <hi>trees</hi> itching after a King, and the offer
being repudiate by the more generous sort, embraced by
the <hi>bramble:</hi> Signifying that men of worth &amp; virtue would
never have taken upon them such an arrogant Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that such a Tyrannicall Government in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
&amp; tendency was nothing but an useless, worthless,
sapless, aspiring, scratching, &amp; vexing shadow of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:41139:221"/>
under subjection to which there could be no peace
nor safety. But this was rather a Tumultuary interruption
than a Change of the Government, not being universally
either desired or ouned; therefore after that the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
the pristine form: Which continued until, being
much perverted by <hi>Samuels</hi> sons, the people unanimously
&amp; peremptorly desired the change thereof, and whether
it were reason or not would have a King; as we were
fondly set upon one, after we had been delivered from his
fathers yoke: And the Lord gave them a King with a
Curse, and tooke him away with a vengeance, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.
11. as He did our <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. Yet He permited
it, but with a Protestation against and conviction of the
sin, that thereby they had <hi>rejected the Lord 1 Sam.</hi> 8. 7. and
with a demonstration from Heaven, which extorted their
oun confession, that they <hi>bad added unto all their sins this evil
to ask a King 1 Sam.</hi> 12. 17, 18, 19. And to deter &amp; disswad
from such a Conclusion, He appoints the Prophet to shew
them the <hi>manner of the King</hi> that should reign over them
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 9. to declare before hand, what sort of a Ruler
he woud prove, when they got him; to wit, a meer
Tyrant, who would take their sons and appoint them for
himself, for his Chariots, and for horsemen, and to run
before his Chariots, and make them his sowldiers, and
labourers of the ground, and Instrument-makers, and
houshold servants, and he would take their fields &amp; vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards—the
best of them, and give unto his servants, in
a word to make all slaves; and that in the end when this
should come to pass, they should cry out because of their
King, but the Lord would not hear them <hi>vers.</hi> 11-18,
All which, as it is palpable in it self, so we have sensibly
felt in our experience to be the Natural description of
Tyranny, but more tollerable than an account of ours
would amount to. It is both foolishly &amp; falsely alledged,
by Royalists or Tyrannists, that here is a grant of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
absoluteness to Kings to Tyrannise over the
people without resistence, And that this <hi>manner of the King</hi>
is in the Original <hi>Mishphat,</hi> which signifies right or Law,
So that here was a permissive Law given to Kings to
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:41139:222"/>
Tyrannise, and to oblige people to passive obedience,
without any remedy but tears, And therefore it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistered
&amp; laid up before the Lord in a book 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 10. 25.
But I <hi>answer.</hi> 1. If any thing be here granted to Kings, it is
either by Gods Approbation, directing &amp; instructing how
they should govern; or it is only by permission &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
Commission to them, to be a plague to the people
for their sin of choosing them, to make them drink as they
have brewed, as sometimes He gave a Charge to the
<hi>Assyrian</hi> rod to trample them doun as the mire of the
streets: If the first be said, Then a King that does not
govern after that manner, and so does not make people
cry out for their oppression, would came short of his duty,
and all behoved to Tyrannize and make the people cry out;
then a King may take what He will from his subjects, and
be approved of God: this were blasphemously absurd, for
God cannot approve of the sin of oppression. If the Second
be said, then it cannot be an universal Grant, or otherwise
all Kings must be ordained for plagnes; And if so, it were
better we wanted such nursing fathers. 2. Though <hi>Mishphat</hi>
signifies right or Law, yet it signifies also, and perhaps no
less frequently, <hi>Manner, Course,</hi> or <hi>Custome:</hi> And here
it cannot signify the <hi>Law of God,</hi> for all these Acts of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
are contrary to the Law of God; for to make Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of subjects is contrary to the Law of God <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.
20. forbidding to lift up himself so far above his brethren, but
this was to deal with them as a proud <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> to take so
many for Chariots &amp; horsemen, is also contrary to the
Law <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15. he <hi>shall not multiply horses:</hi> to take their
fields &amp; vineyards, is meer Robbery, contrary to the
Moral &amp; Judicial Law, whereof he was to have alwise a
Copy <hi>vers.</hi> 18. And contrary to <hi>Ezek. 46. 18. The Prince
shall not take of the peoples inheritance</hi> &amp;c. This would justify
<hi>Ahabs</hi> taking <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard, which yet the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Robberie, and for which Tyrants are called
<hi>Companions of Thieves Isai.</hi> 1. 23. &amp; <hi>Robbers Isai.</hi> 42. 24. into
whose hands the Lord somtimes may give His people for
a spoyl in Judicial providence, but never with His Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
&amp; grant of right: to make them <hi>cry out,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s oppression,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:41139:222"/>
which the Lord abhors <hi>Isai.</hi> 5. 7, 8. And if this be all the
remedy, it is none; for it is such a Cry, as the Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
He will not hear. 3. It is false that this <hi>manner of the
King</hi> was registered in that <hi>Book</hi> mentioned 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 25.
for that was the <hi>Law of the Kingdom,</hi> accordingly the Copy
of which the King was to have for his instruction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the fundamental Laws, point blank contrary to
this which was the manner of the King: There is a great
difference between the <hi>Manner of the Kingdom,</hi> what ought
to be observed as Law, and the <hi>Manner of the King</hi> what he
would have as lust. Would <hi>Samuel</hi> write in a Book the
rules of Tyranny, to teach to oppress, contrary to the
Law of God? He sayes himself he would only teach both
King &amp; people <hi>the good &amp; the right way, Sam.</hi> 12. 23, 25.
4. Nothing can be more plain, than that this was a meer
disswasive against seeking a King; for he protests against
this Course, and then layes before them what sort of King
he should be, in a description of many acts of Tyranny,
and yet in end its said <hi>vers. 19. Nevertheless the people refused to
obey the voice of Samuel, and said, Nay but we will have a King.</hi>
Now what else was the voice of <hi>Samuel,</hi> than a disswasion?
I am not here levelling this Argument against Monarchy in
the abstract, that does not lie in my road. But I infer from
hence. 1. If God was displeased with this people for
asking &amp; ouning a King, who was only <hi>Tyrannus in fieri,</hi>
and disswades from the choise by a description of his future
Tyranny; Then Certainly He was displeased with them
when they continued ouning him, when a Tyrant <hi>in facto
esse,</hi> according to that description: But the former is true,
Therefore also the latter. The Consequence is clear; for
Continuing in sin is sin; but continuing in ouning that
Tyrant which was their sin at first, was a continuing in
sin: <hi>Ergo</hi>—The <hi>Minor</hi> is confirmed thus: Continuing
in counteracting the Motives of Gods disswasion, especially
when they are sensibly visible, is a Continuing in sin: But
their Continuing in ouning <hi>Saul</hi> after he became a Tyrant,
was a Continuing in counteracting the Motives of Gods
disswasion, when they were sensibly visible. I do not say,
because it was their sin to ask <hi>Soul,</hi> therefore it was not
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:41139:223"/>
Lawful to oune him, while he ruled as a Magistrate; And
so if <hi>Charles the second</hi> had ruled righteously, it would not
have been sin to oune him: but after the Lord uses disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sives
from a choise of such a one, and these are signally
verified, if it was sin to make the choise, then it must be
sin to keep it. 2. If it was their sin to seek &amp; set up such a
one before he was Tyrant, who yet was admitted upon
Covenant terms, and the manner of it registered; Then
much more is it a sin to seek &amp; set up one, after he declared
himself a Tyrant, and to admit him without any terms at
all, or for any to consent or give their suffrage to such a
deed: But the former is true: Therefore the latter: and
Consequently, to give our consent to the erection of the
D. of Y. by ouning his Authority, were our sin. 3. If
it be a sin to oune the <hi>manner of the King</hi> there described,
then it is a sin to oune the present pretended Authority,
which is the exact transumpt of it: But it is a sin to oune the
manner of the King there described, or else it would never
have been used as a disswasive from seeking such a King.
4. To bring our selves under such a burden which the
Lord will not remove, and involve our selves under such
a miserie wherein the Lord will not hear us, is certainly
a sin <hi>vers.</hi> 18. But to oune or chuse such a King, whose
manner is there described, would bring our selves under
such a burden &amp; miserie, wherein the Lord would not
hear us: <hi>Ergo</hi> it were our sin.</p>
               <p>4. We may adde the necessary <hi>Qualifications</hi> of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
which the Lord requires to be in all, both Superior
&amp; Inferior: And thence it may be inserred, that such
pretended Rulers who neither have nor can have these Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
are not to be ouned as Magistrates, no more
than such are to be ouned as Ministers who have no quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
for such a function. We find their essentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
qualifications particularly described. <hi>Iethros</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
was Gods Counsel &amp; Command; That Rulers must be
<hi>able men,</hi> such as <hi>fear God, men of Truth, hating Covetousness
Exod.</hi> 18. 21. Tyrants &amp; Usurpers have none nor can have
any of these qualifications, except that they may have
ability of force, which is not here meant; but that they
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:41139:223"/>
be Morally <hi>able</hi> for the discharge of their duty: Surely
they cannot fear God; nor be men of Truth, for then they
would not be Tyrants. It is Gods direction, that the man
to be advanced &amp; assumed to Rule, must be a man <hi>in whom
is the Spirit Numb.</hi> 27. 18. as is said of <hi>Ioshua:</hi> what Spirit
this was, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 9. explains, <hi>He was full of the Spirit of
Wisdom,</hi> that is, the Spirit of Government; not the Spirit
of infernal or <hi>Iesuitical</hi> Policy, which Tyrants may have,
but they cannot have the true Regal Spirit, but such a
Spirit as <hi>Saul</hi> had when he turned Tyrant, an <hi>evil Spirit from
the Lord.</hi> Moses saith: they must be <hi>wise men</hi> &amp; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and <hi>known among the tribes, Deut.</hi> 1. 13. for if they
be Children or fools, they are plagues &amp; punishments <hi>Isai.</hi>
3. 2, 3, 4. &amp;c. not Magistrates, who are alwise blessings.
And they must be <hi>known men</hi> of intergrity, not known to
be knaves or fools, as all Tyrants are alwayes. The Law
of the King is, <hi>Deut,</hi> 17. 15. he must be one of the Lords
choosing. Can Tyrants &amp; Usurpers be such? No they are
set up, but not by Him <hi>Hos.</hi> 8. 4. he must be a <hi>brother</hi> &amp;
not a stranger, that is, of the same Nation and of the same
Religion: for though infidelity does not make void a
Magistrates Authority, yet both by the Law of God &amp;
man, he ought not to be chosen who is an enemy to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
&amp; Liberty: Now it were almost treason, to call
the Tyrant a brother; and I am sure it is no reason, for he
disdains it, being absolute above all. That good Kings
Testament confirms this, the <hi>God of Israel said, the Rock of
Israel spake, he that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear
of God 2 Sam.</hi> 23. 3. But Tyrants &amp; Usurpers cannot be just;
for if they should render every one their right, they would
keep none to themselves, but behoved to resign their
Robberies in the first place, and then also they must give
the Law its course, and that against themselves. These
Scriptures indeed do not prove, that all Magistrates are in
all their Administrations so qualified, nor that none ought
to be ouned but such as are so qualified in all respects. But
as they demonstrate what they ought to be, so they prove
that they cannot be Magistrates of Gods ordaining who
have none of these qualifications: But Tyrants &amp; Usurpers
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:41139:224"/>
have none of these qualifications. Much more do they
prove that they cannot be ouned to be Magistrats, who
are not capable of any of these qualifications: But Usurpers
are not capable of any of these qualifications. At least
they conclude, in so far as they are not so qualfied, they
ought not to be ouned but disouned: But Tyrants &amp; Usurpers
are not so qualified in any thing: therefore in any thing
they are not to be ouned but disouned: for in nothing they
are so qualified as the Lord prescribes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall offer some reasons from Scripture
<hi>Assertions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. It is strongly Asserted in <hi>Elihu's</hi> speech to <hi>Iob,</hi> that
he that hateth right should not govern. Where he is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Iob</hi> with blasphemie, in accusing God of injustice; of
which he vindicates the Almighty, in Asserting His Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity
&amp; Absolute Dominion, which is inconsistent with
injustice: and shewes both that if He be Soveraign He
cannot be unjust, and if He be unjust He could not be
Soveraign: which were horrid Blasphemy to deny. And
in the demonstration of this, he gives one Maxime in a
question, which is equivalent to an universal negative
<hi>Iob. 34. 17, 18. Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt
thow condemn him that is most just? Is it fit to say to a King, thow
art wicked? and to Princes, ye are ungodly?</hi> In which Words,
the Scope makes it clear, that if <hi>Iob</hi> made God a hater
of right, he should then deny His Government; and if he
took upon him to condemn Him of injustice, he should
blasphemously deny Him to be King of the World. For it is
not fit to say to any King, that he is wicked, or so ungodly
as to be a <hi>hater of right;</hi> for that were treason, Lese-Majestie,
and in effect a denying him to be King: much less is it fit to
say to Him that is King of Kings. Here then it is affirmed,
&amp; supposed to hold good of all Governours, that he that
hateth right should not <hi>govern,</hi> or <hi>bind,</hi> as it is in the
Margent; for <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>abash</hi> signifies both to bind and to Govern,
but all to one sense, for Governours only can <hi>bind</hi> subjects
Authoritatively, with the bonds of Laws &amp; Punishments.
I know the following Words are alledged, to favour the
incontroulableness &amp; absoluteness of Princes, that it is not
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:41139:224"/>
fit to say to them, they are wicked. But plain it is, the
words do import treason against Lawful Kings, whom to
call <hi>haters of right</hi> were to call their Kingship in question;
as the Scope shewes, in that these words are adduced to
Justify the Soveraignity of God by His Justice, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
any indirect charging Him with injustice because that
would derogate from His Kingly Glory, it being imposs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible
He could be King &amp; unjust too. So in some Analogy,
though every act of injustice do not unking a Prince; yet
to call him <hi>wicked,</hi> that is habitually unjust, and a hater of
Justice, were as much as to say, he is no King, which
were intollerable treason against Lawful Kings. But this is
no treason against Tyrants: for Truth &amp; Law can be no
treason; now this is the language of Truth &amp; Law, that
wicked Kings are wicked; And they that are wicked &amp;
ungodly ought to be called so, as <hi>Samuel</hi> called <hi>Saul,</hi> and
<hi>Elijah Ahab</hi> &amp;c. However it will hold to be a true Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
whether we express it by way of Negation or Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
Shall even he that hateth right Govern? But are
not Tyrants &amp; Usurpers haters of right? shall therefore they
Govern? I think it must be answered, they should not
Govern. If then they should not Govern, I infer, they
should not be ouned as Governours. For if it be their sin
to Govern (right or wrong, its all one case, for they should
not Govern at all) then it is our sin to oune them in their
Government: for it is alwise a sin to oune a man in his
sinning.</p>
               <p>2. The Royal Prophet, or whoever was the Penman
of that Appeal for Justice against Tyranny <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 20. does
tacitely Assert the same truth, in that Expostulation, <hi>shall
the Throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, that frameth
mischief by a Law?</hi> which is as much as if he had said, the
Throne of iniquity shall not, no cannot have fellowship
with God; that is, it cannot be the Throne of God that
He hath any Interest in, or Concern with, by way of
approbation: He hath nothing to do with it, except it be
to suffer it a while, till He take vengeance on it in the end.
And shall we have fellowship with that Throne, that God
hath no fellowship with, and that is not His Throne but
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:41139:225"/>
the Devils, as it must be, if God doth not oune it? Much
may be argued from hence, but in a word: A Throne which
is not of God nor ordained of God, but rather of the Devil,
cannot be ouned (for that is the reason of our subjection to
any power, because it is of God and ordained of God <hi>Rom.</hi>
13. 1. And that is the great dignity of Magistracy, that its
Throne is the <hi>Throne of God 1 Chron.</hi> 29. 23.) But a Throne of
Tyrannie &amp; usurpation is a Throne which is not of God, nor
ordained of God, but rather of the Devil: <hi>Ergo</hi>—the
<hi>Minor</hi> is proved: A Throne of iniquity &amp;c. is a Throne which
is not of God, nor ordained of God, but rather of the
Devil: But a Throne of Tyranny &amp; usurpation is a Throne
of iniquity: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not of God &amp; so not to be ouned.</p>
               <p>3. The Lord charges it upon <hi>Israel</hi> as a transgression of
His Covenant, &amp; trespass against His Law, that they had
<hi>set up Kings &amp; not by Him and had made Princes and He knew it
not Hos.</hi> 8. 4. and then taxes them with Idolatry, which
ordinarly is the Consequent of it, as we have reason to
fear will be in our case. He shewes there the Apostasie of
that people, in changing both the Ordinances of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy
and of the Ministry, both of the Kingdom &amp; of
the priest-hood, in which two the safety of that people
was founded: So they overturned all the order of God,
and openly declared they would not be governed by the
hand of God, as <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place expounds it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Lord had commanded, if they would set up Kings
they should set none up but whom He choosed <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.
15. yet they had no regard to this, nor consulted Him in
their admission of Kings, but set them up and never let
Him to wit of it, without His knowledge, that is, without
consulting Him, and without His approbation, for it can
have no other sense. I know it is alledged by several Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
that here is meant the tribes secession from the
house of <hi>David,</hi> and their setting up <hi>Ieroboam.</hi> I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that the ten tribes did sin in that erection of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi>
without respect to the Counsel or Command of God,
without waiting on the vocation of God, as to the time
&amp; manner, and without Covenanting with him for security
for their Religion &amp; Liberty: But that their secession from
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:41139:225"/>
                  <hi>Davids</hi> line, which by no precept or promise of God they
were astricted to, but only conditionally, if his Children
should walk in the wayes of God, Or that their erecting of
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> was materially their sin, I must deny; and assert,
that if <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had not turned Tyrant &amp; Apostate from
God (for which they should have rejected him afterwards
and returned to the good Kings of <hi>Davids</hi> line) he would
have been as Lawful a King as any in <hi>Iudah,</hi> for he got the
Kingdom from the Lord the same way, and upon the same
terms that <hi>David did,</hi> as may be seen expressly in 1 <hi>King.</hi>
11. 38. It must be therefore meant, either generally of
all Tyrants whom they would set up without the Lords
mind, as at first they would have Kings on any terms,
though they should prove Tyrants, as we have seen in <hi>Sauls</hi>
case. Or particularly <hi>Omri</hi> whom they set up, but not by
the Lord 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 16. And <hi>Abab</hi> his Son, And <hi>Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,
Menahem, Pekah</hi> &amp;c. who were all set up by blood &amp;
treacherie, the same way that our Popish Duke is now set
up, but not by the Lord, that is by His approbation. Hence
I argue, those Kings that are not ouned of God, nor set
up by Him, must not be ouned by us (for we can oune
none for Kings but those that reign by Him <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15. and
are ordained of Him <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1.) But Tyrants &amp; Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are not ouned of God as Kings, nor are set up by Him:
<hi>Ergo</hi>—Again if it be a sin to set up Kings and not by God,
then it is a sin to oune them when set up: for, that is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of &amp; continuing in the sin of that erection, and hath
as much affinity with it, as resetting hath with thieft; for if
they be the thieves, they are the ressetters who receive them
&amp; oune them.</p>
               <p>4. The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> in his Complaint to God of
the Chaldean Tyranny, Asserts that God hath made the
righteous, as the <hi>Fishes of the Sea, as the Creeping things,
that have no Ruler over them, Habak.</hi> 1. 14. Now how were
they said to be without a Ruler, when the <hi>Chaldean</hi> actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanded &amp; absolutely ruled over them? yea how can
the Fishes &amp; Reptiles have no Ruler over them? If Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering
be ruling, they want not that; when the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
are over-mastered by the stronger, and by them made
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:41139:226"/>
either to be subject: ar to become their prey. But the
meaning is, these Creatures have no Ruler over them by
order of nature: And the <hi>Iewes</hi> had then no Ruler over
them by order of Law, or ordination from God, or any
that was properly their Magistrate by Divine Institution, or
humane orderly constitution. We see then it is one thing
for a people to have an arbitrary or enthra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing Tyranny,
another to have true Magistracy or Authority to be ouned
over them, without which Kingdoms are but as Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of prey, and Seas of Confusion. Hence I argue, If
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> having the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Monarch tyrannising over
them, had really no Ruler over them, then is a Tyrant &amp;
Usurper not to be ouned for a Ruler: But the former is
true: therefore also the Latter.</p>
               <p>5, Our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> delivers this as a Commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
&amp; a true Maxime, <hi>Iohn. 8. 54. He that honoureth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
his honour is nothing.</hi> The <hi>Iewes</hi> had objected that He
had only made himself <hi>Messias, vers.</hi> 53. To whom He
answers by way of concession, if it were so indeed then
His Claims were void, <hi>If I honour my self my honour is nothing:</hi>
And then claims an indubitable title to His dignity, <hi>It is my
Father that honoureth me.</hi> Here is a two fold honour distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished,
the one real the other suppositious &amp; null, the
one renounced the other ouned by Christ, Self-honour &amp;
honour which is from God. Hence I argue, A self creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
dignity is not to be ouned: the Authority of Tyrants &amp;
Usurpers is a self created dignity: <hi>Ergo</hi>—this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
above.</p>
               <p>Thirdly I shall offer some other considerations confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this truth, from those Scriptures which I class among
<hi>precepts.</hi> And these I find of diverse sorts touching this
subject.</p>
               <p>1. I shew before that the greatest of men, even Kings,
are not exempted from punishment and Capital punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if guilty of Capital Crimes: for where the Law di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth
not, we ought not to distinguish. There is one
special &amp; very peremptory Law, given before the Law for
regulating Kings, which by that posterior Law was neither
abrogated nor limited even as to Kings, <hi>Deut. 13. 6-9.
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:41139:226"/>
If thy Brother</hi> (and a King must be a Brother <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15.)—<hi>entice
the secretly saying let us go &amp; serve other Gods—Thow
shalt not consent unto him nor hearken unto him neither shall thine
eye pity him.</hi> How famous <hi>Mr Knox</hi> improved this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is shewed in the <hi>third Period.</hi> That which I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of here is only, that Kings are not excepted from this
Law, but if they be open Intycers to Idolatry, by force or
fraud, Persecution or Tolleration, as this Idolater now
reigning is palpably doing, they are obnoxious to a legal
animadversion. As it cannot be supposed, that Secret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tycers
should be lyable to punishment, and not open A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouchers
of a desire &amp; design to pervert all the Nation to
Idolatry: that a private perverter of one man, though never
so nearly &amp; dearly related, should be pursued &amp; brought to
condign punishment, and a publick Subverter of whole
Nations, and Introducer of a false &amp; blasphemous Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Religion, should escape <hi>Scot-free.</hi> Let the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inflicted be in a Judicial way, and of what measures
it pleases the Judge to determine, I shall not controvert
here; Only I plead, that Idolatrous Tyrants are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
from this Law: and infer, that if they ought to be
punished they ought to be deposed; And if they ought to
be deposed, they cannot be ouned, when undenyably, guilty
of this Capital Crime, as was urged above. To this I
may adde that part of that Prophetical Kings Testament;
who being about to leave the world, under some Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
of Mal-administration in his oun Government (for
which he took himself to the well ordered everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
for pardon &amp; encouragment) after he had shown
what Rulers should be, he threatens, by <hi>Antithesis,</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pretenders,
in these severe words, which do also
imply a precept, and a direction how to deal with them
2 <hi>Sam 23. 6, 7. But they of Belial shall be all of them as
thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands,
but the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron &amp;
the staff of a spear, and they shall be utterly burnt with fire
in the same place.</hi> Let these words be understood as a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
against all the wicked in general, who ars to bequench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:41139:227"/>
as the fire of thorns; or particularly of the Promoters
of Antichrists Kingdom, in opposition to Christs, as some
Interpreters judge; it will not weaken but confirm my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
if Kings who are ringleaders of that gang be not
excepted. I know some do understand this of <hi>Rebells</hi> against
righteous Rulers: which though indeed it be a truth, that
they that are such should be so served, and roughly handled
with iron and the staff of a spear; yet it is not so consonant to
the scope &amp; connexion of this place, shewing the Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of righteous Rulers and of usurping Tyrants, making an
opposition between Rulers that are just ruling in the fear of
God, and those that are Rulers of <hi>Belial,</hi> promising bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
upon the Government of the one &amp; contempt &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the other, and shewing how both should be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
towards: Neither does it aggree with the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
where the supplement in our translation is redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant;
for it is not in the Hebrw, <hi>the sons of Belial,</hi> only <hi>They of
Belial,</hi> clearly relative to the <hi>Rulers</hi> of whom he was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before. And indeed the word <hi>Belial,</hi> in its Etymology
is not more applicable to any than to Tyrants; for it comes
from <hi>beli, non,</hi> and <hi>Hhall supra,</hi> because they will have
none above them, or from <hi>beli non</hi> and <hi>Hhol jugum,</hi> because
they cannot suffer a yoke, but cast away the yoke of Laws
and the yoke of Christ, saying, <hi>let us burst His bands</hi> &amp;c.
Nor is it alwayes aggreeable to truth, to understand it only
of Rebells against righteous Rulers, that they can never be
taken with hands: For as very rarely righteous Rulers have
any Rebells, to be the objects of their rigour &amp; rage; So
when there are any, discreet &amp; wise Rulers will find many
wayes to take &amp; touch them, and quash or quiet them.
But it is alwise true of Tyrants, for they can never be taken
with hands, neither in a friendly manner, taken by the
hand and transacted with in any bargain as other men, for
they that would do so will find them like pricking &amp; jag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
bryers, which a man cannot handle without hurt to
himself; Nor can they be any other way repressed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
or touched, but by hands fenced with iron, that
is, with the sword of necessity, or ax of Justice. And this
is insinuated as duty, so to endeavour to exstirpate &amp; era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:41139:227"/>
such <hi>thorns,</hi> as pester the Common-wealth: but if
it cannot be done, it must be duty &amp; wisdom both not to
medle with them, nor oune them, no more than <hi>Iotham,</hi>
who would not subject himself nor come under the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of the bastard <hi>bramble.</hi> I confess it is commonly taken
as a threatening of the Lords Judgement against these Sons
of <hi>Belial:</hi> And so it is. But it teacheth also what men are
called to, when they have to do with such, to wit, to take
the same course with them as they would to clear the
ground of thorns &amp; bryars. And that it is restricted to the
Lords immediate way of taking them off, is not credible:
For, it can have no tollerable sense to say, they shall be
thrust away because they cannot be taken with the <hi>Lords
hands:</hi> Neither is there need, that He should be <hi>fenced with
iron</hi> &amp;c. And let <hi>iron</hi> &amp;c. be taken tropically for the Lords
sword of vengeance; yet how can it be understood, that
He must be fenced there with? or that He will trust them
away, as a man must be fenced against thorns? What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
needs the Lord against Tyrants? It is only then intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible,
that the Lord in His righteous Judgement will
make use of men &amp; legal means, and of those who cannot
take them with hands, in His Judicial procedure against
them. Hence I argue, If Tyrants are to be dealt with as
thorns, that cannot be taken with hands, but to be thrust
away by violence, Then, when we are not in case to thrust
them away, we must let them alone, and not medle nor
make with them, and so must not oune them, for we
cannot oune them withount medling, and without being
pricked to our hurt: But the former is true: <hi>Ergo</hi>—Of
this same nature, another threatening confuting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Princes impunity, may be subjoined out of <hi>Psal.
82. 6, 7. I have said ye are Gods, and all of yow are Children of
the most High, but ye shall die like men &amp; fall as one of the Princes.</hi>
From which words, the learned Author of the <hi>History of
the Douglasses, Mr David Hume of Gods craft,</hi> in his discourse
upon <hi>Mr Craigs</hi> Sermon upon the words, doth strongly
prove, that the Scope is to beat off all Kings, Princes, &amp;
Rulers, from the conceit of impunity for their Tyrannical
Dominations; that they must not think to Domineer and
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:41139:228"/>
do what they list, and overturn the <hi>foundations</hi> or funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Laws of Kingdoms, because they are gods; as if
they were thereby incontrolable, and above all Law &amp;
punishment: no, they must know, that if they be guilty
of the same transgressions of the Law, as other Capital of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
they shall die like other men, &amp; fall as Princes
who have been formerly punished. It is not to be restrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a threatening of Mortality; for that is unavoidable,
whether they Judge justly or unjustly, and the fear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
usually hath litle efficacy to deter men from Crimes
punishable by Law: Neither can it be understood only of
the Lords immediate hand taking them away, exclusive
of mens legal punishment; for expresly they are threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to die like Common men, and to be lyable to the like
punishment with them: Now common men are not only
lyabl to the Lords immediate Judgement, but also to mens
punishment. Hence, if Tyrants and overturners of the
foundations of the earth, must be punished as other men,
then when they are such they cannot be looked upon as
righteous Rulers, for righteous Rulers must not be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished:
But the former is true: <hi>Ergo</hi>—According to
these Scriptures, which either express or imply a precept
to have no respect to Princes in Judgement when turning
Criminalls, we find examples of the peoples punishing
<hi>Amazia</hi> &amp;c. which is recorded without a challenge, and
likewise <hi>Athalia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. There is a Precept given to a humbled people, that
have groaned long under the yoke of Tyranny &amp; oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
enjoining them, as a proof of their sincerity in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
to bestir themselves in shaking off those evils they
had procured by their sin. <hi>Isai. 58. 6. Is not this the fast that
I have ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sen, to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy
burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every
yoke?</hi> which are all good works of Justice &amp; Mercy, and
more acceptable to God than high flown pretences of
humiliation, under a stupid submission; and hanging doun
the head as a bulrush. We see it then a duty to relieve the
oppressed, and to repress Tyranny, and break its yoke. If
it be <hi>Objected</hi> (1) That these are Spiritual bonds &amp; yokes,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:41139:228"/>
that are here commanded to be loosed &amp; broken; or if any
external be meant, they are only the yokes of their exactions
&amp; usuries. For <hi>Ans.</hi> I grant, that it is the great duty of a
people humbling themselves before the Lord, to <hi>break off
their sins by righteousness</hi> and <hi>their iniquity by shewing mercy to the
poor Dan.</hi> 4. 27. but that this is the only duty I deny; or
that this is the genuine &amp; only sense of this place, cannot
be proved, or approved by the Scope; which is, to press
them to those duties they omitted, whereby the poor
oppressed people of God might be freed from the yokes of
them that made them to houl, and to bring them to the
conviction of those sins for which the Lord was contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them, whereof this was one, that they <hi>exacted all
their Labours,</hi> or things wherewith others were grieved
(as the Margent reads) or suffered the poor to be oppressed.
(2) If it be alledged, that this is the duty proper to Rulers
to relieve the oppressed &amp;c. I <hi>Answer,</hi> It is so; but not
peculiar to them: yet most commonly they are the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors
themselves, and cast out the poor, which others
must take in to their houses. But the duty here is pressed
upon all the people, whose sins are here cryed out against
(<hi>vers.</hi> 1.) upon all who professed the service of God, &amp;
asked the ordinances of Justice (<hi>vers.</hi> 2) upon all who were
fasting &amp; humbling themselves, and complained they had
no success (<hi>vers.</hi> 3.) the reasons whereof the Lord discovers
(<hi>vers.</hi> 4. 5.) whereof this was one, that they did not loose
those bands, nor breake these yokes, nor relieved the
oppessed; And those works of Justice (<hi>vers.</hi> 6.) are pressed
upon the same grounds, that the works of mercy are
pressed upon (<hi>vers.</hi> 7.) sure these are not all nor only
Rulers. Hence I argue, If it be a duty to break every
yoke of oppression &amp; Tyranny, then it is a duty to come
out from under their subjection: But the former is true:
therefore aso the latter.</p>
               <p>3. In answer to that grand objection of the <hi>Iewes</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> I shew what litle weight or
force there is in it. And here I shall take an Argument
from that same Passage. The Lord commands His people
there, to desert &amp; disoune <hi>zedekiah</hi> who was the possessor
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:41139:229"/>
of the Government at present, and sayes, it was the <hi>way of
life to fall to the Chaldeans Ier.</hi> 21. 8, 9. which was a falling
away from the present King. Either this commanded sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> is an universal precept; or it is only
particular at that time. If it be universal, obliging people
to subject themselves to every Conqueror, then it is also
universal obliging people to renounce &amp; disoune every
Covenant-breaking tyrant, as here they were to fall away
from <hi>Zedekiah:</hi> If it be only particular, then the ouners of
of Tyranny have no advantage from this passage. And I
have advantage, so far as the ground of the precept is as
moral, as the reason of that punishment of <hi>zedekias,</hi> which
was his perfidie &amp; perjurie. Hence, if the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to disoune a King breaking Covenant, then at
least it is not insolent or unprecedented to do so: But here
the Lord hath commanded to disoune a King: <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> we may have many Confirmations of this truth,
from Scripture <hi>practices</hi> approven.</p>
               <p>1. I was but hinting before, how that after the death of
that brave Captain &amp; Judge <hi>Gideon,</hi> when <hi>Abimelech</hi> the
son of his whore, did first aspire into a Monarchy, which
he perswaded the silly <hi>Schechemites</hi> to consent to, by the

consuming both the usurping King and his traiterous

<hi>See Pool Synops. Critic.</hi> on the place <hi>Iud.</hi> 9. Here is one
express example of disouning a Tyrant &amp; Usurper.</p>
               <p>2. I shew before, how after the Period of that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi>
which the Lord had maintained &amp; managed for some
time in great mercy &amp; Majesty in &amp; over His people, they,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:41139:229"/>
itching after novelties and affecting to be neighbour-like,
rejected the Lord in desiring a King; And the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
it, gave them a King in His wrath (the true Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
&amp; only Sanction of Tyrannical Monarchy) when the
Characters of his Tyranny, presaged by <hi>Samuel,</hi> were veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in his aspiring into a great deal of absoluteness, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in his cruel persecuting of <hi>David;</hi> not only the 600
men that were <hi>Davids</hi> followers stood out in open oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to him, but in the end, being weary of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
many brave &amp; valiant men, whom the Spirit of
God commends &amp; describes very honourably, fell off
from <hi>Saul,</hi> even while he was actually Tyrannising, before
he was dead 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 1. &amp;c. They came to <hi>David</hi>
to <hi>Ziklag</hi> while he yet kept himself closs <hi>because of Saul the
son of Kish</hi> (N. B. now he is not honoured with the name
of King) they were armed with bows and could use both
the right hand &amp; the left. And of the <hi>Gadites,</hi> there sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
themselves unto <hi>David</hi> men of might fit for the battel,
that could handle shield &amp; buckler, whose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aces were as
the faces of lyons <hi>vers.</hi> 8. And the Spirit came upon <hi>Amasai</hi>
chief of the Captains, saying, <hi>Thine are we David &amp; on thy
side thow son of Iesse.</hi> Here was a formed Revolt from <hi>Saul</hi>
unto <hi>David</hi> before he was King, for after this he was made
King in <hi>Hebron,</hi> and there could not be two Kings at once.
Hence I argue, if people may separate themselves from
and take part with the Resister, against a Tyrant; then
they may disoune him (for if they oune him still to be the
Minister of God, they must not resist him <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2.)
But here is an example that many people did separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from <hi>Saul</hi> and took part with the Resister <hi>David:
Ergo</hi>—Here two of the first Monarchs of <hi>Israel</hi> were
disouned, <hi>Abimelech &amp; Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The first Hereditary Successor was likewise disoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as was hinted above likewise. The ten tribes offer to
Covenant with <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> in terms securing their Rights
&amp; Liberties. They desired nothing on the matter, but that
he would engage to rule over them according to the Law
of God; To which when he answered most Tyrannically,
and avowed he would Tyrannise over them, and oppress
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:41139:230"/>
them more than any of his Predicessors, they fell away from
him, and erected themselves into a new Common-wealth
1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 16. So when <hi>Israel</hi> saw that the King hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not unto them, they answered, <hi>what portion have we in
David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Iesse, to your
tents O Israel,</hi> now <hi>see to thine oun house David 2 Chron.</hi> 10. 16.
Now, however the event of this declared Revolt proved
sorrowful, when they and their new King made defection
unto Idolatry, yet if they had stated &amp; managed it right,
the Cause was good, justifyable, &amp; commendable. For
(1) We find nothing in all the Text condemning this (2)
On the Contrary its expressly said, the <hi>Cause was from the
Lord,</hi> that He might perform His saying which He spake
by <hi>Ahijah 1 King. 12. 15. 2 Chron.</hi> 10. 15. And (3) When
<hi>Rehoboam</hi> was preparing to pursue his pretended right, he
was reproved &amp; discharged by <hi>Shemajah, ye shall not go up nor
fight against your brethren, for this thing is from me 1 King.</hi> 12. 24.
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 4. (4) Whereas it is alledged by some, that
this was of God only by His providence, and not by His
Ordinance; the contrary will appear, if we consider, how
formally &amp; Covenant-wise the Lord gave ten tribes to
<hi>Ieroboam 1 King. 11. 35, 37, 38. I will take the Kingdom out
of his sons hand, and I will give it unto thee, even ten tribes;
And I will take thee, and thow shalt reign according to all
that thy soul desireth, and shall be King over Israel; And it
shall be, if thow wilt hearken unto all that I command thee,
and will walk in my wayes and do that which is right in my
sight, to keep my statutes &amp; my commandments, as David
my servant did, that I will be with thee &amp; build thee a
sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.</hi>
Where we see, the Kingdom was given unto him on the
same Terms &amp; conditions, that it was given to <hi>David.</hi> He
may indeed give Kingdoms to whom He wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
grant, as unto <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and others; but He
never gave them a Kingdom upon these Conditions, and
by way of Covenant, that does alwayes imply &amp; import
His Word, Warrant, &amp; ordinance (5) If we consider the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:41139:230"/>
Cause of the Revolt, we will find it very just: for after the
decease of the former King, they enter upon terms of a
Compact with the successor, upon a <hi>suspensive condition,</hi>
to engage into fealty &amp; Allegiance to him as subjects, if he
would give them security for their Liberties &amp; Priviledges.
A very Lawful, Laudable &amp; necessary transaction, founded
upon Moral equity, &amp; upon the fundamental Constitutions
of that Government, and suitable to the constant practice
of their Predicessors in their Covenanting with <hi>Saul</hi> &amp;
<hi>David.</hi> As for that Word 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 19. So Israel <hi>Rebelled</hi>
against the house of <hi>David:</hi> It is no more then in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
they <hi>fell away</hi> or <hi>revolted;</hi> And no more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
then <hi>Hezekiahs Rebellion 2 King. 18. 7. The Lord
was with him, and he Rebelled against the King of Assyria.</hi> That
was a good Rebellion. Hence, If it be Lawful for a part
of the people to shake off the King, refuse subjection to
him, and set up a new King of their oun, when he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to play the Tyrant, and rule them after his oun ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
power; then it is a duty, when he actually playes
the Tyrant, and by his absolute power overturns Laws &amp;
Religion, and claims by Law such a prerogative: But
the former is true: Ergo—See <hi>Ius Pepuli vindic. chap.</hi> 3.
<hi>Pag</hi> 52.</p>
               <p>4. This same <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> when he turned Tyrant &amp; Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,
was revolted from and deserted by the <hi>Priests</hi> &amp; the
<hi>Levites,</hi> and after them out of all the tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> by all
such as set their heart to seek the Lord God of <hi>Israel;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that King, degenerating into Tyranny &amp; Idolatry,
had put them from the exercise of their office &amp; Religion
(as our <hi>Charles</hi> did, and ordained him Priests for the Devils
&amp; for the Calves: So they returned to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by his administration of the Government, which
for a time was better then he promised, for three years he
walked in the wayes of <hi>David</hi> &amp; <hi>Salomon 2 Chron.</hi> 11. 13-17.
Hence I argue, If Idolatrous Tyrants may be
deserted, then they may be disouned; for when they desert
them, they disoune them abroad, in coming under another
Government; and if they may be disouned abroad, it is
the same duty at home, though may be not the same Policy
or Prudence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:41139:231"/>
5. Another example of the like nature we have in the
reign of <hi>Baasha,</hi> who succeeded to <hi>Nadab Ieroboams</hi> son,
whom he slew &amp; reigned in his stead (the same way that the
<hi>Duke</hi> came to the Throne) For he could not keep his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
within his Kingdom, but behoved to build <hi>Ramah,</hi>
that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to <hi>Asa.</hi>
King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> a good Prince, 1 <hi>King</hi> 15. 17. yet that
could not hinder them, but many strangers out of <hi>Ephraim</hi>
&amp; <hi>Manasseh</hi> &amp; <hi>Simeon</hi> fell to him in abundance, when they
saw that the Lord his God was with him 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 9.
Hence, If people may chuse another King, when they see
the Lord is with him, then they may disoune their Country
King, when they see the Devil is with him.</p>
               <p>6. When <hi>Jehoram</hi> the son of <hi>Ahab</hi> reigned over <hi>Israel,</hi>
we have an express example of <hi>Elisha's</hi> disouning him
2 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 14. 15. And <hi>Elisha</hi> said unto the King of <hi>Israel,
what have I to do with thee?</hi>—<hi>As the Lord of hosts liveth,
before whom I stand, surely were it not that I regard the presence of</hi>
Jehoshaphat <hi>the King of</hi> Judah, <hi>I would not look toward thee
nor see thee,</hi> Here he declares so much contempt of him,
and so litle regard, that he disdains him a look. And if he
would not regard him, nor give him honour, then he did
not oune him as King; for all Kings are to be honoured,
that are ouned to be Kings really. It may be alledged by
some: that <hi>Elisha</hi> was an extraordinary man, and this was
an extraordinary action, and therefore not imitable. I
shall grant it so far extraordinary, that it is not Usual to
carry so to persons of that figure, and that indeed there are
few <hi>Elisha's</hi> now, not only for his Prophetick Spirit which
now is ceased, but even in respect of his Gracious Spirit of
zeal, which in a great measure is now extinguished: He
was indeed an extraordinary man, and this Action did
demonstrate much of the Spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> to have been
abiding with him. But that this was unimitable, these
reasons induce me to deny. (1) Prophets were subject to
Kings as well as others, as <hi>Nathan</hi> was to <hi>David</hi> (1 <hi>King.</hi>
1. 32, 33.) every soul must be subject to the higher powers
that are of God (2) All the Actions of Prophets were not
extraordinary, nor did they every thing by extraordinary
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:41139:231"/>
inspiration; that was peculiar to Christ, that He could
Prophecy &amp; do extraordinary acts when He pleased, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
He received <hi>the Spirit not by measure,</hi> and it <hi>rested</hi>
upon Him. (3) this particular Action &amp; carriage was before
he called for the <hi>Minstrel,</hi> and before the hand of the Lord
came upon him <hi>vers. 15. Ergo</hi> this was not by inspiration.
(4) The ground of this was Moral &amp; Ordinary, for hereby
he only shewed himself to be a person fit to abide in the
Lords Tabernacle, and an upright walker in whose eyes
<hi>a vile person is contemned, Psal.</hi> 15. 4. and a just man, to
whom the <hi>unjust is an abomination Prov.</hi> 29. 27. What further
can be aledged against this instance, I see not. And I need
draw no Argument by Consequence, it is so plain.</p>
               <p>7. This same <hi>Jehoram,</hi> after many signal demonstrations
of the power of God exerted in the Ministry of His Servant
<hi>Elisha,</hi> which sometimes did extort his acknowledgment
and made him call the Prophet his father, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 21. yet
when in the strait siege of <hi>Samaria</hi> he was plagued with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
for his Idolatry, in so much that the pitiful Mothers
were made to eat their oun tender Children; became so
insolent a Tyrant, that being incensed into a madness of
outragious malice against the Prophet <hi>Elisah,</hi> that he sware,
<hi>God do so to him &amp; more also if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat
should stand on him that day,</hi> accordingly he sent a messenger
to execute it. But the Prophet, from a Principle of Nature
&amp; Reason &amp; Law, as well as Grace, and by the Spirit of
a man as well as of a Prophet, stood upon his defence, and
encouraged those that were with him to keep out the house
against him, saying, <hi>See ye how this son of a Murderer</hi> (a
proper style for such a Monster of a King) <hi>hath sent to take
away mine head ... 2 King.</hi> 6. 32. This is a strong Argument
for self defence, but I improve it thus: If Tyrants may
be opposed as sons of Murderers, &amp; Murderers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and no otherwise to be accounted then under such
a vile Character, then can they not be ouned as Kings:
But here is an example for the first: <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
               <p>8. This mans brother in Law, of the same name,
<hi>Iehoram</hi> the son of <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> who had the Daughter of
<hi>Ahab</hi> to wife, and therefore walked in the way of the
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:41139:232"/>
house of <hi>Ahab,</hi> gives us another instance. He turned Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
&amp; Tyrant, and <hi>Abimelech</hi>-like (or if yow will York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like)
slew his brethren, and diverse also of the Princes of
<hi>Israel;</hi> Moreover he made high places in the Mountains of
<hi>Iudah,</hi> and caused the Inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to commit
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ornication, and compelled <hi>Iudah</hi> thereto: For which
Cause of his intollerable insolency in wickedness, <hi>Libnah</hi>
one of the Cities of Priests in <hi>Iudah, Revolted from him
2 King. 8. 22. because he had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers
2 Chron.</hi> 21. 10. which was the motive &amp; impulsive Cause
of their disouning him, and is not to be detorted to that
restricted Cavil of Royalists, understanding it only as the
Meritorous or procuring Cause of his punishment &amp; loss
sustained thereby; for it is not so said of the <hi>Edomites</hi> who
revolted at the same time, as it is mentioned in another
Paragraph; Neither of the <hi>Philistims</hi> &amp; <hi>Arabians</hi> &amp; <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi>
whose spirit the Lord stirred up against him; These
were also a punishment to him: Nor would it found very
suitably to be said, that they opposed him <hi>because he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
the Lord God of his fathers:</hi> for that would insinuate
some influence that his Apostasie had on them, as certainly
it could not but have on the Lords Priests that dwelt in <hi>Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi>
who understood by the Law of God, what was their
duty to do with Intycers or Drawers or Drivers to Idolatry:
And when they were not in capacity to execute the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord, this was the least they could do, to <hi>Revolt.</hi>
Here then is an example of a Peoples Revolt from a Prince,
and disouning Allegiance to him because of Apostasie &amp;
Tyranny.</p>
               <p>9. In this Kingdom of <hi>Iudah,</hi> after long experience of a
Succession of Hereditary Tyranny in many wicked Kings,
the people after they had long smarted for their lazie Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yaltie
in their stupid abandoning, forgetting, &amp; foregoing
this Priviledge of disouning Tyrants, and keeping them in
order, began at length to bestir themselves in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to recover their lost Liberties, and repress Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
Insolencies on several occasions. Wherein, though
sometimes there were extravagances, when Circumstances
did mar the Justice of the Action, and some did go beyond
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:41139:232"/>
their sphere in tumultuary precipitations; yet upon the
matter it was Justice, and in conformity to a Moral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
One impregnable witness of this we have, in the
pious Plot of <hi>Iehojada</hi> the Priest, who being but a Subject,
as all Priests were (as the deposition of <hi>Abiathar</hi> by King
<hi>Solomon 1 King.</hi> 2. 27. proveth) entered into an Association
with the inferior Rulers, to choose &amp; make a new King;
and notwithstanding that the Idolatress &amp; She-Tyrant
<hi>Athaliab,</hi> who had the Possession of the Government, cried
<hi>Treason, Treason</hi> at the fact, they had her forth without the
ranges, &amp; <hi>slew her 2 King.</hi> 11. 14-16. This was according
to the Law <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. And approven by all Interpreters,
even <hi>Mr Pool in his Synopsis Critic.</hi> though <hi>alias</hi> Superlatively
Loyal, yet approves of this, and sayes, she was an incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Idolatress, and therefore deserved to be deposed by
the Nobles of the Kingdom: And quotes <hi>Grotius in Loc.</hi>
saying [she reigned by meer force &amp; no right, and therefore
justly repressed by force, for the Hebrewes were to have
<hi>Brethren</hi> for their Kings but not <hi>Sisters, Deut.</hi> 17. 15.] Hence
if Tyrants may be forcibly repressed, then may they peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
be disouned: But this example comfirms that: <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
               <p>10. The Sacred History proceeds in the Relation, how
this same <hi>Joash,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> after he degenerated
into Murdering Tyranny, was slain by <hi>Jozachar</hi> &amp; <hi>Jehozabad
2 King.</hi> 12. 20, 21. But that was by his oun Servants in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Assassination; therefore they are called <hi>Murderers</hi> by
<hi>Amaziah</hi> his Son 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 5, 6. but upon the matter it
was the Justice of God, which he deserved (if it had been
duely execute) for the blood of the Sone of <hi>Jehojada</hi> the
Priest 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 25. So <hi>Amon</hi> the Son of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> for
his walking in the way of his Father in Idolatry &amp; Tyranny,
and forsaking the Lord God of his Fathers, was slain in his
oun house by his Servants, who conspired against him; But
though this was Justice also upon the matter, and consonant
to the Command for punishing Idolaters &amp; Murderers,
yet because defective in the manner, and done by them
that tooke too much upon them, in a perfidious way of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Assassination &amp; Conspiracy, therefore the People of
the Land punished them for it 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 23. 24. But the
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:41139:233"/>
repressing &amp; punishing of <hi>Amaziah</hi> is a more unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
instance. The people made a Conspiracy against him
in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and he fled to <hi>Lachish,</hi> but they sent after him
to <hi>Lachish and slew him there 2 King.</hi> 14. 19. after the time
that he turned away from following the Lord 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.
27. Which was according to the Command <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.
which hath no exception of Kings in it. This Action was
not questioned either by the people, or his Successor, as
the formentioned Conspiracies were. His son <hi>Uzziah</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
who did right &amp; consulted the Lord (2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
26. 4, 5.) did not resent nor revenge his Fathers death;
which certainly he would have done, by advice of <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi>
who had understanding in the visions of God, if it had
been a transgression. The famous &amp; faithful <hi>Mr Knox</hi> doth
clear this passage beyond Contradiction in his conference
with <hi>Lithingtoun</hi> Hence I take an Argument <hi>a fortiori.</hi> If
people may conspire &amp; concur in executing Judgement
upon their King turning Idolater &amp; Tyrant; Then much
more may they Revolt from him: But this example clears
the Antecedent, Ergo.</p>
               <p>11. The same power &amp; priviledge of peoples punishing
their Princes, was exemplified in the Successor of him last
mentioned, to wit, in <hi>Uzziah</hi> the son of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Azariah 2 King.</hi> 15. when he degenerated into the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of arrogating a Supremacy, in causes Ecclesiast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
&amp; Sacred as well as Civil, his heart was lifted up to his
destruction, for he transgressed against the Lord his God,
and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn Incense.
In which Usurpation he was resisted by <hi>Azariah</hi> the Priest,
and with him fourscore Priests of the Lord that were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
men, who withstood him, and told him it did not
appertain to him to take upon him so much, and bade him
go out of the Sanctuary, or else it should not be for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Which indeed he stomacked at as an affront, to
be controled &amp; resisted; but in thinking to resent it he was
plagued of the Lord with leprosie; which the Priests look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon, they thrust him out from thence: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
sequestred him from all Supremacy, both that which
he had before in things Civil, and that which he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:41139:233"/>
in matters Sacred; for he was made to dwell in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
house, being a leper, (the Law including (&amp; here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
upon) the King as well as the beggar) and to resign the
Government into his son <hi>Jothams</hi> hands 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 16-21.
Where it appears he was not only <hi>excommunicated</hi> by a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
punishment, but also <hi>deposed</hi> Judicially. Whether
he voluntarly dimited or not, it is to no purpose to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend:
its evident, that by the Law of God, the actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of his power was removed, whether with his will or
against it, it is all one; And that he was punished both by
God and by men is undeniable. Yea in this, his punishment
was very gentle, and far short of the Severity of the Law;
for by the Law he should have been put to death, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling
with these holy things, interdicted to all but to
the Priests under pain of death <hi>Numb. 3. 10. Numb.</hi> 18. 7.
<hi>The stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death:</hi> All were
strangers that were not Priests. Whence I argue, If a
Prince, for his Usurpation beyond his line in things Sacred,
may by the Priests be excommunicated, and by the people
deposed; then may a Prince, not only Usurping a Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
(as Charles did) but an absolute power of overturning all
things Sacred &amp; Civil (as James doeth) &amp; oppressing his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in all their Liberties, be disouned, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> for that is
less than deposing or dethroning: But this Example clears
the Antecedent: Ergo—<hi>See Knox discourse to Lethingtoun:
Lex Rex Quest. 44. §. 15. pag. 461. Ius popul. chap. 3. pag.</hi> 56.</p>
               <p>12. What if I should adduce the Example of a Kings <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>
against, and Revolt from a Superior King, to whom
he &amp; his Fathers both acknowledged themselves subject?
Surely our Royalists and Loyalists would not condemn
this; and yet in justifying it, they should condemn their
beloved principle of uncontroled subjection to uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable
Soveraigns possessing the Government. <hi>Ahaz</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Servant to the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarch 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 7. yet
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> his son, when the Lord was with him, and he
prospered—<hi>Rebelled against the King of Assyria and he serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him not 2 King. 18. 7. Hezekiah</hi> was indeed a King: but
he was not <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> King; he acknowledges himself
his vassal, and that he offended in disouning him <hi>vers.</hi> 14.
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:41139:234"/>
which certainly was his sin against the Lord, to make such
an acknowledgment: for if his Fathers transaction with the
<hi>Assyrian</hi> was sin, then it was duty to break the yoke; if
the Lord was with him in that rebellion, then it was his sin
to acknowledge it to be his offence; And to make good
this ackowledgment, it was certainly his sin to commit
Sacriledge in robbing the House of God, to satisfie that
Tyrant. By way of Supplement, I shall adde that instance
of repressing a mad &amp; furious Tyrant, which all will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to be Lawful. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was both strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
of God with madness, and for that was depelled from
the Kingdom, according to the heavenly Oracle, <hi>The
Kingdom is departed from thee and they shall drive thee from men,
Dan.</hi> 4. 31-33. <hi>Calvin</hi> sayes upon the place, he was
ejected as usually is done to Tyrants, by the Combination
of the nobles &amp; people, <hi>Pool Synopsis Critic. in Locum.</hi> Thus
he was unkinged for a time, both by the just Judgement of
God, and by the intermediation of the just Judgement of
men; and could not be ouned to be King at that time, when
his nails were like birds Clawes, and he could not tell his
oun fingers: They could not oune him to be the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
then of so many Kingdoms, when he could not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
himself. Hence, though this is an instance of Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,
yet because they acted upon a rational ground, it
may be argued: If Kings, because of Natural madness
when they cannot govern themselves, may not be ouned;
Then also because of Moral madness, when they will not
govern but to the destruction of Kingdoms, may not be
ouned: But the former is true: Therefore also the Latter.
The same reason against the Government of Asses, will
also militate against the Government of Tygers, the first
is more eligible then the last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This may be confirmed from Several <hi>promises</hi> in
Scripture.</p>
               <p>1. There are many Gracious &amp; precious promises of
<hi>Reformation of the Magistracy,</hi> and Restitution of good Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
as a great blessing from God to Mankind and to the
Church <hi>Isai, 1. 26. I will restore thy Iudges as at the first, and
thy Counsellors as at the begining, afterwrrd tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> shalt he called
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:41139:234"/>
the City of righteousness.</hi> If Judges must first be restored before
the City can be a City of righteousness, then they must be
restored before we can oune the Government thereof: for
that Government under which it cannot be a City of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
cannot be ouned: since it is no Government
but a Rebellion &amp; Combination of Thieves, see <hi>vers.</hi> 23.
I do not here restrict the promise, as it is a Prophecy, to
its exact fulfillment, as if no Government were to be ouned
but what answers this promise, of the restitution of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
order of Magistrats; but I plead, that when the
Princes are rebellious &amp; Companions of Thieves, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is not to be ouned, till Judges be so far restored,
as to reduce righteousness in some measure, which cannot
be under Tyranny. And in the general I may plead, that
none is to be ouned as a Magistrate but who some way is
found in a promise; for there is no Ordinance of God, no
duty, no blessing, no good thing, either to be done or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
but what is in a promise: but Tyranny, or ouning
of Tyrants, or subjection to Usurpers, is not nor cannot
be in a promise. We have many other promises about Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
as that the Lord will be for <hi>a Spirit of Iudgement to
him that sitteth in Iudgement, Isai.</hi> 28. 6. A Tyrant cannot
be capable of this happiness, nor we under Tyranny, nor
any while they oune them. Kings shall be the Churches
<hi>nursing Fathers</hi> and their Queens her nursing Mothers <hi>Isai.</hi>
49. 23. Kings are not alwayes so, but all Kings to be ouned
are such as can be so, at least they are never to be ouned
when they turn destroyers of what they should nourish: But
Tyrants can never be Nourishers. It is promised to the
Lords people, if they will hearken diligently unto the Lord,
and keep the Sabbath, then shall there enter into their gates
Kings &amp; Princes <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 24, 25. And if they will execute
Judgement &amp; righteousness, and deliver the spoyled out of
the hand of the oppressor &amp;c. they shall obtain the same
blessing <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 3, 4. But it is never promised, neither doth
it ever come to pass in Providence, that these duties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
Tyrants. There are many other promises to the
same purpose, from whence may be concluded, the Lord
will not alwayes leave His people to houl under ineluctable
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:41139:235"/>
Tyranny, but will accomplish their deliverance in His oun
time &amp; way, though we are not to look to Miracles.
Whence I argue. 1. Since all the Ordinances of God, &amp;
Rulers in a special manner, are appointed &amp; promised as
blessings, these cannot be ouned for His Ordinance, which
are not Blessings but Curses. 2. That which would vacate
&amp; evacuate all the promises of Magistracy, cannot be a
Doctrine of God: But this that obliges to oune Tyrants &amp;
Usurpers, as long as they are up, would vacate &amp; evacuate
all these promises of Magistracy: For except the Lord
work Miracles (which are not in the promise) and do all
without means, they cannot be accomplished. For if any
means be used, they must be such as will infer disouning of
Tyrants; for Magistrates cannot be restored except Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
be removed, and whatever way they be removed
without Miracles, by others or their oun Subjects, they
must still be disouned, and that before they be removed;
for if they be to be ouned before, their removal, if they exist,
cannot make them to be disouned: dispossession cannot
take away their right, if they have it before.</p>
               <p>2. There are many promises of <hi>breaking the yoke</hi> of Tyrants
Isai. 10. 27. <hi>His burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder
and his yoke from off thy neck.</hi> And in that promise of the
Churches deliverance &amp; enlargment, wherein they are
Prophetically urged &amp; stirred up to some activity in coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
with the providence, <hi>Isai. 52. 1, 2. they are called to
awake &amp; put on strength &amp; their beautiful garments</hi>—and <hi>to
shake themselves from the dust</hi>—and <hi>to rise and loose themselves
from the bands of their neck,</hi> that were captives. Here is not
only a promise of deliverance, or a ground of encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
what the Church may expect, but a promise of &amp;
direction for their being active in delivering themselves, as
men, from the encroachments that were made on their
humane Liberties, that they should loose themselves from
these bands; Whose bands? from their bands that ruled
over them, and made them to houl, and the Lords Name
to be blasphemed (<hi>vers.</hi> 5.) Here's a promise of breaking the
bands of Rulers, by them who houled under their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
And it also includes a precept, that people should
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:41139:235"/>
not stay any longer under these yokes, than they can shake
them off or slip from under them. Hence we see we are
not to lie stupidly sleeping, or sinking in the Ditch, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the accomplishment of the promise of Deliverance,
but are to endeavour actively, in dependence upon the
Lords Assistance, to deliver our selves. Hence we may
argue. 1. A promise by way of Command, that a people
under bands of oppressing Rulers shall rouse themselves up
to loose themselves from them, implies &amp; infers a promise
&amp; a duty of disouning those Rulers (for otherwise they
cannot be loosed from their subjection.) But here is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
by way of Command, that a people under bands of
oppressing Rulers shall rouse themselves up to loose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from them: <hi>Ergo</hi>—2. If the removal of Tyranny &amp;
Usurpation be promised as a blessing, then those can never
be ouned to be the Ordinance of God; for the removal of
that can never be a blessing: But in these promises we see,
the removal of those is promised as a blessing: Therefore
they can never be ouned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To the same purpose we may cite some <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings,</hi>
that will confirm the same Truth.</p>
               <p>1. There are many Threatenings against Tyrants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
There are two mentioned <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. that seem patly
to quadrate, and near of a piece, with our Misrulers; both
because of the demerit of the Threatening, and the likeness
of the Judgement Threatened. The ground of it was <hi>build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their house by unrighteousness and their chambers by wrong</hi> vers.
13. And severally they are Threatened: <hi>Iehojakim with the
burial of an Ass unlamented vers. 18, 19. Coniah</hi> with a life
without prosperity, and a death without issue to succeed
<hi>vers.</hi> 30. The first of these is verified in the Elder of our
Royal Brothers, the last is like to be of both. But that
which I take notice of is, first, the demerit, building their
house by unrighteousness, on which <hi>Whitehall</hi> is built with
a witness: and particularly it is noted of <hi>Iehojakim,</hi> as his
Crimson sin (to which his Son <hi>Iehojakim</hi> or <hi>Coniah</hi> served
himself heir) that he <hi>burnt Ieremia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Roll,</hi> or Causes of wrath;
So did our Dominators burn the Causes of wrath (a book
written by the Commission of the General Assembly) and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:41139:236"/>
the Covenants. Then I note these words <hi>vers. 15. Shalt
thow reign because thow closest thy self in Cedar &amp;c.</hi> It is certainly
not fit for us to say, <hi>he shall reign,</hi> of whom the Lord sayes,
<hi>he shall not reign:</hi> but when we oune the Authority of those
whom the Lord threatens they shall not reign, we say,
they shall reign: for we say, they have a rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t to reign, and
oune our selves obliged to do all that is required in our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
to perpetuate their reign. There is a terrible
Threatening against <hi>Zedekiah Ezek.</hi> 20. 25-27. <hi>Thow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane</hi>
(or as some translate it; <hi>Thow worthy to be killed, Pool.
Synops. Critic. in Locum.) wicked Prince of Israel</hi>—Thus
saith the Lord God, <hi>Remove the Diadem, take off the Crown,
this shall not be the same, exalt him that is low, and abase
him that is high, I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, and
it shall be no more untill he come whose right it is, and I will
give it him.</hi> Than which nothing can be more applicable to
our Princes, who are <hi>profane,</hi> and the patterns &amp; patrons
of it, whose Diadem the Lord will remove; and if He
threaten it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wo to them that contribute to hold it on. We
see here, a profane &amp; wicked Prince threatened to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
must not be ouned, because he hath no right: But
our Excommunicate Tyrant, is a profane &amp; wicked Prince
threatened to be overturned: <hi>Ergo</hi>—There is another
dreadful Threatening against Tyrants <hi>Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s 4. 1, 2. Hear
this word ye Kine of Bashan, which oppress the poor, which

                     </gap>, that He will
take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fish hooks.</hi>
Shall we oune these, against whom the Lord hath engaged
His Holiness by Oath so solemnly, that He will fish them
with hooks? We may fear if there be such a tye as Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
between them and us, that that same hook which
fishes them may also catch us; as it is said of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his
subjects, when he is hooked, then his <hi>fish stick unto his scales,</hi>
and he &amp; they are left in the wilderness <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29. 4, 5. that is
as <hi>Grotius</hi> expounds it, whoever are of his Community shall
be consorts in his Calamity, <hi>Pool Critic. in Locum.</hi> If we
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:41139:236"/>
then oune them we must be of their Community, and so
partake of their Judgements.</p>
               <p>2. There are many Threatenings against illimited <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie,</hi>
and those who had more of that than Religion: for
this <hi>Ephraim</hi> was broken in Judgment, <hi>because he willingly
walked after the Commandment Hos.</hi> 5. 11. And because the
Statutes of <hi>Omri</hi> were kept, and the works of the house of
<hi>Ahab,</hi> therefore the Lord threatens to make them a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
<hi>Mic.</hi> 6. ult. And among other Threatenings against
the men of such universal Loyaltie, that is notable <hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 3.
<hi>Now ye shall say, we have no King, because we feared not the Lord,
what then should a King do to us?</hi> It is the just punishment of
wicked Loyalty, that prefers the fear &amp; favour of Kings to
the fear &amp; favour of God, that at length they are brought to
that pass, that either they have no Kings at all to look to,
or else they have such of whom it may be said, they are no
Kings in effect, for they cannot act the part of Kings to
them that trust in them. Hence. 1. If to have really no
Kings be a punishment, then such Kings as are a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot be ouned to be Kings; for to have them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a punishment, if the want of them be a punishment.
2. If those that have the name of Kings, that can do no
good, be no Kings; Then Tyrants that can do no good
but a great deal of hurt, must be reckoned no Kings also:
But here its threatened, people that had Kings, that had
the name but could do no good, should reckon they had
no Kings: Therefore much more may Tyrants be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to be no Kings, who can do no good but a great deal
of hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> This Truth is confirmed from Scripture <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi>
Whereof there are many against Tyrants, none for
them. Hence we argue, If we are not to pray for Tyrants
then we are not to oune them; for we are to pray for all
that are in Authority 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 2. 2, But we are not to pray for
Tyrants: <hi>Ergo</hi> we are not to oune them. The <hi>Minor</hi> now
must be proved. And this leads me to another subordinate
Question, which hath also been a head of suffering to some
serious Seekers of God in our Land of late.</p>
               <p>The profane Emissaries of this and the late Tyrant, sent
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:41139:237"/>
out with bloody Commissions to hunt after the Lords
hidden Ones, in order to murder all whom they might
meet with, that made Conscience of adhering to every
part of the present Testimony; among other trapping
Questions to discover their prey, they used to put this to
them as a discriminating <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> and Tessera of ouning
the present Tyranny, <hi>will yow say, God save the King?</hi> And
for refusing this, many have been cruelly murdered in the
Fields; And many before their bloody Judicatories, have
for this been arraigned &amp; condemned, &amp; executed to the
death. Wherefore to this somewhat must be said. 1. By
way of Concession. 2. By way of Vindication, of Scrupling
it and Suffering upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> In the General, it will be necessary to premit by
way of <hi>Concession.</hi> 1. It is duty to pray, supplicate, &amp; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<hi>for all men 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 1. not Collectively considered,
nor Distributively for every one universally without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
but indefinitely &amp; indiscriminately, <hi>pro generibus
singulorum</hi> for all sorts &amp; sexes, of whatsoever Nation or
Religion, <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Gentile, Christian</hi> or <hi>Infidel,</hi> not excluding
any for these distinctions: And not only so, but <hi>pro singulis
generum</hi> also Conditionally, if they be among those <hi>all</hi>
whom the Lord will have to be <hi>saved vers.</hi> 4. If they be
among those <hi>all</hi> for whom the Mediator gave himself a
<hi>ransome</hi> to be testified in due time <hi>vers.</hi> 5, 6. If they have not
sinned <hi>the sin unto death,</hi> for which we are not bidden pray
1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. 16. Which, because we know not particularly
who are guilty of it, Charity will oblige us to take into our
Prayers many that may never be the better of them; Yet it
is necessary that we pray <hi>in Faith,</hi> for what, or whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we pray; at least, if I may so call it, we must have a
<hi>negative Faith,</hi> a belief that they have not sinned that sin
unto death; which we cannot have of all, there being some
whose demonstrations of desperate displayes of affronted
wickedness, and hatred of Godliness, may give ground to
doubt of it, as Christians had of <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostate.</hi> 2. We
are obliged to love our Enemies, to Bless them that Curse
us, to do good to them that hate us, to <hi>pray for them that
despitefully use &amp; persecute us Math.</hi> 5. 44. Accordingly Our
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:41139:237"/>
Master, who commanded this, did give us a Pattern to
imitate, when He prayed, <hi>Father forgive them for they know
not what they do Luk.</hi> 23. 34. And His faithful Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi>
prayed for his Murderers, <hi>Lord lay not this sin to their charge,
Act.</hi> 7. ult. We are to pity them, and not to seek venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
against them, for any injuries they can do to us. Yet,
as this doth not interfere with a holy &amp; zealous Appeal to
God, for righting &amp; resenting &amp; requiting the wrongs done
to us, that He may vindicate us &amp; our Cause, and make
them repent of their injuries done to us, to the Glory of
God, and Conviction of Onlookers, and Confusion of
themselves, which may well consist with Mercy to their
Souls: So all we can pray for them in their opposition to
us, is in order to their repentance, but never for their
prosperity in that Course. And we may well imitate, even
against our enemies, that prayer of <hi>Zecharia's,</hi> The <hi>Lord
look upon it and require it 2 Chron.</hi> 24. 22. But we are never
to pray for <hi>Christs stated Enemies,</hi> as to the bulk of them, and
under that formality <hi>as</hi> His Enemies: for we must not love
them that hate the Lord 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 2. but <hi>hate them,</hi> and
hate them with a <hi>perfect hatred, Psâl.</hi> 139. 21, 22. We are
to pray for the Elect among them, but only to the end they
may escape the vengeance, which we are obliged to pray
for against them. 3. We are not to <hi>exsecrate</hi> our enemies, or
use imprecations against any, out of blind zeal, or the
passionate or revengefull motions of our oun hearts: Our
Lord rebuked His Disciples for such preposterous zeal <hi>Luk.
9. 55. Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of.</hi> But against
the Stated &amp; Declared Enemies of Christ, <hi>as such</hi> &amp; <hi>while
such,</hi> we may well take a pattern from the imprecatory
Prayers of the Saints recorded in Scripture; such as do not
peremptorly determine about the eternal State of particular
persons: which determinations, except we be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly
acted by the same Spirit, whose Dictates these are,
are not to be imitated by us. We find several sorts of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations
in the Psalms, &amp; other Scriptures: Some are
imitable, some not: Some are <hi>Propheticall</hi> having the force
of a Prophecy, as <hi>Davids Psal. 35. 4. Let them be confounded
—that seek after my Soul—Let Destruction come upon him
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:41139:238"/>
Psal. 55. 15. Let them go doun quick to hell.</hi> And <hi>Ieremiah chap.
17. 18. Let them be confounded that persecute me—destroy them
with double destruction.</hi> Without this Prophetical Spirit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
the application of these threatenings to particular
persons, we may not imitate this peremptoriness. Some
are <hi>Typical</hi> of Christs Mediatory devoting His Enemies to
destruction; who as He interceeds for His friends, so by
virtue of the same Merits (by them trampled upon) He
pleads for vengeance against His enemies: Which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory
vengeance, is the most dreadful of all vengeances
(<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29.) So also <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. He whose ears were opened,
and who said <hi>lo I come—vers.</hi> 6. 7. that is Christ) does
imprecate shame &amp; Confusion &amp; desolation <hi>vers.</hi> 14. 15. As
also <hi>Psal.</hi> 109. the Psalmist personates Christ, complaining
of &amp; imprecating against His enemies, particularly <hi>Iudas</hi>
the Traitor <hi>vers.</hi> 8. It must be dreadful to be under the dint
of the Mediators Imprecations; And also dreadful to clash
with Him in His Intercessions, that is, to apprecate for
them against whom He imprecates, or pray for them against
whom He intercedes. But some Imprecatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s against the
enemies of God, are imitable such as proceed from pure
<hi>zeal</hi> for God, and the Spirit of Prayer, as that <hi>Psal.</hi> 109.
ult. <hi>Put them in fear O Lord that the Nations may know themselves
to be but men. Psal.</hi> 83. 16.—<hi>fill their faces with shame that
they may seek thy Name.</hi> This is to be imitated in general
against all the enemies of God <hi>Psal 129. 5. Let them all be
confounded that hate Zion;</hi> without condescending on parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
persons, except obviously &amp; not odiously desperate,
&amp; presumptively Christs implacable Enemies. 4. Touching
Magistrates it is a great duty to pray, that God would give
us Magistrates, as He hath promised for the Comfort of
His Church <hi>Isai. 1. 26. Isai. 49. 2. Ier.</hi> 30. 21. Promises
should be motives &amp; foments of Prayer. We ought to pray
against Anarchy as a Plague, and with all earnestness beg
of God, that the mercy of Magistracy may aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n be known
in <hi>Brittain,</hi> of which it hath been long deprived. 5. And
when we have them, it is a necessary Duty to pray for them;
<hi>for Kings and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a
quiet &amp; peaceable life in all Godliness &amp; honesty 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 2.
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:41139:238"/>
Where it is specified, what sort we should pray for, and
to what end. As we are not to pray for all men absolutely;
for some, as they are declared to be out of the precincts of
of Christs Mediation, so they must be out of our Prayers:
So there may be some in actual Rule, that may be excepted
out of the verge of the Christians Prayers, as was said of
<hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostate.</hi> But he that is a Magistrate indeed, and
in Authority, the subjects are to pray and to give thanks for
him, not as a man meerly, but as a Magistrate. Yea
though they be Heathen Magistrates, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 6. 10. We
may pray for all in Authority, two wayes; As Men, &amp; as
Kings. As Men, we may pray for their Salvation, or
Conversion, or taking them out of the way, if they be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Christs Kingdom, according as they are stated; and
upon Condition, <hi>if it be possible,</hi> and if they belong to the
Election of Grace. Though for such as are opposites to
the coming of Christs Kingdom, as it is a contradiction to
the second petition of the Lords Prayer [<hi>Thy Kingdom come</hi>]
So in the experience of the most eminent wrestlers, they
have found less faith &amp; less encouragement in praying for
them, than for any other sort of men. It is rare that ever
any could find their hands, in praying for the Conversion
of our Rulers. And though we pray that the Lord would
convince them, yea &amp; confound them, in mercy to their
souls; yet this must never be wanting in our Prayers for
Tyrants, as men, that God would bring them doun, and
cause Justice overtake them, that so God may be Glorified,
and the Nation eased of such a burden. But if we pray for
them as Kings, then they must be such by Gods approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not meer possessory Occupants, to whom we
owe no such respect nor duty. For whatever the <hi>Hobbists,</hi>
and the time-serving Casuists of our day, and even many
good men (though wofully laxe in this point) homolating
both Doctrinally &amp; Practically their heathenish notions, say
to the contrary; I hope it be in some measure made out,
that Tyrants are no more the Ordinance of God, nor to be
ouned as His Ministers &amp; Vicegerents, than the Devil the
Prince of this World for the Lords Anointed, or <hi>Baals</hi>
Priests for true Ministers. If we pray for them as Kings,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:41139:239"/>
we must pray for their peace, prosperity, &amp; preservation,
that their Government may be blessed with success, their
designs not frustrated, nor their desires disappointed. This
we cannot pray for Tyrants. 6. Albeit we may pray for the
Peace of the Nation, and for the Government thereof, so
far as it may conduce to our oun &amp; the Churches Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that we may live a peaceable &amp; Godly life under it; yet
this cannot be extended to the peace of Tyrants, for whom
the best Prayer that we can bestow is, that the Lord would
bridle &amp; restrain them, that they may not m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

City, whither soever I have caused yow to be carried Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and pray unto the Lord for it, for in the peace thereof
shall yow have peace,</hi> is apparent to have been but of a
temporary nature, upon occasion of their Captivity there,
until the 70 years should be expired, having it also declared
by God, that their oun peace was bound up in that of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons:</hi>
For after that time they are taught the contrary car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
towards that City, to depart, and pray against it, and
exult &amp; rejoice in its ruine; <hi>O Daughter of Babylon, happy
shall he be that rewardeth thee as thow hast served us, that
dasheth thy litle ones against the Stones, Psal.</hi> 137. 8, 9.

to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of
Zion say, and my blood be upon Chaldea, shall Ierusalem say.</hi>
Certainly this is not the season to seek the Peace of Misti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<hi>Babylon,</hi> but to pray for the destruction thereof and all
its supporters: Which we cannot do, if we pray for them
that improve, imploy, &amp; apply all their power to support
it, lest we pray contradictions; as many do, who pray
against <hi>Babels</hi> brats and yet pray for the King: but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
is this, that Nonsensical Prayers will do litle good,
litle hurt, but to themselves that pray them.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To <hi>vindicate</hi> the Scruplers &amp; Refusers of such
Compelled &amp; extorted Devotion, in praying for Tyrants,
I shall offer these Considerations.</p>

1. The imposed form of it (which as it is found in
the Original from whence it is taken, is only Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically
expounded, <hi>God save the King;</hi> and most Catechre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically
applied to Tyrants, being in the native sense of
the words of this signification, <hi>Let the King Live;</hi> which
is a very improper Wish for men of death, of whom God
sayes, they shall die, and the Law sayes, they should die,
for their Murders &amp; Capital Crimes) must be taken either
as an Adulatory Complement; or a Congratulatory ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
or a precatory benediction. The first, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
most illegally, so it can be rendered neither Civilly,
nor Sincerly, nor Christianly: but all ingenuus men would
think it a base imposition, to be forced not only to subject
themselves to their Tyrannical Oppressors, but to flatter
them as if they were not such. Whatever they may force
the mouth to speak dissemblingly, they can never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the heart to think, such wishes are due to them; and
so they can never be Cordial, nor consistent with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor;
and to interpose the Holy &amp; Dreadful Name of God,
in a dissembling Complement, to flatter base men, is a
horrid mocking of God, and a heinous taking His
Name in vain, contrary to the <hi>Third Command.</hi> If it be a
<hi>Congratulation</hi> (as alwayes it is used in Scripture, and in
all cases formerly; being never imposed on men by way
of Compulsion, before this sett of Tyrants started up,
that know they can get no deference of honest men, but by
extortion) It is the more abominable; not only for the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
that is in it, but the Blasphemie, in giving thanks
for the Promoter of the Devils Interest, and the Destroyer
of Christs, and the Liberties of Mankind. What have we
to Congratulate him for, but for overturning our Laws &amp;
Liberties, and oppressing us in most grievous Tyranny?
Besides to give the vilest of men when exalted any Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory
honour, is contrary to the fifth Command, as is
shewed above. And it were a forsaking of the Law, thus
to praise the wicked, since they that keep the Law will
contend with them <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 4. If it be a <hi>Benediction,</hi> we
cannot bestow it upon one whom our Father Curses, our
Mother Curses, and all our Brethren. It is no less pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous

to bless whom the Lord declaredly Curses, than
to Curse whom he blesses. The <hi>Curse of the Lord is in the
house of the wicked Prov.</hi> 3. 33. we cannot then bless that
house. Nor can we bless them that our Mother curses,
and cries for vengeance against, as she did against <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar

of our dead Brethren hath a Moral Cry, <hi>How long O Lord

And the vexed Spirits of our Brethren, yet houling under
the same yoke, are puting up before the Throne of Grace,
the same continued Cry, with incessant importunity, <hi>How
long how long shall the wicked triumph how long shall they break in
pieces thy people? O God to whom vengeance belongeth? Psal.</hi> 94.
1-4. Yea God hath said it, and we must not contradict
it in our practice, against all Tyrants that wrest Judgement,
and <hi>say unto the wicked thow art righteous, him shall the people,
curse Nations shall abhor him, Prov.</hi> 2. 24. And this must stand
registred as the everlasting Claise of all <hi>Zions</hi> haters, to
which all her Lovers must say, <hi>Amen,</hi> that they shall be
<hi>as the grass upon the house tops</hi> and never have the benefit of
the Churches benediction <hi>Psal. 129. 8. Neither do they which
go by say, the blessing of Lord be upon yow, we bless yow in
the Name of the Lord.</hi> This one word may be a sufficient
<hi>Supercedeas</hi> from blessing any of the enemies of God, or
of the Church, while acting in a declared opposition to
God for the destruction of His people &amp; interest.</p>
               <p>2. Either this—<hi>Save the King,</hi> as they mouth it, and
demand the repetition of it, is a Prayer; or it is not. If not,
it must be a dreadful profanation of the name of God, to
be commanded to speak to Him, and yet not to pray. If it
be a Prayer, we would expect another way of dealing with
us, if rhey really desired the benefit of our Prayers, than a
threatening us with death if we did it not. And if they did
desire it as <hi>Darius</hi> did, that we might offer sacrifices of sweet
savours unto the God of Heaven, and pray for the life of
the King and of his sons <hi>Ezra.</hi> 6. 10. we could not refuse to
pray for him, so far as might consist with that Prayer of the
same <hi>Darius,</hi> in that same decree <hi>vers. 12. that God may destroy
all Kings &amp; people, that shall put to their hand to alter and destroy
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:41139:240"/>
the House of God.</hi> We can pray no Prayer inconsistent with
this, And to pray that God would save this King, and yet
destroy all Kings that put to their hand against His House,
were to pray Contradictions. But they know they deserve
no Prayers, and must force them if they get them. And all
the world knows, that <hi>Compelled Prayers are no devotion;</hi> and
if they be no devotion, they must be sin: Imposed Prayers,
are not the Prayers that God will hear &amp; accept; And if we
have not the faith of acceptance in them, they must be sin,
for <hi>whatever is not of faith is sin, Rom. 14. ult.</hi> All Prayers
which God will hear, must proceed from the heart volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarely
and fervently, in Spirit &amp; in Truth, with the whole
heart. But imposed &amp; compelled Prayers cannot be such;
especially when they are not only by them imposed, but
prescribed as to the form of them. Which sets and <hi>formes</hi>
prescribed by men, and such men as usurp a Supremacy
over the Church, cannot be subjected to, according to
the Word of God, and the Principles of our Reformation.</p>
               <p>3. That infallible Proposition of the Apostle, <hi>Whatsoever
is not of faith is sin,</hi> must be urged yet a litle further: And that
with a reference, both to the Person required to be prayed
for, and to the matter of the duty more generally. First if
we cannot pray for this man, neither as a Christian, nor
as a King, then we cannot satisfie this imposed demand;
for it will not satisfie to pray for him as a Heathen: But we
cannot in faith pray for him, either as a Christian, or as a
King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not as a Christian; for besides that he is an <hi>excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi>
Apostate (by a sentance which we beleeve stands
yet rate in Heaven, Pronounced by a faithful Servant of
Christ) and a <hi>Papist,</hi> which <hi>as such</hi> can no more be prayed
for than the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Pope;;</hi> for whom, and all the limbs of
Antichrist; the only prayer that Protestants can pray, is,
that the Lord would <hi>consume him with the Spirit of His Mouth
and destroy with the brightness of His coming 2 Thess.</hi> 2. 8. (we
cannot reconcile the prayers of some, that pray against the
<hi>Pope</hi> and his supporters, and upholders of his tottering
Kingdom, and yet for this his Antichristian vassal) His
rage &amp; resolution in prosecuting a war against Christ and
His followers, is such, that if we may make Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:41139:241"/>
our faith will have litle more ground to pray for
<hi>Iames,</hi> than Christians of old could find for <hi>Iulian,</hi> the
the Apostate. Nor as a King, for that we cannot do,
because he is none with Gods approbation, and may not do,
for a very heathen could teach us to pray, that God would
destroy all Kings that put to their hand to alter &amp; destroy
the House of God, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 6. 12. And besides, in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place, with respect to the matter of the duty in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral:
That cannot be in faith which wants a warrant in
the Word, either by precept, promise, or practice: But
to pray for wicked Tyrants &amp; Enemies of God, wants a
Warrant in the Word, either by precept, promise, or
practice. There is no <hi>precept</hi> for it, either General on
particular, neither express, nor any to which this is reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible.
And who dare adde without a precept in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, either for matter, or manner, or end, what
He hath not commanded? for such presumption; <hi>Nadab</hi> &amp;
<hi>Abihu</hi> were destroyed <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 1, 2. because they did that
which the Lord <hi>had not commanded.</hi> What Command can
there be for praying for that, which is against the preceptive
Will of God? But it is against the preceptive Will of God,
that there should be Tyrants: Therefore to pray that these
may be preserved in the World, cannot fall under a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God. There is no <hi>promise</hi> for it, which is the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; foundation of Prayer: We can pray for nothing
that we have not a promise for, either General or Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:
But we have none, nor can have any, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of a plague to us, as Tyrants are. There is no
<hi>Practice</hi> for it in Scripture, to pray for Kings that put to
their hand to destroy the House of God. <hi>Samuel</hi> did indeed
mourn for <hi>Saul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but the Lord reproved him for it, <hi>How
long wilt thow mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from
being King over Isrrel? 1 Sam.</hi> 16. 1. belike this reproof was
for his praying for <hi>Sauls</hi> preservation as King, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we may mourn for wicked wretches, for their sin &amp;
Miserie both. But hence, if the Lord reprove His Serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
for mourning for a King whom He disoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, then we
may not pray for such a King whom the Lord disounes, as
He disounes all Tyrants, for they are set up &amp; not by Him!
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:41139:241"/>
But the Antecedent is true in that example of <hi>Samuel:</hi>
Therefore also the Consequent, that we may not pray for
them as Kings, whom the Lord disounes.</p>
               <p>4. Moreover to confirm this yet further: That Prayer
is not <hi>of Faith,</hi> and so sin, which is contrary to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of God, and his promises, and the practices of
the Saints: But praying for wicked Kings their preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
is contrary to these precepts, promises, &amp; practices
&amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi>—It is contrary to some Divine precepts,
both Affirmative, &amp; Negative. There is an <hi>Affirmative</hi>
precept, prescribing what Prayer should be used under the
Domination of Tyrants, that they should weep and say,
<hi>Spare thy people O Lord, give not they Heritage to reproach,
that the heathen should rule over them, wherefore should
they say among the people where is their God Ioel.</hi> 3. 17.
If it be a reproach to be under Heathen Rulers, and if we
should pray that they may not Rule, but that Our God may
shew Himself where He is, and who He is, in delivering
His people from their Domination; Then it is contrary
to this, to pray for the preservation of Tyrants, that do
rule over them to their destruction &amp; reproach: For it is
contradictory to pray, that they may not Rule, and that
they may be preserved in Ruling. There is a <hi>negative</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
prohibiting the salutation of Hereticks and Enemies
of the Gospel, which will condemn this salutation of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
Kings: for in the Original <hi>God save the King</hi> is no
more than a solemn salutation, or apprecatory Wish that
he may prosper. 2 <hi>Epist. Iohn. vers. 10, 11. If there come
any</hi>—and <hi>bring not this Doctrine—neither bid him God
speed,</hi> for <hi>he that biddeth him,</hi> God speed, <hi>is partaker of his evil
deeds. God speed,</hi> in the <hi>Greek,</hi> is the same with <hi>God save,</hi> in the
<hi>Hebrew.</hi> If then we must not say, <hi>God save a</hi> Heretick, neither
must we say <hi>God save an Hertical King,</hi> or a Popish Tyrant, a
sworn enemy to the Gospel of Christ, and the coming of His
Kingdom. This is also inconsistent with that Rule &amp; Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of our prayers, commonly called <hi>The Lords prayer,</hi> not
only because it cannot be reduced to any of its petitions
(which are comprehensive of all that we are warranted to
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:41139:242"/>
pray for) but because it is contradictory to the <hi>Second</hi> which
is, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi> The Coming of Christs Kingdom in our
Land cannot consist with the preservation of the Tyrants
reign, which is <hi>Satans</hi> rule: for Antichrists <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Satans King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Christs, cannot be promoted both at once. It
may be also demonstrated, that it is inconsistent with all
the petitions of that perfect form of prayer. With the first,
<hi>Hallowed be thy Name;</hi> for when they who rule over His
people make them to houl, then His Name continually
every day is <hi>Blasphemed Isai,</hi> 52. 5. yea much profaned in the
frequent repeating that imposition. With the Second, <hi>Thy
Kingdom come</hi> for when He takes unto Him His great
power &amp; Reigns, then is the time <hi>He, will destroy them that
destroy the earth, Revel.</hi> 11. 17, 18. It is against the <hi>third,
Thy will be done</hi>—for it is against His preceptive will that
there should be a Throne of iniquity, it shall not have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with Him; as it would have, if according to His
will. And therefore <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> pleads from the Lords Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
&amp; Righteousness against Tyrants, <hi>Habbak.</hi> 1. 13, 14.
It is against the <hi>fourth, Give us this day our daily bread,</hi> to pray
for them that rob us of it, whom the Lord hath set over us
for a plague, to domineer over our bodies, and all the
means of life <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 37. The Saints there make a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint

                  </gap>. 8, 9. It is against the <hi>fifth, Forgive us
our debts or sins;</hi> for if we pray for taking away the guilt of
sin, we must also pray for removing the punishment;
whereof this is one, to be under Tyrants: And if it be sin
which brings on such a judgment, then it is sin to pray for
the keeping of it on &amp; continuing thereof: And though we
should forgive their sin against us, yet we ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
against their sins against God, and the Church, in
defiling it, &amp; shedding the blood of the Saints <hi>Psal.</hi> 79.
1-7. It is against the <hi>sixth, Lead us not into Temptation
and deliver us from evil:</hi> for their Government is a continued
tract of Temptation, they being a snare on <hi>Mizpah &amp; a net
spread upon Tabor Hos.</hi> 5. 1. And if we pray to be delivered
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:41139:242"/>
from all evil, then we must pray to be delivered from Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
which is a great evil. It is against the <hi>Conclusion</hi>
also <hi>for thine is the Kingdom</hi>—&amp; <hi>Glory:</hi> Tyrants being
stated in opposition to the Glory of God. Again, in the
next place, it is against many <hi>promises</hi> of giving good Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and of breaking the yoke of Tyrants (as I cited se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
above) Neiether of which can consist with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Tyrants, if such a Prayer should be answered
according to the idol of the heart of the supplicants: for if
God should save this man as long as we may pray for him
as a King, then all the promises of a Change &amp; Revolution
are precluded. Lastly, it is contrary to the constant tenor
of the Saints <hi>prayers</hi> against theé Enemies of God. <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
prayed upon the destruction of a Tyrant, <hi>So let all thine
enemies perish O Lord Iudg. 5. ult. Iotham</hi> prayed against
that bastard King, <hi>let fire come out from Abimelech &amp; devour
the men of Shechem,</hi> and—<hi>let fire come out from the men
of Shechem &amp; devour Abimelech, Iudg. 9. 20. David</hi>
prayes against <hi>Saul,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Cush</hi> the <hi>Benjamite</hi> in
the title of <hi>Psal.</hi> 7. alluding to <hi>Kish</hi> his Father, or because
he was no better than an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> a <hi>Cushite Amos</hi> 9. 7. and
could no more change his manners than an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> can
change his skin <hi>Ier.</hi> 13. 23. See <hi>Pool Synops. Critic. in Locum.</hi>
Where it is proven that this was <hi>Saul;</hi> against him he prayes
that the Lord would <hi>awake to Iudgement Psal.</hi> 7. 6. and that
He would <hi>break the arm</hi> of the wicked and the evil man <hi>Psal.</hi>
10. 15. that He would not slay them (to wit suddenly or
in a common way) lest the people forget, but scatter and
bring them doun and <hi>consume them in wrath,</hi> that they may
not be, that it may be known <hi>God ruleth in Iacob</hi> to the ends
of the earth <hi>Psal.</hi> 59. 11, 13. This is a Psalm against <hi>Dogs</hi>
vers. 6. what Dogs? <hi>Saul</hi> and his men watching <hi>David,</hi> See
the <hi>Title.</hi> As also it is against <hi>Saul</hi> that he prayes, that the
Lord would not grant his desires nor further his devices,
and as for the head of them that compassed him about
(which was <hi>Saul) let the mischief of their oun lips cover them
Psal.</hi> 140. 8, 9. There is also a prayer that the Saints may
execute vengeance &amp; the judgement written upon Tyrants,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:41139:243"/>
and bind them with chains <hi>Psal.</hi> 149. 7, 8, 9. The Church
is brought in praying for vengeance against the <hi>Babylonian</hi>
Tyrant, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the King of Babylon hath devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me—the <hi>violence done to me and my flesh be upon Babylon
shall the Inhabitant of Zion say Ier. 51. 34, 35. Paul</hi> impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
any man that does not love the Lord Jesus, <hi>let him be
Anathema Maranatha 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 22. and sure no Tyrant,
persecuter &amp; subverter of Christs Kingdom, can be a Lover
of Christ. The Martyrs under the fifth seal slain for the
Word of God, and the Testimony which they held, are
brought in crying against the Tyrants that murdered them,
<hi>How long! O Lord, Holy &amp; True, dost thow not judge &amp; aveange
our blood, Revel.</hi> 6. 9, 10. Which though it be to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of a Moral Cry of blood, as <hi>Abels</hi> blood cried against
<hi>Cain;</hi> yet ought to be a pattern of our prayers against such
Bloody Enemies, imbrewing their hands in the blood of
our Brethren, for which we ought to pray that the Lord
would haste to make inquisition. <hi>Durham</hi> Observes from
this place, that Gods people in a holy way may pray for
vengeance upon persecuters.</p>
               <p>5. Let us consider the person &amp; matter, for whom and
for what this prayer is extorted. Either it is for the personal
salvation of <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Papist:</hi> or the Royal preservation of
<hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Tyrant.</hi> It will not satisfie to pray, that if it be
possible, and if it were the Lords will, he might be taken
to Heaven, that so we might be quit of him. Neither
were it Lawful to pray that, except we prayed first, that
he might repent of this his wickedness, if perhaps it might
be forgiven him, as <hi>Peter</hi> directed <hi>Simon M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gus</hi> to pray for
himself <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 22. for it is unlawful to pray for the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Papist, except upon supposition of his repentance
&amp; relinquishing <hi>Poperie.</hi> We must pray nothing but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Wil of God; and it is not the Wil of God,
that they that have &amp; keep &amp; will not part with the <hi>Mark of
the beast,</hi> should be saved, for he is adjudged of God to drink
of the wine of His wrath <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 9, 10. So we cannot
pray for him as a Christian, which he is not; Nor as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
except that he may get repentance. Nor can we pray
for him as a King, which he is not; nor as a Tyrant, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:41139:243"/>
that he may repent of &amp; relinquish his Tyranny &amp;
Usurpation: for Tyrants as such cannot be saved, no more
than Papists as such; for <hi>Tophet is ordained of old yea for the
King it is prepared</hi>—<hi>Isai.</hi> 30. 33. We cannot then pray
for his salvation, except we pray for his repentance, and
relinquishing all his sins, and so we must pray for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishing
his Kingship, and that he may cease to be King;
for that is his sin, that he hath made himself King without
God, and against the Laws of the Land. And now whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
he continues such, we must complain in prayer, not for
his Misgovernment only, but for that he Governs, and
desire to be delivered from him. <hi>See Gees Magistrates Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
pag.</hi> 258. But now considering what a Man, and what
a King he hath been, guilty of Murder, Adulterie, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
under sentence of the Law both of God &amp; Man; We
can pray no otherwise for him, than for a Murderer, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,
or an Idolater. We cannot pray for him as Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Authority, or that the Lord may bless his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for that is his sin &amp; our Miserie that he is a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
And his Throne is a Throne of iniquity, which we
dare not pray may have fellowship with God. Can we
pray that God would bless him on a Throne of iniquity?
Could we pray, that the Lord would bless a Drunkard
in his drunkenness, abusing his enjoyments? Or a Thief
in Stealing his, though he used his purchase never so sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
What if prevailing Robbers by Land, or pyrats by sea,
preying upon all passengers, should require this as the sign
of subjection to them, and only condition whereupon
such as they apprehended &amp; overcame should be suffered
to live, that they should pray for preservation &amp; prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to them? Would not this be wickedness thus to pray
for Thieves &amp; Robbers? And are not Tyrants the greatest
of Thieves, that rob &amp; destroy twenty for one of private
Robbers? And do they not require this as such a sign on such
a Condition?</p>
               <p>6. Lastly, then the plea will be reduced to this, that it
is exacted as a Badge of Loyaltie, and Sign, Tessera, &amp;
<hi>Sbibboleth</hi> of ouning the Authority. Which I have at this
length endeavoured to prove, cannot be conscienciously
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:41139:244"/>
Ouned by us, in these circumstances. And even by this
Argument: That Authority which we cannot pray for we
cannot oune: But we cannot pray for this Tyrannical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
<hi>Ergo</hi>—The <hi>Minor</hi> I trust is in some measure
made manifest, by what is said above. And so I conclude
this Head, with that forme of prayer, that I use for the King.
<hi>O Lord God to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thy self;

that are Loyal &amp; zealous for His Interest against their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachings
thereon; Where by they have caught &amp; cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many out of their Conscience, &amp; have broken the neck of
some, the Peace of others, &amp; the heart of not a few. Yea no
Nation can be instanced, wherein so many Oaths &amp; Bonds,
have been imposed on peoples Consciences, so nawseating
for naughtyness &amp; number as well as noxious in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in an Age, as have been in Scotland within these 27
years past; on design to wast all remainder of Conscience, or
sense of Religion among people, that so having worn out
the awful impression of it, they might introduce what they
would, upon a people involved in the same Apostasie
with themselves: And either to incorporate all with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the same Combination against the Lord, or to
exstirpate all Dissenters, who should discover any tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Conscience, in not going along with them in the
same excess of riot. And to the end they might have the
greater concurrence &amp; countenance, with the help of hells
Policy, they contrived them in such terms, as might
engage many to take them, and load the Recusants with
odious obliquies, either as silly Scruplers, or seditious
Schismaticks, or Rebells. For this hath been all alongs
their grand project, to Level their designs against Religion,
not directly &amp; formally under that notion, but obliquely
to the destruction of the Lovers &amp; Professors of it, under
the Nick-name of fanatical Enemies to Government. Of
these ensnaring Engines levelled to these ends, some have
been more patent &amp; open, others more laten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

both have made a prey of people, the last chiefly. For a
snare, the more latent &amp; hidden it be, and the more var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
over with the vermilion of pretended honesty &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
it is the more dangerous; and will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by all the Circumspect &amp; Cautious, as in its design more

than that which is more open &amp; manifest. A hook,

the surer and more successful it is to catch the simple fish;
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:41139:245"/>
if it want its busking, they will not so readily bite at it. In
vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird: yet, though
this is a Truth, such silly birds have the bulk of us been,
such silly doves without a heart, and so senslessly stupified,
as to suffer our selves to be blind-folded &amp; hood-winked
into snares, of such a manifest baseness, as none could be
readily supposed might fall into, who did not brutishly
abandon all common sense of Reason, besides Religion:
As the <hi>Test,</hi> and Oaths of arbitrary <hi>Allegiance,</hi> Bands of
<hi>Conformity</hi> &amp; irregular <hi>Regulation</hi> &amp;c. Some again, and
these Alas! too many, have been insnared with snares of
a more smooth, soft, &amp; subtile Complexion, and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
with gilded arrowes, coloured over with the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pretexts of the enemies relenting Condescendency &amp;
tenderness, stooping now to universal &amp; general terms,
obviously thought capable of a very good Construction,
and daubed over with the untempered morter of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency
of the almost universally unscroupled subscription
of very good &amp; Consciencious men, and the rarity of Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants
lying under the reproach of some few, wild, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical
fools. These well busked hooks have caught
many; of which sort have been many banded <hi>Indemnities,</hi>
and easily swallowed Oaths thereunto appended. Though
the present indeed is contrived without gins of this sort,
and now all these snares of <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Bands</hi> are as illegally
taken away as they were before imposed; upon the same
design, to catch silly fish by other methods; not with hooks
as before, but with a large spread net, to hale the whole
School to Antichrists shore; And to put to proof &amp;
practice the vastness of that <hi>Leviathan Prerogative</hi> of <hi>Absolute
power,</hi> to dispense with all Oaths; especially because, in
all of them even the most monstrous, people might think
there was some tye Obliging them to maintain the <hi>Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi>
Religion, therefore to obliterate that, &amp; bury it in
oblivion, all now are taken away; But the guilt of them
still remains upon the Land, and the grievous Cry of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for refusing them still continues; And therefore the
iniquity of them must be looked unto &amp; lamented, and that
with an eye to the account &amp; reckoning must be rendered
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:41139:246"/>
for thém, to a Greater Judgment than that of Creatures.
But among all these destructive &amp; diabolical devices, there
have been none more charming &amp; cheating, than that
Cunningly Contrived <hi>Oath of Abjuration,</hi> as it is called,
enjoined to be taken by all within the Kingdom, by a
Proclamation about it Representing a late Declaration,
emitted by that party whose sufferings I am vindicating
(as a Manifesto of their Grievances, and necessities to
fall upon severe Resolutions towards their Enemies)
under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the most odious Character, that the malice of
men helped with hells hatred could devise; And requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all to Abjure it in the most peremptory manner, and
under the severest penalty, that ever was heard. This
Oath, I say, was contrived with such cunning, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with such keenness, that it hath involved moe under
its obligation, and engaged more to subscribe it, than any
other that went before it: because it hath been painted over
with such pretexts, as never any before was capable of.
The pressing of it hath been so impartial, upon all travell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Countrey &amp;c. And their acceptance of the <hi>Pass</hi>
annexed to it thought so necessary, as without it no business
could be gone about. Its subscription so universally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrupled,
even by the Generality of great Professors &amp;
Ministers too; the thing abjured represented so odious,
as no honest man could refuse to renounce; And the matter
renounced, under its best aspect &amp; Construction, esteemed
only a paper Declaration, of a party very despicable,
wherein the Principles, profession, or Confession of the
Church seems no way concerned; and if any way concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet the Concern appearing so small, as few or none
durst state their Sufferings upon that head. Yet I beleeve,
if either such as have taken it, or others that may have the
tentation of the like hereafter, will impartia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly ponder it;
so much iniquity may be discovered in it, as may oblige the
one to mourn in the sense of its sinfullness, and the other
to beware of its danger. And so much the rather would
I offer this to Consideration, that I know one who was
wofully wheedled into it, that found the bitter effects of
this poysoned pill in his wounded Conscience, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:41139:246"/>
on the deed, in such a measure that he despaired
of ever recovering Peace. And this man had as much,
and more to say, to justify his deed, than any that ever took
it; having it with all the advantages that ever it could be
tendered with: for, being urged thereunto before the
<hi>Iusticiary,</hi> he expressly refused to disoun that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Principles whereupon it was founded, and
told them that it was misrépresented in the Proclamation:
And when they yeelded to an abstract disouning of it <hi>in so
far as</hi> the Proclamation represents it, or <hi>if so be</hi> it might be
so represented, he gave in a sense in writ, wherein he would
take it; shewing that upon supposition the Declaration did
assert such things as was represented, he would disoune it:
And after the sense was accepted as satisfactorie, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to swear after the ordinary manner, following the
Clerks blind manuduction, but behoved to have it written
doun: And when it was written, with express specifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Apologetical Declaration, he refused to swear
it, till it was altered and corrected, And the Word <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi>
put in the stead of it: which done, before he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
it, he protested it might be constructed in no other
sense, than the genuine meaning of the words he delivered
in, and that it might not be reckoned a Complyance for
fear of his life: yet not withstanding of all this, he lost the
Jewel of inward peace, and knew the terror of the Lord
for many dayes. Therefore I shall chiefly insist on discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the iniquities of this last Oath, called the <hi>Abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Oath,</hi> both because it is the smoothest, and more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
taken than any other, and approven by many that
condemns the rest, and the refusing it hath been punished
by death, and most illegally pressed upon all, under the
penalty thereof, as none of the rest was; And because as
all other Oaths successively imposed, were so contrived
that the last did alwise imply &amp; involve the substance of the
former, So it will appear that the iniquity of none of the
preceding Oaths was altogether wanting in this. But to
the end, both the Complication of the iniquities of this
Oath may be evidenced, and the Continued strain of all the
Oaths (which have also been heads of suffering, though
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:41139:247"/>
not to this degree) may be discovered; I shall touch some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of all the sorts of them, And shew that their iniquity
cleaves to this last Oath: And then come to canvass
this Oath it self, After I have premitted some General
Concessions.</p>
               <p>First, In a few Words some General Concessory propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
may be premitted.</p>
               <p>1. That Oaths both Assertory and promissory are Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
will not be denyed but by <hi>Quakers</hi> &amp;c. It is clear,
Swearing is a Moral duty, and so material, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is used for the whole Worship of God <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13.
<hi>Thow shalt fear the Lord thy God, and shall serve Him, and
Swear by His Name Deut.</hi> 10. 20.—<hi>To Him shalt thow
cleave &amp; Swear by His Name.</hi> The reason is, because by
whomsoever we swear, Him we profess to be our God,
and invocate Him as witness of our hearts uprightness, &amp;
honest meaning in the thing sworn, according as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by both parties, and as aveanger if we prove false.
Hence every Oath which doth not bind us faster to serve &amp;
cleave to Him, is but a breach of the <hi>Third Command.</hi> Again
it is not only Commanded as a duty, but qualified how it
should be performed <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 1, 2. Where it is required of a
people returning to the Lord, to Swear <hi>in Truth, in Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement,
and in Righteousness.</hi> Hence every Oath which is
not so qualified, and does not consist with a penitent frame,
is sin. It is likewise promised in the Covenant, that
Beleevers shall speak the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp; swear to
the Lord <hi>Isai</hi> 19. 18. every Oath then that is not in the
language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> is unsuitable to Beleevers, that is to
say, Consentaneous to the Word of God, and Confession
of our faith. Again, He that <hi>sweareth in the earth shall swear
by the God of Truth Isai.</hi> 65. 16. and therefore that Oath
which is not according to Truth, is dishonourable to the
God of Truth. If all the Oaths imposed upon <hi>Scotland</hi> these
many years, were examined by these Touch-stones, they
would be found all naught. So giving <hi>Bands</hi> for security,
which for obligation are equivalent to promissory Oaths,
are also Lawful materially: but with the same qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
otherwise they are sinful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="475" facs="tcp:41139:247"/>
2. This duty when suitably discharged, truely, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously,
righteously, in the fear of God, according to His.
Will, is in many cases very necessary. Not onely in <hi>vowes,</hi>
in which God is the party, in matters morally necessary,
to keep <hi>the righteous Iudgements of God, Psal.</hi> 119. 106. Nor
only in <hi>National Covenants</hi> for Reformation, and promoting
the Interest of Christ, whereof we find many Instances in
Scripture, in <hi>Moses, Ioshua, Asa, Hezekiah, Iosiah,
Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> their making &amp; renewing such Covenants
by Oath, coming under the dreadful Curse of it if they
should break it. And this may make our hearts meditate
Terror, for the universal unparalelled Breach of Solemn
Covenants with God, that exposes the Nation to the Curse
of it. But also in humane Transactions, whereunto God
is invocated as a Witness; as in National Transactions,
at choosing &amp; inaugurating their Magistrates, for security
of Religion &amp; Liberties, as we have many examples in
Scripture. Seldome indeed do such bonds hold Tyrants,
but it is this Generations indeleble brand &amp; bane, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this they have come under the yoke of ineluctable slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and have entailed it upon posterity. As likewise in
Contracts &amp; mutuàl Compacts of Friendship or stricter
Association, when Edification or other Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>faction or
security Calls for it, as <hi>Iacob</hi> sware to <hi>Laban, David</hi> to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi>
&amp;c. In which the matter must be clear, &amp; mutually
understood, &amp; honestly meant, without (equivocation &amp;
mental Reservation, and all ambiguity, as also possible &amp;
likely to continue so: for otherwise, it were but a mocking
of God &amp; man, to swear a thing we either cannot or will
not perform, according to the meaning of him in whose
favours the Oath is given. But withall we ought to be
sparing in such things, except where the matter of the Oath
or Band is weighty &amp; necessary, &amp; not multiply them need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessly
upon formality or Custom: for if there were suitable
Confidence in one another, there would not be need
for so many of these securities. And specially in Relative
stipulations betwixt man &amp; wife &amp;c. Where an indissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
relation is entered into. And in a particular manner,
even in things Civil, when we are called thereunto by a
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:41139:248"/>
Lawful maigstrate, for deciding of Contraversies, or
our oun vindication, or to Confirm our Obligation to
some duty, An Oath for Confirmation is an <hi>end of all strif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
Heb.</hi> 6. 16. But alwise in this the matter must be Lawful,
according to the will of God, and true, &amp; certainly known,
and also necessary, weighty, useful, worthy of such
Confirmation, for the Glory of God, and the good of our
Neighbour, that His Holy Name be not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for otherwise if the matter be false, God is made Witness
of a lie; if uncertain, Conscience Conde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns us that we
know not, nor care not, what we call God Witness to;
if unlawful, then God is called to approve what He hath
comdemned, and so to contradict Himself which is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Blasphemy. With all which Cases, if we compare &amp;
examine all these Delusory Oaths, &amp; hell-devised Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
on Consciences in these dayes, obtruded to debauch
&amp; insnare them; Not one of them, levelling all at one
design, how smoothly soever conceived, can be taken
without a wound &amp; wramp to the Conscience.</p>
               <p>3. Of all these Cases, only two are applicable to our
imposed Transactions with our wicked Rulers, to wit, in
the matter of friendly Contracts, or in the matter of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Appearances before them, and Swearing and Banding
before them, and to them. In both which, there must be
a sort of Confederation with them. In Contracts with them
it will not be doubted: And in Judicial submitting to their
Authoritative Impositions of such Securities, it is evident,
there must be also a Confederation with them, not only in
acknowledging their Authority, but in coming under mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
exacted stipulations; wherein, by taking these Oaths
&amp; Bands, we give them security of orderly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ubjection, as
members of the Community whereof they are Judges, and
get their security of acquittance, and that we shall not be
molested nor prosecuted among the Recusan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Confederation, I shall concede in two cases it
may be ouned, and Consequentially Oaths &amp; Bands may
be given to men of their stamp. 1. A Confederation which
is more <hi>Discretive</hi> or Discriminative may be allowed to
them; that is, such bargains wherein they and we are kept
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:41139:248"/>
still divided as two parties, and not under one Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as in Contracts of Conhabitation, liveing under them
as Tenants, buying &amp; selling, and the like. But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enter into a Confederation unitive with them, which
may make us one body or party. 2. A Confederation which
is necessary &amp; unavoidable; when either an unavoidable
strife or contention doth arise between them &amp; us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we are compelled to answer in Law, and can no
otherwise be decided but by our Oath of Confirmation,
which is an end of all strife; or when we are falsly accused
of some odious &amp; heinous Crime, as of Murder or Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery:
It is then Lawful &amp; necessary to vindicate our selves,
by giving all these Legal Confirmations that we are free of
these things; for otherwise to lye under the imputation of
such enormities, were shamefully scandalous to Religion.
But we cannot allow any Transactions of this sort, which
are elective &amp; voluntary, to make or pursue either peace
or pleas with them, when our oun Interest or benefit
draweth us thereunto, but ere we go to Law or give Oaths
&amp; Bonds to and before the unjust and perfidious, and such
also as we cannot oune as Magistrates, we would rather
take wrong &amp; suffer our selves to be defrauded, as the
Apostle adviseth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, 7. It was not unlawful, as
Expositors shew from that place, for the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to
answer in Law for their oun vindication, being pursued by
a Heathen, but it was utterly a fault to go voluntarly one
with another. And if to pursue a brother was a fault,
then much more to go to Law with an Apostate, with
whom there should be less medling. And if to go before
the unjust Magistrates, as these Heathen Judges were at
<hi>Corinth</hi> who yet were Magistrats, was utterly a fault, then
much more to go before such as have neither rightful nor
righteous Authority at all: Which yet must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
if we take Oaths &amp; Bands before them; for none
can exact these but acknowledged Magistrates. Hence it
is apparent, it would be an Elective Confederation with
these wicked Usurping Judges, when brought before them
to take their tendered Oaths and Bands, not as parties pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
before them, but as transacting with them, with
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:41139:249"/>
whom as well as before whom we must give these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
Securities: And so not only must we acknowledge
them to be <hi>Gods,</hi> among whom the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itteth, whose
Holy Name is interposed in such Solem Transactions, but
also we must swear &amp; enter in bands to them as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
This indeed is necessar when called before them
against our will, and accused of horrid Crimes; as was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in the imposition of the Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi> auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
imputed to the Refusers, that they asserted Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Principles, and ounéd it Lawful to kill all that
served the King; In such a Case, to declare with the most
solemn Asseverations, for vindication of Truth, that we
disoune not only all such Assertions, but all such thoughts
as that it is Lawful to kill all that serve the King, or any
that serve him because they serve him, or because they have
injured us any manner of way, &amp; to declare our abhorrence
of all Murder &amp; Assassinations. But to swear such things to
them, when we are altogether innocent, would be a granting
that we were legally suspect, by offering a legall purgation.
And so all the Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> should take upon them
to purge themselves from a suspicion of Murder, which
were odious. And to abjure a Declaration as asserting such
things, when it asserts no such thing, is a Swearing to a lie.</p>
               <p>4. All Solemn Securities of Oaths, or Bonds that are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Promises, are <hi>stricti juris</hi> of most strict &amp; indispensible
obligation, as <hi>Mr Durham</hi> on the <hi>Third Command</hi> shewes
in many cases: No mans loss or private prejucice can make
it void (though we swear to our <hi>oun hurt</hi> we must not <hi>change
Psal.</hi> 15. 4.) Nor indifferency in the matter, if once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in (for then our Souls are <hi>bound Numb.</hi> 30. 2.) Nor
deceit of others, if the deceit be circumstantial only, as in
the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> case: Nor the exstortion of it by fear or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
if the matter be Lawful: Nor rashness and sin in
the manner, if Lawful in the matter, as with the <hi>Gibeoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi>
Nor another meaning afterwards devised, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Imposers mind, nor our oun at first who took it
(thats but a swearing <hi>deceitfully Psal.</hi> 24. 4.) Nor any good
meaning or design in reversing the Oath (<hi>Saul</hi> was punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for breaking his Oath with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> out of zeal
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:41139:249"/>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 2.) Nor though the Oath be conceived by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
(as by the <hi>Altar</hi> or <hi>Temple</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 20-22. Nor
when the thing becomes impossible, if that possibility could
have been foreseen or prevented: Nor any other secret
meaning, by equivocation or mental reservarion, which are
abominable: Nor any Dispensation from <hi>Pope</hi> Or <hi>King:</hi> Nor
any other posterior Oath. None of these things can make an
Oath void, but if we have bound our selves God will require
it; for who so despises an Oath, by breaking the Covenant,
when <hi>lo he hath given his hand be shall not escape,</hi> God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense
it <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. 18, 19. They are null indeed &amp; of
no force, when they become bonds of iniquity tying to
things unlawful or impossible; or when the thing sworn
is not in our oun power <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. 5. Or when there is
deceit in it, not in Circumstantialls only, but in Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls;
Or when it hinders a greater good; when the case
Materially altereth; or when the party sworn to relaxeth
us. All these do condemn the horrid breach of the Sacred
&amp; <hi>Solemn League &amp; Covenant,</hi> and Confutes the perverting
&amp; wresting the words of it in the <hi>third Article,</hi> as if it did
oblige to Allegiance to Tyrants; for in that case the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is unlawful, and there is a deceit in essentialls, and
the case materially altereth (for in the Covenant we are
bound to the King, not to a Tyrant) and the party
sworn to hath relaxed us long ago, by annulling the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
yet all these things prove, that the Covenant is
still in force: And that all the Oaths &amp; bonds contradictory
to it, are sinful: and yet, thô it be sinful to take them,
and sinful to keep them, it is nevertheless perjury to break
them, especially to them whose erroneous conscience
is bound by them, under a Notion of their Lawfulness.
And in a special manner, it is here conspicuous, how
deceitful a jugle that sinful shift of many hath been, that
they could subscribe an unlawful bond under a <hi>penalty;</hi> As
for example, to answer to their Courts, or to go to Church,
or separate from the persecuted Meetings of the Lords
people, under such a <hi>penalty,</hi> which they thought to pay
the penalty would clear them of, as if it were only an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative</hi>
band. The iniquity of this Juggle will appear, if
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:41139:250"/>
we consider, such Bonds cannot be Alternative: for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatives
are alwayes disjunctive, binding equally either
to this or that; and the one Alternative is no more deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately
enjoyned by the Imposer, than the other. And so,
if these Bonds were Alternative, it should be in the binders
choise, whether to Answer the Court, go to Church, to
separate Meetings; Or pay so much money. But it is not
so, for the Stipulation &amp; promise is determinate to the
obligation, for which the bond is required, and the penalty
is annexed, as a punishment of the breach of that obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And that fancy of cluding the bond by paying the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
would quite enervate all security among men, in
their mutual compacts of that nature; and under that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
they might give a satisfactory Complyance to the
most wicked imposed obligation imaginable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to subscribe
the <hi>Turks Alcoran,</hi> with a reserved intention only to pay
the imposed penalty. Which Reservation is so far from
being suitable to that Christian Simplicity the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
that it does not answer that Moral honesty that
our concern in the good of humane Societie calls for. Its
incumbent on all that expect to Dwell in Gods Holy hill, to
have this requisite qualification for one, though they swear
to their <hi>oun hurt</hi> they will not <hi>change it,</hi> and they must be far
from swearing <hi>deceitfully:</hi> And Consequently, if they bind
themselves by a promise, which a Christian should be no
less tender of than of his Oath, they must keep it. And
besides, to condescend that that penalty or fine should be
paid, by our selves or friends in our behalf, were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
that these Enemies should be enriched by our oun
or the spoil of our friends, upon the account of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of our promise; which seems such a dishonest &amp;
dishonourable thing, that an honest heart would disdain it.
And though this should be flouted as foolish preciseness,
to choose rather to lye still &amp; suffer in such a case; yet it
may be considered that Christs Cross, even with reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
is alwise a better Choise, than the works Ease, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
at any price which is a hire for Christs enemies.</p>
               <p>5. All Divines and Casuists do grant, that an Oath must
be taken in his sense &amp; meaning who tenders it, and in
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:41139:250"/>
whose favours it is conceived: because Oaths and Bonds
are for security, and therefore whosoever would deal
honestly &amp; Christianly in taking an Oath, must take in the
sense that it is understood by such as impose it: Otherwise
the Holy Name of God should be taken in vain, and the
swearers &amp; promisers shall deal deceitfully, in frustrating
the end of the Oath or bond, and the design of the tenderers
thereof. And therefore, as Reason &amp; Religion requires,
that all Oaths or Bonds be so conceived and enunciated,
that all concerned may understand them, and if there be
any doubt how far they bind, the Imposers should explain
the same, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did to his servant: So Conscience
requires, that they be alwayes taken in the Imposers sense,
and as they discover their sense &amp; sentiments of them, and
not according to the meaning that we may think the words
Capable of; Nor yet according to the wheedling expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
that they may give or allow, which are as deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
&amp; insnaring as the things themselves. Nor is it to be
looked upon as a favour to get a Liberty to put a sense upon
them, contrary to their known meaning; for that is but a
Liberty to mock God, to mock others, and our selves
too, and nothing but a snare to the Conscience. And to
put a Gloss upon printed Oaths or Bonds, which in strict
Construction they will not bear, and then to subscribe
them <hi>inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ninis</hi> as offered, is not only an intangling our
selves into the bond of sinful Oaths &amp; Bonds, but to stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Godly, and harden the wicked in the present, and
to mock posterity in future ages; who shall see the Oaths
<hi>in terminis</hi> subscribed, but not the sense they were taken
in, <hi>See Apolog. Relat. Sect.</hi> 14. It is known by manifold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences
that it is dangerous to hearken to their overtures
who study to ensnare us, but far more hurtful &amp; hateful to
propound overtures to them. For they interpret it a Ceding
and giving ground, and when they see a man begining to
yeeld, then they will seem to be very condescending, even
to accept of litle at first that they may draw him on to more:
like cuning Anglers, sometimes recoyling &amp; drawing back
the well baited &amp; busked hook, to invite the poor unwary
fish to pursue, and sometimes leting it run away with the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:41139:251"/>
hook, when it begins to bite kindly: So when thy find a
man offering &amp; ready to accept of Accommodations, they
will be very yeelding and easie, but with a design to hook
him. But Conscience can find no safety at present, nor
satisfaction afterwards in accommodations with them.
For it is plain to all that are not blinded with Ignorance,
or partiality, or a Judicial stroak, that our Imposers are
such sons of <hi>Belial</hi> as cannot be taken with hands, or by the
hand; And if we reflect upon the matters upon which these
Accommodations are to be offered or accepted, they are
not things upon which we may come &amp; go, upon our
discretion, as we do with our oun particulars, or with
Problems to be disputed, or ambiguous propositions ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of different senses; but matters so &amp; so circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate,
as do require the positive determinate Judgement of
the Conscience, Concerns of Truth &amp; falshood, duty
&amp; sin, which cannot admit of Accommodation, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
or Reservation, or any other sense than the
Imposers and they that state their Inquisition about such
things do oune, and are observably known to have &amp;
maintain about them. Otherwise, all other forged Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations
are but tampering tricks, jugling with
juglers, deceiving the deceivers, in such a way as does not
well consist with the simplicity of the Gospel, or the doves
innocency: for what is that but a swearing or promising
deceitfully! <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 4. a conceiving &amp; uttering from the

easily deceived, for they will readily yeeld to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
or any tolerable sense that we can put upon their

glead to find us so far justifying their acts &amp; impositions, as

and they will come many wayes to our hand to get us

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> These things being premitted, I shall offer
Reasons why it was necessary in point of Conscience, to
Refuse all the Oaths hitherto tendered, and Consequently
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:41139:251"/>
Consciencious Sufferers upon this Account will be vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.
And first some General Reasons against all of them
together, and Then a Word to each sort of them.</p>
               <p>1. There is one General Argument, that will Condemn
coming in any terms of Oaths or Bonds with that party,
that have broken the Covenant, overturned the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and destroyed the people of the Lord: Because
such Transactions with them (as is hinted above) are a sort
of <hi>Confederacy</hi> with the known Enemies of Truth &amp; God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
importing a voluntary subjection to them, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
&amp; Incorporation with them, as members of the
same Community, whereof they are acknowledged to be
head. Now all such sort of Confederacy with such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Enemies of God and of the Church, is unlawful,
as <hi>Mr. Gillespie</hi> demonstrates in his <hi>Useful Case of Conscience,
concerning Associations &amp; Confederacies with Idolaters, or any
known Enemies of Truth &amp; Godliness.</hi> Though <hi>Civil</hi> Compacts
for common Commerce may be allowed, as <hi>Abram</hi> was
confederate with <hi>Aner, Eshcol,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mamre Gen.</hi> 14. 13.
<hi>Iacob</hi> Covenanted with <hi>Laban</hi> by way of <hi>Lawborrowes Gen.</hi>
31. 44. But Sacred Confederations of this sort, are
unlawful from these Arguments. 1. The Law of God
condemns them <hi>Exod. 23. 32. Thow shalt make no Covenant
with them, nor with their gods, they shall not dwell in thy Land,
lest they make thee sin against me</hi>—Where not only Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Covenants are discharged in a <hi>tolleration of</hi> their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
but familiar Conversation also, <hi>they shall not dwell in
thy Land.</hi> If then we must not suffer them, if in Capacity,
sure we must far less be imposed upon by them; if we are
not to be familiar with heathens, far less with Apostates,
that calls themselves Christians: for the Apostle layes
much more restraint from communion with them, than
with Pagans 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10, 11. The reason of the Law,
<hi>lest they make thee sin,</hi> as long therefore as there is that hazard
of sinning, the Law obliges to that caution. So <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.
12-16. <hi>Take heed to thy self lest thow make a Covenant with
the inhabitants of the Land—lest it be a snare—but ye shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
their Altars—lest thow make a Covenant with them</hi>—and
<hi>they go a whoring after their gods and thow take of their
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:41139:252"/>
daughters unto thy sons</hi>—Here again, all Sacred Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sactions
are discharged, upon a Moral &amp; perpetually
binding ground, and all <hi>Toleration</hi> is prohibited, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
Affinity. Such complyance brought on the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solating
Judgment, the flood on the old world (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 1, 2,
3.) when the Godly conformed &amp; incorporated themselves,
and joined in affinity with that ungodly crew, from
whom they should have separated themselves. Likewise
<hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 2, 3, 4, 5.—<hi>Thow shalt make no Covenant with
them, nor shew mercy unto them, neither shalt thow make mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
with them—for they will turn away thy son from following
Me—so shall the anger of the Lord be kindled against yow—but
thus shall ye deal with them, ye shall destroy their Altars.</hi>
Where all Transactions with a people devoted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
are discharged, even that of <hi>tolleration</hi> of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
enemies; according to which precept, <hi>David</hi> resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to destroy early <hi>all the wicked of the Land,</hi> and cut off all
wicked doers from the City of the Lord <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 8. Mark
this <hi>All,</hi> of what degree or quality so ever, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of persons. And lest it should be thought this is
meant only of these seven Nations there enumerate, the
Law is interpreted by the Spirit of God of many other
Nations; where <hi>Solomon</hi> is condemned for joining in
affinity with other wicked people, besides these 1 <hi>King.</hi>
11. 1, 2. So that it is to be understood generally: against
Confederacies with all, to whom the Moral ground is
applicable, &amp; the danger of insnaring the people of God. It
is clear likewise, we must have nothing to do with the
wicked, but to treat them &amp; with them as enemies <hi>Psal.</hi>
139. 21, 22. with whom as such there can be no Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
for that supposes alwayes the enmity is laid aside,
but that can never be between the Professors of Religion
and the professed Enemies thereof: but that must alwayes
be the language of their Practice, <hi>Depart from me ye workers
of iniquity, for the Lord hath heard me Psal.</hi> 6. 8. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is peremptory &amp; perpetual, <hi>for sake the foolish, Prov.
9. 6. make no friendship with them, Prov. 22. 24. Say not a
Confederacy to them Isai.</hi> 8. 12. Where it is clear from the
opposition in that Text, betwixt Confederating with the
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:41139:252"/>
wicked and the fear of God, that the one is not consistent
with the other. There is an express discharge to <hi>yoke</hi> or
have any <hi>fellowship</hi> with them 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. to the end—<hi>for
what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?</hi>—what
<hi>Concord hath Christ with Belial?—wherefore come out
from among them and be separate</hi>—2. Many fad &amp; sharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
for such Transactions &amp; Confederations, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the same thing <hi>Iud.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.—<hi>Isaid—ye shall
make no league with the Inhabitants of this Land, yow shall throw
doun their Altars, but yow have not obeyed my voice, why have
yow done this? Wherefore—I will not drive them out from
before yow</hi>—It cannot be expected, the Lord will drive
out these enemies, if we swear subjection &amp; Allegiance,
&amp; come under Confederations with them; for thereby we
contribute actively to their settlement &amp; establishment, and
bring our selves not only under the miserie, but the guilt
of strengthening the hands of evil doers. So <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. the
people of God are reproved, for making themselves <hi>home
born slaves;</hi> how? by out-Landish Confederacies <hi>vers.</hi> 18.
<hi>Now what hast thow to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters
of Sihor? or what hast thow to do in the way of Assyria?</hi>—The
<hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase hath it, <hi>Nunc ergo quid vobis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahendo
Societatem cum Pharaone rege Egyptiorum?—&amp; quid
vobis percutiendo faedus cum Assyria.</hi>—What have yow to
do Associate with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of Egypt? and what have
yow to do to make a Covenant with the Assyrian? So may
we say, what have we to do to take their Oaths &amp; Bonds,
that are as great enemies as they were. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is reproved
for mixing himself among the people <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 8. by making
Confederacies with them; what followes? he is a <hi>Cake not
turned,</hi> hot in the neither side, zealous for earthly things,
but cold &amp; raw in the upperside, remiss in the things of
Christ. And this we have seen in our experience to be
the fruit of such bargains, or bonds, or Oaths, that they
that were ingaged in them, have alwise in some measure
fallen from their former fervor for Christ. Nay we shall
find, that such Transactions are seldom or never recorded
in the Book of God without a reproof, or some greater
Mark of Gods displeasure put upon them; which doubtless

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s set purposely as beacons, that we may beware of them.
And therefore. 3. We may take notice of many disallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
&amp; condemned examples, on which the Lord sets marks
of wrath, as <hi>Ahabs</hi> Covenant with <hi>Benhadad, 1 King.</hi> 20. 32.
to the end: <hi>Asa's</hi> Covenant with <hi>Benhadad,</hi> which the
Prophet calls a <hi>foolish</hi> deed 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. from begin. to <hi>vers.</hi>
10. proceeding from an evil heart of unbelief; as all such
Transactions are over-awed Complyances. <hi>Iehosaphats</hi>
with <hi>Abab</hi> hath the same Censure, though he kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
free of <hi>Ahabs</hi> Idolatrie, and <hi>Ahab</hi> seemed to have been
penitent before he joined with him, and his relation to him
was very near, the enemy of both was an Infidel, the cause
was good to recover a city of refuge, the manner of his
proceeding was Pious consulting the Prophets, and his
end good; yet all this did not justify that wickedness, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. and reproved 2 <hi>Chron. 19. 2. Iehu</hi> the
Prophet is sent to him, <hi>Should thow love them that hate the
Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord.</hi> After
this, when he joined himself with <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> who did very
wickedly, the Lord brake his works 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 35. to
the end: which made him afterwards mend his fault, for
he would not again joine with him, when he sought the
like Association 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 49. So <hi>Amaziah's</hi> bargain
with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when the Lord was not with them, is
condemned by the Prophet, admonishing him to disjoyne
himself from them 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 7-10. And <hi>Ahaz</hi> his
bargain with <hi>Tiglath-Pilnasser</hi> the <hi>Assyrian 2 Chron.</hi> 28. 16.
&amp;c. is plainly disallowed. 4. The complaints, Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
&amp; Lamentations of the Lords people, mourning
over this sin, demonstrate the evil of it <hi>Ezra, 9. 14. Should
we again break thy Commandments, &amp; join in affinity with the
people of these abominations? wouldst not thow be angry with us,
till thow hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor
escaping? Psal. 106. 35. They were mingled among the heathen
and learned their works.</hi> All these commands, Reproofs,
Examples, &amp; complaints, are written for our learning;
and being seriously laid to heart, will sufficiently scare all
the fearers of God, to Join but stand aloof from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyances,
conjurations, or confederacies with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:41139:253"/>
of God, directly or indirectly, formally or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively,
for fear of partaking of their sins and receiving
of their plagues. I insist the more largely on this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
both because it will conclude that for which these
proofs are adduced, to condemn all bonding or bargaining
with Malignant Enemies; And because it will vindicate
the aversion of this poor persecuted Remnant, from asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating
in expeditions of war, with promiscuous subverters
&amp; perverters of the cause, on which it were not so proper
to my purpose to dilate any discourse in a distinct head,
while I must confine my self only to the heads of Sufferings.
Only because it may be <hi>Objected,</hi> and it will be profitable to
consider it, that these Scriptures disprove only voluntary
&amp; elective confederations with the wicked, but cannot
condemn necessitated subscriptions of Lawful Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when the matter is not sinful; Nor come they home
to the case of Prisoners, who are constrained to transact &amp;
treat, and have to do with the men in power: Otherwise,
if all bonds were unlawful, then Prisoners might not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Liberty for longer or shorter time, upon bond &amp; bail
to <hi>answer again when called;</hi> Which yet is generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven,
and practised without scruple, and seems not to
want a precedent in Scripture, in that <hi>Iason</hi> gave such
security <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 9. I shall therefore subjoin here some
considerations, by way of <hi>Answer</hi> to this. 1. These
Scriptures disprove all Covenants <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 32. All con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies
<hi>Isai.</hi> 8. 12. all concord or aggreement with the
men of <hi>Belial 2 Cor,</hi> 6. 15. and, without distinction of
voluntary or over-awed Transactions, all <hi>Unitive</hi> aggree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of whatsoever sort are discharged, and can no more
be restricted to the particulars there specified, as if any
other Covenant, confederacy, or concord might be
Lawful that were not a joining in Marriage, an assotiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in war, or communion in Worship with them, than
the Moral grounds of these Prohibitions can be so restrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
for the hazard of sin &amp; snares, the hurt of faithless
fears, from whence they flow, and the hatefulness of
such unequal Conjunctions, which are the grounds &amp;
reasons of these Laws, as may be seen in these forecited
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:41139:254"/>
places, cannot be restricted to the particulars specified.
But now all the tendered Oaths &amp; Bonds of our Adversari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
when subscribed as they require, yea even those
Transactions of Prisoners for procuring their Liberty, on
terms of engaging to re-enter themselves according to
aggreement with their persecuters, are Unitive Covenants
or Conditional aggreements, giving solemn securities for
their respective obligations, upon terms wherein both
parties accord: for these bonds are given to them, and
not only before them, as was said. They are confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
of the Subjected, seeking the peace &amp; favours of
their superiours, which when over-awed are sinful to be
made with wicked Enemies of Religion, as well as when
unconstrained, for <hi>Ahaz</hi> his transaction with the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi>
was forced out of fear, and yet it is called a sinful
confederacy, not to be homologated by any of the fearers
of the Lord <hi>Isai.</hi> 8. 12. They are concords and aggree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with the unrighteous sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> and not about
common matters, but matters wherein Religion &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
are nearly concerned: Can any think that these
Commands are given with exception of Prisoners? And
that if any <hi>Isralite</hi> was Prisoner to these Nations, he might
make a Covenant with them for his Liberty, upon an
engagment to render himself Prisoner to them again?
Then he might give bond to Gods devoted enemies, to
bind up his hands from prosecuting the war with them,
which all <hi>Israel</hi> was obliged to do: for if they might Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
subjection to them, then it would have been their sin
to rebel, as it was <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> sin to rebel against <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
because it was breach of Covenant: And so there
might be a case, wherein the <hi>Israelites,</hi> notwithstanding
of all these Prohibitions, would bee obliged not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,
nor break doun their Altars, to wit, if they made
such a bargain with them for their Liberty, to surrender
themselves as their subjects. Now we read, many times
they were brought under subjection, and that as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their leaguing with them, and yet they broke the
yoke, when they cried unto the Lord, and never submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any longer than they were able to deliver themselves.
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:41139:254"/>
Whence it is plain, that they never bound themselves to
such subjection by Oath, bond, or promise, for that
would have been no mercy which was purchased by
Treachery. 2. It is a voluntary compact with the men in
power, to procure Liberty upon bond to answer again,
and cannot be called necessitated; or if it be, it is but a
necessitated sin. It must be voluntary, because it is an act
of the will, and the will cannot be forced; Its the <hi>Consent</hi>
of the will, and the Consent cannot but be voluntary, in
so far as it is a Consent; and by this, whereas before their
so procured Liberty they were prisoners by <hi>Constraint,</hi> now
when they must return to prison, they are prisoners by
<hi>Consent:</hi> Its the prisoners <hi>Choise,</hi> whether he will come out
upon these terms or not, and every Choise in so far as it is
a Choise, is elective &amp; voluntary: Its put to the mans
choise whether he wil continue under the Cross, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his Testimony for the cause, or surcease from it for a
time, the Latter in the case is chosen. Its the prisoners <hi>desire</hi>
and <hi>petition,</hi> to transact with them in these terms for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
without which no benefit of any such bond can be
procured, and every desire is voluntary. Yea it is a formal
<hi>Compact</hi> &amp; Capitulation with them, binding &amp; obliging
these bonders by their oun word &amp; writ, at least to be at
their Call &amp; Command, not by Compulsion &amp; force now,
but by the Moral obligation of their oun compact: Now
every such compact is voluntary. And therefore, if all
voluntary Covenants, Confederacies, &amp; Aggreements be
discharged in Scripture, then this bond of Compearance
also must be discharged. The Judgement of famous <hi>Mr
Rutherfoord,</hi> of a draught of a petition to have been present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Committee of Estates, by those Ministers who
were prisoners in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> will confirm
what is said: we find it in the  <q>
                     <bibl>Third part of his <hi>Letters Numb.</hi>
63.</bibl> where are these words, I am straitned as another suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man, but dare not petition this Committee. 1. Because
it drawes us to Capitulate with such as have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the mount, the Lord of disposing for the present,
and to bring the matters of Christ to yea and no (yow
being prisoners, and they the powers, is a hazard.</q> 3.
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:41139:255"/>
This Aggreement with the Enemies for Liberty, upon
these terms, is sinful. For it is not only an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a wicked power, in ouning &amp; transacting with
them as Judges, who can free them and bind them as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
by Law, which is disproved above: But it is a bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves over to a pacqued, perverse, &amp; Law-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
Judicatory, not as prisoners by forcible constraint,
but a willing consent, ackowledging the Legality of their
imprisonment, and obliging themselves to observe it
when demanded: yea it is a Covenanted &amp; bonded obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to a wicked Law; for it is a wicked Law, to exact
from a Sufferer for Truth, his re-entrie to prison, for no
crime but his duty. As also it is a justifying of a wicked
sentence, for it is a wicked sentence, that an innocent
man shall return to prison when they please; which is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
when they bind themselves to obey it. This is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
like a mans going to the Gibbet on his oun feet; for
the man does not bind himself to do that, neither is it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
of him as an obedience to a Law, nor is it given forth
as a part of his sentence, Only he chooseth it for his oun
ease: But if all these did concur, it were unlawful for a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
for Righteousness to obey such a Law, or voluntarly to
submit to such a wicked sentence. Neither is it of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency
to urge, that it is Lawful for a man to submit so
far to a Robber, as to bind himself to return to him against
such a day with another purse to him: For this is a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
bargain, to give what a man hath and promise more
to save his life, and is like a mans casting his goods out at
sea to save the ship; The other is not so but elective: This
is only a Choise of the least of two evils of suffering, but
the other is a choise of one of two evils which is sin, which
cannot come under a Christians election at all: This is a
compact with the Robber, which is still discretive, and
nowise unitive of the Robber &amp; him, in any bargain of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
or consederacy or acknowledged subjection, only a
passive surrender to his greater force as an enemy; But the
other is unitive, as between Rulers &amp; Ruled: This is not
any obedience to a Law, nor is the mans purse required to
be given or promised under that notion, as the other is,

I shall here also subjoin some more of that foresaid <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Letter</hi>
of <hi>Mr Rutherfoords,</hi>
                     </bibl> In the 2 place, sayes he, A speaking
to them in writ, and passing in silence the sworn Covenant
&amp; the cause of God, which is the very present Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
is contrary to the practice of Christ and the Apostles,
who being accused or not accused avouched Christ to
be the Son of God, and the Messias, and that the dead
must rise again,</q> even when the Adversarie mistated the
question; Now plain it is, that neither in the bonds nor
petitions, is there any word of the cause or Testimony suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for. 4. As it is sinful, so it is very scandalous in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
respects; in that at least it hath the appearance of evil,
which Christians should abstain from 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 22. and
seems to be a voluntary subjecting themselves to their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
(at least of that to return to prison again) a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
acknowledgment of their unjust Usurpations; a sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
consenting to their Mischiefs framed into a Law, &amp;
exacted under the Notion of a Law; A gratifying of the
enemies of Religion, and pleasing them more than any
thing a prisoner can do, except he should wholly deny the
cause; and therefore chiefly always this overture is most
acceptable from those that durst give any Testimony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they look upon it as some indication of their fainting
or falling from it, or of their wearying of the Cross of
Christ, of which they are very glad; And an offending and
making sad the hearts &amp; condemning the practice, of some
truly tender &amp; zealous Confessors of Christ, who have had
strong tentations to make such transactions, and durst not
yeeld so far for a world; yea it is certainly an Argument of
faithless fear, &amp; impatient wearying of the Cross because of
the fury of the Oppressor, which the Lord taxeth, when the
<hi>Captive hasteneth that he may be loosed,</hi> and that he should not
die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail, which is a
dishonour to Him who hath promised to bear their charges,
and hath given them many encouragments to trust, that
He will open a door in His oun time &amp; way, see <hi>Isai.</hi> 51.
13, 14. Of this <hi>Rutherfoord addeth</hi> in that forecited Letter,
<q>Silence of the cause of God which Adversaries persecute,
seems a tacite deserting of the cause, when the state of
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:41139:256"/>
of the Question is known to beholders, and I know the
Brethren intend not to leave the cause. And a litle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
sayes he, The draught of that petition which yow
sent me, speaks not one word of the Covenant of God,
for the adhering to which yow now suffer, and which is
the Object of mens hatred, and the destruction whereof
is the great work of the times; and your silence in this
nick of time) appears to be a not confessing of Christ
before men, and yow want nothing to begen an uncleanly
deliverance,</q> but the profession of silence: which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
by all, that petition for such a bond, when their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
&amp; transaction speaks no more in favours of the cause,
than if they denied it. It is plainly a coming out of prison
without a Testimony, which cannot consist with faithful
&amp; zealous suffering for Christ, and is far from the choise
of Christs Witnesses, who overcame by the blood of the
Lamb and the Word of their Testimony, recorded <hi>Heb.</hi>
11. 35.—<hi>who were tortured not accepting de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iverance, that
they might obtain a better resurection.</hi> 5. As it is Scandalous,
so it is very inconvenient &amp; unsuitable for the Confessors
of Christ. In that not only they may be ignorant, and
much troubled to know, what underhand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ealings their
friends may use sometimes to procure that Liberty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
acquainting them, and how odiously their Act of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
may be worded &amp; registred to the prejudice of the
cause, which they dare not testify against afterwards when
they do know it, for fear of many inconveniencies. But also
it cannot be vindicated from being a dishonourable shifting,
and puting off, or casting off the Call of a Testimony; and
confessing either an inconstancy, or impatience or unreadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or want of resolution, to confess or profess the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
for Christ, without some respyte to gather new
defences for it: Whereas Christs Witnesses should be ready
always to give an Answer, to every man that asketh them,
a reason of the hope that is in them 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
they involve themselves into the incumbrances of a
doubtful suspence about the event, whereas if they keep
their first resolution &amp; condition with cheerfullness, aloof
from such bargains, they know the utmost they have to
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:41139:256"/>
fear or hope from men. But now, as it is Hard for them
to come off without some sinful engagment, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
any measure of faithfulness when they are out, for
fear of being soon called again; so they bring themselves
into many sad difficulties, how to behave, and cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into many tentations unadvoidably. However ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of late, a precedent of this practice can hardly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced
among the Sufferers of Christ in former times, but
on the contrary many have refused such offers. I shall only
name one; In the persecution of Qeen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England, Dr
Sands</hi> Prisoner at <hi>London,</hi> had the offer of Liberty, upon
the terms of such a bond, finding bail to appear when he
should be called, but refused it absolutely; and when a
Gentleman without his knowledge, having procured it
by giving a thowsand pound Bond for him, brought him
forth and required his consent and observance of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
he would not consent to give any security, and
denied his resolution to observe it in the least; whereupon
the Gentleman very courteously told him, he would stand
to his hazard. This was far more like the innocency of the
dove, but this new prudence resembles more the wisdom of
the serpent. Finally as for <hi>Iasons</hi> business, which is so
much harped upon by these Bonders. (1) These were
Rulers that he had to deal with all, and not raging Tyrants
(2) They were indifferent Arbiters between <hi>Iason</hi> and the
Lewd fellowes that troubled him, and not both Judge &amp;
party; he gave no security to his persecuters, as these
Bonders do, but to the true Judges of the cause, who
impartially took cognizance of it, from whom <hi>Iason</hi> might
&amp; did expect right (3) This was before he was Prisoner,
being as free as his accusers, and having the Law as free
for him as it was for them; whereby he could vindicate
himself and abide the Law, and be absolved by it: which
does not answer the case of Prisoners, actually ingaged in
&amp; called to a Testimony for Christ, when there is no Law
but what is established in opposition to Christ. (4) In the
Original it is, <hi>when they got satisfaction from him,</hi> that is, when
he so cleared himself, that they could not fasten any trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
upon him, then they absolved him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:41139:257"/>
2. All these Oaths &amp; solemn Securities that have been
imposed in these times, are dreadful &amp; heinous breaches
of the <hi>Third Command,</hi> by <hi>taking His Name in vain</hi> in the
worst sort, whereby the takers cannot be holden guiltless.
For it is impossible such Oaths &amp; Bonds; however they be
constructed, can ever be taken with these requisite quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
necessary to be observed in all Oaths (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in all Solemn promises or Bonds) that are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
once for all <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 2. where one that sweareth must
do it, <hi>in Truth, in Iudgement, &amp; in Righteousness.</hi> 1. They
cannot be taken in <hi>Truth,</hi> which is a necessary qualification
in all Oaths; according to the definition of a true Oath;
Which is, a <hi>Solemn Invocation of God, for Confirmation of
some true. Lawful, grave, and weighty, Useful, &amp; worthy
business, wherein He is attested &amp; appealed unto, that He, as
the only Searcher of hearts, may give His Testimony to the Truth of
the thing, and punish the Swearer if he swear not in Truth.</hi> And
this Swearing in <hi>Truth</hi> does import &amp; require, both <hi>Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of the heart, filled with Reverence and the awful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of a present God; And <hi>Simplicity</hi> of the mind,
well informed of the genuine meaning of the Oath, that
we have clear uptaking of it, and take it not implicitely but
with our oun understanding; And also <hi>singleness</hi> &amp; honesty
of the intention, that it be not to deceive, by puting any
other sense than the imposer hath, or will allow when he
understands it: So the meaning must be clear, and such as
may be obviously gathered from the Words, and according
as they are supposed to be understood by others, especially
them that exact the Oath; for if they mean one thing and
we another, Gods Name is profaned, and the end of the
Oath frustrate, and so all equivocations &amp; mental reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are condemned; As all Divine treating on Oaths
teach, and worthy <hi>Mr Durham</hi> particularly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the <hi>Third
Command,</hi> who Asserts, that <q>though we could devise some
other meaning, that might seem to make for us; yet if that
was not meant at first tendering, but otherwise under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by him that did take it, it will not absolve from the
guilt of perjurie; for an Oath is <hi>stricti juris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and will not
admit on any respct or account of interpretations, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:41139:257"/>
to the Native Truth of it, lest it should be found
to be (according to <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 4.) a <hi>swearing deceitfully.</hi>
And afterwards he sayes, Much less will it exempt a
man from guilt, that in swearing he had a meaning of
the words, contrary to what in common sense they
bear, and in the construction of all indifferent persons
<hi>sine juramento</hi> or <hi>extra,</hi> but it should be plain, single, &amp;
clear.</q> And <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Pareus</hi> saith in <hi>Catech Urs. Part. 2. quest.</hi> 102.</bibl>
                     <hi>Sancitum est Iuramentum, ut sit vinculum veritatis inter homines,
&amp; Testimonium quod Deus sit Author &amp; Desensor veritatis.</hi>
                  </q> An
Oath hath the Divine Sanction, that it might be a bond of
verity among men, and a Testimony that God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
&amp; defender of Truth, Now none of these Oaths &amp;
Bonds can be taken in Truth; for if they may be safely taken
in any sense: it must be such as the Oath in the design of
the Imposers cannot bear, and which the Imposers never
intended, nor would they ever have allowed, if they had
understood it; which industriously the Takers have a care
they should not understand, and so they must take it in
that sense <hi>cum animo fallendi</hi> which cannot be in Truth, but
most derogatory both to the Truth &amp; simplicity of the
Gospel. And they are all unclear &amp; ambiguous, which
cannot be taken in Truth, because they have no Truth in
them, as <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> saith <hi>De Iur. Promiss. Oblig. Prael.</hi> 6.
§. 10.</bibl> a Proposition of an ambiguous &amp; indefinite sense,
before the matter be distinguished, is not a true propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
yea nor a proposition at all: for a proposition,
as its definition cleareth, should signify either a truth
or a falshood, without any ambiguity: And therefore,
sayes he, such Oaths should be supected, that there
is some deceit lurking, and every pious &amp; prudent man
should refuse them, offered under such terms, cited by
<hi>Apol. Relat Sect. 10. Pag. 118. &amp; Sect. 14. Pag.</hi> 267.</q> In
fine, None of them can be taken in <hi>Truth:</hi> since they are all a
denying the Truth, as will be evident by the induction of all
of them; Which how it can consist with the fear of God, or
sincerity of the heart, cannot be imagined, and if conscience
be called in to Judgement it will condemn the taking
them. 2. They cannot be taken <hi>in Iudgement,</hi> that is, with
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:41139:258"/>
knowledge &amp; deliberation; minding &amp; understanding
what it is we swear or subscribe, as <hi>Mr Durham</hi> explains it
in the place above cited. For first, they cannot be taken
in Judgement, because they are all ambiguous, the terms
of them being capable of diverse senses, not explained by
the Imposers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> And if they were explained in their sense,
then they could not be taken in Righteousness; And so at
best they are uncertain: And that is dreadful, to invock
the Majestie of God to be a Witness to uncertainties, for
that is to swear with an evil conscience &amp; contempt of
God, to dare to call Him in as a Witness of that which is
in suspense, whether it be Truth or a lie; And such a
swearer must make it a matter indifferent, whether he
make God a Witness of a Truth or of a lie in the case. <hi>Vide
Pareum Loc. supra citat. Pag. 654 Sect. 4. Dr Sanderson ubi
supra,</hi> gives these reasons further against all ambiguous
Oaths: because of him who tendereth the Oath: <q>for the
proper end of an Oath is, that he in whose favours it is
taken should have some certainity of that whereof he
doubted before, but there can be no certainity out of
words which have no certain sense: Next, because of
him who sweareth, who if he take such an Oath in these
terms, either stumbleth his neighbour, or spreadeth a
net for his oun feet; for to what else should such collusion
tend, but either that by our example others may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to take it, whereby they are stumbled; Or that
afterwards, by virtue of that Oath, some thing may be
required of us, which is either unlawful or hurtful,
and this is to lay a snare for our selves! Therefore let
every prudent man beware of suffering himself to be
deceived by these wiles, and of thinking so much either
of the favour or of the ill will of any other, as to swallow
the bait under which he is sure there is a hook</q>: It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
that in the matter of Oaths all things be done
aright, and that the sense be clear to all, and that is <hi>jurare
Liquido</hi> to swear with a clear conscience <hi>Apol. Relat. Pag.</hi>
267. But next, they cannot be taken in Judgement; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are all <hi>imposed</hi> and extorted under a sever penalty,
and some of them of death, and so must be taken out of
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:41139:258"/>
fear. Such Oaths are by many famous Divines judged
unlawful, especially Publick Oaths imposed by Authority,
and under colour of Law; these are worse than a mans
private Oath given to a Robber, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>for fear of Death, if the
matter be unlawful: for, whether the matter be Lawful
or unlawful, such Oaths coacted, exacted, &amp; imposed by
Law, cannot be taken in Judgement; for if they be taken
out of respect to the Law, then it is the persons suffrage
to the equitie of that Law, and an approbation of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
Which in the present case cannot be done, by
any man of conscience, for whether the Oaths be Lawful
or not, the Authority imposing them is naught, and the
Law wicked and can never be approven; And if they be
extorted out of fear, then they cannot be taken with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
or voluntary &amp; unviolented choise, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
light or liberty, which are all the ingredients of
Judgement. 3. They cannot be taken <hi>in Righteousness,</hi>
that is according to the Law of equity as well as piety, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wronging God nor others by our Oaths. Lawful
Oaths should be in themselves <hi>vincula aequitatis,</hi> as well as
<hi>veritatis.</hi> And <hi>Pareus</hi> saith <hi>loco supra citato, Iuramenta licita
tantum ea sunt—quae suscipiuntur de rebus veris, certo cognitis,
licitis; possibilibus, gravibus, necessariis, utilibus, dignis.</hi> Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Oaths are only these which are ingaged into about things
true, certainly known, lawful, possible, weighty, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
useful &amp; worthy. And if that be true, then are
all the Oaths &amp; Bonds taken these many years, but fetter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
into bonds of iniquity; which when the consciences of
the Takers will reflect on them, will become Galls of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and found to have none of these qualifications, but
on the contrary to be about matters false, uncertain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
impossible, frivolous, fruitless, useless, &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
to the worst degree of baseness; and which is
worst of all, dreadfully sinful, and horrid to be thought on
to interpose the Name of God upon, making Him the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover
of what His Soul hates, and a Witness of that
which He will be an Avanger of, as will appear by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
consideration af all of them.</p>
               <p>3. Let it be considered, that though (as the pleaders
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:41139:259"/>
for these transactions do impertinently alledge) the same
words in other cases might be subscribed in a more abstract
sense, as being capable of a good construction: yet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexly
considered in the form &amp; frame of all the Oaths &amp;
Bonds we have been troubled with, they cannot be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in any sense; and if in any, that must be the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
sense, which in them all is alwayes pernicious. 1.
They cannot be taken in any sense though never so good,
if we consider the absolute illegality of their arbitrary impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
It will be confessed that Oaths should be very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
imposed upon consciences, not only lest the Name
of God be prostitute to profanation, in matters light &amp; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial,
or dubious &amp; uncertain; but lest a Tyrannical Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
be exercised over the Souls of men, which are not
subject to any power that Mortals can claim. So it cannot
be denied, but that the Constitution of our Government
requires, and Reason as well as Religion sayes it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
that no Ruler hath right to enjoin an Oath which is
not first enacted into a Law; And it was alwayes account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a good plea for refusing Oaths, when there was no Law
for them; And some have been charged with Treason, for
exacting Oaths without a Statute ordaining them: Which
might be brought in as a Charge against all the Imposers of
Our Oaths, the most part of which have been exacted &amp;
extorted without any colour of Law; some of them being
never ordained by any Act of Parliament, and others of
them before they could obtain such a Mischief framed into
an Act for them, and all of them neither ever legally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
nor righteously enacted, by such who had power
to make Acts; for as for the pacqued Parliaments that made
them, no consciencious Man could ever oune such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of perjured Traitors, to be their Parliamentary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives.
Yet abstracting from that, I say, the Oaths
that have been imposed without and against Law could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be taken in any sense, without consenting to their
treasonable breach of Law, for which they have forfeited
their lives to Justice, when ever there shall be a Judicatory
to revise their administrations: And these that have been
imposed by a pretended Law, could never be taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:41139:259"/>
justifying of that Law that ordained them, which hath
been nothing but a mischief framed into a Law by a Throne
of iniquity. 2. They cannot be taken in a good sense,
with a safe conscience; considering either what is plain in
them, or what is more ambiguous. What is plain and
capable but of one sense, that is alwayes either constraining
to a clear Sin, to renounce some part of the Covenanted
Reformation, in profession or practice; Or Restraining
from a clear duty, that we should not do that which we may
or ought to do. There is nothing in all of them plain but
what obliges to one of these two. Again what is ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
in them, as it ought to be refused for its ambiguity;
so when it is explained according to the Imposers mind &amp;
meaning, the sense will be found alwayes pernicious,
though the words may be plausible. As when they require
an obligation to Allegiance, or Loyaltie, or peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or Orderlyness, and other smooth words signifying
excellent things in an abstract Notion, these will be found
to carry quite another sense, if we inquire into the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
meaning, in which only Oaths &amp; Bonds must be taken.
The only way to find out their meaning, is to consider
either their Acts or Actings, or their designs &amp; intentions,
as they are discoverable by any man of Prudence or consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
If we consult their Acts or Actings, practical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; only legally explaining them, for a commentary;
then by <hi>Allegiance,</hi> we can understand nothing else but an
ouning of their <hi>Absolute</hi> Tyranny; by <hi>Loyaltie,</hi> nothing
but an absolute &amp; implicite Obedience of their absolute
Commands, <hi>without reserve</hi> (as the late Proclamation for
the Tolleration expounds it) by <hi>peaceableness,</hi> nothing but
a stupid subjection to them, leting them do what they
please without resistence or control; and by <hi>Orderlyness,</hi>
nothing but a disorderly Complyance &amp; Conformity with
them, in going along with the Corruptions &amp; Defections
of the time, for their Acts &amp; Actings expound them so. If
we consider their designs &amp; intentions, according to which
they are all uniformly calculate and equally levelled; He
is blind who hath not seen, they have been driving all this
time at these designs (to which all these Oaths &amp; Bonds
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:41139:260"/>
have been adapted &amp; successfully subservient, and by which
they have been promoted to the present pass) to overturn
gradually all the degrees of our Covenanted Reformation,
to establish <hi>Tyranny</hi> and advance it unto greater degrees of
Absoluteness, and to introduce <hi>Poperie</hi> &amp; slavery; So that
by <hi>Allegiance</hi> &amp; <hi>Loyaltie,</hi> can be meant nothing else but an
obligation to oune &amp; obey, and never to oppose the design
of advancing Tyranny; And by <hi>Peaceableness</hi> &amp; <hi>Orderlyness,</hi>
nothing else can be intended, than an obligation never to
oppose either the present Settlement, or future establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Poperie</hi> &amp; arbitrary power, upon the ruines of the
Reformation and our Civil &amp; Religious Rights &amp; Liberties.
Whence, they that can take these Oaths &amp; Bonds in any
other sense, and plead for the inoffensiveness of the terms,
in a more abstract notion, and sense alledged more legal,
without regard to that of the Imposers practically explained
by their administrations, and so looking more to the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries
of their blinded reason and wordly Interest, than to
the Dictates of conscience, please themselves with such no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
&amp; quibling evasions, do but Mock God, deceive
the world, illude the enemies, and delude themselves.
And all these debatings for Accommodations &amp; Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in another sense, are but foull fairdings of conscience-beguiling
Compoundings in, and pitiful priggings for, a
base Complyance. But it is usual for a guilty Son of <hi>Adam</hi>
to sow fig-leaves.</p>
               <p>4. Let it be considered, that all these Oaths &amp; Bonds
that the Land hath been debauched with these 27 years, are
all condemned by and contradictory to anterior binding <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
the Acts of the General Assembles, requiring <hi>no Oaths
in the common cause to be taken without the Churches consent,</hi> as
was cleared in the Historical part, upon the <hi>fifth Period pag.</hi>
82. And that especially they are condemned as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to, &amp; violatory of prior <hi>Oaths</hi> of continuing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible
Obligation; being designed, pressed, &amp; imposed
on purpose to delete the same out of the minds &amp; memories
of the present Generation: I mean the <hi>National</hi> and <hi>Solemn
League &amp; Covenants,</hi> and other former Nationally binding
Publick Engagments. Which, because they are not only
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:41139:260"/>
broken &amp; burnt, but declared Criminal to be ouned, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the ouning of their obligation is ordinarly inserted in
the Indytments of our Martyrs, I must touch upon them
more particularly. It was cleared above <hi>Head. 1. Arg.</hi> 11.
from the <hi>Form,</hi> the <hi>Object,</hi> and from the <hi>Ends</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
which are all Moral and of indispensible obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it is of perpetual and unalterably binding force,
obliging the present and all future Generations, as well
as that which did first come under the bond of it. And to
confirm this, I shall adde more particularly these many
consideration. 1. The National Engagments are Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>promises,</hi> plighting &amp; pledging the Nations <hi>publick faith,</hi>
for the preservation &amp; propagation of Religion &amp; Liberty,
to succeding posterity; which if succeeding Generations
may reverse, then the faith of men, and the faith of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
can be of no force above a century of years; nay nor
after the decease of them that personally made the promise:
And so every new Ruler, every new Parliament, yea every
person coming up to succeed the Father in any Capacity,
might be free not to stand to it, which were very absurd.
Certainly that promise of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nobles &amp; Rulers,
not to exact <hi>Usury</hi> of their Brethren, but to restore &amp; not
require it of them, did not only oblige themselves, but
would bring their posterity under the curse, if they should
exact the same debt there remitted <hi>Neh.</hi> 5. 12, 31. And does
not a National promise of preserving the Reformation,
bind as much to the curse of the breach of it? 2. They are
National <hi>vowes,</hi> avowing &amp; avouching and devoting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
&amp; their posterity to be the Lords people, and to keep
His Statutes &amp; promove His Interests; which do bind the
posterity. <hi>Iacobs</hi> vow at <hi>Bethel,</hi> that the Lord should be his
God <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 21. did oblige all his posterity, virtually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in him; <hi>He found Him in Bethel and there He speake
with Us,</hi> saith the Prophet many hundered years after <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s.</hi> 12.
4. The <hi>Israelites</hi> vow, to destroy the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> did oblige
all their posterity <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 2. Not only by virtue of the
Lords Command, but by virtue of their vow; as we are
obliged to preserve the Reformation, not only by virtue
of the Lords Command, but by virtue of our Covenants.
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:41139:261"/>
                  <hi>Vowes</hi> are bonds to the <hi>Soul,</hi> which must <hi>stand Numb.</hi> 20. 2, 4.
And whereas it is said, that as a womans father or husband
might disanull her vow, and so the Magistrate might
abrogate the Covenant: Besides the impertinency of this
Comparison, as might be easie to demonstrate, it may be
refelled by giving &amp; not granting that he might do so; yet if
the father &amp; husband shall <hi>hold their peace,</hi> then all her vowes
shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul
shall <hi>stand vers.</hi> 4, 7. but so it was, that the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
did give his Consent to the <hi>National</hi> Covenant, and
the Successor did swear the <hi>Solemn League &amp; Covenant,</hi> and
received the Crown on the terms thereof, to preserve &amp;
promote Religion &amp; Liberty; and therefore her vowes must
stand, they cannot be made void afterwards; for it is a
snare to devour that which is holy, and <hi>after vowes to make
enquiry Prov.</hi> 20. 25. So we find the <hi>Rechabites</hi> were obliged
to observe the vow of their forefather <hi>Ionadab Ier.</hi> 35. 6, 14.
And if the fathers vow obliges the Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall not the
Nations vow oblige the posterity? 3. They are National
<hi>Oaths</hi> which do oblige posterity: <hi>Esaws</hi> Oath to <hi>Iacob,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
his birth-right, did oblige his posterity never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it <hi>Gen. 25. 33. Ioseph</hi> took an Oath of the Children of
<hi>Israel,</hi> to carry up his bones into <hi>Canaan, Gen.</hi> 50. 25. which
the posterity going forth of <hi>Egypt</hi> in after ages, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
straitly sworn to observe <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 19. and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
buryed them in <hi>Shechem, Ioshua.</hi> 24. 32. The <hi>Spies</hi> swore
to preserve <hi>Rahab</hi> alive and her house, <hi>Ioshua.</hi> 2. 12, &amp;c.
which was without the Consent of the Magistrate, and yet
<hi>Ioshua</hi> found himself obliged to observe it <hi>Ioshua.</hi> 6. 22.
<hi>Moses</hi> swore unto <hi>Caleb</hi> to ensure him an inheritance <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua.</hi>
14. 9. and upon this ground he deman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s it as his right
<hi>vers.</hi> 12. which he could not do, if Successors might reverse
their Predicessors Lawful Oaths. The Lord will in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
manner resent &amp; revenge the posterities breach of the
Oath of their fathers Covenant <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 59. Thus saith the
Lord God, <hi>I will even deal with thee as thow hast done, which
hast despised the Oath in breaking the Covenant,</hi> which was the
Covenant of their fathers. 4. They are National <hi>Covenants,</hi>
wherein King, Parliament, &amp; people do Covenant with
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:41139:261"/>
each other, for the performance of the respective Duties
of their several stations, either as to the work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or as to the preservation of each others mutual Rights
&amp; Priviledges: So that they are National Covenants made
by men with men; and these we find do oblige the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<hi>Israels</hi> Covenant with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> did oblige the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
<hi>Iosh.</hi> 9. 15, 19. and for the breach of it many ages after
the posterity was plagued 2 <hi>Sam. 21. 1. Zedekiah</hi> was bound
by his Predecessors Covenant, though it was such as made
the Kingdom base, yet in keeping it it was only to <hi>stand,
Shall he break the Covenant &amp; be delivered? Thus saith the Lord,
as I live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> surely mine Oath that he hath despised, and my Covenant
that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his oun h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad
Ezek.</hi> 17. 12, 14, 15, 19. The Apostle sayes even of humane
Covenants, <hi>Though it be but a Mans Covenant yet if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
no man disanulleth or addeth thereunto Gal.</hi> 3. 15. that is,
cannot do so Lawfully, much less can one man disanull
a Nations Covenant. 5. They are National <hi>Attestations</hi> of
God as a Witness, for the perpetuity as well as fidelity of
these Sacred Engagments. All such Covenants, wherein
the Holy Name of God is invocated as Witness, are ouned
of God as His (hence the Covenant betwixt <hi>David.</hi> &amp; <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi>
is called the Covenant of the Lord 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 8. and
<hi>Zedekiahs</hi> fault was the breach of the Lords Covenant <hi>Ezek.</hi>
17. forecited. So likewise that Covenant mentioned <hi>Ier.</hi>
34. 8, 9, 10. wherein the Princes &amp; People did swear to let
their <hi>Hebrew</hi> Servants go free, is called <hi>Gods, Covenant. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi>
18. and upon this account sorer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Judgements are threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>vers. 19, 20. And I will give the men that have transgressed
my Covenant, which have not performed the Words of the Covenant
which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y had made before me—into the hands of their enemies.</hi>
Certainly this did oblige the posterity, at least not to recall
these Servants, and it was alwayes Morally obliging. So
our National Covenant, sworn with hands lifted up to the
Most high God, being materially also binding, cannot be
abrogated by the posterity, except the Lord renounce His
Interest in them; as long as the Witness liveth then, who
claims them as His, they cannot be made void. Especially
considering. 6. They are National Covenants made <hi>with
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:41139:262"/>
God,</hi> as the other <hi>party</hi> Contracting, in the matters of God,
which none can dispense with, or grant Remissions in; and
therefore they must perpetually bind, until He loose them.
And if even the posterity break them, the Lord will make
them that hate them to reign over them, and He will bring
a <hi>Swosd upon them to aveange the quarrel of His Covenant, Levit.</hi>
26. 15, 17, 25. Such were all the National Covenants of
the Lords people renewed by <hi>Ioshua, Asa, Iehoshaphat,
Hezekiah, Iosiah, Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> for the breaches of
which the Lord plagued the posterity. It was for breach of
their fathers Covenant with God, that the ten tribes were
carried away Captive 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 15. &amp;c. We have already
experienced the threatened Judgments for Covenant-breaking,
and may look for more. 7. They are for their
<hi>matter</hi> National Covenants about things <hi>Moral</hi> objectively,
obliging to joine our selves to the Lord in a <hi>perpetual Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
that shall not be forgotten. Ier.</hi> 50. 5. I might easily demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
all the Articles of the Covenant to be Morally oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but they are demonstrate sufficiently above <hi>Head.</hi> 1.
<hi>Arg.</hi> 11. Therefore they are perpetually binding. 8. They
are for their <hi>Ends</hi> National Covenants inviolably obliging:
which cannot be made void, though they should be broken,
because the ends of them are alwayes to be pursued as is
proved above <hi>Head.</hi> 1. Therefore they are perpetual. 9. They
are for their <hi>formality</hi> National Covenants, most <hi>Solemnly</hi>
Sworn &amp; subscribed by all ranks, with uplifted hands, with
bended knees, with solemn invocating the Name of God,
with solemn preaching, prayer, &amp; praise, rendering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and the posterity obnoxious to the <hi>Curse</hi> if they
should break it. Now the Solemnities of the Oath do ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
the heinousness of the breach of it, as is clear
from <hi>Ier. 34. 19. Ezek.</hi> 17. 18. quoted above: the
reason is, because of their greater deliberation in the
action, and because of the greater scandal accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the violation thereof. Hence as they are National
Oaths &amp; Covenants so solemnized, they are National
<hi>Adiurations</hi> under the pain of a National <hi>Curse,</hi> not to
break them Nationally; Which do make the posterity
obnoxious to it: as <hi>Ioshua</hi> adjuring <hi>Israel,</hi> saying, <hi>Cursed
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:41139:262"/>
be the man that riseth up and buildeth this City Iericho Iosh.</hi> 6. 26.
Which was fulfilled many generations after, in the dayes
of <hi>Ahab,</hi> upon <hi>Hiel</hi> the <hi>Bethelite 1 King. 16. Ult.</hi> So the
Curse of introducing abjured <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> if it be
let in, will be impendent on the Nation. All National
Covenants have a Curse annexed, in case of a breach
when ever it shall be: So in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> Covenant, they
clave to their Brethren, &amp; entered into a Curse, and into
an Oath, to walk in Gods Law, which was given by
<hi>Moses</hi> the Servant of God, and to observe &amp; do all the
Commandments of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Lord our Lord, and His Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
&amp; Statutes, particularly not to enter into affinity
with their Malignant enemies <hi>Neh.</hi> 10. 29, 30. Which
certainly did oblige the posterity, because the thing was
Moral, So in our Covenants we are bound to the same
things, and nothing but these: And therefore the posterity
is lyable to the Curse of perjurie for the breach thereof.
10. They are for their <hi>Legality,</hi> National <hi>Laws,</hi> being
Solemnly Ratified by the Parliament and by the King, and
made the foundation of their Compact with him at his
Inauguration; whereby they became the <hi>fundamental Laws</hi>
of the Government, and among the very <hi>Leges &amp; regulae
regnandi:</hi> which, though they be rescinded by a wicked
Law, yet make the Rescinders chargable not only of
<hi>Perjurie,</hi> in breaking a Covenant, but of <hi>Treason</hi> &amp; <hi>Tyranny</hi>
in breaking and altering the Constitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and render them lyable to the Curse thereof: for
they cannot rescind that, nor escape its vengeance: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have a speaking pledge already, in that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinder
of these Covenants was so terribly rescinded, and
cut off by the hands of unnatural violence; God thereby
fulfilling that threatend Judgment of Covenant breakers,
that he that hath broken His Covenant shall be brought to
destruction, and <hi>bloody &amp; deceitful men shall not live out half
their dayes Psal. 55. 20. ult.</hi> So <hi>Charles the Second</hi> got not leave
to live out half the dayes, that he projected to himself.
11. They are National Engagments of an <hi>Hereditary</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
like that of <hi>Israel Deut.</hi> 29. 14, 15. which did oblige
not only the present, but the <hi>absent,</hi> not only them that

stood there that day before the Lord their God, but the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there is such a <hi>Clause in the Covenant as that it should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual:</hi>

God, the advancement of the Kingdom of—Christ, the honour
&amp; happiness of the King &amp; his posterity, and the true publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,

private condition is included:</hi> and again it is added, for <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of our selves &amp; our Religion from utter ruine &amp; destruction.</hi>
All this is a publick National good. (4) The <hi>matter</hi> is
<hi>Moral,</hi> about materially binding duties, and therefore it
must be hereditary and of perpetual obligation. 12. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
They are National obligations, taking on publick
duties, by way of virtual <hi>Representation of the posterity.</hi> And
they that think it irrational, that the father should repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

are condemned by the Covenants, be false &amp; unlawful
Oaths: But the first is proved: Therefore these Oaths so
opposite to &amp; condemned by the Covenants are false &amp;
unlawful. That they are opposite to the Covenant, will
appear in the induction of all of them. And that, what
ever they be imposed by this party, they are condemned by
the Covenants, wherein we are obliged to make no such
Transactions with them, will appear if we consider these
and the like expressions, that <q>we <hi>shall neither directly nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly,
suffer</hi> our selves to be divided, by whatsoever
suggestion, allurement, or terror, from this blessed
Conjunction, nor shall cast in any let or impediment that

               <p>I. The first in order, which was a Copy to all the rest, was
the <hi>Declaration,</hi> ordained to be subscribed by all in publick
Charge, office or Trust within the Kingdom: <q>Wherein
they do affirme &amp; declare, they judge it unlawful to
Subjects, upon pretence of Reformation or any other
pretence whatsoever, to enter into Leagues &amp; Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
or take up armes against the King—and that all
these Gatherings—petitions, protestations—that
were used—for carrying on of the late troubles, were
unlawful &amp; seditious; And particularly that these Oaths—the
<hi>National Covenant</hi>—and the <hi>Salemn League &amp;
Covenant,</hi> were and are in themselves unlawful Oaths.</q>
Here is a Confederacy required against the Lord, at
which the Heavens might stand astonished; an unpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled
breach of the <hi>Third Command.</hi> Which could no more
be taken in <hi>Truth</hi> &amp; <hi>Righteousness,</hi> than an Oath renouncing
the Bible: but it hath this advantage of the rest; that it is
some what plain, And the iniquity legible on its front.
1. That it is a renouncing of Solemn &amp; Sacred Covenants,
perpetually binding to Moral &amp; indispensable duties, the
wickedness whereof is evident from what is said above.
2. It makes perjurie of the deepest dye, the necessary <hi>sine
qua non</hi> qualification of all in publick Office: who cannot
be presumed capable of administrating Justice, when they
have avowed themselves perjured &amp; perfidious, and not
to be admitted among heathens let be Christians, nor
trusted in a matter of <hi>ten shillings</hi> money, according to the
Laws of <hi>Scotland.</hi> 3. It renounces the whole Work of
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:41139:264"/>
Reformation, and the way of Carrying it on, as a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>
and <hi>trouble</hi> unlawful &amp; seditious: Which if it be a
Trouble, then the Peace they have taken in renouncing
it, must be such a Peace as is the plague of God upon the
heart, filling it with senslessness &amp; stupidity in His just
Judgement, because of the palpable breach of Covenant;
or such a Peace, as is very consistent with the Curse &amp;
vengeance of God, pursuing the quarrel of a broken Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
4. It condemns the taking up armes against the
King, which shall be proven to be duty <hi>Head</hi> 5. Besides,
that hereby the most innocent means of seeking the redress
of Grievances, that Religion, Risings, Law, &amp; practice
of all Nations allowes, is condemned. Yet in effect, for
as monstrous as this Oath is, the Complexe of its iniquity
is couched in the <hi>Oath of Abjuration;</hi> in which many of these
Methods of Combinations, Risings &amp; Declarations of
war against the King, and Protestations against his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
which were used in the late Troubles for carrying
on the Reformation, are abjured; in that a Declaration is
renounced in so far as it Declares war against the King,
and asserts it Lawful to kill them that serve him: Which
yet, in many cases in the Covenanted Reformation here
renounced, were acknowledged &amp; practised as Lawful,
besides that it hath many other breaches of Covenant in it,
as will be shewed.</p>
               <p>II. The next <hi>Net</hi> they contrived to catch Consciences,
was the <hi>Oath of Allegiance &amp; Supremacy:</hi> 
                  <q>Wherein they that
took it, for testification of their faithful obedience to
their most gracious &amp; redoubted Soveraign, <hi>Charles</hi> King
of Great <hi>Britain</hi>—do affirme, testifie, &amp; Declare—that
they acknowledg their said Soveraign, only supreme
Governour of this Kingdom, over all persons, &amp; in all
Causes; And that no forreign Prince—hath any ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
power, or superiority over the same; and
therefore do utterly renounce all forreign power—and
shall at their utmost power defend, assist, &amp; maintain
his Majs. jurisdiction foresaid</q>—and never decline his
power—The iniquity of this Oath is very vast and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
1. It is a Covenant of <hi>Allegiance</hi> with a King,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:41139:265"/>
turned Tyrant and enemy to Religion, Subverter of the
Reformation, and overturner of our Laws &amp; Liberties;
and therefore demonstrate to be sinful both from the first
General Argument against Oaths, and from <hi>Head.</hi> 2. 2. It
cannot be taken in. <hi>Truth, Righteousness,</hi> or <hi>Iudgement:</hi>
beause the words are general &amp; very comprehensive, and
ambiguous, capable of diverse senses: when he is affirmed
to be <hi>supreme over all Persons and in all Causes,</hi> and to be assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
&amp; maintained, in that jurisdiction. Who can be sure
in swearing such an Oath, but that he may thereby wrong
others, wrong Parliaments in their Priviledges, wrong the
Church in her Liberties, and which is worse, wrong the
Lord Jesus Christ who is Supreme alone in some Causes?
Can an Oath be taken in Truth &amp; Righteousness, to assist
him in all encroachments, upon Causes, that are not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
to him? and in invading all those Priviledges of
Subjects, which are Natural, Civil, Moral, &amp; Religious?
for if he be supreme in all Causes, then all these depend
upon him &amp; be subordinate to him. And can it be taken in
<hi>Iudgement,</hi> and with a clear mind, when it may be debated
&amp; doubted (as it is by some) whether the obligation of it is
to be considered, as circumstantiate &amp; specificate to the
present Object of it, supposing him a Tyrant? or in a more
abstract notion, as it might be tendered in the sense of its
first Authors, as it was taken in King <hi>Iames</hi> the 6. his dayes,
And as they plead for taking the <hi>English</hi> Oath of Allegiance,
as it was accepted by the <hi>Puritans</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
whether it obliges to a King in <hi>Idea,</hi> and in a more general
consideration, as one who is said <hi>never to die?</hi> Or with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to such an one as we have, a morta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> man, and an
immortal enemy to all those precious Interests, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of which he only received his Kingship? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it must be taken in that of the Imposers, practically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
by their administrations? or in any other sense, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
more Legal? These would be clear, before it can
be taken with the due qualifications of an Oath. 3. As for
the Civil part of it or Ecclesiastical, no other explanation
needeth to be inquired after, than what they give forth in
their Acts on record: The <hi>Act of Supremacy</hi> (to be seen
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:41139:265"/>
in the Historical Representation of the <hi>Sixth</hi> &amp; last <hi>Period
pag.</hi> 111. senses the Ecclesiastical part of it: And the <hi>Act
for acknowledgment of his Majesties prerogative</hi> does sufficiently
sense, explain, &amp; expound the Civil part; Declaring,
<q>That it is inherent in the Crown, and an undoubted part
of the Royal prerogative—to have the sole choise &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of all Officers of State—the power of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
holding, &amp; dissolving Parliaments, and all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
&amp; Meetings of Estates—the power of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
making of peace &amp; war, treaties &amp; leagues with
forreign Princes or States, or at home by the subjects
among themselves—and that it is high treason in the
subjects—upon whatsoever ground, to rise—in
Armes—or make any treaties or leagues—among
themselves, without his Maj. Authority first interponed
thereto; That it is unlawful to the subjects, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
quality or function, to convocate—them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for holding of Councils to treat, consult, or
determine in any matters Civil or Ecclesiastick (except
in the ordinary Judgements) or make leagues or
bonds upon whatsoever colour or pretence, without
his Maj. special consent—That the league &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and all treaties following thereupon, and acts
or deeds that do or may relate thereunto, are not
obligatory—and that none—should presume,
upon any pretext of any Authority whatsoever, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the renewing or swearing of the said league
&amp; Covenant &amp;c.</q> Whereby it appears, that all this
screwing up the prerogative to such a pitch, is by the
Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to defend all this jurisdiction justified;
and so, these palpable encroachments on the priviledges
of the <hi>Scots</hi> Parliaments, that, by the fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of the Government, alwayes had a share in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Laws, and Peace &amp; War; These robberies of our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
priviledges of defending our selves by Armes, in case
of the Kings Tyranny &amp; oppression, and of Convocating
for Consultations about the best means thereof; And these
Invasions upon our Ecclesiastical priviledges, in keeping
General Assemblies for the affairs of Religion <hi>Prorenata,</hi>
                  <pb n="512" facs="tcp:41139:266"/>
alwayes strenously contended for as a part of the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
yea all these rescindings, repealings, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the Way &amp; Manner, Methods &amp; Measures, of
promoting the Covenanted Reformation, are by this Oath
explained &amp; by this Act acknowledged to be parts of that
supremacy &amp; Jurisdiction to be defended &amp; maintained: As
like wise, by many wicked Acts since promulgated, which
promote the Supremacy to a vast degree of Absoluteness,
which all do interpret what that Supremacy is which is
sworn to be maintained, to wit, pure Tyranny established
by Law. See the many grievous Consequences of this laid
out at large, in <hi>Apol. Relat. Sect.</hi> 10. 4. Here is <hi>absolute</hi>
Allegiance sworn to an <hi>Absolute power,</hi> Paramount to all
Law, engaging to <hi>faithful obedience to</hi> their <hi>Soveraign, as
Supreme over all Persons and in all causes—and to defend,
assist, &amp; maintain his said jurisdiction, and never to decline his
power;</hi> there is no restriction here on obedience, nor Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
on the power, nor definition of the Causes, nor
circumscription of the cases, in which that assistance &amp;c.
is to be given, whether they be Lawful or not. Now ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
allegiance to an absolute power cannot be sworn by
any man of Conscience, nor ouned by any man of reason,
as is proven <hi>Head. 2. Arg.</hi> 6. It cannot be Lawful in any
sense, to swear such an Oath to any Mortal, nay not to a
<hi>David</hi> nor <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> because to swear unrestricted &amp; unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
Allegiance to any man, were a manifest mancipating
of Mankind, not only to an Ass-like subjection, but to a
servile obligation to maintain &amp; uphold the Persons &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of mutable men, be what they will, turn to what
they will; it is known the best of men may degenerate:
And by this no remedy is left to redress our selves,
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t our heads, hearts, and hands all tied up under an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagment
to defend, assist, &amp; maintain whosoever doth
hold the Government, manage it as he pleases. This reason
will also conclude against the <hi>English</hi> Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi>
though it be a great deal more smoothly worded, and
seems only to require a rejection of the <hi>Pope</hi> and legal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the King; yet that comprehensive Clause makes
it border upon absoluteness, <hi>I will bear faith &amp; true allegiance
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:41139:266"/>
to his Maj. heirs &amp; successors, and him and them will defend to
the uttermost of my power, against all Conspiracies &amp; attempts
whatsoever.</hi> There are no Conditions here at all, limiting
the Allegiance, or qualifying the Object; but an arbitrary
imposition of true Allegiance and defence, in all cases,
against all attempts (even that of repressing their Tyranny
not excepted) not only of their persons but of their <hi>Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
if this be not an illimited Allegiance to an absolute
power, I know not what it is. 5. Here is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of the Ecclesiastical Supremacy resident in the
King: which is the most blasphemous Usurpation on the
prerogatives of Christ and priviledges of His Church, that
ever the greatest Monster among men durst arrogate: yea
the <hi>Roman</hi> beast never claimed more; And in effect, it is
nothing else but one of his <hi>Names of Blasphemie</hi> twisted out
of the <hi>Popes</hi> hands by K. <hi>Henry the Eight,</hi> and handed doun
to Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and wafted over to &amp; <hi>Iames</hi> the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. for
that was the Original &amp; conveyance of it. The iniquity
whereof is discovered above <hi>Head. 1. Arg.</hi> 3. But further
may be aggravated in these particulars (1) It is only a change
of the <hi>Pope</hi> but not of the <hi>Poped<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m;</hi> and nothing else but
a shaking off the Ecclesiastical <hi>Pope,</hi> and submitting to a
Civil <hi>Pope,</hi> by whom Christs Head-ship is as much wronged
as by the other: And hereby a door is opened for bringing
in <hi>Poperie</hi> (as indeed by this Strategem it is brought now to
our very doors) for by the Act of Supremacy he hath power
to settle all things concerning Doctrine, Worship, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
or Government, by his Clerks the <hi>Bishops,</hi> having
all the Architectonick power of disposing, ordering, &amp;
ordaining these, as he in his Royal wisdom thinks fit. (2)
By this, Church &amp; State are confounded (whereof the
Distinction is demonstrate above) making the Magistrate a
proper &amp; Competent Judge in Church matters, not to be
declined; wherby also he hath power to erect new Courts,
Mongrel-Judicatories, half Civil half Ecclesiastick, which
have no Warrand in the Word. (3) By this, many palpable
&amp; intollerable encroachments made upon the Liberties &amp;
priviledges of the Church of Christ are yeelded unto; as
that there must be no Church Judicatories or Assemblies,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:41139:267"/>
without the Magistrates consent, but that the power of
convocating &amp; indicting Assemblies do belong only to him,
and the power of delegating &amp; constituting the members
thereof, that he may dissolve them when he pleases; that
his presence or his Commissioners is necessary unto each
Nationall Assembly; that Ministers have no proper decisive
suffrage in Synods, but only of advice; that the Church
Judicatories be prelimited, and nothing mus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be treated
there which may be interpreted grating upon the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
nor any thing whatsoever but what he shall allow &amp;
approve, without which it can have no force nor validity;
yea by this a door should be opened unto the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
&amp; overthrow of all Church Judicatories, seeing
he is made the fountain of all Church power. (4) By this,
the Magistrate is made a Church member as he is a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
and so all Magistrats as such are Church members,
even heathens. And yet (5) By this he is exempted from
subjection to the Ministry, because they are made accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to him in their administrations, and in the discharge
of their function are under him as Supreme. Yea (6) By
this the Magistrate is made a Church Officer, having the
disposal of the Churches Government. And not only so,
but (7) By this he is made a Church Officer of the highest
degree, being supreme in all Causes, to whom Ministers
in the discharge of their Ministrie are subordinate. And so
(8) By this the Church of the new Testament is made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
so long as she wanted a Christian Magistrate,
wanting hereby a Chief Officer; yea and the Apostles did
amiss in robbing the Magistrate of his power (9) By this
the Magistrate might exerce all Acts of jurisdiction, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
by himself; seeing he can do it as supreme by his
Commissioners in Ecclesiastick affairs. (10) Finally By
this Oath the King is made the head of the Church, being
supreme over all persons &amp; in all Causes, unto whom all
Appeals &amp; references must ultimately be reduced, even
from Church Judicatories. Those things are only here
touched they are more apodeictically confirmed above,
and may be seen made out at large in <hi>Apol. Relat. Sect.</hi> 12.
But I proceed. 6. It is contrary unto the Solemn League
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:41139:267"/>
&amp; Covenant; into whose place after it was broken, burnt,
buryed, &amp; rescinded, since they have remitted the subjects
allegiance by annulling the Bond of it, they substitute &amp; sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
this in its place: And therefore none can comply with
the surrogation of the second, except he consent to the
abrogation of the first Oath. All the Allegiance we can oune
according to the Covenant, stands perpetually &amp; expressly
thus qualified, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>defence of Religon &amp; Liberty,</hi> according
to our first &amp; second Covenants, and in its oun nature must
be indispensably thus restricted: Therefore to renew the
same, or take an Oath of Allegiance simply, purposely
omitting the former restriction, when the powers are in
manifest Rebellion against the Lord, is in effect a disouning
of that limitation, and of the Soveraign prerogative of the
Great God, which is thereby reserved; <q>and as much as to
say, whatever Authority command us to do, we shall
not only stupidly endure it, but actively concur with &amp;
assist in all this Tyranny.</q> See <hi>Naph. Prior edit. Pag.</hi> 177.
178. Vindicated at length by <hi>Ius Populi. chap.</hi> 11. By all
this the iniquity of the <hi>Scots</hi> Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> &amp; <hi>Supremacy</hi>
may appear, and also that of the English Oath of Allegiance,
even abstract from the Supremacy, is in some measure
discovered; though it is not my purpose particularly to
speak to that: yet this I will say, that they that plead for its
precision from the Supremacy annexed, seem not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the full import of its terms; for under the <hi>dignities,
superiorities, &amp; Authorities,</hi> there engaged to be upheld,
the Ecclesiastical Supremacy must be included; for that is
declared to be one of the dignities of the Crown there, as
well as here; and hither it was brought from thence. And
therefore those <hi>Scots</hi> men that took that Oath there, and
plead that though the Oath of Allegiance in <hi>Scotland</hi> be a
sin, yet it is duty to take the Oath in <hi>England,</hi> seem to me
to be in a great deceit; for the object is the same, the
subject is the same, the duty expected, required, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
into is the same, and every thing equal in both. Yet
all this iniquity here Couched, is some way Comprehended
in &amp; implyed by the <hi>Oath of Abjuration:</hi> for the Civil part is
imported, in abjuring a Declaration, for its <hi>declaring war
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:41139:268"/>
against the King;</hi> Where it is clear, he is ouned as King,
and all part with them that declare war against him being
renounced, it is evident the Abjurers must take part with
him in that war, and so assist &amp; defend him; for being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
they must not be neutral, therefore if they be not
against him they must be for him, and so under the bond of
allegiance to him: The Ecclesiastical Supremacy is infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from that expression of it, where some are said to <hi>serve
him in Church</hi> as well as in State, which implies an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
subordination to him as Supreme over the Church.</p>
               <p>III. The Tenor of some other <hi>Bonds</hi> was more smooth
&amp; subtil, as that of the <hi>Bond of Peace;</hi> several times renewed
&amp; imposed, and under several forms; but alwayes after
one strain: engaging to <hi>Live Peaceably,</hi> Whereby many
were caught &amp; cheated with the seeming sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ness of these
general terms: but others discerning their fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>laciousness,
refused and suffered for it. This in the General is capable
of a good sense: for no Christian will refuse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o <hi>Live Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,</hi>
but will endeavour, if it be possible, as much as lieth
in them, to <hi>Live Peaceably with all men Rom.</hi> 12. 18. that is,
so far to follow Peace with all men, as may consist with
the pursuit of <hi>holiness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 12. 14. But if we more narrowly
consider such Bonds, we shall find them Bonds of iniquity.
for. 1. They are Covenants of Peace, or Confederacies
with Gods enemies, whom we should count our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and <hi>hate</hi> them because they hate Him <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 21.
It is more suitable to answer, as <hi>Iehu</hi> did to <hi>Ioram 2 King.</hi>
9. 22.—<hi>What Peace, so long as the whoredomes of thy Mother
Iezebel, and her witchcrafts are so many?</hi> than to engage to be
at Peace with those, who are carrying on <hi>Babylons</hi> Interest,
the Mother of harlots &amp; witchcrafts. 2. This cannot be
taken in <hi>Truth, Iudgement,</hi> &amp; <hi>Righteousness,</hi> because of the
fallacy &amp; ambiguity of the terms: for there are diverse sorts
of Peace &amp; Peaceableness; some kind is duty, some never.
It must then be rightly qualified, for we can profess &amp;
pursue no Peace of Confederacy with the enemies of God,
not consistent with the fear of the Lord, otherwise we
cannot expect to have the Lord for a <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> but for a
stone of stumbling <hi>Isai.</hi> 8. 8. 12-14—No Peace ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:41139:268"/>
the Gospel or Testimony, or abstracting from
the duty of the day; No Peace tending to sinful security
<hi>Ier.</hi> 8. 11. No Peace leading to slavish stupidity; No Peace
prompting to preposterous prudence, in palliating sin, or
daubing defections with untempered morter; No Peace
inconsistent with Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they must go together <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 19.
No Peace that may not be followed with <hi>Holiness Heb.</hi> 12.
14. But it must be so qualified, that it be in the Lord, in
Truth, in duty, contributing for the good of the Church
<hi>Psal.</hi> 122. 8, 9. and the fruit of that Wisdom, which is first
<hi>Pure</hi> and then <hi>Peaceable Iam.</hi> 3. 17. Now all that know the
Imposers of these Bonds, will acknowledge that is not the
Peace they are seeking. 3. If we further enquire into their
meaning of <hi>Living Peaceably,</hi> and seek a determinate sense
of it from their Acts &amp; Actings, It is plain they mean such
a Peaceable Living, as gives obedience to their wicked
Laws, and is a Complyance to their established Courses:
And it must be such a Peaceable living, as is opposite to
their sense of <hi>Sedition, Rebellion, Schisme,</hi> &amp;c. Which they
interpret every seasonable duty to be: And it must be such
a Peaceable living, as they were presumed not to have been
observant of before: and what ever it be, must be opposite
to that with which they were charged as turbulent, and so
contrary to all the duties of our Covenanted profession,
as going to meetings, withdrawing from the <hi>Curats</hi> &amp;c.
Which they interpret not to be Peacable living. 4. This
is contrary to our Covenants, which oblige us to a constant
contending with and opposition to them. Yet all this is
engaged into in the <hi>Oath of Abjuration,</hi> which abjures
all war against the King, and all doing injury to them that
serve him, and consequently to Peace &amp; living Peaceably
with them.</p>
               <p>IV. Of Affinity to this were many other Bonds of <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,</hi>
frequently renewed &amp; generally imposed, and that
with unparalelled illegality &amp; rigour; Sometimes by hosts
of Savage <hi>Highlanders;</hi> Sometimes by <hi>Circuit-Courts,</hi> and
by Heretors upon their Tenants, and with such unheard
of involvements, that the Master or Heretor was obliged
for himself, his Wife, Children, Servants, Tenants,
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:41139:269"/>
and all under him, to live <hi>Orderly:</hi> Which in some was
more bluntly expressed, in others more flatly explained,
that they should keep the Publick Ordinances, that is,
hear the <hi>Curats,</hi> and not go to any Seditious Conventicles
(so they called the Persecuted Meetings of the Lords people
for the Worship of God) and in others yet more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
exacted, that they should not harbour, intertain,
or correspond with any that went to these Meetings, but
discover and assist to the apprehending of them. There
were several forms of them from time to time, some long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
some shorter; but all of them, first &amp; last, were to the
same sense &amp; scope. And the most favourably worded had
much wickedness in them: for. 1. They are Covenants
of <hi>Order,</hi> and coming under the same Rule with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which is nothing but their lusts &amp; Mischiefs framed
into Law, not according to the Rule of the Word of God,
but the iniquious Laws of men. 2. They could not be
taken in Truth, Judgement, &amp; Righteousness: for either
they were ambiguous, or their plain sense obliged to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
iniquities, to conforme with all their enacted cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.
3. They are clear breaches of Covenant, which
obliges to another Kind of Orderlyness, and to follow
other Rules, and take none from them in the Matters of
God. 4. They are impossible, and absurd; obliging Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to bind for all under them, that could neither lye in
their power, nor in their duty, to restrain their Liberty in
these Lawful things, and to constrain &amp; compell their
consciences to sin. 5. They are unnatural &amp; cruel, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Takers to partake with them in their persecution
of the Godly. 6. They were engagments to hear <hi>Curats,</hi>
which is proved to be sin <hi>Head</hi> 1. throughout. 7. They
were engagments to withdraw from the Meetings of the
Lords people, proved to be duty. <hi>Head</hi> 4. Yet the Oath
of Abjuration is some way equivalent to this, in that it
obliges the Abjurers to renounce Disorderlyness in their
sense, and to do no harm to the timeserving Orderly Clergy
or Laity, serving &amp; prosecuting their wicked Orders.</p>
               <p>V. Some other <hi>Bonds</hi> of that nature, and <hi>Oaths</hi> frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put to Suffering people when taken Prisoners, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:41139:269"/>
                  <hi>peaceableness</hi> &amp; <hi>Orderlyness,</hi> in this Style, that they
should either tacitely or expressly condemn Some Risings
in Armes, as at <hi>Pentland, Bothwel</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be Rebellion against the
King, and a sin against God, &amp; engage never to rise in Armes against
the King, or any commissionate by him, upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</hi>
The iniquity whereof is manifest: for 1. This is a
Covenant equivalent to a league Offensive &amp; Defensive
with them, obliging never to offend or oppose them, not to
defend nor rescue our Brethren against &amp; from their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
violence. 2. This could not be taken in Truth,
Judgement, &amp; Righteousness: for, who can tell how far
that may extend, <hi>upon any pretence whatsoever?</hi> this may
oblige us to make a stupid surrender of our lives, when the
King turns so Tyrannical as to send his Cut-throats to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them, or Authorizes his bloody Papists to Massacre
us, them we must not resist upon this pretence. 3. It is
contrary to our Covenants, that allow Resistance in some
cases, and oblige to assist &amp; defend all that enter under the
bond thereof. 5. This infers an ouning of the present Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
as the irresistible Ordinance of God, and an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of living peaceably in subjection under it; disproved
above: To which I shall adde a part of that forecited <hi>Letter</hi>
of <hi>Mr Rutherfoords</hi> the 63. in number of the <hi>third part</hi> of his
printed <hi>Letters,</hi> which are a clear vindication of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
&amp; practice of our consciencious Sufferers on this
point [There is a promise &amp; real purpose (saith he) to
live peaceably under the Kings Authority; <q>But (1) yow
do not so answer candidly &amp; imgenuously the mind of
the Rulers, who to your knowledge mean a far other
thing by Authority than yow do; for yow mean his just
Authority, his Authority in the Lord—in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of true Religion, as in the Covenant, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of faith—is expressed from the Word of God;
they mean his supreme Authority &amp; absolute prerogative
above Laws, as their Acts clear and as their practice
is, for they refused to such as were unwilling to subscribe
their bond, to adde, <hi>Authority in the Lord,</hi> or just &amp;
Lawful Authority, or Authority as it is expressed in the
Covenant; but this draught of a petition yeelds the sense
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:41139:270"/>
&amp; meaning to them, which they crave. (2) That Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
for which they contend, is exclusive of the sworn
Covenant; So that except ye had said, ye shall be subject
to the Kings Authority in the Lord, or according to the
sworn Covenant, yow say nothing to the point in hand,
&amp; that sure is not your meaning (3) whoever promises so
much of peaceable living under his Maj. Authority, leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the exposition of the 5. Command—may upon
the very same ground subscribe the bond refused by the
Godly, and so yow pass from the Covenant, and make all
these bypast Actings of this Kirk &amp; State these years by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past
to be horrid Rebellion, and how deep this guilt
drawes consider</q>. 5. This would infer, though the King
should send and kill us, we must not resist, nor defend
our oun lives: yet being an Oath against the Sixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
which enjoineth Natural self preservation, it
should be intrinsecally sinful; and its all one to swear to
non-preservation of self, as to swear to self Murder. 6. I
hope to make it appear in the 5. <hi>Head,</hi> that this is against the
practice of Nations, the Law of Nature, and the Word
of God. Yet all this Complex iniquity is clearly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the <hi>Oath of Abjuration, in terminis</hi> ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uring all war
against the King.</p>
               <p>VI. There were some other <hi>Oaths,</hi> frequently obtruded
upon people, for refusing which they have suffered great
cruelties, that can hardly be described by any name, Nor
can their imposition have a paralel in any age or place, for
illegaltty, inhumanity, arbitrariness, &amp; odiousness.
These were the Oaths of <hi>Inquisition</hi> or <hi>Super inquirendis:</hi>
Whereby people were pressed to answer the Inquisitors,
according to all their knowledge of things, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogate
upon, and delate &amp; discover Intercommuned
persons in their Wanderings, or such whose names were
in their <hi>Porteous Rolls</hi> &amp;c. And power was given to single
Souldiers, to press these Oaths upon whom they pleased.
The iniquity of which is monstrous: for. 1. This was the
worst Kind of Combination with these blood-hound, to
abett &amp; assist, them in their pursuing after the Lords people:
Which is worse than to be bare consenters to such wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:41139:270"/>
or to be onlookers to their affliction in the day of
their Calamity, but like that sin charged upon <hi>Edom,</hi> that
they delivered up those of His that did remain in the day of
distress <hi>Obad. vers.</hi> 13. 14. for these that took Oaths, obliged
themselves to do all they could to deliver up the Remnant
that escaped; and if they did not, no thanks to them, if
they could not, their sin was in their willingness: if they
would not, and yet swore would contribute their help
towards it, by telling of all they knew, that was horrid
perjury &amp; false swearing. 2. This could be no wayes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the qualifications of an Oath; not only because
the matter is wicked &amp; unnatural, to discover may be the
husband or Children or nearest relations, to please men or
save their oun life, which was a great tentation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in it there could be no delibaration in swearing: but
also for the doubtful perplexity confounding the mind, that
they either could not or durst not tell of all they knew, and
yet sware to do it. 3. It is against the Covenant, which
obliges to discover Malignant enemies, and assist our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting
Brethren, and not to discover them, and assist
Malignant enemies: which is a perfect inverting the fourth
&amp; sixth <hi>Articles</hi> of the Covenant. 4. It is contrary to clear
precepts in Scripture, to assist &amp; defend our Brethren, to
make our shaddow as the night in the midst of the noon day,
and hide the Outcast, and <hi>bewray</hi> not him that <hi>wandereth
Isai.</hi> 16. 3. 5. The illegality of this imposition makes it
very absurd, that every pitiful Officer or Souldier should
be impowered to impose &amp; exact Oaths, and impannel &amp;
examine Witnesses, about alledged Criminals. Yet the
monstrousness of this Oath serves to aggravate the <hi>Oath of
Abjuration;</hi> in that the Abjurers do renounce their part of
&amp; disoune the Declarers of that abjured Declaration, and
so do as much as from them is required, to give them up
for a prey to their hunters; yea they declare them Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in that they abjure their Declaration as asserting Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
And consequently they must be obliged to discover
them to their acknowledged Judges.</p>
               <p>VII. The Abominable <hi>Test</hi> comes next: which needs
no other refutation, than to rehearse it: the substance
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:41139:271"/>
whereof was, a Solemn Swearing, that they Ouned &amp;
sincerely professed the true <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, contained
in the confession of faith, recorded in the first Parl. of K.
<hi>Iaemes</hi> the 6—and that <q>they would adhere thereunto all
the dayes of their life—and never consent to any
change or alteration contrary thereto—but renounce
all Doctrines, principles, practices, whether <hi>Popish</hi> or
<hi>Fanatical,</hi> contrary thereto—And they swear that the
King is the only Supreme Governour of this Realme,
over all persons in all causes, as well Ecclesiastical as
Civil,—and promise to bear faith &amp; true allegiance
to the Kings Maj. his heirs &amp; Lawful successors, and to
their power shall assist &amp; defend all rights, jurisdictions,
prerogatives—belonging to them—And affirme
—it—unlawful for subjects upon pretence of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or any other pretence whatsoever, to enter into
Covenants—or to convocate, conveen, or assemble—to
treat, consult, or determine in any matter of State,
Civil or Ecclesiastick, without his Maj. special command—or
to take up Armes against the King, or these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionate
by him—And that there lies no obligation
on them, from the National Covenant, or Solemn League
&amp; Covenant—to endeavour any change or alteration
in the Government, either in Church or State, as it is now
established by the Laws of the Kingdom—and they
shall never decline his Maj. power &amp; jurisdiction—
And finally they swear, that this Oath is given in the plain
genuine sense &amp; meaning of the words, without any
equivocation, mental reservation, or any manner of
evasion whatsoever</q>—This is the Complement
of a wicked Conspiracy, couching in its Capicious bosome
the Complication of all their Mischiefs, comprehending
all &amp; explaining all the former: which indeed cannot be
taken with any equivocating evasion, that can escape ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Stigma</hi> of <hi>nonsense</hi> &amp; self contradiction, or the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of <hi>Atheisme</hi> &amp; irreligion, or the sentence of Divine
vengeance against such baffling the Name of God. The
best sense that can be put upon it, is that which a poor <hi>Sot</hi>
expressed, when it was tendered to him, prefacing thus
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:41139:271"/>
before he took it, <hi>Lord have mercy upon my Soul.</hi> For. 1. It
is not consistent with itself: there being such contradictions
between that <hi>confession of faith</hi> and the following part, that
no man can reconcile: Some whereof may be instanced as
followes. (1) In the 11. <hi>Art.</hi> of that confession, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
of <hi>Christs Ascension</hi> it is said, that Christ is the only
Head of the Church &amp; Just Lawgiver, <q>in which Honours
&amp; Offices if man or Angels presume to intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
we utterly detest &amp; abhore them as blasphemous
to our Soveraign &amp; Supreme Governour Christ Jesus;
and a litle before in that same <hi>Article,</hi> it is said, this
Glory Honour &amp; prerogative He alone among the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
shall possess: And in the 16. <hi>Art. of the Kirk,</hi> Christ
is the only Head of the same Kirk</q>. And yet in the <hi>Test</hi>
the King is affirmed to be the only supreme in all causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical.
(2) In the 14. <hi>Art.</hi> among good works are
reckoned these, <q>to obey Superior powers and their
charges (not repugning to the Commandment of God)
to save the lives of Innocents, to repress Tyranny, to
defend the oppressed; And among evil works these are
qualified, to resist any that God hath placed in Authority
[while they pass not over the bounds of their Office]
And <hi>Art.</hi> 24. it is confessed, that such as resist the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
power, doing that which pertains to his charge, do
resist Gods Ordinance—while the Princes &amp; Rulers
vigilantly travel in the execution of their Office.</q> And
yet in the <hi>Test,</hi> true Allegiance is engaged into without any
such limitations; And it is affirmed to be unlawful, upon
any pretence whatsoever, to <hi>convocate</hi> &amp;c. or to take up
Armes against the King. (3) In the 14. <hi>Art.</hi> Evil works
are affirmed to be, <q>not only those that expressly are done
against Gods Commandment, but those also that, in
matters of Religion &amp; Worshipping of God, have no
other assurance but the invention &amp; opinion of men:</q> And
<hi>Art.</hi> 18. among the Notes of the true Church, <q>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Discipline uprightly ministred, as Gods Word pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes,
whereby vice is repressed, and virtue nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is one: In <hi>Art.</hi> 20. the voice of God and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men are opposed.</q> And yet in the <hi>Test,</hi> they swear
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:41139:272"/>
never to endeavour any change or alteration in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church—as it is now established; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
many things must be altered, yea the whole forme &amp;
frame of it, if these propositions be true, as they are. (4)
In the <hi>Test,</hi> they swear never to consent to any change or
alteration, contrary to that confession, and that all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
&amp; practices contrary thereto are <hi>Popish</hi> &amp; <hi>fanatical</hi> (for
so they divide them into one of these disjunctively) then
must all the following principles in their <hi>Test</hi> be renounced
as such; seeing they are contrary to that confession in some
propositions or Articles; And that the Government esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by that confession was <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and this esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by the <hi>Test</hi> is <hi>Episcopal.</hi> 2. It comprehends all the
former Oaths &amp; Bonds, which are cleared above to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Yet for as wicked as it is, it must be some way ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologated
by the <hi>Oath of Abjuration,</hi> excepting the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
that is in it: Seeing all these oppositions against the
King, sworn aginst in the <hi>Test,</hi> are abjured &amp; renounced
in that <hi>Oath of Abjuration,</hi> in renouncing all Declarations of
war against the King; for if any war can be undertaken
against him, all these Kinds of opposition must be allowed,
that are in the Test sworn against.</p>
               <p>VIII. In the <hi>last</hi> place, I shall come to consider more
particularly the <hi>Oath of Abjuration</hi> it self; for refusing of
which the sufferings were more severe (being extended
even to death or banishment) though the words be more
smooth than in any of the former, which are these <hi>I—do
abjure, renounce, &amp; disoune a late pretended Declaration, affixed
on several Mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at Crosses &amp;c. in so far as it declares War against
the King, and assert it Lawful to kill any that serve his Maj. in
Church, State, Army, or Country.</hi> That the taking of this
Oath is a step of Complyance, dishonourable to God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to the dayes Testimony, contradictory to the many
reiterated Confessions of Christs Worthy (though poor &amp;
despised) Witnesses, sealed by their blood, bonds, &amp; ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
encouraging &amp; gratifying to the Enemies of God,
hardening to backsliding Brethren, offensive to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Righteous, stumbling to all, leaving a stain &amp;
sting upon the Conscience of the Subscriber, I shall endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to make out by these Considerations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="525" facs="tcp:41139:272"/>
1. Considering the <hi>party who imposed it;</hi> it must be looked
upon as a Confederacy with them, being tendered upon all
the Subjects, as a Test of their incorporating themselves
with and declaring themselves for their head, and syding
with them &amp; him, in this their Contest &amp; Contention with
a poor Remnant of the Lords people, persecuted &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by them for Truth &amp; Conscience sake, who issued
forth that Declaration against them, here abjured. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let the party be considered, imposing the Oath with
such rigour, and prosecuting the Refusers with ravenous
rage, murdering &amp; torturing all who did not comply with
them, declaring a Ware more formally &amp; explicitely against
Christ as King, and all that will dare to assert their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to Him, under an open displayed banner of defyance
of Him &amp; His, than ever Mortals durst espouse &amp; avouch:
The head of that Treacherous &amp; Truculent faction, both
he who was first declared against in that Declaration, and
he who hath by bloody &amp; treacherous Usurpation succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him, being such a Monster for Murder &amp; Mischief,
Tyranny, Oppression &amp; Perfidy, that among all the <hi>Nimrods</hi>
&amp; <hi>Nero's</hi> that past ages can recount, we cannot find a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel,
by all Law Divine &amp; humane incapable of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or any Trust, or so much as Protection, or any
Priviledge, but to be pursued by all as a Common enemy
to mankind: And his Underlings, Agents &amp; Complices,
devoted to his lust, &amp; serving his wicked designs, in their
respective offices &amp; places of trust under him, which by his
nomination &amp; sole appointment they have been erected to,
&amp; established in, with the stain &amp; indelible Character of
perjurie, the only qualification of their being capable of any
advancement, occupying by usurpation intrusion &amp; vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
the publick places of judicatories, and carrying all so
insolently &amp; arbitrarly, and with an effrontry of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
&amp; despight of all Reason, Religion, or Justice, that
they cannot but be looked upon as the most pestilent &amp;
pestiferous Plague that ever pestered a People: The taking
then of this Oath, by them projected as a Pest to infect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
with, and pervert them to wicked Truth-desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp; Law-perverting Loyaltie, and imposed as a Test of
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:41139:273"/>
Complyance with them, and coming off from that litle
flock whom they design to devour &amp; destinate to destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
must be in their oun esteem, as well as of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Righteous, to their satisfaction and the others
sorrow, a real incorporating with them, an ouning of their
usurped power as Judges to administer Oaths, giving them
all obedience they required for the time to their Authority,
and all the security they demanded for the Subscribers Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie,
an approving of all their Proceedings in that matter,
and transacting, tampering, &amp; bargaining with these Sons
of <hi>Belial,</hi> out of fear: whereby a right is purchased to that
common badge of their ouned &amp; professed friends, who
(upon taking that Oath) had from them a priviledge &amp; all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owance
to travel &amp; traffique (where and how they will)
through the Country, denyed to all other that wanted that
Badge; I mean the <hi>Pass</hi> or <hi>Testificate</hi> they got from them
thereupon, which was the Mark of that secular beast of
Tyrannie, no less pernicious to the world than Poperie
hath been to the Church; and which was given to all the
Takers of that Oath, as a Mark of <hi>Tessera</hi> that they were no
enemies to the Government, as they call it. O base and
unworthy <hi>Liverie,</hi> for the suffering Sons of <hi>Zion</hi> to put on
the Signature of the Society of her devourers. Hence, if
Covenants &amp; Confederacies, declaring we are on their
side, cannot be made with the Enemies of Religion, then
this Oath could not be taken Lawfully: But the former is
proved above: <hi>Ergo</hi> the latter followes. This will yet
more appear.</p>
               <p>2. If we consider the <hi>Party that set forth that Declaration,</hi>
whom the Proclamation against it represent so odiously &amp;
invidiously whom the Oath imposed obliges us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn;
being so represented, as if they were maintainers
of Murdering Principles, and perpetators of Assassinating
villanies, inconsistent with Peace or any good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and therefore to be exterminated &amp; destroyed out
of the Land, whom therefore they prosecute &amp; persecute
so cruelly to the effusion of their blood, under colour of
Law. 1. The takers of this Oath must have formally,
under their unhappy hand, disouned &amp; renounced them,
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:41139:273"/>
and all part or interest in them, or Society or Sympathie
with them; who yet are known to be the Suffering people
of God, more earnestly contending, witnessing, wrestl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the faith &amp; Word of Christs patience, and have
suffered more for their adherance to the Covenanted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to all its deformations &amp; defections, than any Party
within the Land: yet them have they rejected as their
Companions, though with some of them sometimes they
have had sweet Company &amp; Communion in the House of
God, by abjuring &amp; condemning their deed which duty
&amp; necessity drave them to. 2. Hereby they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously
taken upon them, to pass a Judgement upon
the deed of their Brethren, before their Murdering Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
And that not a private discretive Judgement, but a
publick definitive sentence (in their Capacity) by the most
solemn way of Declaring it, that can be, by Oath &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
under their hand; whereby they have condemned
all the Sufferings of their Brethren, who sealed their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in opposition to this Complyance with their blood,
and finished it with honour &amp; joy, as foolish &amp; frivolous
profusion of their oun blood, Nay as just &amp; legally inflicted
&amp; executed upon them, as being Rebells, of Murdering
Principles &amp; practices: For this cannot be vindicated from
a more than indirect justifying of all the Murdering Severity
executed upon them. 3. And hereby they have unkindly
and unchristianly listed themselves on the other side against
them, and taken part rather with their enemies than with
them; for thus they used to plead fort it, when they pressed
this Oath upon them that scrupled it; When any War is
declared against the King, <q>any of his Maj. Souldiers may
question any man whom he is for, and if he be not for the
King, he may act against him as an enemy, and if they
will not declare for the King and disoune the Rebells,
they are to be reputed by all as enemies.</q> Which, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
weakness be in the arguing, plainly discovers, that
they take the abjuring of that Declaration in that juncture,
to be a mans Declaring of what side he is for, and that he is
not for the Emitters of that Declaration, but for the King
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:41139:274"/>
and his party: which in the present state of affairs, is a
most dreadful ouning of Christs Enemy, and disouning of
His Friends. Hence, a disouning of the Lords persecuted
people, and condemning their practice, and an ouning of
their Persecuters and espousing their side of it, is a sinful
Confederacy: But the taking of this Oath is such, as is
evident by what is said: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is a sinful Confederacy.</p>
               <p>3. Considering the Nature, Conditions, &amp; Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of so solemn &amp; serious a peice of Gods Worship, and
way of invocating His Holy Name, as an Oath is: It will
appear, that the taking of this imposed Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi>
was a dreadful &amp; heinous breach of the <hi>Third Command,</hi> by
taking His Name in vain, in the worst sort, and so cannot
be holden guiltless. I prove it thus: An Oath which cannot
be taken in Truth, Judgement, &amp; Righteousness, is a breach
of the Third Command: But this is an Oath which cannot
be taken in Truth, Judgement, &amp; Righteousness: Which
is evident; for. 1. It cannot be taken by any Consciencious
man in <hi>Truth,</hi> in sincerity of the heart, simplicity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
mind, singleness &amp; honesty in the intention, not puting
any other sense than the imposer hath, and which is the
clear sense of it <hi>sine juramento</hi> and <hi>extra.</hi> For, if he take it
according to their meaning, then he should swear it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
ever to declare War against the King, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
never to rise in Armes against him upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
whatsoever: for, if we may rise in Armes for our
oun defence, we mak &amp; must declare a defensive War. And
indeed, in themselves as well as in their sense &amp; meaning
who imposed them, these two Oaths, never to rise in
Armes against the King, and this of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> are one
and the same. Then also should he swear it unlawful, at
any time, upon any occasion, or for any Cause, to kill any
such as serve the King in Church, State, Army, or Country,
either in Peace or War: for that is their thought, and <hi>sensus
vel juramenti ipsius vel extra juramentum:</hi> And in part, for
their exemption &amp; immunity from all condign punishment,
this Oath was contrived. But in fine, how can this Oath be
taken in Truth; when it is not apparent, either that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
of a War against the King, or killing some for some
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:41139:274"/>
causes (which shall afterwards be made appear to be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful)
that serve him, are to be abjured &amp; disouned? or that
the Declaration does assert any such thing? And indeed it
will be found to be a denying the Truth, and a subscribing
to a manifest falsehood, invoking God to be Witness
thereto. 2. This Oath cannot be taken in <hi>Iudgement,</hi> that
is, with knowledge &amp; deliberation &amp;c. All the terms of
it have much obscure ambiguity, <hi>Declaring a war,</hi> and <hi>killing
any who serve the King,</hi> may be constructed in several senses,
good &amp; bad, but here they are indefinitely expressed, and
universally condemned. Particularly that [<hi>in so far as</hi>] hath
several faces, and can never be sworn in Judgement; For,
if it denote a <hi>Causality,</hi> and signify as much as <hi>quia</hi> or <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus,</hi>
then <hi>all Declarations of war</hi> against any that have the
name of King whatsoever, upon whatsoever grounds,
and <hi>all killing</hi> of any serving him, though in our oun defence,
must be universally condemned, for <hi>a quatenus ad omne
valet Consequentia:</hi> If it import a <hi>restriction,</hi> excluding other
things in the Declaration, but obliging to abjure only that;
then it implies also an affirmation, that these two things
are contained in it, which will not appear to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them that will seriously ponder the Declaration it
self: If again it be a <hi>Supposition</hi> or Condition, and to be
interpreted for <hi>if so be,</hi> then all that the Judgement can
make of it is that it is uncertain, and so the Conscience
dare not invoke God as a Witness of that which is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
whether it be a Truth or a lie. 3. This Oath could
not be taken in <hi>Righteousness:</hi> for the matter is not true,
certainly known, Lawful, possible, weighty, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
useful, &amp; worthy: It is not <hi>true,</hi> that the <hi>Declaration</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<hi>so far as</hi> as it is represented in the Oath of <hi>Abjuration:</hi>
Neither is it <hi>certainly known,</hi> but by collating these two
together the Contrary will appear: Neither is it <hi>Lawful</hi>
(if it were true that such assertions were in it) to abjure all
Declarations of war against the King, and to swear it
unlawful ever to kill any if he be once in the Kings service,
in Church, State; Army, or Country: Nor is it <hi>possible</hi>
to reduce this Assertory Oath into a promissory one Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
as most part of such Oaths may &amp; do necessarely
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:41139:275"/>
imply; for when I swear such a thing unlawful, it implies
my promise, by virtue of the same Oath, never to practise
it; But it is not possible (as the case stands) for a man to
bind up himself in every case from all declared war against
the King, or from killing some imployed in his service;
what if there be a necessary call to joine in armes with the
Lords people, for the defence of their Religion, lives,
&amp; Liberties, against him? what if he command a Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre?
shall not a man defend himself? Nor endeavour to
kill none of that murdering Crew, because they are in his
service? Was ever a fool so fettered? Nor is it of such
<hi>weight,</hi> as to be the occasion of involving the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in perjury or persecution, as by that Oath was done:
Nor was it <hi>necessary,</hi> in this mans time, to make all abjure
a Declaration out of date, when the object of it <hi>Charles the
Second</hi> was dead, and no visible party actually in armes to
prosecute it; Nor was it ever of any <hi>use</hi> or <hi>worth,</hi> except it
were implicitely to gratify their greedy lusting after the
blood of Innocents, or the blood of silly Souls cheated by
their snares, by involving them in the same sin of perjury
&amp; Conscience-debauching false-swearing, whereof they
themselves are so heinously guilty. But let them, and such
as have taken that Oath, and not fled to Christ for a Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
lay to heart the doom of false swearrers, the <hi>flying roll
of the Curse of God shall enter into their house Zech. 5. 4. Love no
false Oath for all these are things that I hate saith the Lord Zech.
8. 17. The Lord will be a swift Witness against false swearers
Mal.</hi> 3. 5. And let them sist their Conscience before the
Word, and set the Word to the Conscience, and these
Considerations will have some weight.</p>
               <p>4. If we consider this Particular <hi>Oath it</hi> self, aud the
words of it more narrowlie, we shall find a Complication
of iniquities in it, by examining the sense of them as the
Imposers expound them. 1. Not only that Declaration,
but all such <hi>in so far as</hi> they declare &amp; assert such things, are
here renounced; and hereby many honest &amp; faithful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
are disouned, that declare the same things. It is
indeed pleaded by some, that profess to be presbyterians,
as it was also pretended by some of the pressers of the Oath
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:41139:275"/>
themselves, but in order to pervert &amp; cheat the Conscience;
that here is not required a disouning of the Apologeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Declaration <hi>simpliciter,</hi> but only <hi>secundum quid,</hi> or
rather of a pretended one of their supposing, <hi>in so far as</hi>
it imports such things: But this is frivolous, for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
one is intended by the Imposers to be the Real
<hi>Apologetical Declaration,</hi> which they will have to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouned,
and cannot be distinguished from it: And though
all these Assertions cannot be fastened upon that <hi>Apologeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Declaration,</hi> but it is evident that it is invidiously misr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented;
yet that same is the pretended one which they
require to be abjured <hi>in so far as</hi> it asserts such things, which
it does not: And if it be <hi>secundum quid</hi> to be disouned, then
that must either be <hi>secundum</hi> that Assertion of <hi>killing any</hi>
&amp;c. Which is not to be found in it, and so it is not to be
disouned at all; or it must be <hi>secundum</hi> the Declaration of
war against the King; And so that <hi>quid</hi> or formal reason of
disouning it, will oblige to disoune all Declarations of
war against the King, which cannot be disouned. Others
again Object, that it is not required to be disouned <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi>
but only <hi>conditionally,</hi> taking &amp; confounding <hi>in so far</hi>
for <hi>if so be:</hi> But to any thinking man it is plain, this cannot
be a <hi>supposition,</hi> nor yet a simple <hi>restriction</hi> (as they would
give it out) but an <hi>assertion</hi> that such things are indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in it; for so the Imposers think &amp; say: And if it
might pass current under that notion, as a supposition,
being equivalent to <hi>if so be,</hi> then under that sophistical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
I might renounce the Covenant, or the most indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Confession or Declaration that ever was, <hi>in so far as</hi>
it contained such things; And so this equivocation might
elude all Testimonies whatsoever, and justify all prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
2. This must condemn all defensive wai of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
against their oppressing Rulers, in that a Declaration
is abjured <hi>in so far as</hi> it declares war against the King: to
press &amp; perswade people to which, it was usually urged by
the Imposers, that when a war is declared by Rebells
against the King, then all the subjects are obliged to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oune
the Rebells, or else be repute for such themselves:
And, when it was alledged the war was ceased, because
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:41139:276"/>
the Object declared against was ceased, <hi>Charles the Second</hi>
being dead, otherwise if a man be obliged to give his
opinion about a war declared against a King deceased &amp;
gone, then by the same parity of reason he must be obliged
to give his opinion of that war of the <hi>Lords of the Congregation</hi>
(as they were called) against Queen <hi>Mary</hi> in the begining
of the Reformation; It was still replyed by them, that the
Rebellion continued, and all were guilty of it that did not
abjure that Declaration: Whence it is evident, they mean
that every thing which they call Rebellion must be disoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and consequently all Resistence of Superiors upon any
pretence whatsoever, as many of their Acts explain it:
yea and it was plainly told by some of them, to some that
scrupled to rake the Oath because they said they did not
understand it, that the meaning was <hi>to swear never to rise in
armes against the King.</hi> Against this it hath been objected by
several, that this was alwayes denied by <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that
ever they declared war against the King, but only for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their lives &amp; Liberties, never agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st the King
<hi>expressy, purposedly, &amp; designedly,</hi> but only against him
<hi>per accidens</hi> when he happened to be the adverse party: But
this distinction will not be a <hi>Salvo</hi> to the Conscience; For
the object declared against, is either a King or not; if he
be not, then a Declaration of war against him is not to be
abjured; if he be King, then he is either declared against
as King <hi>qua Rex</hi> &amp; <hi>perse,</hi> or as an oppressor, or an Abuser
of his power; the first indeed is to be disouned, for a King
as King or Lawful Magistrate must not be resisted <hi>Rom.</hi>
13. 2. But the second, to declare war against a King as an
oppressor and abuser of his power and subverter of the
Laws, hath been ouned by our Church &amp; State many a
time, and they have opposed &amp; declared war as purposedly
against him as he did against them, and as really &amp; formally
as he was an oppres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or: sure he cannot be an oppressor
only <hi>per accidens,</hi> nor does he declare war against the subjects
only <hi>pes accidens:</hi> However this hath been ouned alwayes
by <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that war may be declared against him who
is called King. And therefore to abjure a Declaration
<hi>in so far as</hi> it declares war against the King, will condemn
not only that Declaration upon the heads wherein its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:41139:276"/>
&amp; faithfulness chiefly consists, but all other most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
&amp; honourable Declarations, that have been made &amp;
emitted by our worthy &amp; renouned Ancestors, and by our
Worthies in our oun time, who have formally, avowed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
&amp; explicitely, or expressly, purposedly, &amp; designedly
declared their opposition to Tyranny &amp; Tyrants, and their
Lawful &amp; laudable designs to repress, depress, &amp; suppress
them, by all the wayes &amp; means, that God, &amp; Nature,
and the Laws of Nations allow, when they did <hi>ipso jure</hi>
depose &amp; exauctorate themselves from all Rule, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
or prerogative of Rulers, and became no more
Gods ministers but <hi>Beelzebubs</hi> vicegerents, and Monsters
to be exterminated out of the Society of Mankind. The
honestest of all our Declarations of defensive war, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
run in this strain; And others, insinuating more
preposterous Loayltie, have been justly taxed for asserting
the Interest of the Tyrant, the greatest enemy of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarers,
and principal object of the declared war; which
disingenuous jugling &amp; foysting in such flattering &amp; falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
distinctions in the State of the Quarrel, hath ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
been thought one of the procuring Causes or Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the discomfiture of our former Appearances, for
the Work of God &amp; Liberties of our Country, 3. This
must infer an ouning of his Authority as Lawful King;
when the Declaration disouning him is abjured <hi>in so far as</hi>
it declares war against his Majestie, for in this Oath he is
styled and asserted to be King, and to have the Majestie of
a Lawful King, and therefore must be ouned as such by all
that take it: which yet I have proved to be sinful above
<hi>Head.</hi> 2. Against this it hath been quibbled by some, that
that Declaration does not declare war against the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<hi>as King,</hi> but only against <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> by them
declared to be no King who set forth the Declaration.
But this will not salve the matter; for then (1) It is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
to a lie, in abjuring a Declaration <hi>in so far as it</hi> did
declare a thing, which it did not, if that hold. (2) The
enemies impose the abjuring &amp; disouning of it, <hi>in so far as</hi>
it declares war against their King, who had none other
but <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> at that time, who was the King in their
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:41139:277"/>
sense; and an Oath cannot be taken in any other sense,
contradictory to the Imposers, even though by them
allowed, without an unjustifiable equivocation. (3)
Though he had been King, and had not committed such
acts of Tyranny as might actually denominate him a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
&amp; forefeit his Kingship; yet to repress his illegal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrariness
&amp; intollerable enormities, and to repel his unjust
violence, and reduce him to good order, Subjects, at least for
their oun defence, may declare a war expresly, purposedly
&amp; designedly against their oun acknowledged King: This
ought not in so far to be disouned; For then all our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
emitted, during the whole time of prosecuting
the Reformation, in opposition to our King: would be
disouned: And so with one dash unhappily the whole
Work of Reformation, and the way of carrying it on, is
hereby tacitely &amp; consequentially reflected upon &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
if not disouned. 4. It must infer an ouning of
the Ecclesiastical Supremacy, when it asserts that some
do <hi>serve the King in Church</hi> as well as in State: there is no
Distinction here, but they are said to serve him the same
way in both. And it is certain they mean so, and have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
so much in their Acts, that Church men are as
subordinate, and the same way subject to the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
as Statsmen are. The absurdity &amp; blasphemy
of which, is discovered above. 5. This condemns all
<hi>killing of any that serve the King,</hi> in Church, State, Army,
or Country: for a Declaration is abjured <hi>in so far as</hi> it asserts
it Lawful to kill any such; And so by this Oath, there is an
impunity secured for his Idolatrous priests, and Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
varlets, that serve him in the <hi>Church;</hi> for his bloody
Councellors, and Gouned Murderers, that serve his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
designs in the <hi>State;</hi> for his bloody <hi>Lictors</hi> &amp; Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners,
the Sword men, that serve him in the <hi>Army,</hi>
whom he may send when he pleases to murder us; and for
his bloody <hi>Iust-asses,</hi> Informers, &amp; Intelligencing Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants,
the <hi>Ziphites,</hi> that serve him in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
All these must escape bringing to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ign punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
contrary to the 4. <hi>Art.</hi> of the Solemn League &amp;
Covenant, and shall be confuted <hi>Head.</hi> 6. Against this it
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:41139:277"/>
is excepted by the Pleaders for this Oath, that it is only a
declared abhoring of Murdering principles, which no
Christian dare refuse; And it may be taken in this sense saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it is to be abjured <hi>in so far as</hi> it asserts it Lawful to
kill all that are to be imployed by his Maj. or any <hi>because so
imployed,</hi> in Church, State, Army, or Country; Which
never any did assert was Law-ful: But though Murdering
principles are indeed alwayes to be declaredly abhorred,
and all Refusers of that Oath did both declare so much, and
abhorred the thoughts of them; yet this evasion is naught,
for (1) The Declaration asserts no such thing, neither for
that cause nor for any other, but expressly makes a distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
between persons under the <hi>Epithet</hi> of bloody cruel
Murderers, and these only whom it threateneth to animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
upon. (2) The only reason of their declared intent
of prosecuting these, whom they threaten to bring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
punishment, was because they were so imployed by
the Tyrant in such service, as shedding the blood of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
Murdering people where they met them; And so
thats the very reason for which they deserve to be killed,
and therefore foolish, impertinent, and very absurd to be
alledged, as a qualification of the sense of that impious
Oath.</p>
               <p>5. If we consider the <hi>Proclamation</hi> enjoining this Oath,
and narrating and explaining the Occasions &amp; causes of it,
all these reasons against it will be confirmed; and it will
further appear, that the Proclamation it self is indirectly
approved. For though it might be sustained: in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract,
that we may &amp; must renounce such Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
founded on Principles inconsistent with Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and bearing such inferences as are specified in that
Proclamation: yet complexly considering what they mean
by Government, and what sort of Societie that is, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
whereof is said to be infringed by that Declaration,
And what is the Scope of that Narrative; A renouncing
of a paper contradictory thereto, must be in so far a tacite
approbation of that Proclamation. For that Oath which
renounceth what is contrary to such a Proclamation, does
justify the Proclamation: But this Oath renounces what
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:41139:278"/>
is contrary to the Proclamation, and that only: <hi>Ergo</hi> it
justifies the Proclamation. It is entituled, as it was really
designed, for <hi>discovering such as oune or will not disoune the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Declaration,</hi> by them falsely nicknamed, <hi>a late treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Declaration of war against his Majestie, and the horrid prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Assassination.</hi> And the body of it discovers such
hell-bred hatred of &amp; malice against that poor party, desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
in their design to final &amp; total destruction, and layes
doun such Contrivances for their discovery and ruin, that
the heads &amp; hearts of the Inventors &amp; Authors may seem to
be possessed &amp; inspired with the Devils immediatly assisting
Counsell, and the Clerks pen that drew it up to have been
dipt in the <hi>Stygian</hi> lake and the Gall &amp; venome of hell: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
the Emitters &amp; Abetters &amp; Spreaders of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
and all who have been joined in any of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
and all who either will oune or scruple to disoune
the said Declaration, in the manner by them tendered &amp;
imposed, (which are the Generality of the most tender &amp;
consciencious Christians in the Land) under all the vilest
&amp; most abominable &amp; odious terms, their malice could
invent; as if they were <q>Insolent &amp; desperate Rebells,
associated under a pretended forme of Government, who
had formerly endeavoured to disguise their bloody &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable
principles, but now had pulled off the mask,
and who think it a duty to kill &amp; Murder all who do any
manner of way serve the present Rulers, or bear charge
under them; who maintain principles inconsistent with
all Government &amp; Society, and tending to the destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the lives of their Loyal &amp; honest subjects; Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous
&amp; assassinating principles &amp;c. who now have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
their hellish intentions, and for the better perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of their mischievons designs, do lurk in secret,
and are never discerned but in the acts of their horrid as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinations,
and passing up &amp; doun among the Kings Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yal
subjects, take opportunity to murder &amp; assassinate,
like execrable Rebells; And Calling that Declaration,
an execrable &amp; damnable Paper &amp;c.</q> All which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable
&amp; damnable lies, and forgeries of the father of
them, and a Charge which all their Sophistrie can never
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:41139:278"/>
make out in any particular: Yet by them amplified to a
swelling hight of heinousness; And among other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
aggravated from their frequent refusing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated
Offers of their Clemency, by which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their contempt of their presumptuous, Christ-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
and Church-destroying <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and their not
submitting to their insnaring &amp; base <hi>Indemnities,</hi> or their
conscience-cheating Bonds &amp; Oaths by them so finely
busked. From these impudently pretended premises, in
their falsly forged viperous Narative, they lay doun
their bloody Methods &amp; Measurs for prosecuting that
poor people, with all rigour of Savage Severity; Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that whosoever shall oune that Declaration, and
the <q>
                     <hi>principles therein specified</hi>
                  </q> (which is a lager Dilatation
of their meaning, than their pretended restriction [<hi>in so
far as</hi> &amp;c.] and gives a further discovery of the intent of the
Oath, that gives a Covert stroke to all the principles of our
Reformation which are reductively specified in that Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
or whosoever shall refuse to disoune the same—
shall be execute to the death; And <q>commanding all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to concur, and do their utmost endeavour, to seek,
search, delate, &amp; apprehend all such, under the sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
penalties of the Laws; And to difference the good
from the bad (meaning their oun Associates &amp; friends,</q>
from Christs followers) by discriminating signs, <q>Declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it their pleasure, and requiring all past the age of six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years, not to presume to travel without <hi>Testificates</hi> of,
their Loyaltie &amp; good principles, by taking the Oath of
Abjuration; whereupon they are to have a Testificate
which is to serve for a free <hi>Pass,</hi> with certification to all
that shall adventure to travel without such a Testificate,
shall be holden &amp; used as Concurrers with the said Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells;
Commanding all Heretors &amp;c. to give up the lists of
the names of all under them, before the Curate; Declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if any shall refuse to concur in such service, shall be
holden as guilty of the foresaid crimes &amp; punished accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
And strictly prohibiting, all to harbour, lodge, or
intertain any, unless they have such certificates under
the same pain; And for encouragment to any that shall
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:41139:279"/>
discover or apprehend any to be found guilty as above
said, ensuring to them the sum of 500 Merks <hi>Scots</hi> for
each of them.</q> This is that hell-hatcht Proclamation, so
grievous for its effects, so dreadful for its designs, so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
for its absurdities, that the like hath not been seen:
Whereby not only the countries Interest &amp; Trade hath
been prejudged, by compelling all to have a <hi>pass</hi> in time of
peace, and these to be procured at exorbitant rates, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
poor people; Not only common <hi>Hostlers</hi> &amp; <hi>Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers</hi>
are made Judges, impowered to impose Oaths
upon Passengers for their passes, that they be not forged;
but many consciences coozened, cheated, wounded, &amp;
insnared, and the whole Land involved in sin. But they
that took this Oath have approved &amp; justified this detestable,
execrable, bloody Proclamation, the supurious spawn of
the Devills venome against Christ followers: For, they
gave all the Obedience to it that was required of them in
their Capacity, And obedience justifies the Law enjoining
it: They have done all was required, or could be done by
them, to answer the design of it in their circumstances;
And consequently by doing the thing prescribed, they have
justified the grounds upon which the prescript was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the methods by which it was prosecuted, which
hath a dreadful Medley of iniquitie in it. Hence (1) They
have subscribed to all these Odious Characters wherewith
they branded that poor persecuted party, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
them as Insolent, desperate Rebells, Murderers,
bloody Assassins &amp;c. (2) In disouning that Declaration,
they have disouned the principles therein specified, and
consequently all the Testimonie against this Usurping
faction of Overturners of the Work of Reformation, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
&amp; passive, that have been given &amp; sealed by the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Servants of God, since this Catastrophe, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Defensive Armes, and our Covenants, and several
others which are therein specified. (3) They have given
their consent to all the concurrence there required, for
seeking, searching, delating, &amp; apprehending of these
people, and to all the cruel villanies committed against
them. (4) They have taken on their prescribed discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:41139:279"/>
Sign of Loyaltie, and of being repute by them
men of good principles, that is, their friends, men for
the times: Which is so sinful &amp; scandalous, that it is
shameful to hint at them, and yet shameful to hide them.</p>
               <p>6. If we consider the <hi>Apologetical Declaration</hi> it self,
which is so bespattered, and so odiously represented, and
so rigorously enjoined to be abjured; who will more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
look into it, and ponder &amp; perpend the purpose &amp;
Scope of it, will see nothing that can be abjured conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
in it, but the whole of it, laying aside prejudice &amp;
invidious Critical Censoriousness, capable of a fair &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
Construction. The <hi>Motives</hi> leading them to set
it forth, being only their desires and just endeavoures to
<hi>prosecute,</hi> and secure themselves in the prosecution of, <hi>Holy
Commanded Duties,</hi> and <q>to keep a standing Testimony,
against the Insolencie of those that are given up of God,
to lay out themselves in promoving a Course of profanity
&amp; persecution,</q> notwithstanding of all their viperous
threatenings. Their <hi>Measures</hi> being none other, than <q>the

National and Solemn Covenants,</q> lying with their bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
force indispensable upon all of us, and obliging us to
endeavour all thats there declared, as being bound for ever
to have common friends &amp; foes with our Covenanted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
to all which they declare &amp; avouch their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
adherence, And their oun former Declarations,
Disouning their Allegiance to, &amp; Authority of a Man who
had <hi>ipso jure</hi> forfeited all Authority, by his intollerable Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie,
Perjurie, &amp; perfidious breach of Trust, reposed

all the fundamental constitutions of the Government,
perverting, inverting, &amp; everting all Laws, all Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
all Priviledges of Church &amp; State, all establishments
of our Covenanted Work of Reformation, all Securities
of our life and enjoyments whatsoever, Usurping to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
an absolute Tyrannical Civil Supremacy, inconsistent
with the safety or freedom of the people, and a monstrous
blasphemous Ecclesiastical Supremacy; Upon which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:41139:280"/>
to endeavour to make good their freedom &amp;
emancipation from that yoke which they had cast off, they
behoved to resolve upon defensive resistence, against him
and his bloody emissaries; Which war being declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they only in this Declaration testified their unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
approbation of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> adherence to, and resolutions for
prosecuting the same, against him &amp; his accomplices, such
as lay out themselves to promove his wicked &amp; hellish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs:
By which <hi>war</hi> they do not mean a formed stated &amp;
declared <hi>Insurection</hi> with hostile force, to break the Peace
of the Nation, and involve all in blood, but a resolved
avowed constant <hi>Opposition</hi> to the Murdering violence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
oppression, &amp; persecution of this wicked faction,
now raging rather than reigning, who have declared &amp; still
prosecute a declared war against Christ, bearing doun His
Work &amp; Interest in the Land; <q>And a constant endeavour,
in opposition to them, to pursue the ends of our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
in standing to the defence of the Glorious Work
of Reformation, and their oun lives; And in the defence
thereof, to maintain the cause &amp; Interest of Christ against
His enemies, and to hold up the Standard of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, (meaning the Gospel &amp; the Word of our Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,)
whereunto they looked upon themselves as bound
&amp; obliged by their holy Covenants, being therein dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the Lord in their persons, lives, Liberties, &amp;
fortunes, for defending &amp; promoving this Glorious Work
of Reformation, notwithstanding of all opposition, that
is or may be made thereunto, and sworn against all neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality
&amp; indifferency in the Lords Matters: Whereunto
they beseech, invite, &amp; obtest, all them who wish well
to <hi>Zion</hi> to a concurrence &amp; concerting the same cause &amp;
Quarrel.</q> In maintaining of which opposition against such
wicked Enemies, because by them they were restlessly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
and hunted, and Murdered wherever they were found,
neither could find any harbour or hiding place in any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the country, for Searchers, Informers, &amp; Justiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
who still stirred up the country to raise the <hi>hue &amp; Crye</hi>
after them, and caused them to be delivered up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them to the Courts of their Murdering enemies,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:41139:280"/>
whereby much innocent blood was shed; Therefore, to stop
their Career of violence, and deter them from such Courses,
they found it necessary to threaten them with more active &amp;
vigorous opposition, and that they might expect to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as they deserved. Wherein they are far from ouning
assassinating principles, or practising assassinations; for they
give only open &amp; plain warning, and advertisement to the
world, of their necessitated endeavours to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and prevent the Murder of their Brethren: And can
no way be charged, with asserting it Lawful, to kill all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the Kings service in Church, State, Army, or
Country, as the Proclamation in viperous invective Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
misrepresents the Declaration, <q>but on the contrary
do jointly &amp; unanimously declare, they detest &amp; abhor
that hellish principle of killing such as differ in judgement
from them, and they are firmly &amp; really purposed, not to
injure or offend any whomsoever,</q> but such as are directly
guilty of, or accessory to the Murder of their Brethren:
whom yet they mind not to assassinate or kill tumultuarly,
but to prosecute them with all the legal formalities, that
Justice in their Capacity, and the times disorder &amp; distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
condition, will allow; Expressly declaring, that <q>they
abhor, condemn, &amp; discharge all personall attempts
upon any pretext whatsomever, without previous deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations,
common consent, certain probation of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
witnesses, or the guilty persons confession</q>. Neither
could it ever be supposed, that they threaten all imployed in
the Kings service with this sort of handling, but some select
&amp; expressly distinguished Kind of Notorious villains, men
of death &amp; blood, openly avowing &amp; vaunting of their
Murders: and these they distinguished into several Classes,
according to the respective aggravations of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
In the first, they place those that Murder by <hi>Command,</hi>
                  <q>under pretext of an usurped Authority, as Councellours,
Justiciary, &amp; Officers of their forces, or bands of Robbers &amp;
not all nor any of these neither but the <hi>cruel &amp; bloody.</hi>
                  </q> In the
second Class, they threaten such as are actually in armes
against them of an inferior rank; And such Gentlemen,
and Bishops, &amp; Curats, as do professedly &amp; willingly serve
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:41139:281"/>
them to accomplish &amp; effectuate their Murders, by <hi>obeying</hi>
their commands, making searth for these poor men, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them up, instigating, informing, and witnessing against
&amp; hunting after them: &amp; not all these neither, but such as
cruelly prosecute that service, to the <hi>effussion of their blood.</hi>
Neither do they threaten all equally, nor any of them
peremptorly, but that continuing after the publication of
<q>this their Declaration obstinately &amp; habitually in these
courses (Plainly declaring they intended no hurt to them
if they would hold up their hands) they would repute them
as enemies to God &amp; the Reformation, and punish them
as such, according to their power, and the degree of their
offence; Withall leaving room for Civil &amp; Ecclesiastical
satisfaction, before Lawful &amp; settled Judicatories, for
the offences of such persons,</q> as their power may not
reach &amp;c. And as unwilling to be necessitated to such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Courses, and earnestly desirous they be prevented,
they admonish them with sorrow &amp; seriousness, of the sin
&amp; hazard of their wicked Courses; and protest, that only
Necessity of self preservation, and zeal to Religion, lest it
should be totally rooted out by their insolency, did drive
them to this threatening Declaration, and not because they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
were acted by any sinful spirit of revange. This is all that
is contained in that Declaration. And if here be any thing
there so odious &amp; execrable, to be so solemnly abjured,
renounced, &amp; abhorred in the persence of God, for the
pleasure of and in obedience to the will of His &amp; our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
let all unbyassed Considerers impartially weigh, or
any awakened Conscience speak, and I doubt not but the
swearing &amp; subscribing this Oath will be cast &amp; condemned.
I shall say nothing of the necessity, or conveniency, or
expediency, or formality of this Declaration: but the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of the matter complexely taken is so undeniable,
that it cannot be renounced without condemning many
very Material Principles of our Reformation: Only Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
&amp; Incapacity is wanting to justify the manner, whole
proceedure, formality, and all the Circumstances of the
business; If either the Declarers themselves, or any other
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="543" facs="tcp:41139:281"/>
to make good the undertaking, had issued out such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
in the same terms, and had prevailed &amp; prospered
in the Project, many that have now abjured it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
&amp; applaud it. But passing these things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
to the consideration in hand, it is the matter that
they required to be abjured &amp; condemned, it is that the
enemies quarrelled at, and not the inexpediency or infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
of it: And it must be taken as they propound it,
and abjured &amp; renounced by Oath as they represent it: And
therefore the iniquity of this subscription will appear to be
great, in two respects: First in denying the <hi>Truth:</hi> Secondly
in subscribing to, &amp; swearing a <hi>Lie.</hi> 1. They that have taken
that Oath have denied &amp; renounced the matter of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration;
which is Truth &amp; duty, and a Testimony to
the Cause of Christ, as it is this day Stated &amp; Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
in the Nation, founded upon former (among us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted)
precedents &amp; Principles of Defensive Wars,
disouning Tyranny, &amp; repressing the insolency of Tyrants
&amp; their Accomplices; the whole matter being reducible to
these two Points, Declaring a resolved endeavour of
breaking the Tyrants yoke from off our neck, thereby
asserting our oun &amp; the posterities Liberty &amp; freedom from
his insupportable &amp; entailed slavery; And a just Threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to curb &amp; restrain the insolency of Murderers, or to
bring them to condign punishment: Whereof as the first
is no wayes repugnant, but very consonant to the <hi>Third
Article;</hi> So the Second is the very duty obliged unto in
the <hi>Fourth Article</hi> of our Solemn League &amp; Covenant. But
all this they have denied by taking that Oath. 2. By taking
that Oath, they have sworn &amp; subscribed to a <hi>Lie,</hi> taking
it as they represent it, abjuring it <hi>in so far as</hi> it declares &amp;c.
&amp; asserts it is Lawful to kill all imployed in the service of
the King, in Church, State, Army, or Country: which
is a manifest Lie, for it asserts no such thing. Neither will
any other sense put upon the words <hi>in so far as</hi> salve the
matter; for as thereby the Takers of the Oath shall deal
deceitfully, in frustrating the end of the Oath, and the
design of the Tenderers thereof; And to take an Oath
<hi>quatenus, eatenus,</hi> in so far, will not satisfie as <hi>Voetius</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:41139:282"/>
                  <hi>de Pol. Eccl. P.</hi> 213. So let them be taken which way
they can, either for <hi>in quantum,</hi> or <hi>quatenus,</hi> or <hi>si modo,</hi> it is
either a denying the Truth, or subscribing a Lie: And
Consequently, these poor people suffered for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that Refused it.</p>

               <head>HEAD. IV. The Sufferings of people for frequenting Field
Meetings Vindicated.</head>
               <p>HItherto the <hi>Negative</hi> Heads of Sufferings have been
vindicated: now follow the <hi>Positive,</hi> founded
upon Positive duties, for doing, and not denying,
and not promising &amp; engaging to relinquish which, many
have suffered severely. The first both in order of nature
and of time, that which was first and last, and most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
most constantly, most universally, and most
signally sealed by Sufferings, was that which is the clearest
of all, being in some respect the Testimony of all Ages,
and which clears all the rest, being the Rise &amp; Root,
Cause &amp; Occasion of all the rest; to wit, the Necessary
duty of hearing the Gospel, &amp; following the pure &amp; power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
faithfully dispensed Ordinances of Christ, banished
out of the Churches to private houses, and persecuted out
of houses to the <hi>Open Fields,</hi> and there pursued &amp; opposed,
and sought to be suppressed, by all the fury &amp; force, rigour
&amp; rage, Cruelty &amp; Craft, policy &amp; power, that ever
wicked men, madded into a Monstrous Malice against
the Mediator Christ and the Coming of His Kingdom,
could contrive or exert: yet still followed &amp; frequented,
ouned &amp; adhered to, by the Lovers of Christ &amp; serious
seekers of God, even when for the same they were killed
all day long, and counted as sheep for the slaughter, and
continually oppressed, harrassed, hunted, and cruelly
handled, dragged to Prisons, banished &amp; sold for slaves, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:41139:282"/>
&amp; Murdered. And after, by their fraudulent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of ensnaring Indulgences &amp; Indemnities, and a
Continued tract of Impositions &amp; Exactions, and many
Oaths &amp; Bonds, they had prevailed with many, and even
the most part both of Ministers &amp; Professors, to abandon
that necessary duty; And even when it was declared <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi>
by Act of Parliament, and interdicted under pain of
death, to be found at any <hi>Field Meetings;</hi> they neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
persisted in an undaunted endeavour, to keep up the
Standart of Christ, in following the Word of the Lord
wherever they could have it faithfully preached, though at
the greatest of hazards: And so much the more, that it was
prosecuted by the rage of enemies, and the reproach &amp;
oblequies of pretended friends, that had turned their back
on the Testimony, and preferred their oun ease &amp; Interests
to the cause of Christ; and with the greater fervor, that
the Labourers in that Work were few, and like to faint
under so many difficulties. What the first Occasion was
that constrained them to go to the fields, is declared at
length in the Historical Deduction of the Testimony of the
<hi>Sixt Period;</hi> to wit, finding themselves bound in duty, to
Testifie their Adherence to &amp; Continuance in their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
profession, their Abhorrence of Abjured Prelacy,
and their Love &amp; Zeal to keep Christ &amp; His Gospel in the
Land; after they had undergone &amp; endured many hazards
&amp; hardships, oppressions &amp; persecutions, for Meeting in
the houses, where they were so easily attrapped, and with
such difficulty could escape the hands of these Cruel Men;
they were forced to take the Fields, though with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
inconveniences of all Weathers without a shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
yet proposing the advantages, both of <hi>Conveniency</hi> for
Meeting in greater Numbers, and of <hi>Secrecie</hi> in the remote
recesses of Wild Moors &amp; Mountains, and of <hi>Safety</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
themselves to inaccessible Natural Strengths, safest
either for flight or resistence, And withal having occasion
there to give a <hi>Testimony</hi> for the Reformation with greater
freedom. And to this very day, though many have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Liberty to meet in houses, under the security of a
Mans promise whose principle is to <hi>keep no faith to Hereeicks,</hi>
                  <pb n="546" facs="tcp:41139:283"/>
and under the shelter &amp; shadow of an Antichristian <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration;</hi>
yet there is a poor people that are out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of this favour, whom all these forementioned rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
do yet oblige to keep the fields, that is both for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency,
Secrecy, and Safety; they dare not trust those
who are still thirsting insatiably after their blood, nor
give them such advantages as they are seeking to prey upon
them, by shuting themselves within houses; And mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
they take themselves to be called indispensably, in
the present Circumstances, to be as publick, or more than
ever, in their Testimony for the Preached Gospel, even
in the open Fields. Now this would be a litle cleared: And
to essay the same, I would offer first, Some <hi>Concessions.</hi>
Secondly some <hi>Postulata</hi> or Supposed Grounds. Thirdly
some more Special <hi>Considerations</hi> which will conduce to
clear the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That we may more distinctly understand what is
the duty here pleaded for, and what is that which these
people Suffer for, here Vindicated; let these <hi>Concessions</hi>
be premised.</p>
               <p>1. Now under the Evangelical Dispensation, there is
no place more Sacred than another, to which the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God is astricted, and which He hath chosen for His
House &amp; Habitation, whither He will have His people to
resort and attend, as under the Legal &amp; Typical Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
was ordered: there was a place where the Lord
caused His <hi>Name to dwel Deut.</hi> 12. 5, 11. But now, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Mountain nor at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the Father will be
Worshipped, but every where and any where <hi>in Spirit &amp;
in Truth Iohn.</hi> 4. 21, 23, 24. And the Apostle wills that
men <hi>pray every where,</hi> lifting up holy hands, without wrath
&amp; doubting 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. We abhor therefore the <hi>English</hi>
&amp; <hi>Popish</hi> Superstition of Consecrated places, and assert that
all are alike in this respect, houses or fields.</p>
               <p>2. In the Constitute case of the Church, or when ever
it can be obtained, Order, Decency &amp; Conveniency doth
require that there be appointed places, sequestrate &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
for the Meetings of the Lords people, according
to that General Rule, <hi>Let all things be done decently &amp; in order
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:41139:283"/>
1 Cot. 14. ult.</hi> And in that case private <hi>Conventicles,</hi> set up
in a Schismatical Competition with Publick Churches, are
not to be allowed. But even then, Private Meetings for
prayer &amp; conference, are necessary, Lawful, &amp; Laudable.
But now the Church is broken by a Crew of Schismatical
Intruders, who have occupied the places of Publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
and thrust out the Lods Ministers: It is these we
scare at, and not the place.</p>
               <p>3. Suppose a Magistrate should interdict &amp; Discharge
the publik place of Worship, and restrain from the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
but leave all other places free to meet in; or if he should
prohibite the houses, but leave freedom for the fields; or
discharge the fields, and give Liberty in houses; in that
case we would not contend for the place out of contempt:
though it were duty then to witness against such a Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Injury done to the Church, in taking away their
Meeting places; yet it were inexpedient to stickle &amp; strive
for one <hi>Spot,</hi> if we might have another: then when only
excluded out of a place, and not included or concluded
and restricted to other places, nor otherwise robbed of the
Churches priviledges, we might go to houses when shut
out of Churches, and go to fields when shut out of houses,
and back again to houses when discharged thence. But
this is not our case, for we are either interdicted of all
places; or if allowed any, it is under such confinements
as are inconsistent with the freedom of the Gospel; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
we have to do with one from whom we can take no
orders to determine our Meetings; nor can we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our Liberty to depend on his Authority, or favour,
which we cannot oune nor trust, nor accept of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
from him. Neither is it the place of fields or hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
that we contend for; Nor is it that which he mainly
opposes: but it is the freedom of the Gospel faithfully
preached, that we are seeking to promove &amp; improve, and
he is seeking to suppress. The contest betwixt him &amp; us
is the Service of God in the Gospel of His Son, that we
profess without ouning him for the Liberty of its exercise:
And therefore as an Enemy to the Matter &amp; Object of these
Religious Exercises, which are the eye-sore of Antichrist,
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:41139:284"/>
he prosecutes with such rage the manner &amp; Circumstances
thereof.</p>
               <p>4. Even in this case, when we are persecuted in one
place we flee unto another, as the Lord allowes &amp; directs
<hi>Math.</hi> 10. 23. And if occasionally we find a house, either
publick, or a Church, or a private dwelling house that
may be safe or convenient, or capacious of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
gathered, we think it indifferent to meet there or in
the Fields: But in the present circumstances, it is more
for the conveniency of the people, and more Congruous
for the dayes Testimony, to keep the Fields in their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
even though it irritate the incensed Enemies. Which
that it may appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall offer some <hi>Postulata</hi> or <hi>Hypotheses</hi> to be
considered, or endeavour to make them good, and infer
from them the necessity &amp; expediency of <hi>Field Meetings</hi> at
this time in these circumstances: which consequently vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the Sufferings that have been thereupon Stated form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly,
and are still continued.</p>
               <p>1. It is necessary at all times that Christians should <hi>meet
together,</hi> whether they have Ministers or not, and whether
the Magistrate allow it or not. The Authority of God,
their necessity, duty, &amp; Interest, makes it indispensable
in all cases. It is necessary for their Mutual help, <hi>two are
better than one for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow, Eccles.</hi>
4. 9, 10. It is necessary for their Mutual <hi>encouragment</hi> in an
evil day, to speak often one to another, which the Lord
hath promised to take special notice of <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16, It is
necessary for cherishing Mutual <hi>Love,</hi> which is the New
Commandment, and the badge of all Christs Disciples
<hi>Iohn.</hi> 13. 34, 35. a principle which they are all <hi>thaught of God.
1 Thess.</hi> 4. 9. It is necessary for nurissing <hi>Union</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
together, in order to their being of one mind &amp;
of one mouth, and that they receive one another <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.
5, 6, 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. standing fast in one Spirit, <hi>striving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>
for the faith of the Gospel <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. It is necessary for
<hi>serving one another in Love Gal.</hi> 5. 13. bearing one anothers
burdens, &amp; so fulfilling the Law of Christ <hi>Gal. 6. 2. submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
to one another <hi>Ehphs. 5. 21. 1 Pet,</hi> 5. 5. teaching &amp;

                  <hi>admonishing</hi> one another <hi>Col. 3. 16. comforting</hi> one another
1 <hi>Thess. 4. ult. edifying</hi> one another 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 11. exhorting</hi>
one another <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. It is necessary for <hi>considering</hi> one
another, &amp; provoking unto love &amp; to good works; And
for this end, they must not <hi>forsake the assembling of themselves
together,</hi> as the manner of some is, for that were to <hi>sin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Heb.</hi> 10. 24, 25, 26. Must these things depend on the
Magistrats Allowance? or can they be done without meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together in private or publick? The same reasons do
alike conclude, for the necessity of both. If then there
must be Meetings for these ends necessary at all times,
then when they cannot do it within door, they must do it
without.</p>
               <p>2. There is a necessity for Meeting for <hi>preaching &amp; h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aring
the Gospel;</hi> the enjoyment whereof hath alwayes been the
greatest design &amp; desire of Saints, who could not live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it; therefore they <hi>loved the place where the Lords Honour
dwelt Psal.</hi> 26. 8. This was the <hi>one thing they desired of the
Lord,</hi> and that they would seek after, to behold the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Lord <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 4. for this they <hi>panted,</hi> and their
Soul <hi>thirsted Psal.</hi> 42. 1, 2. without which every Land is but
a thirsty Land, where there is no water, where they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see the <hi>power &amp; the Glory of God</hi> as they have <hi>seen it in the
Sanctuary Psal.</hi> 63. 1, 2. O how amiable are His Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles?
one day in His Courts is better than a thousand else
where <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 1, 10. No gladness to them like that of
going to the House of the Lord <hi>Psal.</hi> 122. 1. A Christian
can not possibly live without Gospel Ordinances, no more
than Children can want the breasts, or the poor &amp; needy
want water when their tongue faileth for thirst; they are
promised it in high places, and in the wilderness, when
they can get it no where else <hi>Isai.</hi> 41. 17, 18. There is an
innate desire in the Saints after it, as new born habes they
desire the sincere milk of the Word 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. So that any
that is offended with them for this, must be offended with
them for being Christians, for as such they must have the
Gospel cost what is will. It is the greatest desire of the
Spouse of Christ, to know <hi>where He feeds</hi> and where to find
the Shepherds tents, where they may rest at noon <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:41139:285"/>
7, 8. And not only in their esteem is it necessary; but in
it self, the Church cannot bear the want of it, for <hi>where
there is no vision the people perish Prov.</hi> 29. 18. and when there
is no open vision, the Word of the Lord is then very <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
1 Sam.</hi> 3. 1. No wonder then that the Lords people
make such adoe for it, in a famine of it, that they go from
sea to sea, to seek it <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 11, 12. and that they are content
to have it at any rate, though with the <hi>peril of their lives because
of the sword of the Wilderness Lam.</hi> 5. 9. Seeing they cannot
live without it. Would men be hindered by Law, from
seeking their natural food? nay they would fight for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they wanted it, against any that opposed them. If
then they cannot get it with peace, they must have it with
trouble: And if they cannot get it in houses, they must
have it wherever it is to be found, with freedom, &amp; the
favour of God.</p>
               <p>3. It is necessary that the Meetings be as <hi>publik,</hi> as they
can be with Conveniencie &amp; Prudence; yea simple hazard
should no more hinder their <hi>Publickness</hi> &amp; <hi>Solemnity,</hi> than
their being at all. Especially in an evil time, when wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
is encouraged &amp; established, and conformity thereto
pressed, Truth banished, and a Witness for Christ sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
Corruption in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline,
&amp; Government connived at, countenanced, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
the Word of God is become a reproach, and men
have no delight in it, Apostacy is become universal, and
both Magistrats &amp; Ministers generally turned promoters of
it, which is the true Discription of our times: Then the
Meetings of the Lords people, that endeavour to keep
clean Garments, should be more frequent, publick, &amp;
avowed. The reasons are. 1. Then the Call of God, by
His Word &amp; Works, is more clamant, for publick &amp; so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<hi>humiliation.</hi> in order to avert publick imminent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and impendent stroks from God. It is not enough
to reforme our selvs privately &amp; personally, and to keep
our selves pure from such Courses by an abstraction &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
from them as is proved <hi>Head.</hi> 1. (where this is
improved as an argument against hearing the <hi>Curats</hi>) Nor
is it enough to admonish, exhort, reprove, &amp; testify against
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:41139:285"/>
such as are involved in these Courses: But it is necessary,
for them that would be approven, to adhere to the Truth,
and serve God after the right manner, and to mourn, sigh
and cry for all the abominations of the time, so as to get the
<hi>Mark of Mourners on their foreheads Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. and they that do
so, wil be found on the Mountains like doves in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes
<hi>all of them mourning every one for his iniquity Ezek.</hi> 7. 16.
and not only to by humbled every family apart, but there
must be a great Mourning as the Mourning of <hi>Hadadrimmon</hi>
in the valley of <hi>Megiddon Zech.</hi> 12. 11. to the end. That is
a Solemn publick Mourning there promised. There must
be a <hi>gathering themselves together,</hi> though a Nation not desired,
before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the
chaff, and the fierce anger of the Lord come upon them,
if they would have any possibility of their hiding <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.
1, 2, 3. The Trumpet then must be blown in <hi>Zion,</hi> to
sanctify a fast, to call a solemn Assembly, <hi>Gather the people,
Sanctify the Congregation, Assemble the Elders, Gather the
Children—Ioel.</hi> 2. 15, 16. As was exemplified in <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi>
time, when there were great Congregations of people
assembled publickly, weeping very sore, then there was
<hi>hope in Israel Ezra.</hi> 10. 1, 2. and when that Messenger of the
Lord came up from <hi>Gilgal</hi> to the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
them for their Defections &amp; Compliance with the
<hi>Canaanites,</hi> they had such a solemn day of humilation, that
the place of their Meeting got a name from it, they called
the name of that place <hi>Bochim,</hi> that is, <hi>Weepers Iudg.</hi> 2. 4,
5. And when the <hi>Ark</hi> was at <hi>Kirjath-jearim</hi> all the house
of <hi>Israel</hi> lamented after the Lord—and they gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to <hi>Mizpeh</hi> and drew water &amp; poured it out before the
Lord 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 2, 6. I shew before, that there is reason
to fear that the sins of a few, especially of Magistrats &amp;
Ministers, will bring wrath upon the whole body of the
people, as is plain from these Scriptures <hi>Levit. 10. 6. Isai.
43. 27, 28. Lam. 4, 13. Mic.</hi> 3. 11, 21. shewing the sins
of Ministers may procure universal Destruction. And
2 <hi>Sam. 24. 25. 2 King. 21. 11. Ier.</hi> 15, 4. proving the sins
of Magistrats may procure it: And <hi>Num. 3. 14, 15. Iosh.</hi> 22.
17, 18. Demonstrating that the sins of a party of the people,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:41139:286"/>
may draw wrath upon the whole. Now the only way the
Scripture points out to evite &amp; avert such publick judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is to make our resentment of these indignities done
to our God, our Mourning over them, and our witness
against them, as <hi>publick</hi> as the sins are, at least as publick
as we can get them, by a publick <hi>pleading for Truth Isai.</hi> 59.
4. for the defect whereof He hides His face, and wonders
that there is no man, no Intercessor <hi>vers.</hi> 16. that is none
to plead with God, in behalf of His born doun Truths:
There must be in order to this, a publick <hi>seeking of Truth,</hi>
which if there be any found making conscience of, the
Lord makes a gracious overture to <hi>pardon</hi> the City <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 1.
we cannot think there were no mourners in secret there,
but there was no publick Meeting for it, and publick oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the duty of that day: There must be <hi>valour for the Truth
upon the earth Ier.</hi> 9. 3. a publick &amp; resolute ouning of Truth:
There must be a <hi>making up the hedge &amp; standing in the Gap</hi> for
the Land, that the Lord should not destroy it <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 30.
a publick Testimony in opposition to defection: There
must be a <hi>pleading with our Mother Hos.</hi> 2. 2. which is spoken
to private persons in the plural number Commanding all
that would consult their oun safety, publickly to condemn
the sins of the whole Nation, that they may escape the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
punishment thereof, as it is expounded in <hi>Pool Synops.
Critic. in locum.</hi> By this means we must endeavour to avert
the wrath &amp; anger of God, which must certainly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to go out against the Land, which hath all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
causes, all the Symptoms, Prognosticks, &amp; Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of a Land devoted to destruction, that ever a Land
had. If then there must be such Publick Mourning, and
such Solemn Gathering for it, such public pleading for
Truth, Seeking of Truth, valour for Truth, making up
the hedge, and pleading with our Mother, there must of
Necessity be publick Meetings for it: for these things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done in private, but must be done by way of Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
Which I make a 2. Reason. The Nature &amp; End
of Meeting for Gospel Ordinances is for a publick <hi>Testimony</hi>
for Christ and His Truths &amp; Interest, against Sin and all
dishonours done to the Son of God. So that the only end,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:41139:286"/>
is not only to bring to Christ &amp; build up Souls in Christ, but
it is to Testify also for the Glory of Christ, whether Souls
be brought in &amp; built up or not. The Preached Gospel is
not only the Testimony of <hi>Christ 1 Cor,</hi> 1. 6. but a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>for Christ;</hi> in which sense, The <hi>Testimony of Iesus</hi> is said
to be the <hi>Spirit of Prophesie Revel.</hi> 19. 10. so called, <hi>Durham</hi>
expounds it, for its bearing Witness to Christ, in which
respect Ministers are often called <hi>Witnesses.</hi> It is also the
Testimony of <hi>Israel</hi> (not only given to <hi>Israel,</hi> but given by
<hi>Israel</hi>) unto which the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord
<hi>Ps.</hi> 122. 4. Whensoever therefore or howsoever the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Church is contradicted, thats not a Lawful
Meeting of the tribes of the Lord. It is also the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Preachers for Christ, against them that will not
receive them, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 11. And a <hi>Witness unto all Nations</hi>
to whom they preach. <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 14. And of all the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
that hold it &amp; suffer for it <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 9. And the same
which is the Word of Christs Testimony, is the Word of
theirs <hi>Rev,</hi> 12. 11. by which they overcome, &amp; for which
they love not their lives. Wherever then the Gospel is
preached, it must be a Testimony: But it cannot be a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
except it be Publick, at least as publick as it can be,
as we find all Christs Witnesses were in the Old &amp; New
Testaments. 3. The Motive or principle prompting the
Lords people to a frequenting of Gospel Ordinances, is a
<hi>publick Spirit</hi> stirring up to a publick Generation Work,
whereof this is the Scope, to promote the Kingdom of
Christ, and not only to obey the Lords Command enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the duty, to enjoy the Lord the end thereof, or to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
their oun Souls; But to partake in &amp; promote this Great
Work of the Day, for the Glory of God and the Churches
good. For the Gospel is not only a <hi>Banner of Love</hi> over His
Friends, but Christs <hi>Standart</hi> of war against His Enemies
<hi>Isai.</hi> 59. 19. under which, all that countenance it, are
called to list themselves as His Souldiers <hi>called,</hi> &amp; <hi>chosen, &amp;
faithful:</hi> And it is required of His Souldiers, that they
be valiant for the Truth upon the earth, Discovering a
Gallant greatness &amp; generosity of a Publick Spirit, having
their designs &amp; desires not limited to their oun interests,
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:41139:287"/>
even Spiritual, but aiming at no less than Christs Publick
Glory, the Churches publick good, the Saints publick
Comfort, having a publick Concern for all Christs Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
Publik Sympathie for all Christs Friends, and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
declared Opposition to all Christs Enemies: This is
a Publick Spirit, the true Spirit of all Christs zealous
Lovers &amp; Votaries: Which, when He is a missing, will
prompt them to go about the City, in the streets, and in the
broad wayes, to seek Him whom their Soul loveth <hi>Cant.</hi>
3. 2. and not only in their <hi>beds,</hi> or secret <hi>corners,</hi> but they
must go to the streets, and to the fields, and avow their seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ, even though the Watchmen should <hi>smite</hi> them,
&amp; the keepers of the walls take their vails from them <hi>Cant.</hi>
5. Which obliges them not only to take Him in to their
oun Cottages, and intertain Him in their hearts, and give
Him a Throne there, but also to endeavour to enlarge
His dwelling, and propagate His Courtly residence through
the World, that the Kingdoms of the earth may becom
the Kingdoms of the Lord; and if they cannot get that
done, yet that He may have the Throne in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her Mothers
house, and take up His abode in the Church, or Nation
they belong to, that there His Ordinances be established
in purity, peace, plenty, &amp; power, according to His oun
Order; And if that cannot be, but that their Mother play
the harlot, and He be provoked to give up house with
her, and by her Childrens treacherie the Usurping Enemy
be invited in to His place &amp; Habitation, and take violent
possession of it, and enact His extrusion &amp; expulsion by
Law; yet they will endeavour to secure a place for Him
among the Remnant, that He may get a lodging among
the <hi>afflicted &amp; poor people that trust in the Name of the Lord</hi>—
that they may <hi>feed &amp; Lie doun &amp; none make them afraid Zeph.</hi>
3. 12, 13. that the <hi>poor of the flock that wait on Him may know
that it is the Word of the Lord, Zech.</hi> 11. 11. they will lay out
themselves to strengthen their hands. This is the Work
of the publick spirited Lovers of the Gospel, which hath
been and yet is the great work of this our day, to carry the
Gospel, and follow it, and keep it up through the Land,
as the Standart of Christ, against all opposition, from
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:41139:287"/>
mountain to hill, when now <hi>Zion</hi> hath been Labouring to
bring forth as a woman in travel, and made to go forth
out of the City, and to <hi>dwell in the field Mic.</hi> 4. 10. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seeing it is the publick Work of the day, and all its
followers must have such a publick spirit, it followes that
the Meetings to promote it must be as publick as is possible.
4. The Interest &amp; priviledge of the Gospel, to have it in
freedom, purty, power, &amp; plenty, is the publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of all the Lords people, preferable to all other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
and therefore more publickly, peremptorly and
zealously to be contended for, than any other Interest
whatsoever. It is the Glory of the Land 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 21.
without which, <hi>Ichabod</hi> may be the name of every thing;
and every Land, though never so pleasant, will be but a
dry &amp; parched Land, where no water is, in the esteem of
them that have seen the <hi>Lords Glory &amp; power in the Sanctuary
Psal.</hi> 63. 1. Where as its name is <hi>Hephzibah &amp; Beulah Isai.</hi> 62. 4. and <hi>Iehovah-Shammah Ezek. 48. ult.</hi> where God is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
in His Gospel Ordinances; And the want &amp; <hi>reproach
of the Solemn Assemblies,</hi> is a matter of the saddest mourning
to the Lords people <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 18. Therefore while the <hi>Ark</hi>
abode in <hi>Kerjath-jearim</hi> the time was thought very <hi>Long,</hi>
and all the house of Israel <hi>Lamented after the Lord 1 Sam.</hi>
7. 2. then they <hi>heard of it at Ephratah and found it in the fields
of the Wood Psal.</hi> 132. 6. But it hath been longer than twenty
years in our fields of the Woods, and therefore we should
be Lamenting after it with greater concernedness; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
remembering, how we were priviledged with the
Gospel, which was somtimes publickly embraced &amp;
countenanced by Authority, and ensured to us by Laws,
Statutes, Declarations, Proclamations, Oaths, Vowes,
&amp; Covenant-engagments, whereby the Land was dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
&amp; devoted unto the Son of God, whose Conquest it
was. And now are not all the people of God obliged to do
what they can, to hinder the recalling of this dedication,
and the giving up of the Land as an offering unto Satan &amp;
Antichrist? And how shall this be, but by a publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
for this priviledge, and a resolving they shall sooner
bereave us of our hearts blood, than of the Gospel in its
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:41139:288"/>
freedom &amp; purity? But this we cannot contend for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
if our Meetings be not publick. 5. The nature
&amp; business of the Gospel Ministrie is such, that it obliges
them that exercise it to endeavour all publickness, without
which they cannot discharge the extent of their Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
their very names &amp; titles do insinuate so much.
They are <hi>Witnesses</hi> for Christ, and therefore their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
should be publick, though their Lot oftentimes be
to Witness in <hi>Sackcloth:</hi> They are <hi>Heraulds,</hi> and therefore
they should Proclaim their Masters Will, though their
Lot be often to be <hi>a voice crying in the Wilderness,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> the
<hi>Baptist</hi> was in his field Preachings: They are <hi>Ambassadours,</hi>
and therefore they should maintain their Masters Majestie,
in the Publick port of His Ambassadours, and be wholly
taken up about their Soveraigns business: They are <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and therefore they should keep &amp; maintain their post
their Masters hath placed them at: Nay they are <hi>Lights</hi> &amp;
<hi>Candles,</hi> and therefore cannot be <hi>hid Math.</hi> 5. 14, 15. The
Commands &amp; Instructions given them, infer the nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssity
of this: They must <hi>cry aloud,</hi> and not spare, and left up
their voice like a Trumpet, and shew the Lords People
their transgressions &amp; sins <hi>Isai.</hi> 58. 1. They are Watchmen
upon <hi>Ierusalems</hi> walls, which must not hold their peace,
day nor night, nor <hi>keep silence,</hi> nor give the Lord rest, till
He establish and till He make <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a praise in the earth
<hi>Isai.</hi> 62. 6, 7. They are Watchmen, that must command
all to <hi>hearken to the sound of the Trumpet Ier.</hi> 6. 17. They must
be <hi>valiant for the Truth upon the earth Ier.</hi> 9. 3. They must say,
<hi>thus saith the Lord</hi> even to a rebellious Nation, whether they
will hear or forbear, and not be afraid of them <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. 5, 6.
They must cause the people to know their abominations
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 2. and the abominations of their Fathers <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.
4. And what their Master tells them in darkness, that they
must <hi>speak in the Light,</hi> and what they hear in the ear, that
they must <hi>Preach upon the house tops Math,</hi> 10. 27. These
things cannot be done in a Clandestine way. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now when there is so much necessity, it is the duty of
all faithful Ministers, to be laying out themselves to the
utmost in their Pastoral function, for the suppreffing of
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:41139:288"/>
all the evils of the time, not withstanding of any prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the contrary, in the most publick manner, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the examples of all the faithful servants of the Lord,
both in the Old &amp; New Testaments; Though it be most
impiously &amp; Tyrannically interdicted, yet the Laws of
God stand unrepealed, and therefore all who have a
Trumpet &amp; a Mouth should set the Trumpet to their
Mouth, and sound a certain sound; not in secret for that
will not alarme the people, but in in the most publick
manner they can have access to. And it is the duty of all to
come &amp; hear &amp; obey their Warnings &amp; Witnessings, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
who will the contrary. It was for mocking, despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
His Words, &amp; misusing His Prophets, that the wrath
of the Lord arose against His people, the <hi>Iewes,</hi> until
there was no remedy 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36, 16. Therefore from all
that is said, it must be Concluded, that Meetings for
Gospel Ordinances must be as publick as can be: And if
so, then that they should be in houses, safety will not
permit to us; to go to the streets or Mercat places, neither
safety nor prudence will admit: Therefore we must go to
the fields with it, cost what it will.</p>
               <p>4. Seeing then there must be Meettngs, &amp; publick
Meetings, And seeing we cannot and dare not in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
countenance the <hi>Curats</hi> Meetings; we must hear,
oune, embrace, &amp; follow such faithful Ministers as are
cloathed with Christ Commission, Righteousness, &amp; sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and do keep the Words of the Lords patience, and
the Testimony of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in particular. This
I think will not, or dare not be denyed, by any that oune the
Authority of Christ (which none can deny or instruct the
contrary, but our Ministers that ventured their lives in
preaching in the fields have had a certain seal to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
&amp; is sealed sensibly in the conviction of many, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of moe) That Christs Ministers &amp; Witnesses, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
about the Great Gospel Message, cloathed with His
Authority, &amp; under the obligation of His Commands lying
upon them, must preach, &amp; the people must hear them, not
withstanding of all Laws to the contrary. Divines grant that
the Magistrate can no more suspend from the exercise, than
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:41139:289"/>
he can depose from the Office of the Ministry; for the one
is a degree unto the other. See <hi>Apollon. de jure Majest. circa
Sacra. Part. 1. Pag. 334. &amp;c. Rutherf. Due right of Presb. Pag.</hi>
430. &amp;c. For whether it be right in the sight of God, to
hearken unto men more than unto God, the Consciences
of the greatest enemies may be appealed unto <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 19.
They must not cease, wherever they have a Call &amp; Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to <hi>Teach &amp; Preach Iesus Christ Act. 5. ult.</hi> Necessity is
laid upon them, yea <hi>wo unto them</hi> if they <hi>Preach not the Gospel
1 Cor.</hi> 9. 16. In all things they must approve themselves,
as the Ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions,
in necessities, &amp;c. by honour &amp; dishonour, by evil report
&amp; good report, as deceivers and yet true, as unknown &amp;
yet well known—2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 4, 8, 9. They must preach
the Word, be instant in season, &amp; out of season, reprove,
rebuke, exhort, with all long suffering &amp; doctrine 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 2. Dare any say then, that a Magistrats or Tyrants
Laws can exauctorate a Minister? or silence him by his oun
proper elicite acts, as King or Tyrant, or formally &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately?
Will Mischiefs framed into a Law, warrant
such iniquity? or an act of a King of Clay rescind the
Mandats of the King of Kings? or exempt people from
obedience due thereunto? Or will the Bishops Canons,
who have no power from Christ, or the Censures of them,
that stand condemned themselves by the Constitutions of
the Church &amp; Acts of the General Assemblies, have any
weight in the case? And yet these are all that can be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
except odious &amp; invidious Calumnies, the ordinary Lot
of the most faithful, against the present preachers in the
fields, which are sufficiently confuted in their late <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory
Vindication,</hi> and need not here be touched. Seeing
therefore they have given up themselves unto Christ as His
servants, they must resolve to be employed for Him to the
outmost of their power, and must not think of laying up
their Talent in a Napkin; especially now when there is
so great necessity, when Defection is yet growing, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
countenanced more &amp; more, Division nothing abated,
but new oyl cast daylie into the flames of devouring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;
the people generally drouned in the deluge of
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:41139:289"/>
the times snares &amp; sins, and like to be over whelmed in the
inundation of black <hi>Poperie,</hi> now coming in at the opened
sluce of this wicked <hi>Toleration,</hi> with the Congratulations
of <hi>Addressing Ministers;</hi> when now the Harvest is great
and the Labourers are few: Great then is the necessity, and
double must the woe be that abideth such Ministers, as are
silent at such a time: And great &amp; inexcusable is the sin of
the people, if they do not come out, and countenance
faithful Ministers, the Messengers of the Lord of hosts,
from whom they should seek the Law <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. especially
when there are so many, that have palpably betrayed their
Trust; and so few that are faithful in the necessary Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the day. Seeing then faithful Ministers must
preach, &amp; people must hear, where can they meet with
conveniency, &amp; safety, &amp; freedom, except either under
the shelter of this wicked <hi>Toleration,</hi> which they dare not
do, or else go to the fields?</p>
               <p>5. It must be obtained also, that the Ministers have <hi>a
right</hi> to Preach, in this <hi>unfixed</hi> manner, whereever they
have a Call; their relation now, in this disturbed state of
the Church, being to be considered more extensively, than
in its settled condition. For understanding which, we must
distinguish a three or four-fold relation, that a Minister of
the Gospel stands into. First, He is a Minister of Christ,
and Steward of the Mysteries of God 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. having his
Commission from Christ as his Master: And this relation
he hath universally, wherever he is. Secondly, he is a
Minister of the Catholick Church, though not a Catholick
Minister of it; which is his primary relation; for that is the
Church, in which Ministers are <hi>set 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 28. and to
which they are <hi>given Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12. Thirdly, He is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the particular Church whereof he is a Member;
and so in <hi>Scotland</hi> a Minister is a Minister of the Church of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and is obliged to lay out himself for the good of
that Church. Fourthly; he is a Minister of the particular
Congregation, whereunto he hath a fixed relation in a
constitute case of the Church: This last is not essential to a
Minister of Christ, but is subservient to the former relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
but when separated from such a relation, or when
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:41139:290"/>
it is impossible to be held, he is still a Minister of Christ,
and His Call to preach the Gospel stands &amp; binds. See <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
Durhams</hi> Degression on this particular on <hi>Revel. chap. 2. pag.</hi>
89. &amp;c. <hi>in quarto.</hi> For thô he be not a Catholick Officer,
having an equal relation to all Churches, as the Apostles
were; Nevertheless he may exerce Ministerial Acts Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively,
upon occasions warrantably calling for the
same, in other Churches, as Heraulds of one King, having
Authority to charge in His Name wherever it be; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in a broken state of the Church, when all the restric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
his Ministerial relation is capable of, is only a tye &amp;
call to officiate in the service of that Church whereof he is a
Member; and so he hath right to preach every where, as
he is called, for the edification of that Church. The reasons
are. 1. He hath power from Christ the Master of the whole
Church; and therefore, wherever the Masters Authority is
acknowledged, the Servants Ministerial Authority cannot
be denied; at least in relation to that Church whereof he is
a Member as well as a Minister. 2. He hath Commission
from Christ, principally for the edification of Christs body,
as far as his Ministrie can reach, according to the Second
relation. 3. His relation to the whole Church is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,
that which is fixed to a part is only subordinate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a part of the whole. 4. His Commission is
indefinite to preach the Gospel, which will s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it as well
in one place as in another. 5. The same great ends of the
Churches greater good &amp; edification, which warrands
fixing of a Minister to a particular charge in the Churches
peaceable state, will warrand his officiating more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in her disturbed state, 6. Else it would follow that a
faithful Minister, standing in that relation to a disturbed
&amp; destroyed Church, and all his gifts &amp; graces were useless
in that case, which notwithstanding are given for the good
of the Church. 7. Yea by this, when his fixed relation
cannot be kept, it would follow, that he ceased to be a
Minister, and his Commission expired; so that he should
stand in no other relation to Christ, than any private person
so qualified, which were absurd: for by Commission he is
absolutely set apart for the work of the Ministrie, so
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:41139:290"/>
long as Christ hath work for him, if he continue faithful.
8. This hath been the practice of all the Propogators of the
Gospel from the begining, and of our Reformers in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
without which they could never have propogated it
so far: And it was never accounted the Characteristick of
Apostles, to preach unfixedly; because in times of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
Pastors &amp; Doctors also might have Preached wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they came, as the Officers of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
did, when scattered upon the persecution of <hi>Stephen Act.</hi>
8. 1. did go every where preaching the Word <hi>ver.</hi> 4. Since
therefore they may &amp; must Preach in this unfixed manner,
they must in this broken State look upon all the Godly in
the Nation, that will oune &amp; hear them, to be their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and embrace them all, and consult their conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
&amp; universal advantage, in such a way as all equally
may be admitted, and none excluded from the benefit of
their Ministrie. And therefore they must go to the fields
with it.</p>
               <p>6. The Lord hath so signally ouned, successfully counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced,
and singularly sealed <hi>Field-Preaching</hi> in these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
exercises, that both Ministers &amp; people have been
much encouraged against all opposition to prosecute them,
as having experienced much of the Lords power &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in them, and of the breathings of the enlivening, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging,
enlightening, and strengthening Influences of the
Spirit of God upon them. The people are hereby called,
in this case of defection, to seek after those waters that
they have been so often refreshed by: For in this case of
defection, God being pleased to seal with a palpable Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on their Souls, the Word from Ministers adhering to
their principles, they may safely look on this as a Call from
God to hear them, and follow after them so ouned of the
Lord. And it being beyond all doubt, that the Assemblies
of the Lords people to partake of pure Ordinances, with
full freedom of Conscience in the fields, hath been signally
ouned &amp; blessed of the Lord, and hath proven a mean to
spread the knowledge of God beyond any thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in our best times; And in despight of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ignal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of God, and envy at the good done in these
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:41139:291"/>
Meetings, all endeavours being used by wicked men to
suppress utterly all these Rendevouzes of the Lords Militia,
both by open force &amp; cunning <hi>Midianitish</hi> wiles; Ministers
cannot but look upon it as their duty, and that the Lord
hath been preaching from Heaven, to all who would hear
&amp; understand it, that this way of preaching, even this way,
was that wherein His Soul took pleasure, and to which He
hath been &amp; is calling all who would be co-workers with
Him this day, to help forward the Interest of His Crown &amp;
Kingdom. Many hundreds of persecuted people can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
this, and all the Martyrs have sealed it with their blood,
and remembered it particularly on the Scaffolds, that they
found the Lord there, and that He did lead them thither,
where He made them to ride upon the high places of the
earth, and to eat the increase of the fields, and to suck
honey out of the rock, and that in their experience, under
the Spirits pouring out from on high, they found the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
to be a fruitful field, and in their esteem, their feet
were beautiful upon the Mountains that brought good tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that published peace, that brought good tidings of
good, that published salvation, that said unto <hi>Zion,</hi> thy
God reigneth. And all the Ministers that followed this
way, while they were faithful, and had but litle strength,
and kept His Word, and did not deny His Name, found
that verified in their experience, which is said of <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia
Revel.</hi> 3. 8. that they had <hi>an open door which no man could
shut.</hi> The Characters whereof, as they are expounded by
<hi>Mr Durham,</hi> were all verified in these Meetings: where
1. The Ministers had a door of utterance upon the one side
opened to them; and the peoples ears were opened to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the same, in love to edification, simplicity, &amp; dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
on the other. 2. This had real changes following,
many being made humble, serious, tender, fruitful &amp;c.
3. The Devil raged &amp; set himself to oppose, traduce, &amp;
some way to blast the Ministrie of the most faithful more
than any others; just as when <hi>Paul</hi> had a greater door &amp; ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
opened to him, there were <hi>many adversaries 1 Cor.</hi>
16. 9. 4. Yet the Lord hath been observably defeating the
Devil &amp; Profanity in every place, where the Gospel came,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:41139:291"/>
and made him fall like lightening from Heaven, by the
preaching of the Word. 5. And the most experimental
proof of all was, that hereby ground was gained upon the
Kingdom of the Devil, and many Prisoners brought off to
Jesus Christ. And therefore seeing it is so, this mnst cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be a Call to them who are yet labouring in that Work,
which others have left off, to endeavour to keep this door
open with all diligence, and reap the corn when it is ripe,
and when the Sun shines make hay, and with all watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
lest the wicked one sow his tares, if they should
fall remiss.</p>
               <p>7. As for the Circumstance of the <hi>place,</hi> of this unfixed
manner of celebrating the Solemn Ordinances of the
Worship of God, in a time of persecution: This cannot
be quarrelled at by any, but such as will quarrel at any
thing. But even that is better warranted, than to be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
with their quarrels. For before the Law, <hi>Mountain-Worship</hi>
was the first Worship of the World, as <hi>Abrams
Iehovah-jireh Gen. 22. 14. Iac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bs Bethel</hi> (or House of God in
the open fields) <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 17, 19. his <hi>Peniel Gen.</hi> 32. 30. his
<hi>El-Elohe-Israel Gen.</hi> 33. ult. do witness: Under the Law,
they heard of it at <hi>Ephratah they found it in the fields of
the Wood Psal.</hi> 132. 6. After the Law, field-preaching
was the first that we read of in the New Testament,
both in <hi>Iohn</hi> his preaching in the wilderness of <hi>Iudea,</hi>
being the <hi>voice of one crying in the wilderness,</hi> and the
Master <hi>Usher</hi> of Christ <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 1, 3. and in His Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
afterwasds, who on the Sabbath sometimes, went
out to a river side were prayer was wont to be made, As
<hi>Lydia</hi> was converted at <hi>Pauls</hi> field preaching <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 13,
14. And chiefly the Prince of Preachers, Christ Himself,
preached many a time by the syds of the Mountains, and
the the sea side: That Preaching <hi>Math.</hi> 5. was on a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>vers.</hi> 1. And this is the more to be considered, that
our Lord had Liberty of the Synagog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es to Preach in, yet
he frequently left them, and preached either in private
houses, or in the fields; because of the opposition of His
Doctrine by the <hi>Iewish</hi> Teachers, who had appointed that
any who ouned Him should be excommunicate: And
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:41139:292"/>
therefore in the like case, at it is now, His Servants may
imitate their Master: for though all Christs Actions are
not imitable; such as these of His Divine <hi>Power,</hi> and the
Actions of His Divine <hi>Prerogative</hi> (as His taking of the ass
without the ouners liberty) and the Actings o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> His <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
Prerogative, which He did as Mediator; but all His
Gracious Actions, and Moral upon Moral grounds, and
Relative upon the grounds of Relative Duties, are not
only imitable, but the perfect Pattern of imitation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that superstitious &amp; ridiculous Cavil, that such Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in fields or houses are <hi>Conventickles,</hi> gathering separate
Congregations, is not worth the taking notice of: for this
would reflect upon Christs and His Apostles w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                  </gap>ince, which hath alwayes
been by that way which they call <hi>keeping of Conventickles.</hi> Its
absurd to say, it is a gathering of separate Congregations,
it is only a searching or seeking after the Lords sheep, that

Word of Truth, in such places where they may get it done
most safely, and may be most free from distraction &amp;
trouble of their enemies, who are waiting to find them
out, that they may hail them to Prisons or kill them.</p>
               <p>8. As for the Circumstance of the <hi>Time,</hi> that is specially
alledged to be unseasonable, especially when there is a
litle breathing, and some relaxation from the heat of
Persecution, to break the peace, and awaken sleeping
Dogs by such irritating Courses, is thought not consistent
with Christian prudence. This is the old pretence of them
that were at ease, and preferred that to duty. But as we
know no peace at this time, but a peace of Confederacy
with the enemies of God, which we desire not to partake
of, and know of no relaxation of Persecution against such
as continue to witness against them: So let what hath been
said above in the 3. <hi>Hypothesis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> of the necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ty of publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in our Meetings at such a time as this is, be considered;
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:41139:292"/>
And let the Scripture be consulted, and it will appear, not
only that in preaching the Gospel there must be a Witness
&amp; Testimony kept up (as is proved above) and not only that
Ministers must preach the Word, and be instant in season
&amp; out of season 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. But that such a time as this, is
the very Season of a Testimony. For in the Scripture we
find, that Testimonies are to be given in these Seasons
especially. 1. When the enemies of God, beginning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
from their stiffness &amp; severity, would compound with
His Witnesses, and give them some Liberty, but not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would let the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> go, but stay
their flocks: And now our <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will give some Liberty
to serve God, but with a Reservation of that part of the
matter of it, that nothing be said to alienate the hearts of
the Subjects from his arbitrary Government. But <hi>Moses</hi>
thought it then a season to testifie (though the bondage of
the people should be thereby continued) that there should
not <hi>a hoof</hi> be left behind; for sayes he, <hi>we know not with
what we must serve the Lord, until we c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

against <hi>Saul,</hi> for his toleration &amp; indemnity granted to <hi>Agag

<hi>Benhadad 1 King.</hi> 20. 42. The Angel of <hi>Ephesus</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended

for omitting this Testimony, and allowing a
<hi>toleration</hi> of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> &amp; <hi>Iezebel Revel.</hi> 2. 2, 14, 20. In
such a Case of universal Complyance with these things,
and the peoples indulging themselves under the shadow of
the protection of such a Confederacy, the Servants of the
Lord that fear Him must not say a <hi>Confederacy,</hi> tho they
should be accounted for <hi>signs &amp; wonders in Israel Isai.</hi> 8. 12,
13, 18. But now Idolatrous Mass-Altars are set up, none
thrown doun, penal Statutes against <hi>Papists</hi> are <hi>stopt</hi> &amp; <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled,</hi>
and the Generality of Ministers are Congratulating,
&amp; saying a Confederacy in their <hi>Addresses</hi> for the same.
3. When the Universal Apostacy is come to such a hight,
that error is prevailing, and few syding themselves in an
avowed opposition against it; as <hi>Elijah</hi> chose that time,
when the people were <hi>halting between two opinions 1 King.</hi>
18. 21. And generally all the Prophets &amp; Servants of

already in some measure evident, that <hi>Field-Meetings</hi> are
very expedient. But I shall adde some more particular
Considerations, to inculcate the same more clossly.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Third</hi> Place, besides what is said, to clear the
Lawfulness &amp; necessity of a publick Testimony against the
evils of the present time, Some Considerations may be
added to prove the Expediency of this way &amp; manner of
giving a Testimony, by maintaining <hi>Field-Meetings</hi> in our
present Circumstances.</p>
               <p>1. The keeping of <hi>Field-Meetings</hi> now, is not only most
convenient for Testifying, but a very significant Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in it self, against this <hi>Popish Toleration;</hi> the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of whose Spring &amp; Original, and of its Nature and
Terms, Channel &amp; Conveyance, End &amp; design, is shewed
in the Historical Narrative thereof, and cannot be denyed
by any <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> whose constant principle is that there
should be no <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>Poperie,</hi> Idolatrie, or Heresie,
in this Reformed &amp; Covenanted Church. Reason &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
both will conclude, that this is to be witnessed
against, by all that will adhere to the Cause or Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
overturned hereby, and resolve to stand in the Gap
against Poperie to be introduced hereby, and that will
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:41139:298"/>
approve themselves as honest Patriots in defending the
Laws &amp; Libertys of the Country subverted hereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
besides, if it be considered with respect to the <hi>Granter;</hi> it is
palpable his design is to introduce Poperie, and advance
Tyrannie, which can be hid from none that accept it, the
effectuating whereof hath a n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cessary &amp; inseparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with the acceptance of the Liberty; and is so far
from being avertible by the Accepters, that it is chiefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
by their acceptance, and the design of it is to lay
them by from all opposition thereto. If it be considered
with relation to the <hi>Accepters,</hi> it is plain it must be taken
as it is given, and received as it is conveyed, from its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of <hi>Absolute power,</hi> through a channel of an Arbitrary
Law-disabling &amp; Religion-dishonouring <hi>Toleration,</hi> which
is <hi>semper mali;</hi> and with consent to the sinful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mpositions,
with which it is tendered; concerning &amp; affecting the
Doctrine of Ministers, that they shall Preach nothing
which may <hi>alienate the subjects from the Government;</hi> Against
all which there is no access for a Protestation, consistent
with the improvement of the Liberty, for it is granted &amp;
accepted on these very terms; that there shall be no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation;
for if there be, that will be found an alienating
of the hearts of the subjects from the Government, which
by that Protestation will be reflected upon. If it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
with respect to the <hi>Addressers</hi> for it, who formally
say <hi>a Confederacy</hi> with, and Congratulate the Tolerator
for his Toleration, and all the Mischiefs he is machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinating
&amp; effectuating thereby; then seeing they have
Presumptuously taken upon them to send it in the name
of all <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> it concerns all honest men, zealous
Christians, and faithful Ministers of that perswasion &amp;
denomination, in honour &amp; Conscience, to declare to
the world by some publick Testimony, that they are not
Consenters to that sinful, shameful, &amp; scandalous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,
nor of the Corporation of these flattering <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressers</hi>
who have betrayed the Cause, with which all will
be interpreted Consenters, that are not Contradicters.
Further this <hi>Tolleration</hi> is sinful as is cleared above <hi>Peri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> 6.
And to accept of it is contrary to our Solemn Covenants
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:41139:298"/>
&amp; Engagments, where we are bound to exstirpate <hi>Poperie,</hi>
preserve the Reformation, defend our Liberties, and
never to accept of a <hi>Toleration</hi> eversive of all these precious
Interests we are sworn to maintain. And it is heinously
<hi>scandalous,</hi> being in effect a succumbing at length and
yeelding up the Cause, which hath been so long contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
&amp; so long contended for, at least an appearance of
ceding &amp; lying by from contending for the Interests of
Christ, of condemning our former Wrestlings for the
same, of purchasing a Liberty to our selves at the rate of
burying the Testimony in bondage &amp; oblivion, of harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp; confirming open Adversaries in their wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions
on our Religion, Laws, &amp; Liberties, of being
weary of the Cross of Christ, that we would fain have ease
upon any terms, and of weakening the hands yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the Practice &amp; peremptoriness of these that are
exampted from the benefit or rather the snare of it, and
suffer when others are at ease. It is also attended with
many Inconveniences; for either such as Preach under the
Covert of it, must forbear declaring some part of the
Counsel of God, and give no Testimony seasonable this
day; or else if they do, they will soon be discovered and
made a prey. Hence seeing there must be a Testimony
against this <hi>Toleration,</hi> it is certainly most expedient to give
it there, where the Meeting is without the reach &amp; bounds
of it, and interdicted by the same Proclamation that tenders
it, and where the very gathering in such places is a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
against it: for to Preach in houses constantly &amp; leave
the fields, would now be interpreted an Homologating
the <hi>Toleration</hi> that commands Preaching to be so restricted;
especially when an <hi>Address</hi> is made in name of all that
accept the benefit of it, from which <hi>Odium</hi> we could not
vindicate our selves, if we should so make use of it.</p>
               <p>2. The keeping of <hi>Field Meetings</hi> now is a Testimony
against that wicked <hi>Law</hi> that discharges them, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
them as Criminal; yea in some respect a <hi>Case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession:</hi>
for if <hi>Daniels</hi> case, when publick prayer was
discharged under pain of death, was a Case of Confession,
as all grant; then must also our case be, when publick
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:41139:299"/>
Preaching is discharged under the some penalty: for it is
equivalent to an Universal discharge of all publick Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when the manner of it is discharged, which we can
only have with freedom &amp; safety in way of publick Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
which can be none other in our Circumstances but
in the fields, Again if the Law be wicked that discharges
them, as certainly it is, and is demonstrated from what
is said already, then it must be sin to obey it; but it were an
obeying of it to quite the fields.</p>
               <p>3. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eeping of <hi>Field-Meetings</hi> now is a Testimony
against <hi>Tyranny</hi> &amp; Usurpation, encroaching upon our
Religion, Laws, &amp; Liberties, and presuming to restrict
&amp; bound the exercise of the Ministerial function, and
discharge it altogether except it be modified according to
the Circumstances prescibed by a wicked Law, which
cannot be allowed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> competent to any man whose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is not acknowledged, for reasons given in <hi>Head.</hi> 2.
Therefore though there were no more, this is sufficient
to call all Ministers to give Testimony against such an
Usurpation, by resfusing to obey any such Act. and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
where God giveth a Call. For otherwise, to submit to
it, would be an acknowledging of his Magist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atical power
to discharge these Meetings, and to give forth sentences
against faithful Ministers.</p>
               <p>4. The keeping of <hi>Field-Meetings</hi> now is a Testimony for
the Honour, Headship &amp; Princely <hi>Prerogative</hi> of Jesus
Christ, which hath been the Great Word of His Patience
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by an Unparalelled, insolence encroached
upon by Usurpers in our day, and in effect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enied by such
as took a new holding for the exercise of their Ministrie
from their Usurped power. Now in these Meetings,
there is a Practical Declaration of their holding their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie
and the exercise thereof from Christ alone, without
any dependence upon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to, or licence &amp;
warrand from His Usurping Enemies; and that they may
&amp; will Preach in publick without Authority from them.
If then it be Lawful &amp; expedient to maintain the Interests
of a King of Clay, against an Usurper; then much more
must it be Lawful &amp; expedient, to maintain the quarrel of
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:41139:299"/>
the King of Kings, when wicked men would banish Him
and His Interests out of the Kingdom by their Tyrannical
cruelty, and cruel mercy of a destructive <hi>Toleration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. The keeping of <hi>Field-Meetings</hi> now is a Testimony
for the <hi>Gospel</hi> and the <hi>Ministrie</hi> thereof; which is alwayes
the dearest &amp; nearest priviledge of Christians, and in the
present Circumstances, when our Lives and our all are
embarked in the same bottom with it, and sought to be
destroyed together with it, by a party conspiring against
Christ, it is necessary duty to defend both by resisting their
unjust violence; especially when Religion and the Gospel
is one and the chief of our fundamental <hi>Land-rights,</hi> and
the Cardinal Condition of the established Policy, upon
which we can only oune men for Magistrats by the Law of
the Land: And this Testimony by defence of the Gospel
and of our oun lives, cannot be given expediently any
where but in the Fields. It is also a Testimony for the
freedom &amp; Authority of the Gospel-Ministrie, and for
their holding their unremovable Relation to the Church of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> which is infringed by these Tyrannical Acts, and
maintained by these exercises: which is a priviledge to be
contended for, above &amp; beyond all other that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for or defended, especially to be maintained against
those that have no power or Authority to take it away.
There will no man quite any of his goods upon a sentence
coming from an incompetent Judge; And shall Ministers
or people be hectored or fooled from such a priviledge by
them that have no such power?</p>
               <p>6. The keeping of <hi>Field-Meetings</hi> now is a Testimony
for our <hi>Covenants,</hi> the ouning whereof is declared Criminal
by that same Law that discharges these Meetings; in which
we are sworn to preserve the Reformation in Doctrine,
Worship, Discipline, &amp; Government, and to defend all
the Churches Liberties, and to oppose all their Opposites,
and endeavour their exstirpation: And in the <hi>Solemn
Acknowledgment of sins &amp; Engagment to duties,</hi> we are sworn,
<hi>because many have of late laboured to supplant the Liberties of the
Kirk, to maintain &amp; defend the Kirk of Scotland, in all her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
&amp; Priviledges, against all who shall oppose &amp; undermine the

same, or encroach thereupon under any pretext whatsoever.</hi> Since
then the ouning of these Meetings and the Covenants are
both discharged together, and the ouning of the Covenant
does oblige to a publick opposition against the dischargers,
and an avowed Maintinance of the Churches priviledges,
whereof this is in a manner the only &amp; chief Liberty now
left to be maintained, to keep Meetings where we may
testify against them, without dependence on their Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
it must follow, that these Meetings are to be
maintained, which only can be in the fields<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency.</p>
               <p>7. To give over these <hi>Field-Meetings</hi> now, would be an
hardening &amp; encouraging of these Enemies in their wicked
design of banishing all these Meetings out of the Land;
which manifestly would be defeat, by a resolute refusal of
all to submit to their discharging of them; and they that do
submit, and give them over, do evidently contribute to
the effectuating that wicked design, which is certain does
not nor will not terminate upon a simple suppression of
that sort, but further is intended to exstirpate all Meetings
for Gospel Ordinances, in which there is any Testimony
against them. To Comply therefore with such a forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of them at this time, would lay a stone of stumbling
before them, to encourage them in these their designs;
when they should see their Contrivance so universally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with, wherein they might boast that at length they
had prevailed, to put quite away that eye-sore of theirs
<hi>Field-Meetings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. To give over these <hi>Field-Meetings</hi> now, were a stumbl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the poor ignorant people; who might think that
now it appears that Work was but of men, and so hath
come to naught, and would look upon it as an evidence of
fainting, &amp; succumbing at last in the matter of the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
as being quite overcome; and that indeed all have
embraced &amp; accepted this present <hi>Toleration,</hi> and were all
alike sleeping under the shade, and eating the fruits of such
a bramble.</p>
               <p>9. Finally, To give over these <hi>Field-Meetings</hi> now,
would be very scandalous to the <hi>posterity,</hi> and to <hi>Strangers,</hi>
                  <pb n="575" facs="tcp:41139:300"/>
who shall read the History of our Church, to find that as
<hi>Prelacy</hi> came in without a joint Witness, and the monstrous,
Blasphemous, &amp; Sacrilegious <hi>Supremacy</hi> was erected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Testimony in its season; So black <hi>Poperie</hi> it self and
<hi>Tyranny</hi> was introduced by a <hi>Toleration,</hi> which laid them all
by from a Testimony against these; who formerly had val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iantly,
resolutely, &amp; faithfully contended against all lesser
Corruptions, but at last, when that came, and stricter
prohibitions of all publick Meetings but under the Covert
thereof were emitted, then all were perswaded to comply
with that Course. How astonishing would it be to read,
that all these Contendings, sealed with so much precious
blood, should come to such a pitiful Period! But I hasten
to the Next, which is the <hi>Second Positive</hi> Ground of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>

               <head>HEAD. V. The Principle of &amp; Testimony for Defensive
Armes Vindicated.</head>
               <p>THis Truth is of that sort, that can hardly be illustrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by demonstration; not for the darkness thereof,
but for its self evidencing clearness, being scarcely
capable of any further elucidation, than what is offered to
the rational understanding by its simple proposition. As
first Principles can hardly be proven, because they need no
probation, and cannot be made clearer than they are, and
such as cannot consent to them, are incapable of conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any probation of them: So this Truth of <hi>Self-preservation</hi>
being Lawful, because it is congenite with and irradicated
in every nature, that hath a <hi>Self</hi> which it can preserve, can
scarcely be more illustrated that it <hi>may</hi> do so, than that it <hi>can</hi>
do so. And therefore to all who have a true respect to their
oun, as well as a due concern in the Interest of Mankind,
and zeal for the Interest of Christ, it might seem superfluous
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:41139:301"/>
to make a doubt or debate of this: Were it not that a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of men is now prevailing, that are as great Monsters
in Nature, as they are Malignant in Religion, and as great
perverters of the Law of Nature, as they are Subverters of
Municipal Laws, and Everters of the Laws of God: Who
for ouning this principle, as well as using the practice, of
Defensive Resistence for self preservation against Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
violence, have set up such Monuments of rage &amp; cruelty,
in the Murder of many innocent people, as was never read
nor heard of before. It hath been indeed the practice of all
Nations in the World, and the greatest of men have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this principle in all ages: But the bare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Asserting the
principle, when extorted by severe Inquisitions, was never
a Cause of taking the lives of any, before this was imposed
on the poor Suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet because they would not condemn the principle they

of this in the hearts of people more than others, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they deserve the practical expression of it by
the hands of all. But the reason they give why they
are so offended at it is, that they look upon it as the
Spring of all the errors of Presbyterians, and a Notion
that destroyes them: Which indeed will be found
to have a necessary connexion with many of the Truths
that they contend for this day, as it hath been the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

of this kind hath been, and what were the occasions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
or rather enforcing to these Defensive Resistences
here to be vindicated as to the principle of them, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
in the Historical Representation: Shewing, that after
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:41139:301"/>
the whole body of the Land was engaged under the bond
of a Solemn Covenant, several times renewed, to defend
Religion &amp; Liberty; and in special manner the Magistrats
of all ranks, the Supreme whereof was formally admitted
to the Government upon these terms; he with his Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates,
conspiring with the Nobles to involve the whole
Land in perjury &amp; Apostasie, overturned the whole Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
Work of Reformation; and thereby not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached
upon the Interest of Christ and the Churches Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
but subverted the fundamental Constitution of
the Kingdoms Government, and pressed all to a submission
unto and complyance with that Tyranny &amp; Apostasie,
erected upon the ruines thereof: Yet the Godly &amp; Faithful
in the Land, sensible of the indispensable obligation of
these Covenants, resolved to adhere thereunto, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
long patiently for adherence unto the same, until
being quite out wearyed by a continued tract of Tyrannical
oppressions, arbitrarly enacted by wicked Laws, and ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
executed against their oun Laws, and cruelly prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
even without all colour of Law, in many unheard
of barbarities; when there could be no access for or success
in complaining or getting redress by Law, all Petitions &amp;
Remonstrances of Grievances being declared seditious &amp;
treasonable, and interdicted as such; they were forced to
betake themselves to this last remedy of <hi>Defensive Resistence,</hi>
intending only the preservation of their Lives, Religion,
&amp; Liberties; which many times hath been blessed with
success, and therefore zealously contended for, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amissible
Priviledge; by all well affected to the Cause of
Christ and Interest of their Country, because they found
it alwayes Countenanced of the Lord; until the cause
was betrayed by the Treachery and abandoned by the
Cowardice of such, as were more Loyal for the Kings In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
than zealous for Christs and the Countries; for which
the Lord in His holy Jealousie discountenanced many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
endeavours of this nature, Cuting us off and puting
us to shame and would not go forth with our Armies. But
because the duty is not to be measured by, and hath a more
fixed Rule to be founded upon, than providence; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:41139:302"/>
the Godly did not only maintain the principle in their
confessions &amp; Testimonies, but prosecute the practice in
carrying armes, &amp; making use of them in the defence of the
Gospel and of themselves, at <hi>Field-Meetings;</hi> which were
alwayes successfully prosperous, by the power &amp; presence
of God. This Question is sufficiently discussed, by our
famous &amp; learned invincible Patrons &amp; Champions for this
excellent priviledge of Mankind, the unanswerable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of <hi>Lex Rex,</hi> the <hi>Apologetical Relation, Napthali,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ius
populi Vindicatum.</hi> But because <hi>facile est inventis addere,</hi> I
shall subjoine my mite. And their Arguments being various
and volumniously prosecute, and scattered at large through
their books, I shall endeavour to collect a Compend of
them in some order. The two first speak of a Defensive
war, managed in a Parliamentary way: And the two last,
of Resistence against the abuse of a Lawful power, when
there is no access to maintain Religion &amp; Liberty any other
way; which does not come up so closs to our case, nor is
it an adequate <hi>Antithesis</hi> to the Assertions of our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
who say, that it is <hi>no wayes Lawful, in any case or upon
any pretence whatsoever, to Resist the Soveraign power of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in whomsoever it be resident, or which way soever it be erected.</hi>
I shall consider it more complexely &amp; extensively, and
plead both for Resistence against the abuse of a Lawful
power, and against the Use &amp; Usurpation of a Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
power, And infer not only the Lawfulness of Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Kings, when they abuse their power (as is demonstrate
unanswerably by these Authors) but the expediency &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the duty of Resisting this Tyrannical power,
whensoever we are in a Capacity, if we would not be
found treatherous Covenant-breakers, &amp; betrayers of the
Interest of God, and the Liberties of the Nation, and of
our Brethren together with the posterity, into the hands
of this <hi>Popish</hi> &amp; Implacable Enemie, and so bring on us the
Curse of <hi>Meroz,</hi> and the Curse of our Brethrens blood,
crying for vengeance on the heads of the shedders thereof,
and upon all who being in case came not to their rescue,
and the Curse of posterity, for not transmitting that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
&amp; Liberty, whereof we were by the valour of
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:41139:302"/>
our fore-fathers put &amp; left in possession. I shall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
restrict my self to the State of the Question, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
ordinarly <hi>viz.</hi> Whether or not, when a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
King doth really injure, oppress &amp; invade his Subjects
Civil &amp; Religious Rights, or unavoidably threatens to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
them of their dearest &amp; nearest Liberties, and sends out
his Emissaries with armed violence against them, and when
all redress to be had, or hope by any Address or petition is
rendered void or inaccessible, yea addressing interdicted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
severe penalties as treasonable; Then &amp; in that case, may
a Communitie of these Subjects defend themselves, &amp; their
Religion &amp; Liberties, by armes in resisting his bloody Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries?
But to bring it home to our present case, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Laxness of the Adversaries position of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollableness
of every one that wears a Crown, I shall State
it thus: Whether or not is it necessary duty, for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
(whether they have the Concurrence of the <hi>primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>
or Nobles, or not) to endeavour, in the Defence of
their Lives, Religion, Laws, &amp; Liberties, to Resist &amp;
Repress the Usurpation &amp; Tyranny of Prevailing Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
using or abusing their power for subverting Religion,
invading the Liberties, and overturning the foundamental
Laws of their Country? I hold the Affirmative, and shall
essay to prove it, by the same Arguments that conclude this
Question, as usually stated. Which will more than evince
the Justifyableness of the Sufferings upon this Head. In
prosecuting of this Subject, I shall first premit some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory
Considerations to clear it. And Secondly bring
Reasons to prove it.</p>
               <p>First for clearing of this Truth, and taking off Mistakes,
these <hi>Concessions</hi> may be considered.</p>
               <p>1. The Ordinance of Magistracy which is of God is not
to be Resisted, no not so much as by disobedience or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
nay not so much as mentally by <hi>cursing</hi> in the
heart <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. 20. but a person cloathed therewith, abus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his power, may be in so far Resisted. But Tyrants,
or Magistrates turning Tyrants, are not Gods Ordinance;
and there is no hazard of damnation for refusing to obey
their unjust commands, but rather the hazard of that is in
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:41139:303"/>
walking willingly after the Commandment, when <hi>the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of Omri are kept.</hi> So that what is objected from <hi>Eccles.</hi>
8. 2-4. <hi>I counsell thee to keep the Kings Commandment</hi> &amp;c.
is answered on <hi>Head.</hi> 2. And is to be unsterstood only of
the Lawful commands of Lawful Kings.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Rebellion</hi> is a damnable sin: except where the word is
taken in a laxe sense, as <hi>Israel</hi> is said to have Rebelled against
<hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and <hi>Hezekias</hi> against <hi>Sennacherib;</hi> which was a
good Rebellion, and clear duty, being taken there for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence</hi>
&amp; <hi>Revolt.</hi> In that sense indeed some of our Risings
in Armes might be called <hi>Rebellions,</hi> for it is Lawful to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
against Tyrants. But because the word is usually taken
in an evil sense, therefore would have been offensive to
acknowledge that before the Inquisitors, except it had
been explained. But Rebellion against Lawful Magistrats
is a damnable sin, exemplarly punished in <hi>Korah</hi> and his
Compan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, who rebelled against <hi>Moses;</hi> and in <hi>Shebah</hi> and
<hi>Absalom</hi> who rebelled against <hi>David;</hi> for to punish the Just
is not good nor to <hi>strike Princes for equity Prov.</hi> 17. 26. And
they that <hi>resist</hi> shall receive to themselves <hi>damnation Rom.</hi>
13. 2. So that this <hi>Objection</hi> brought from this place, as if
the Apostle were commanding there subjection without
Resistence to <hi>Nero,</hi> and such Tyrants, as it is very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
It is fully answered above <hi>Head.</hi> 2. Here it will be
sufficient to reply. 1. He is hereby vindicating Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from that reproach, of casting off or refusing subjection
to all Magistrats, as if Christian Liberty had destroyed that
Relation, or that they were not to be subject to Heathen
Magistrats. Whereupon he binds this duty of subjection
to Magistrats <hi>for conscience sake</hi> in general. And it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
what <hi>Buchanan</hi> sayes in his book <hi>de jure regni,</hi> that
<hi>Paul</hi> did not write to the Kings themselves, because they
were not Christians, and therefore the more might be born
with from them, tho they should not understand the duty
of Magistrats: But imagine, that there had been some
Christian King, who had turned Tyrant and Apostate, to
the Scandal of Religion; <q>what would he have written
then? Sure if he had been like himself, he would have
denyed that he should be ouned for a King, and would
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:41139:303"/>
have interdicted all Christians Communion with him,
and that they should account him no King, but such as
they were to have no fellowship with, according to the
Law of the Gospel.</q> 2. He speaks of Lawful Rulers
here, not Tyrants, but of all such as are defined &amp; quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
here, being <hi>powers ordained of God, terrours to evil works,
Ministers of God</hi> for good. Yea but says Prelats, and their
Malignant Adherents, these are only <hi>Motives</hi> of subjection
to all powers, not <hi>qualifications</hi> of the powers: I answer,
they are indeed Motives, but such as can be extended to
none but to these powers that are so qualified. 3. He
speaks of Lawful powers indefinitely in the plural number,
not specifying any Kind or degree of them, as if only Kings
&amp; Emperours were here meant. It cannot be proven that
the power of the sword is only in them. Neither was there
a plurality of Kings or Emperours at <hi>Rome</hi> to be subject to:
if he meant the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, he would have designed
him in the singular number. All the reasons of the Text
aggree to inferiour Judges also, for they are <hi>Ordained of God,</hi>
they are called <hi>Rulers</hi> in Scripture, and <hi>Gods Ministers,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengers
by Office, who judge not for man but for the
Lord; And inferiour Magistrats also are not to be resisted,
when doing their duty 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. yet all will grant, when
they go beyond their bounds and turns litle Tyrants, they
may be with-stood. 4. He does not speak of <hi>Nero,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
whom it cannot be proven, that at this time he had
the Soveraign power, as the learned <hi>Mr Prin</hi> shewes: Or
if he had, that he was a Tyrant at this time: and if he meant
him at all, it was only as he was obliged to be <hi>de jure,</hi> not
as he was <hi>de facto.</hi> All men know, and none condemns
the fact of the Senate, that resisted <hi>Nero</hi> at length, without
transgressing this precept. Yea I should rather think, the
Senate is the power that the Apostle applies this Text to,
if he applied it to any in particular. 5. The subjection here
required, is the same with the honour in the <hi>fifth Command,</hi>
whereof this is an exposition; and is opposite to the <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinatness</hi>
here condemned: Now subjection takes in all
the duties we owe to Magistrates, and Resistence all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries
forbidden; but unlimited obedience is not here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
so neither unlimited subjection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="582" facs="tcp:41139:304"/>
3. We may allow <hi>Passive subjection</hi> in some cases, even
to Tyrants; when the Lord layes on that yoke, and in
effect sayes, He will have us to lie under it a while, as He
Commanded the Jewes to be subject to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi>
of which passage, adduced to prove subjection to Tyrants
Universally, <hi>Buchanan ubi supra</hi> infers, that if all Tyrants
be to be subjected to, because God by His Prephet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
His people to be subject to one Tyrant; Then it
must be likewise concluded, that all Tyrants ought to be
killed, because <hi>Ahabs</hi> house was Commanded to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by <hi>Iehu.</hi> But passive subjection, when people are
not in capacity to resist, is necessary. I do not say <hi>Passive
obedience,</hi> which is a meer <hi>Chimaera,</hi> invented in the brains
of such Sycophants, as would make the world slaves to
Tyrants. Whosoever suffereth if he can shun it, is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to his oun being: for every natural thing must strive to
preserve it self against what annoyeth it; and also he sins
against the order of God, Who in vain hath ordained so
many Lawful means for preservation of our being, if we
must suffer it to be destroyed, having power to help it.</p>
               <p>4. We abhor all war of subjects, professedly declared
against a Lawful King, as such; all war against Lawful
Authority, founded upon or designed for maintaining
Principles inconsistent with Government, or against Policy
&amp; Piety; Yea all war without Authority. Yes, when all
Authority of Magistrates supreme &amp; subordinate is pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and abused, contrary to the ends thereof, to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
of the people, and overturning of their Laws &amp;
Liberties, people must not suspend their Resistence upon
the Concurrence of men of Authority, and forbear the
Duty in case of necessity, because they have no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>peers</hi> or
<hi>Primores</hi> to lead them: for if the ground be Lawful, the
call clear, the necessity cogent, the capacity probable,
they that have the Law of Nature, the Law of God, and
the fundamental Laws of the Land on their side, cannot
want Authority, though they may want Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iaments to
espouse their quarrel. This is cleared above <hi>Head.</hi> 2. Yet
here I shall adde. 1. The people have this priviledge of
nature, to defend themselves and their Rights &amp; Liberties
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:41139:304"/>
as well as <hi>Peers,</hi> and had it before they erected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
Peers or <hi>Primores.</hi> There is no distinction of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in interests of Nature, though ther be in Civil order:
but self defence is not an act of Civil order. In such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
people must not depend upon the priority of their
superiours, nor suspend the duties they owe to themselves
and their neighbours, upon the manuduction of other
mens greatness. The Law of Nature allowing self defence,
or the defence of our Brethren, against unjust violence,
addeth no such restriction, that it must only be done
by the conduct or concurrence of the <hi>Primores</hi> or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
2. The people have as great Interest to defend
their Religion as the Peers, and more, because they have
more souls to care for than they, who are far fewer. And
to be violented in their Consciences, which are as free to
them as to the Peers, is as unsupportable to them: yea
both are equally concerned to maintain Truth, and rescue
their Brethren suffering for it, which are the chief grounds
of war; and if the ground of the defensive war be the same,
with them and without them, what reason can be given
making their Resistence in the one case Lawful, and not
in the other? Both are alike obliged to concur, and both
are equally obnoxious to Gods threatened Judgments for
suffering Religion to be ruined, and not relieving &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuing
Innocents. It will be but a poor excuse for people to
plead, they had no Peers to head them. What if both King
&amp; Nobles turn enemies to Religion? (as they are at this day)
shall people do nothing for the defence of it then? Many
times the Lord hath begun a Work of Reformation by
foolish things, and hath made the <hi>least of the flock to draw them
out Ier.</hi> 49. 2. and 50. 45. and did not think fit to begin
with Nobles, but began it when powers &amp; Peers were in
opposition to it: and when He blessed it so at length, as to
engage the publick Representatives to oune it, what was
done by private persons before, they never condenmed.
3. The people are injured without the Nobles; therefore
they may resist without them, if they be able: for there can
be no Argument adduced to make it unlawful to resist
without them, which will not equally make it unlawful
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:41139:305"/>
to do it with them. 4. Its true the <hi>Primores</hi> are obliged
beyond others, and have Authority more than others to
concur; but Separately they cannot act as Representatives
judicially: They have a Magistratical power, but limited
to their particular Precincts where they have Interest, and
cannot extend it beyond these bounds; And so, if they
should concur, they are still in the capacity of subjects,
for out of a Parliamentary Capacity they are not Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives.
5. All the power they can have is Cumulative
not Privative, for <hi>deterior conditio Domini per Procurationem
fieri non debet.</hi> Why then shall the Representatives betraying
their Trust, wrong the Cause of the people, whose Trustees
they are? Nay, if it were not Lawful for people to defend
their Religion, Lives, &amp; Liberties without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Parliaments, then their case should be worse
with them than without them; for they have done it before
they had them, and so they had better be without them
still. 6. People may defend themselves against the Tyranny
of a Parliament, or <hi>Primores,</hi> or Nobles: <hi>Ergo</hi> they may
do it without them; for if it be Lawful to resist them, its.
Lawful to wave them, when they are in a Conspiracy
with the King against them.</p>
               <p>5. We disallow all war without real indeclinable <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,</hi>
and great &amp; grievous wrongs sustained: and do not
maintain it is to be declared or undertaken, upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Grounds, or pretended Causes: And so the Question
is impertinently stated by our Adversaries, <q>Whether or
not it be Lawful for Subjects, or a party of them, when
they think themselves injured, or to be in a capacity,
to Resist or Oppose the Supreme power of a Nation.</q> For
the Question is not, if when they think themselves injured
they may Resist? but when the injuries are real: Neither
is it every realitie of injuries will justify their Resistence,
but when their dearest &amp; nearest Liberties are invaded,
especially when such an invasion is made, as threatens
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>luctable subversion of them. Next we do not say, that
a parties esteeming themselves in a Capacity, or their
being really in a Capacity, doth make Resistence a duty;
except <hi>caeteris Paribus</hi> they have a Call as well as a Capacity,
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:41139:305"/>
which requires real Necessity, and a right to the action,
and the things contended for to be real &amp; legal Rights,
really &amp; illegally encroached upon: their Capacity gives
them only a Conveniency to go about the duty, that is
previously Lawful upon a Moral ground. No man needs
to say, who shall be Judge? the Magistrate or people?
For. 1. All who have eyes in their head may judge whether
the sun shine or not; and all who have common sense may
judge in this case. For when it comes to a Necessity of
Resistence, it is to be supposed, that the Grievances
complained of, and sought to be redressed by armes, are
not hid but manifest; it cannot be so with any party only
pretending their suffering wrong. 2. There is no need of
the formality of a Judge, in things evident to Natures eye,
as Grassant Tyranny undermining &amp; overturning Religion
&amp; Liberty must be. Nature, in the acts of necessitated
Resistence in such a case, is Judge, party, Accuser,
Witness, &amp; all. Neither is it an act of Judgement, for
people to defend their oun: Defence is no act of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
but a priviledge of Nature. Hence these common
sayings, <hi>vim vi repellere omnia jura permittunt;</hi> And <hi>defendere
se est juris Naturae: Defensio vitae necessaria est, &amp; a jure Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali
profluit.</hi> 3. Be Judge who will, the Tyrant cannot be
Judge in the case: for in these Tyrannical Acts, that force
the people to that Resistence, he cannot be acknowledged
as King, and therefore no Judge: for its supposed, the
Judge is absent, when he is the party that does the wrong.
And he that does the wrong, as such, is inferior to the
innocent. 4. Let God be Judge, and all the World, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cognizance of the evidence of their respective <hi>Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto's</hi>
of the State of their Cause.</p>
               <p>6. We condemn Resing to revenge private injuries;
whereby the Land may be involved in blood, for some
petty wrongs done to some persons, great or small: And
abhor revengful Usurping of the Magistrats sword, to
avenge our selves for personal injuries. As <hi>Davids</hi> killing
of <hi>Saul</hi> would have been 1 <hi>Sam. 24. 10, 12, 13. 1 Sam.</hi> 26.
9, 10. To <hi>Object</hi> which in this case, were very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent:
for it would have been an act of offence in a remote
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:41139:306"/>
defence, if <hi>Saul</hi> had been immediatly asaulting him, it
could not be denied to be Lawful: and it would have been
an act of private revenge, for a personal injurie, and a
sinful preventing of Gods promise of <hi>Davids</hi> succession,
by a scandalous Assassination. But it is clear, then <hi>David</hi>
was Resisting him, and that is enough for us; and he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
he might <hi>descend into battel &amp; perish 1 Sam.</hi> 26. 10. not
excluding, but that he might perish in battel against himself
resisting him. We are commanded indeed <hi>not to resist evil,</hi>
but whosoever shall smite us on the one check, to turn to
him the other also, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 39. and to <hi>recompense to no
man evil for evil Rom.</hi> 12. 17. But this doth not condemn self
defence, or Resisting Tyrants violently, endangering our
Lives, Laws, Religion, &amp; Liberties, but only resistence
by way of private revenge &amp; retaliation, and enjoins pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
when the clear call &amp; dispensation do inevitably
call into suffering; but not to give way to all violence &amp;
Sacriledge, to the subverting of Religion &amp; Righteousness.
These Texts do no more condemn private persons reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating
the Magistrate, than Magistrats retaliating private
persons, unless Magistrats be exempted from this precept,
and consequently be not among Christs followers: Yea
they do no more forbid private persons to resist the unjust
violence of Magistrats, than to resist the unjust violence
of private persons. That Objection from our Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
<hi>Peter Math. 26. 52. Put up thy sword for all they that
take the sword shall perish by the sword,</hi> hath no weight here: for
this condemns only making use of the sword, either by way
of private revenge, or usurping the use of it without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
(and so condemns all Tyrants) which private sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
do not want to defend themselves, their Religion &amp;
Liberty; or using it without necessity, which was not in
<hi>Peters</hi> case, <hi>tum quia valebat Christus se ipsum defendere, tum
quia volebat se ipsum tradere, Pool Synops. Critic. in Locum.</hi>
Christ could easily have defended himself, but he would
not; and therefore there was no necessity for <hi>Peters</hi>
rashness; it condemns also a rash precipitating and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the Call of God to acts of Resistence: But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it is plain, it was not <hi>Peters</hi> fault to defend his Master,
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:41139:306"/>
but a necessary duty. The reason our Lord gives for that
inhibition at that time, was two fold; one expressed <hi>Math.
26. 52. for they that take the sword</hi> &amp;c. Which do not belong
to <hi>Peter,</hi> as if <hi>Peter</hi> were hereby threatened; but to those
that were coming to take Christ, they usurped the sword
of Tyrannical violence, and therefore are threatened with
destruction by the sword of the <hi>Romans:</hi> so is that commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to be understood of Antichrist, and the Tyrants that
serve him <hi>Rev. 13. 10. he that killeth with the sword must be
killed with the sword,</hi> which is a terrible word against per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters.
The other reason is <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18. 11.—<hi>The Cup
which my Father hath given me shall I not drink?</hi> Which clearly
resells that <hi>Objection</hi> of Christs non-resistence. To which it
is answered, that suffering was the end of His voluntary
suscepted humiliation, and His errand to the World, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Father, and undertaken by Himself; which
is not the Rule of our practice: Thô it be true, that even
in His Sufferings He left us an <hi>ensample that we should follow
His steps 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 21. In many things, as He was a <hi>Martyr,</hi>
His Sufferings were the purest Rule &amp; Example for us to
follow, both for the matter, and frame of Spirit, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
patience, constancy, meekness &amp;c. but not as
He was our <hi>Sponsor,</hi> and after the same manner, for then
it were unlawful for us to flee, as well as to resist, because
He would not flee at that time.</p>
               <p>7. As we are not for Rising in Armes for triffles of our
oun things, or small injuries done to our selves, but in a
case of necessity for the preservation of our Lives, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Laws, &amp; Liberties, when all that are dear to us
as men and as Christians are in hazard: So we are not for
Rising up in Armes, to force the Magistrate to be of our
Religion, but to defend our Religion against his force.
We do not think it the way that Christ hath appointed, to
propogate Religion by Armes: Let Persecuters &amp; Limbs
of Antichrist take that to them; but we think it a Priviledge
which Christ hath allowed us, to defend &amp; preserve our
Religion by Armes: especially when it hath been esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by the Laws of the Land, and become a <hi>Land-right,</hi>
and the dearest and most precious Right &amp; Interest we have
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:41139:307"/>
to contend for. It is true Christ saith, <hi>Iohn. 18. 36. My
Kingdom is not of this world; if my Kingdom were of this world,
then would my Servants fight that I should not be delivered to the
Iewes.</hi> But this <hi>Objection</hi> will not conclude, that Christs
Kingdom is not to be defended &amp; preserved even by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
of all that would impiously &amp; sacrilegiously spoil
us of it in this world, because it is not of this world: for
then all were obliged to suffer it to be run doun, by slaves
of Hell and Satan, and Antichrists vassals, Papists &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants:
Yea Magistrats were not to fight for it, for they
are among His Servants, if they be Christians. But the
good Confession He Witnesses here before <hi>Pilat,</hi> is that He
hath a Kingdom, which as it is not in opposition to any
<hi>Cesarean</hi> Majestie; So it must not be usurped upon by any
King of Clay, but is specifically distinct from all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the world, and subordinate to no earthly power,
being of a Spiritual Nature; whereof this is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
and sufficient security for earthly Kingdoms,
that His Servants as such, that is, as Christians, and as
Ministers, were not appointed by Him to propogate it by
Armes, nor to deliver Him their King at that time, because
He would not suffer His Glorious design of Redemption
to be any longer retarded: but this doth not say, but thô
they are not to <hi>propogate</hi> it as Christians, and as Ministers,
by carnal weapons; yet they may <hi>preserve</hi> it with such
weapons as men. Hence that old saying may be vindicated,
<hi>preces &amp; lachrimae sunt arma Ecclesiae,</hi> Prayers and tears are
the Armes of the Church. I grant they are so, the only best
prevailing Armes, and without which all others would be
ineffectual, and that they (together with Preaching &amp;
Church Discipline &amp;c.) are the only Ecclesiastical or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Armes, of a Church as a Church, but the Members
thereof are also <hi>Men,</hi> and as men they may use the same
weapons that others do, <hi>And ye my flock the flock of my Pasture
are men saith the Lord Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. Yea from this I shall take
an Argument: It it be Lawful for private Subjects, without
the concurrence of Parliaments, to resist a Tyrant by
Prayers and tears; Then it is Lawful also to resist him by
violence; But the former is true, as our Adversaries grant
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:41139:307"/>
by this Objection, and I have proved it to be duty to pray
against Tyrants <hi>Head 2. Ergo</hi>—The Connexion is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon these reasons. 1. This personal Resistence by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
is as consistent with that Command <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2.
<hi>Let every soul be subject unto the higher Powers—whosoever
therefore resisteth the Power resisteth the Ordinance of God;</hi> as
Resistence by Prayer is with that 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 1, 2. I exhort—
that—Supplications—be made—for Kings and for all that
are in Authority.</hi> If the Prince be good, the one as is unlawful
as the other; and a sinful resistence of the Ordinance of
God (to pray against him) no less than the other (to fight
against him) Therefore when he becomes a Tyrant &amp;
destroyer of the Lords Inheritance, and an Apostate, as I
may not pray for him except conditionally, but against him
as an Enemy of Christ; so I may also fight against him as
such. 2. As Adversaries themselves will grant, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
by Prayers &amp; tears is more powerful &amp; effectual
than the other; So the Laws of the Land make the one
treasonable as well as the other; and that deservedly, when
the Prince is doing his duty, but when he turneth Tyrant,
neither can justly be condemned.</p>
               <p>These things being premitted, I shall come shortly to
the purpose, and endeavour to prove this Truth,, <hi>That it
is a necessary duty for a Community (whether they have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of the Primores, Nobles &amp; Representatives or not) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
in the defence of their Religion, Lives, Laws, &amp; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
to Resist &amp; Repress the Usurpation &amp; Tyranny of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Dominators, using or abusing their Power, for subverting
Religion, invading the Liberties, and overturning the foundamental
Laws of their Country.</hi> Wherein I shall be but short, because
this Truth is sufficiently confirmed by all the Arguments
of the <hi>Second Head.</hi> Yet I may only hint at many other; And
prosecute them in this Order. First I shall produce some
Arguments from the Law of Nature &amp; Nations. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Common practice of all Christian people.
Thirdly from express Scriptures.</p>
               <p>I. The Arguments of the first Class are very multifarious:
I shall reduce them to a few, as Compendiously as may be,
and only give the strength of them in a Syllogistical forme,
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:41139:308"/>
without expatiating save where the matters requires.</p>
               <p>1. The greatest Antagonists of this Truth, through the
clearness thereof are forced to assert &amp; grant such parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
as will by Consequence justify this plea. 1. <hi>Barclay
contra Monarchum.</hi> is cited by the <hi>Apol. Relat.</hi> and <hi>Ius Populi</hi>
asserting, that <q>if a King will alienate &amp; subject his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
without his Subjects consent, or be carried with
a hostile mind to the destruction of his people, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is actually lost, and the people may not only Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
resist, but also depose him.</q> 
                  <hi>Grotius de jure belli lib.</hi> 1.
<hi>cap.</hi> 4. asserts the same, and adds, if he but attempt to do
so he may be resisted. The <hi>Surveyer of Nap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tali</hi> grants the
same <hi>pag.</hi> 23, 24. Yea this hath been granted in open Court,
by the <hi>Council of Scotland,</hi> that in case of the Kings alienat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Kingdoms, he may be Resisted. Hence (1 If ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or alienation of Kingdoms, or attempts of it, do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null
a Kings Authority; Then an alienation of them from
Christ, to whom they are devoted by Covenant, and sell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to Antichrist, as is attempted by this King, gives
the people a right to Resist him: But the former is here
conceded: <hi>Ergo</hi>—(2) We need say no more to apply
the other, that carrying a hostile mind to the destruction of
the people does forfeit his Kingdom, and gives the people
right to Resist, than that a <hi>Papist</hi> is alwise known to carry a
hostile mind to the destruction of <hi>Protestants,</hi> and all the
designs declared these 27 years have been demonstrative
efforts of it. 2. <hi>Dr Ferne</hi> acknowledgeth, <q>that personal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
is Lawful against the sudden, illegal, &amp; inevitable
assaults of the Kings Messengers, or of himself in so far
as to ward off his blowes, or hold his hands. As also he
alloweth private persons Libertie, to deny subsidies &amp;
tribute to the Prince, when he imployeth it to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Commonwealth.</q> Hence (1) If one man
may defend himself against the sudden, illegal, &amp; inevitable
assaults of the King or his Messengers; Then may many
men, in defence of their Lives &amp; Liberties, defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against the surprising Massacres, the sudden assaults,
and much more the devised &amp; deliberate assaults of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
bloody Emissaries, which are illegal &amp; inevitable, as
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:41139:308"/>
all their furious &amp; bloody on-sets have been: But the former
is here acknowledged: <hi>Ergo</hi>—(2) If people may deny
subsidies to a King when he employeth it, to the destruction
of the Commonwealth; Then (as this justifies the denyal
of the <hi>Cess,</hi> imposed for destruction of the Church &amp; banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel, So) this gives them right to Resist
him (for if he be the power ordained of God not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
then for this Cause tribute must be paid, for they
are Gods Ministers <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 6. and if tribute must not be
paid then he is not the power ordained of God, and so may
be resisted) But the former is here allowed; <hi>Ergo</hi>—3.
<q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Bodin de Repub. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 5. granteth,</bibl> if a King turn Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
he may Lawfully, at his subjects request, be invaded,
resisted, condemned, or slain by a foraign Prince.</q> Hence,
if foraign Princes may Lawfully help a people oppressed
by their oun Soveraign; then people may Resist themselves,
if they be able and hold in their pains: But the former is
here granted: <hi>Ergo</hi>—The Consequence cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
for foraigners have no more Power or Authority
over another Soveraign, then the people have themselves.
4. <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Arnisaeus de Author Princip. c. 2. n.</hi> 10</bibl>. granteth, that if
the Prince proceed extrajudicially, without order of Law,
by violence, every private man hath power to resist. So
the <hi>Surveyer of Naphtali ubi supra</hi> grants so much of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
violent resisting attempts, against the honour of her
chastitie, and tending to ensnare her in sin, whereof her
non-resistence makes her guilty.</q> Hence (1) If every
extrajudicial violence of a Prince may be Resisted; Then
also all Contrajudicial violence against Law or reason must
be opposed, for that is more grievous, and all their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
wherein they do not act as Judges must be resisted,
and that is all together, for in none of them they can act as
Judges: But the former is here granted: <hi>Ergo</hi>—(2) If a
woman may defend her Chastity against the K. lest her non-resistence
make her guilty (Oh if all women had been of this
mind, the Country would not have been pestered so with
the Kings bastards) Then may a Nation, or any part of it,
Resist a Tyrants attempts upon the honour of their Religion,
entycing them to fornication with the Mother of harlots,
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:41139:309"/>
lest their non-resistence make them guilty: But the former
is here yeelded: <hi>Ergo</hi>—5. That same <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Arnisaeus cap.</hi> 4.</bibl>
saith, Of the former (to wit, he who is called a Tyrant
in title) it is determined by all without any difficultie,
that he may be Lawfully repulsed, or if by force he be
gotten into the Throne, he may warrantably be thence
removed, because he hath not any Jot of power which
is not illegitimate, and unto which resistence is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
for the fear of God and for conscience sake, and
therefore he is no further to be looked at than as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</q>
This is so pat &amp; pertinent to the present possessor of
the Government, that no words can more particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it. 6. <hi>Grotius de jure belli Lib. 1. c.</hi> 4. granteth, the Law
of not resisting does not bind when the danger is most
weighty &amp; certain. <q>And we do not plead for it in any
other case.</q> And further he sayes, <q>The Law of non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
seemeth to have flowed from them, who first
combined together into societie, and from whom such
as did command did derive their power: Now if it had
been asked of such, whether they would chuse to die,
rather than in any case to resist the Superior with Armes?
I know not if they would have yeelded thereto, unless
with this addition, if they could not be resisted but with
the greatest perturbation of the Common-wealth &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of many Innocents. And afterwards he hath
these words,</q> 
                  <hi>Attamen indiscriminatim dam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

aut partem minorem, quae ultimo necessitatis praesidio sic uta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
ut interim &amp; communis boni respectum non deseruit, vix au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim.</hi>
From which we need make no inference, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
is so large, that it answers our case. 7. The <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer
of Naphtali,</hi> in the place above cited, grants <q>Legal self
defence against the Soveraign, by way of plea in Court, for
safety of a mans person or estate—as also in the case of
most habited, notour, &amp; Complete Tyranny against
Law, to the destruction of the body of a people, and of
all known Legal Liberties, and the being of Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law—And in case of his not being in his
natural &amp; right wits</q>—Hence (1) If it be Lawful to
resist the King by a Plea in Law, for an Estate (yea the
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:41139:309"/>
Law will allow, by actual force, if he come to take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of it illegally) Then it must be Lawful for their
lives &amp; estates, Liberties &amp; Religion, to resist him by force,
when the Legal resistence is not admitted: But the former,
is yeelded here: <hi>Ergo</hi>—The reason of the Connexion
is: The Municipal Law permits the one, and the Law of
Nature &amp; Nations (which no Municipal Law can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe)
will warrand the other: He hath no more right to
be both Judge &amp; Party in this case, more than in the other:
And he can no more act as Soveraign in this case, than in
the other. (2) If it be Lawful to resist habited, notour, &amp;
Complete Tyranny against Law, to the destruction of the
body of a people, and of all known legal Liberties, and
the being of Religion, according to Law; Then we desire
no more to conclude the duty of resisting this Tyranny ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erced
this 27 years habitually, which the desolation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hindered families, the banishment of many hundreds
to slavery, the rivers of blood &amp;c. have made Notour to
all <hi>Scotland</hi> at least, and the perversion of all the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Laws, and all Civil &amp; Religious Liberties, yea the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of every remaining Model of Our Religion, as
Reformed &amp; Covenanted to be preserved, in Doctrine,
Worship, Discipline, &amp; Government, and designs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
Popery &amp; establish Arbitrary Government, have
made Complete: But the former is here granted, <hi>Ergo</hi>—
(3) If in the case of his being out of his wits, he should
run upon an innocent man to kill him, or attempt to cut
his oun throat, it were then Lawful to resist him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea a sin
not to do it; Then when in a rage, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> deliberately, he is
seeking to destroy many hundreds of the people of God, he
may be resisted: But the former is clear: <hi>Ergo</hi>—8. King
<hi>Iames the Sixth,</hi> in his Remonstrance for the right of Kings,
against the Oration of <hi>Cardinal Perron,</hi> hath these words,
<hi>The publick Laws makes it Lawful, and free for any private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to enterprize against an Usurper of the Kingdom.</hi> Then shall
it not be duty, to enterprize against a man, who by the Laws
of the Land is not capable of a right to reign, who hath got

that the Absolute subjection they talk of will not
hold, nor the prerogative be so incontrollable in every
case, as they would pretend, and that in many cases, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
populi</hi> hath the Supremacy above it, And that also in
these cases the people must be Judges, whether they may
resist or not.</p>
               <p>2. From the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> I may argue. 1. If God, the
fountain of all power and Author of all Right, hath given
unto man both the power and the right of, and reason to
manage self defence, and hath no wayes interdicted it in His
Word to be put forth against Tyrants; Then it is duty to use
it against them upon occasion: But the former is true: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi>—2.
If this power &amp; right were restrained in man
against the unjust violence of any, it would either be by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
or Grace, or some express prohibition in the Word
of God: But none of these can be said: <hi>Ergo</hi>—Policy
cannot destroy nature, but is rather cumulative to it; A
man entering into a Politick Incorporation, does not lose
the priviledge of nature: If one particular nature may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it self against destroying violence out of Societie, then
must many of these Natures combined in Societie have the
same right, and so much the more that their relative duties
superadde an obligation of mutual assistence. Grace does
not restrain the right of sinless nature, though it restrains
corruption: but self defence is no corruption: Grace makes
a man more a man than he was. And nothing can be
more dishonourable to the Gospel, than that by the Law
of Nature it is Lawful to resist Tyrants, but we are bound
by Religion from withstanding their Cruelty: The Laws
of God do not interf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne with another. 3. That Law
which alloweth comparative re-offending, so as to kill ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than be killed, teacheth Resistence: But so the Law
of Nature alloweth, except we be guilty or Murder in the
culpable omission of self defence. The reason is, because
the love of self is nearer and greater, as to temporal life,
than the love of our Neighbour; that being the measure of
this: Therefore it obliges rather to kill than be killed, the
exigence of necessity so requiring. 4. If nature put no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:41139:310"/>
between the violence of a Tyrant than of another
man; then it teaches to Resist both alike: But it putteth no
difference, but rather aggravates that of a Tyrant; being the
violence of a man, the injustice of a member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
&amp; the cruelty of a Tyrant. And it were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
to say, we might defend our selves from the lesser vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
&amp; not from the greater. 5. If particular Nature must
yeeld to the good of Universal nature; then must one man,
though in greatest power, be Resisted, rather than the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Common-wealth suffer hurt: But the former is true;
for that dictates the necessity of the distracted father to be
bound by his oun sons, lest all the family be hurt: <hi>Ergo</hi> the
greatest of men or Kings, when destructive to the Common-wealth,
must be Resisted; for he is but one man, &amp; so but
particular nature. 6. That which is irrational, and reflects
upon Providence, as puting men in a worse condition then
Brutes, is absurd and contrary to the Law of Nature: But
to say, that the Brutes have power to defend themselves
by resisting what annoyes them, and deny this power to
men, is irrational and reflects upon Providence, as puting
men in a worse condition than Brutes: Therefore it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
&amp; contrary to the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>3. From the <hi>Institution</hi> of Government I may argue thus:
That power and Government which is not of God may be
Resisted: The Tyrants power &amp; Government, in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
Laws, subverting Religion, bringing in Idolatry,
oppressing Subjects, is not of God: <hi>Ergo</hi> it may be Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
The <hi>Major</hi> is clear, because that is only the reason why
he is not to be resisted, because the Ordinance of God is not
to be resisted <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2. But they that resist a man destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Interests of mankind, overturning Laws, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
Religion &amp;c. do not resist the Ordinance of God.
And if it were not so, this would tend irremedilessly to
overthrow all Policies, and open a gap to all disorder, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
&amp; cruelty, and would give as great encouragment
to Tyrants to do what they lift, as thieves would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
if they knew no body would resist them or bring
them to punishment.</p>
               <p>4. From the <hi>Original Constitution</hi> of Government by men,
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:41139:311"/>
It may be argued thus: If people at the first erection of
Government acted rationally, and did not put themselves
in a worse case than before, wherein it was Lawful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves against all injuries, but devolved their
rights upon the fiduuciary Tutory of such, as should remain
still in the rank of men, that can do wrong, who had no
power but by their gift, consent, &amp; choice, with whom
they associated not to their detriment but for their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and determined the form of their Government, and
time of its continuance, and in what cases they might recur
to their primeve Liberty, and settled a succession to have
Course not <hi>jure hereditario</hi> but <hi>jure &amp; vi legis,</hi> for good ends;
Then they did not give away their birth-right of self defence,
and power of resistence, which they had before to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the violence, injuries, &amp; oppressions of the men they
set over them, when they pervert the form and convert it
to Tyranny, but did retain a power &amp; priviledge to resist
and revolt from them, and repell their violence when they
should do violence to the Constitution, and pervert the
ends thereof: But the former is true. <hi>Ergo</hi>—The <hi>Minor</hi>
is cleared <hi>Head.</hi> 2. And the Connexion is confirmed from
this; if the Estates of a Kingdom give the power to a King,
it is their oun power in the fountain, and if they give it for
their oun good, they have power to judge when it is used
against themselves, and for their evil; and so power to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
&amp; resist the power that they gave.</p>
               <p>5. From the way &amp; <hi>manner of erecting Governours</hi> by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
the necessity whereof is proven <hi>Head.</hi> 2. Many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
might be deduced; I shall reduce them to this
form: If people must propose Conditions unto Princes,
to be by them acquiesced in &amp; submitted unto at their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the Government, which thereupon becomes the
fundamental Laws of the Government, and Securities for
the peoples rights &amp; Liberties, giving a Law Claim to the
people to pursue the Prince, in case of fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing in the main
&amp; principal thing Covenanted, as their oun Covenanted
<hi>Mandatarius</hi> who hath no <hi>Ius</hi> or Authority of his oun, but
what he hath from them, and no more power but what is
contained in the Conditions, upon which he undertaketh
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:41139:311"/>
the Government; Then when either an Usurper will
come under no such conditions, or a Tyrant doth break
all these conditions, which he once accepted, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>stricto jure</hi> no Prince, and the people be <hi>stricto jure</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated
from subjection to him, they may &amp; must Defend
themselves and their fundamental Rights &amp; Priviledges,
Religion &amp; Laws, and Resist the Tyanny overturning
them: But the former is true <hi>Ergo</hi>—The Connexion is
clear: And the <hi>Minor</hi> is proved <hi>Head.</hi> 2. And at length
demonstrated and applied to the Government of <hi>Charles
the Second</hi> by <hi>Ius Populi. cap.</hi> 6. See <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. &amp; 5. <hi>Head.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>6. From the <hi>Nature</hi> of Magistracy it may be argued thus.
That power which is properly neither Parental, nor Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rital,
nor Masterly, &amp; Despotick, over the Subjects
Persons &amp; goods, but only fiduciary and by way of trust, is
more to be Resisted than that which is properly so: But
that power which is properly so, that is Parental power,
and Marital, and Masterly, may be Resisted in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
<hi>Ergo</hi> that power which is not so properly, but only
<hi>fiduciary</hi> is more to be Resisted. That a Kings power over
his subjects is neither Parental, nor Marital, &amp;c. is proven
<hi>Head.</hi> 2. And the <hi>Major</hi> needs no Probation. The <hi>Minor</hi> is
clear by Instances. 1. If Children may in case of necessity
resist the fury of their father, seeking to destroy them;
then must private subjects Resist the rage &amp; Tyranny of
Princes, seeking to destroy them, and what is dearest to
them; for there is no stricter obligation Moral between
King &amp; people, than between Parents &amp; Children, nor so
strict; and between Tyrants &amp; people there is none at all:
But the former cannot be denyed: <hi>Ergo</hi>—2. If Wives
may Lawfully defend themselves against the unjust violence
of enraged Husbands; then must private subjects have
power to Resist the furious assaults of enraged Tyrants,
for there is not so great a tye betwixt them and people, as
between man &amp; wife; yea there is none at all: But the
former is true: <hi>Ergo</hi>—3. If Servants may defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against their Masters; then must private subjects
defend themselves against a Tyrant or his Emissaries: But
the former is true: <hi>Ergo</hi>—4. If the Kings power be only
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:41139:312"/>
                  <hi>fiduciary,</hi> and by way of <hi>Paun,</hi> which he hath got to keep;
then when that power is manifestly abused, to the hurt
of them that entrusted him with it, he ought to be Resisted
by all whom he undertook to protect: But the former is
true: <hi>Ergo</hi> the latter.</p>
               <p>7. From in the <hi>Limited power</hi> of Princes it may be thus
argued: If Princes be limited by Laws &amp; Contracts, and
may be resisted by Plea's in Law, and have no absolute
power to do &amp; command what they will, but must be
limited both by the Laws of God and man, and cannot
make what Laws they will in prejudice of the peoples
Rights, nor execute the Laws made according to their
pleasure, nor conser on others a Lawless licence to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
whom they please; Then when they turn Tyrants,
and arrogate a Lawless Absoluteness, and cross the Rules
&amp; transgress the Bounds prescribed by Gods Law &amp; mans
Law, and make their oun lust a Law, and execute the
same arbitrarly, They must be Resisted by force, when a
legal resistence cannot be had, in defence of Religion and
Liberty: But all Princes are limited &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi>—The
<hi>Minor</hi> is proved <hi>Head.</hi> 2. And the Connexion may be thus
confirmed in short: That power which is not the Ordinance
of God may be resisted: But an absolute illimited power,
crossing the Rules and transgressing the bounds prescribed
by Gods Law and mans, is not the Ordinance of God:
<hi>Ergo</hi> it may be Resisted.</p>
               <p>8. Further from the <hi>Rule</hi> of Government it may be
argued several wayes. 1. That power which is contrary
to Law, evil &amp; Tyrannical, can tye none to subjection,
but if it oblige to anything, it tyes to Resistence: But the
power of a King against Law, Religion, and the Interests
of the subjects, is a power contrary to Law, evil &amp; Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical:
<hi>Ergo</hi>—The <hi>Major</hi> is plain, for Wickedness
can tye no man but to resist it: That power which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Law evil &amp; Tyrannical is Wickedness. 2. That
power and those Acts, which neither King can exerce
nor command, nor others execute, nor any obey, must
certainly be Resisted: But such is the power and Acts that
oppress the subjects, and overturn Religion &amp; Liberty:
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:41139:312"/>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi>—The <hi>Minor</hi> is evident from Scriptures condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
oppression &amp; violence, both in them that command,
and in them that execute the same, and also them that
obey such wicked commands. The <hi>Major</hi> is clear from
Reason: both because such power &amp; such Acts as cannot
be commanded, cannot be executed, cannot be obeyed
Lawfully, are sinful &amp; wicked; and because it cannot be
a Magistratical power, for that may alwayes be exerced &amp;
executed Lawfully. And what a man cannot command,
the resisting of that he cannot punish: But acts of oppression
against Law, Religion, &amp; Liberty, a man cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
<hi>Ergo</hi> the Resisting of these he cannot punish.
3. That Government or Administration, which is not
subordinate to the Law &amp; Will of God, who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
it, must be Resisted; But that Government or
Administration, which undermines or overturnes Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
&amp; Liberty, is not subordinate to the Law &amp; Will of
God: <hi>Ergo</hi>—The <hi>Major</hi> is clear: for nothing but what
is the Ordinance of God, subordinate to His Law &amp;
Will, is irresistible <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2. The Assumption is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable.</p>
               <p>9. From the <hi>Ends</hi> of Government, which must be
acknowledged by all to be, the Glory of God, and the
Good of Mankind: yea all that have been either wise or
honest, have alwayes held that <hi>Salus Populi est Suprema Lex,</hi>
The Arguments may run thus, in short. 1. That Doctrine
which makes the Holy one to cross His oun ends in giving
Governours, must be absurd &amp; Unchristian, as well as
irrational: But such is the Doctrine that makes all Kings
&amp; Tyrants irresistible upon any pretence whatsoever. <hi>Ergo</hi>—The
<hi>minor</hi> I prove: That Doctrine which makes God
intending His oun Glory &amp; the peoples good, to give Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
both as Fathers to preserve and as Murderers to
destroy them, must make the Holy one to cross His oun
ends; for these are Contradictory: But the Doctrine that
makes all Kings &amp; Tyrants irresistible &amp;c. is such: For by
Office they are Fathers to preserve, and by Office also they
must be Murderers, vested with such a power from God
<hi>actu primo,</hi> if they be irresistible when they do so; seeing
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:41139:313"/>
every power that is irresistible is the Ordinance of God.
Hence also when a Blessing turns a Curse it is no more the
Ordinance of God, but to be resisted: But when a King
turns a Tyrant, overturning Religion &amp; Liberty, then a
Blessing turns a Curse: <hi>Ergo</hi>—2. Means are to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
when they are not useful for but destructive to the
ends they were appointed for: But Governours overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Religion &amp; Liberty, are Means not useful for, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to the ends for which they were appointed, Seeing
then they are neither for the Glory of God, nor the good
of Mankind. <hi>Ergo</hi>—3. If all powers &amp; Prerogatives of
men, are only means appointed for and should vaile unto
the Supreme Law of the peoples Safety, and all Laws be
subordinate to and corroborative of this Law, and when
cross to it are <hi>eatenus</hi> null &amp; no Laws, and all Law-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
in Competition with it are to be laid aside, and all
Parliamentary priviledges must yeeld to this, and King &amp;
Parliament both conspiring have no power against it, and
no Soveraign power by virtue of any resignation from the
people can comprize any Authority to act against it; Then
it is duty to obey this Supreme Law, in Resisting all
powers &amp; Prerogatives, all Laws &amp; Law-formalities,
and all conspiracies whatsoever against this Supreme Law,
the Safety of the people: But the former is true, as was
proven <hi>Head. 2. Ergo</hi>—4. That power which is obliged
&amp; appointed to command &amp; rule, Justly &amp; Religiously,
for the good of the people, and is only set over them on
these conditions, and for that end, cannot tye them to
subjection without Resistence, when the power is abused
to destruction of Laws: Religion, and people: But all
power is so obliged &amp; appointed: Therefore whensoever
it is so abused it cannot tye people to subjection, but rather
oblige them to Rejection of it.</p>
               <p>10. From the <hi>Obedience</hi> required to Government, It
may be argued thus. 1. If we may flee from Tyrants,
then we may Resist them: But we may flee from Tyrants:
<hi>Ergo</hi> we may Resist them. The Connexion I prove (1) If
all grounds of Justice will warrand the one as well as the
other, then if the one be duty so is the other: But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:41139:313"/>
is true: For the same justice &amp; equity that warrands
declining a Tyrants unjust violence by flight, will warrand
Resistence when flight will not do it; The same Principle
of self defence, that makes flight duty when Resistence is
not possible, will aso make Resistence duty when flight is
not possible; The same Principle of Charity to Wives &amp;
Children, that makes flight Lawful when by Resistence
they cannot avoid Tyranny, will make Resistence duty
when by flight they cannot evite it; The same Principle of
Conscience to keep Religion free, that prompts to flight
when Resistence will not save it, will also prompt to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
when flight is not practicable. (2) If to flee from a just
power, when in Justice we are obnoxious to its sword,
be to resist the Ordinance of God and so sin; then to flee
from an unjust power must be also a Resisting of the abusing
of it, and so duty, for the one is Resistence as the other,
but the difference of the power resisted makes the one
Lawful the other not: Again, if Royal power may be
resisted by interposing seas and miles, why not also by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing
walls &amp; armes? both is resistence, for against
a Lawful Magistrate that would be resistence. (3) If a
Tyrant hath irresistible power to kill and destroy the
people, he hath also irresistible power to cite &amp; summond
them before him; and if it be unlawful to resist his murders,
it must be as unlawful to resist his summonds. (4) For a
Church or Community of Christians persecuted for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to flee with Wives &amp; Children, strong &amp; weak,
old &amp; yong, to escape Tyrannical violence, and leave the
Land, were more unlawful than to Resist: For what is
not possible as a Natural means of preservation, is not a
Lawful mean; but this were not a possible mean: Neither
is it warranted in Natures Law, or Gods Word, for a
Communitie or Society of Christians, that have Gods
Right and mans Law to the Land and the Covenanted
Priviledges thereof, to leave the Country and Cause of
Christ, and all in the hands of a Tyrant &amp; <hi>Papist,</hi> to set up
Idolatry upon the ruines of Reformation there. A private
man may flee, but flight is not warranted of them as of a
private single man. 2. If it be duty to disobey, its duty to
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:41139:314"/>
Resist Tyrants, in defence of Religion &amp; Liberty: But it
is duty to disobey them. <hi>Ergo</hi>—The Connexion only
will be stuck at which is thus strengthened: If subjection
be no more pressed in Scripture than obedience, then if
non-obedience be duty, non-subjection must be so also,
and consequently Resistence: But subjection is no more
pressed in Scripture than obedience: For all Commands
of subjection to the Higher powers as Gods Ministers,
under pain of damnation, do only respect Lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats,
and in Lawful things and do include obedience;
and non-obedience to the power so qualified is a resisting of
the Ordinance of God, as well as non-subjection: If then
obedience to Magistrats be duty, and non-obedience sin,
and obedience to Tyrants sin and non-obedience duty;
Then by Parity of reason, subjection to Magistrats is duty
and non-subjection is sin, and also subjection to Tyrants is
sin and non-subjection duty.</p>
               <p>11. From the <hi>Resistence</hi> allowed in all Governments,
it may be argued thus: If it be duty to defend our Religion,
Lives, &amp; Liberties, against an invading army of Cut-throat
<hi>Papists, Turks,</hi> or <hi>Tartars,</hi> without or against the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats
warrand; Then it must be duty to defend the same
against invading home-bred Tyrants, except we would
subscribe our selves home-born slaves: But the former is
true: <hi>Ergo</hi>—The <hi>Minor</hi> cannot be doubted; because the
Magistrats power cannot be privative &amp; destructive to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of our Religion, Lives, &amp; Liberties; nor can it
take away Natures birth-right to defend these; or make it
fare the worse than if we had no Magistrats at all, now if
we had no Magistrats at all we might defend these against
Invaders, and whether we have Magistrats or not we are
under Moral obligations of the Law of God to endeavour
the defence of these: But this needs not be insisted on.
The Connexion of the Proposition is clear: If Princes be
more Tyrannical in invading Religion &amp; Liberties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
than in suffering others to do it, or hindering them
to be opposed; And if their invasion be more Tyrannical,
hurtful, &amp; dangerous than the invasion of Strangers; Then
if it be duty to resist Strangers invading these Interests, it is
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:41139:314"/>
more duty to Resist home-bred Tyrants invading the same:
But the former is true: Therefore the latter. Resisting in
the one case is no more Resisting the Ordinance of God
than in the other.</p>
               <p>12. From the <hi>Motives</hi> of Resistence we may draw this
Argument, which might be branched out into several, but
I shall reduce it to this Complexe one: If when we are in a
Capacity, we cannot acquit our selves in the duties that we
owe to our Covenanted Religion, and our Covenanted
Brethren, and Posterity, and our selves, nor absolve &amp;
exoner our selves from the sin &amp; Judgment of Tyrants,
who overturn Religion, oppress our Brethren, impose
slavery on our selves, and entail it upon Posterity, by a
Passive subjection, submission to, and not opposing these
mischiefs; Then Resistence is necessary: But the former is
true: <hi>Ergo</hi>—The Connexion is clear: for there cannot
be a <hi>Medium;</hi> if we cannot discharge these duties by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
submission, and not opposing; then we must do
them by non-subjection, non-submission, and opposing;
since they must be done some way. The Assumption is
thus confirmed. 1. The duties we owe to Religion, when
it is corrupted, declined from, &amp; overturned, are not
only to Reforme our oun hearts &amp; wayes, and keep our
selves Pure from the Corruptions established, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
and witness against the Complyers with the same,
and so by work, doing &amp; suffering, keep &amp; contend for
the Word of our Testimony; But further, when by the
Constitution of the Kingdom Religion is become a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Law, and consequently the Magistrate overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, is violating &amp; everting the main grounds &amp; ends of
the Government, and turning grassant &amp; ingrained Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
especially when it is not only so Authorized &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by Law, but Corroberated by solemn vowes &amp;
Covenants made &amp; sworn unto God by all ranks of people,
to <hi>maintain &amp; defend this Religion with their lives &amp; fortunes</hi>—and
<hi>resist all contrary errors &amp; corruptions according to their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and the uttermost of that power that God puts in their hands,
all the dayes of their lives, As also mutually to defend &amp; assist one
another.</hi> (as in the National Covenant) And <hi>sincerely, really,
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:41139:315"/>
&amp; constantly endeavour—the Preservation of the Reformed
Religion in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, &amp; Government, the
extirpation of Poperie, Prelacie &amp;c—and to assist &amp; defend
all those that enter into the same bond in the maintaining thereof—</hi>
(as in the Solemn League) Then to defend &amp; maintain that
Religion and themselves Professing it; when it is sought
to be razed; This must be an Interest as necessary to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
as that of our bodies which is far inferiour, and as
necessary a duty, as to defend our Natural &amp; Civil Liberties
from perpetual slaverie, and as preferrable thereunto, as
Christ Interest is to mans, and as the end of all self pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
is to the means of it, the preservation of Religion
being the end of all self preservation: But this duty cannot
be discharged without Resistence, in a meer Passive sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
&amp; submission; Otherwise the same might be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
in our universal submission to <hi>Turks</hi> coming to
destroy our Religion. Certainly this Passive way cannot
answer the duty of <hi>Pleading for Truth Isai. 59. 4. seeking the
Truth Ier.</hi> 5. 1. being <hi>valiant for it Ier. 9. 3. making up the
hedge, standing in the Gap &amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 22. 30. which yet are
necessary incumbent duties according to our Capacity;
Therefore we cannot answer the duties we owe to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in a meer Passive way. 2. The duty we owe to our
Covenanted Brethren, is to assist &amp; defend them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
them when oppressed, as we are bound by our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
and antecedently by the Royal Law of Christ,
the foundation of all Righteousness among men toward
each other, <hi>Math. 7. 12. All things whatsoever ye would that
men should do to yow, do ye even so to them</hi>—We would have
them helping us when we are oppressed, so should we do
to them when it is in the power of our hands to do it, and
not forbear to deliver them for fear the Lord require their
blood at our hand, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 11, 12. But this cannot be
done by meer subjection with out Resistence. 3. There is
no way to free our selves of the sin &amp; judgment of Tyrants
by meer Passive subjection: We find in the Scriptures,
people have been so involved and punished for the sins of
Tyrants; As the people of <hi>Iudah</hi> for <hi>Manasseh 2 King.</hi> 21.
11. &amp;c. <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 4. whose sins if they had not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:41139:315"/>
the judgments for them had been prevented, and
if the people had hindered them they had not smarted; But
being joyntly included with their Rulers in the same bond
of fidelity to God, and made accountable as joynt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals
with their Kings for that debt, by their Mutual as well
as Several engagments to walk in His Wayes, they were
lyable to be punished for their Rebellion &amp; Apostasie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they did not hinder it. Hence some-what must be
done to free our selves of their sin and to escape their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
But this can be nothing else but opposition to them
by Resistence; or else if we make any other opposition, it
will make us more a prey to their fury.</p>
               <p>II. Secondly this Truth is Confirmed from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Practice</hi> of the people of God, even under Persecution.
Whence I shall draw an Argument <hi>ab Exemplis,</hi> which to
condemn were impious, and to deny were most impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
And for formes sake, it may run thus: What the
people of God under both Testaments have frequently
done, in time of Persecution, for defending, vindicating,
or recovering their Religion &amp; Liberties, may &amp; ought
to be done again in the like Circumstances, when these are
in the like hazard: But under both Testaments, the people
of God frequently in times of Persecution have defended,
vindicated, or Recovered their Religion &amp; Liberties by
defensive Armes, Resisting the Soveraign powers that
sought to dostroy them: <hi>Ergo</hi> this may &amp; ought to be done
again when these Religious Civil &amp; natural priviledges, are
in the like hazard to be destroyed by the violent encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Soveraign powers. The Proposition cannot
be denyed, except by them that do profess themselves ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the people of God, and condemn their most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
reiterated practices most solemnly &amp; signally ouned
of God, to the confusion of their enemies, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the World, that the Cause for which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
was of God, and to the encouragment of all the
Patrons of such a Cause, to hope that when it is at the
lowest it shall have a Revival &amp; Glorious Issue. It is true
somtimes they did not Resist, when either they were not
in a Capacity, or did not see a Call to such an Action, but
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:41139:316"/>
were extraordinarly Spirited of the Lord for Passive Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
under a suffering dispensation: But 'tis as true,
that many times they did Resist, when the Lord capacitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
called, &amp; Spirited them for Active Testimonies. And
therefore, if their Suffering under these Circumstances
may be imitated by a people so stated; Then also their
Actions under these other Circumstances may be imitated,
by a people in the like case. And by an impartial Scrutiny
it will be found, that the examples of their endeavoured
Resistence will be litle inferiour, if not superiour in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
or importance, to the examples of their submissive
Sufferings in all ages: Which will appear in the Probation
of the Assumption, by adduction of many Instances, which
I shall only cursorly glean out of that plentiful harvest that
Histories afford.</p>
               <p>1. I need only to glance at that known &amp; famous History
of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> of undoubted verity, though not of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
Authority. In which, according to Scripture Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
we have a notable account of Heroick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes,
Atchievments, &amp; Exploits, performed by them
that <hi>knew their God,</hi> and tendered His Glory and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
&amp; Countries Liberties, above the Common Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrestick
notions of incontrollable irresistible <hi>Royaltie,</hi> and
absolute implicite <hi>Loyaltie,</hi> that have abused the world in
all ages. We have there an account of the noble &amp; suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful
Resistence of a party of a few Godly &amp; zealous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots,
without the concurrence of Civil Authority, or
countenance of the <hi>Ephori</hi> or <hi>Primores regni,</hi> against a King
universally acknowledged &amp; subjected unto, that <hi>came in
Peaceably,</hi> and obtained the Kingdom <hi>by fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ries,</hi> with
whom the greatest part and those of the greatest note took
part, and <hi>did wickedly against the Covenant</hi> and Nations In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and were <hi>corrupt by flatteries:</hi> Yet a few Priests,
with the concurrence of some common Country-men,
did go to armes against him and them; And the Lord did
wonderfully assist them for a considerable time, as was
foretold by <hi>Daniel.</hi> 11. This fell out under the persecution
of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and was happily begun by <hi>Mathias</hi>
a Godly Priest, and his five Sons, who being commanded
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:41139:316"/>
under severe Certifications to Worship according to the
then Law and the Kings wicked lust, did valiantly resist
that abomination, and went to defensive armes: which
while living he Patronized, and when adying did encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
his sons to it by a notable Oration, shewing what case
his Country was in, and what a duty &amp; dignity it was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
&amp; deliver it. This was vigorously prosecuted by <hi>Iudas
Maccabeus,</hi> expressly for the quarrel of Religion &amp; Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
against that mighty Tyrant &amp; all his Emissaries.</p>
               <p>2. To come to the History of the Gospel Dispensation:
It is true, in that time of the <hi>Primitive Persecutions</hi> under
Heathen Emperours, this Priviledge of Self Defence was
not much improved or contended for by Christians, who
studied more to play the <hi>Martyrs</hi> than to play the <hi>Men,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in these Circumstances the Lord was pleased to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
for and call them unto, and accept off their hands, <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Testimonies;</hi> while they were incorporate under a Civil
relation with the Heathens, in subjection to Governours
who did not by open Tyrannie overturn their Civil Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
only did endeavour to eradicate Religion, which at
that time had never become their Right by Law; while
they were scattered and out of Capacity, and never could
come to a separate formed Community by joynt Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
&amp; Correspondence, to undertake a Declared Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence;
while Religion was only a propagating through
the Nations, and the Lord Providentially did preclude the
least appearance that might be of propagating it by any form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
force, being the Gospel of Peace designed to save and not
to destroy: Yet even then, Instances are not wanting of
Christians Resisting their Enemies, and of Rescuing their
Ministers &amp;c. As these are found on record. 1. How
some inhabiting <hi>Mareots,</hi> with force rescued <hi>Dyonisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                  </hi> of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> out of the hands of such as were carrying him
away, about the year 235. 2. How about the year 310. the
<hi>Armenians</hi> waged war against <hi>Maximus,</hi> who was come
against them with an Army, because of their Religion. 3.
How about the year 342. the Citizens of <hi>Alexandria</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<hi>Athanasius</hi> their Minister, against <hi>Gregorius</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
Curate, and <hi>Syrianus</hi> the Emperours Captain, who
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:41139:317"/>
came with great force to put him in. 4. How about the
year 356. the people of <hi>Constantinople</hi> did in like manner
stand to the defence of <hi>Paulus,</hi> against <hi>Constantius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and killed his Captain <hi>Hermogenes:</hi> And afterwards
in great Multitudes they opposed the intrusion of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<hi>Macedonius.</hi> 5. How, when a wicked Edict was sent
forth to pull doun the Churches of such as were for the
Clause of <hi>one Substance,</hi> the Christians that maintained that
Testimony resisted the bands of Souldiers, that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
at the Emperours Command by <hi>Macedonius,</hi> to force
the <hi>Mantinians</hi> to embrace the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie: But the
Christians at <hi>Mantinium,</hi> kindled with an earnest zeal
towards Christian Religion, went against the Souldiers
with Cheerful minds &amp; valiant Courage, and made a great
slaughter of them. 6. How about the year 387. the people
of <hi>Cesarea</hi> did defend <hi>Basil</hi> their Minister. 7. How for fear
of the people, the Lievtenant of the Emperour <hi>Valens,</hi>
durst not execute those 80 Priests who had came to suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the Emperour, and were commanded to be killed by
him. 8. How the Inhabitants of Mount <hi>Nitria</hi> espoused
<hi>Cyril<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> quarrel, and assaulted the Lievtenant and forced
his Guards to flee. 9. How about the year 404. when the
Emperour had banished <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> the people flocked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
so that the Emperour was necessitated to call him
back again from his Exile. 10. How the people resisted
also the transportation of <hi>Ambrose</hi> by the command of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi>
the Emperour; And chused rather to lose their
lives, than to suffer their pastor to be taken away by the
Souldiers. 11. How the Christians, oppressed by <hi>Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi>
King of <hi>Persia,</hi> did flee to the <hi>Romans</hi> to seek their
help. And <hi>Theodosius,</hi> the Emperour, is much praised for
the war which he commenced against <hi>Chosroes</hi> King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
upon this inducement, that that King sought to ruine
&amp; exstirpate those Christians in his Dominions, that would
not renounce the Gospel.</p>
               <p>3. But when Religion was once imbraced in imbodyed
Corporations, and established by Law, and became a
peoples common Interest &amp; Liberty, in a Capacity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it with their lives &amp; other Liberties, and when it was
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:41139:317"/>
propagated through the Nations: Then the Lord did call
for other more <hi>Active</hi> Testimonies, in the preservation &amp;
defence of it: Of which we have many Instances in Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
About the year 894. The <hi>Bohemian</hi> Christians Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Drahomica</hi> their Queen, who thought to have destroyed
them &amp; reintroduced <hi>Paganisme.</hi> About the year 1420.
they maintained a long defensive war against the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the <hi>Popes</hi> Legats, under the managment of their
brave Captain <hi>Zizca;</hi> which was further prosecuted after
him by the remaining <hi>Thaborites.</hi> And again in this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
<hi>anno</hi> 1618. They maintained a Defensive war against
the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand the Second,</hi> electing and erecting a
new King in opposition to him, <hi>Frederick Palatine</hi> of the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> in which Cause many received the Crown of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom:
and this was also espoused by King <hi>Iames the</hi> 6.
who sent to aid his Son in Law against the Emperour.</p>
               <p>4. If we look to the Histories of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> these
constant Opposers of Antichrist, we will find many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of their Resistence. About the year 1194. very early,
while <hi>Waldo</hi> (from whom they had their name) was alive,
they began to defend themselves by Armes, after the
bloody Edict of <hi>Aldephonsus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon;</hi> an Edict so
like to many of ours emitted this day, that as it would seem
our Enemies have taken the Copy of it, so it were very
seemly for the people grieved with such Edicts to imitate
the Copy of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> their practice, in opposition to
them. <hi>Anno</hi> 1488. they resist by Armes <hi>Albert de Capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis</hi>
sent by <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the 8. in <hi>Pragola</hi> &amp; <hi>Frassaniere,</hi> and
through out <hi>Piedmont;</hi> where for the most part the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of the old <hi>Waldenses</hi> had their residence, where very
evidently, through many successions of ages, they shewed
themselves to be the true Successors of their Worthy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors,
valiant for the Truth. Thats a famous Instance
of their Resistence, in opposing vigorously the <hi>Lord of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
in that same <hi>Piedmont,</hi> at which time they so solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
asked their Ministers, Whether it were not Lawful to
defend themselves against his violence? Who answered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively.
And accordingly they did it with wonderful
success at that time, and many times thereafter. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:41139:318"/>
it is notour; in the memory of this present age, how
<hi>anno</hi> 1655. a vigorous defensive war was prosecuted against
the D. <hi>Savoy,</hi> by their Captains <hi>Gianavel, Iahier</hi> &amp;c. which
was espoused by many Protestant Princes. And no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gone than the very last year, it is known how they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
the Armes of the <hi>Tyger,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> that helped
him, and that their Simplicity in trusting <hi>Popish</hi> promises
was their ruine.</p>
               <p>5. If we look over the Histories of the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> we
find many Instances of their Defensive Resisting their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
Superiours. About <hi>anno</hi> 1200. They defended
themselves at <hi>Beziers</hi> and <hi>Carcasson,</hi> against the <hi>Popes</hi> Legat
and his Crossed Souldiers, under the Conduct, first of
the Earle of <hi>Beziers,</hi> and then of the Earle of <hi>Foix,</hi> and
Earle <hi>Remand</hi> of <hi>Thoulouse,</hi> and were helped by the <hi>English</hi>
who then possessed <hi>Guienne</hi> bordering upon <hi>Thoulouse:</hi>
which resistence continued several years. Afterwards <hi>anno</hi>
1226. they maintained a Resistence against the King of
<hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. In <hi>Spain,</hi> we find the people of <hi>Arragon</hi> contesting
with <hi>Alphonso</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> and associating themselves together
against him. And they tell <hi>Pedro</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> their King, that if he
would not contain himself within the limits of the Laws,
they would pursue him by Armes, about <hi>anno</hi> 1283. As
also other <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who rose in Armes several times
against <hi>Pedro</hi> the 1 King of <hi>Castile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. It was this which brought the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Helvetia</hi> into
this State of freedom, wherein they have continued many
years. For about the year 1260. they levied war against
their oppressing nobles. And <hi>anno</hi> 1308. they joined in
Covenant to defend themselves against the house of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria:</hi>
and <hi>anno</hi> 1315. they renewed it at <hi>Brunna,</hi> in which
at length the rest of the <hi>Cantons</hi> joined, and formed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into a Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>8. If we take a glance of the <hi>Germans,</hi> we will find at the
very Commencement of the Reformation, as soon as they
got the name of <hi>Protestants,</hi> they Resisted the Emperour
<hi>Charles the fifth.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> the Land Grave of
<hi>Hesse,</hi> and the City of <hi>Magd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>burgh,</hi> with Advice of Lawyers,
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:41139:318"/>
concluded <q>That the Laws of the Empire permitted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
of the Emperour in some cases, that the times
were then so dangerous, that the very force of Conscience
did lead them to Armes, and to make a League to defend
themselves, though <hi>Caesar</hi> or any in his name should
make war against them—for since he attempteth to
root out Religion, and subvert our Liberties, he giveth
us cause enough to resist him with a good conscience:
The matter standing as it doth, we may (say they) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
as may be shewed both by Sacred &amp; Profane Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</q>—
And so they undertooke and stated the war upon
the account of Religion &amp; Liberty.</p>
               <p>9. If we but cast an eye over to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> we will
find how much they stand obliged to this practice of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
Armes; having thereby recovered both Religion &amp;
Liberty, and established themselves into a fiourishing
State. We find even in the time of <hi>D. de Alva's</hi> Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they began to defend <hi>Haerlem</hi> and <hi>Valenciennes</hi> in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault,</hi>
and went on till under the conduct of <hi>William</hi> of
<hi>Nassaw</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> they declared the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to
have fallen from the Government of those Countries: and
so effectually shook off the yoke of <hi>Spanish</hi> Tyrannie.</p>
               <p>10. If we go to the <hi>French Hugenots,</hi> we will find many
Instances among them, and many brave Heroes raised
up, to maintain the principle and prosecute the practice
thereof, of older &amp; later date. The History of the Civil
wars of <hi>France</hi> is stored with their Trophees; and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
of <hi>Condie</hi> &amp; <hi>Coligni</hi> will ever be fragrant. There
were many Resistences there, both before &amp; since the <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian
Massacre.</hi> It is sad, that the present <hi>Protestants</hi> there are
so far degenerate from the Spirit of their Ancestors.</p>
               <p>11. The many practices of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> Resisting the
encroachments of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> prove the same.
And when <hi>Mathias</hi> denyed the free exercise of Religion
unto the Protestants of <hi>Austria,</hi> they took up Armes
in their oun defence, and sent a Protestation unto the
Estates of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> requiring their Assistence, conforme
to their League. And now this present war there founded
upon this plea.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="612" facs="tcp:41139:319"/>
12. The <hi>Polonians</hi> have often times levied war against
their Kings: and we are furnished by <hi>Clark</hi> in his <hi>Martyrol.</hi>
with a late Instance of their Resistence against the Soveraign
Powers, at <hi>Lesita</hi> in <hi>Poland anno</hi> 1655.</p>
               <p>13. The <hi>Danes</hi> &amp; <hi>Swedes</hi> have not been wanting for their
parts in taking course with their <hi>Christierns,</hi> Kings of that
name, whom they resisted &amp; punished. And generally,
wherever the Reformation was received, we find this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
espoused and the practice of it prosecuted. Nay
there hath been no Nation in the world, but it will be
found, they have either resisted or killed Tyrants.</p>
               <p>14. The most Deserving &amp; Celebrated Monarchs in the
world, have espoused the quarrel of oppressed Subjects.
Not only such as <hi>Tamerlanc,</hi> whose observable Saying is
noted, when he advanced against <hi>Bajazet, I go</hi> (sayes he)
<hi>to chastise his Tyrannie and to deliver the afflicted people.</hi> And
<hi>Philip</hi> &amp; <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who assisted the Barons of <hi>England</hi>
against King <hi>Iohn.</hi> And <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> who upon this
ground undertook a war against the <hi>Lombards</hi> in <hi>Italie.</hi> But
even <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, hath it recorded for his honour,
that he employed his power &amp; force against <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cinius,</hi> upon
no other Motive but because he banished, tortur'd, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
those Christians in his Dominions, that would not
abandon their Religion. And Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is commended,
for assisting the <hi>Dutch</hi> to maintain their Religion by force,
when they could not enjoy it by favour. And King <hi>Iames</hi>
the 6. gave publick aid to the Protestants in <hi>Germany</hi> &amp; <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>
against the Emperour. Against whom also <hi>Gustavus
Adolphus</hi> marched, that he might deliver the oppressed
Cities from the bondage that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had brought them
into. Yea King <hi>Charles the first,</hi> this mans Father, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
at least to help the Protestants in <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Ree</hi> and
<hi>Rochel:</hi> And though he himself was avowedly Resisted by
the Parliaments of both Ringdoms, yet he was forced to
Declare in his Acts of <hi>Oblivion</hi> &amp; <hi>Pacification,</hi> The <hi>Scots late
taking up Armes against him, in defence of their Religion, Laws,
&amp; Priviledges, to be no Treason nor Rebellion</hi>—See <hi>Apol.
Relat. Sect. 11. pag.</hi> 149. And thô the late <hi>Charles the Second</hi>
condemned all the Risings of the people of <hi>Scotland</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:41139:319"/>
of Religion &amp; Liberty, and their lives &amp; priviledges,
which his oun Tyrannie forced them into; yet he justified
the present Revolt of <hi>Heathens</hi> &amp; <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Subjects from
the young King of <hi>Bantam</hi> in <hi>Iava Major</hi> in the <hi>East Indies,</hi>
who, when he got the Government in his hands by his
Fathers Resignation, killed his subjects, and caused them
to be killed without any cause, which was the reason of
their revolt ftom him, and defending the Father against the
son: This defensive war of these Subjects was justied by
the said <hi>Charles,</hi> in his sending Amunition &amp;c. for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
These, and many moe Instances that might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
are sufficient evidences of the Righteousness and
Reason of such Resistences, when the Greatest of Princes
have undertakent he Patrocinie of them.</p>
               <p>III. From <hi>Scripture-Proofs,</hi> I shall but briefly gather
some of the many that might be pressed, which being put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to me seem impregnable. I shall reduce them to these
heads. 1. I shall aduce some practices of the Lords people,
frequently reiterated, never condemned, alwayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven,
confirming this Point. 2. Some severe Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
for their omission of this duty, in the season there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
3. Some promises both of Spiriting for the duty, and
of Countenancing it, when undertaken. 4. Some precepts
commanding such Atchievments. 5. Some prayers sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating
for them. All which put together will make a
strong Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> For <hi>practices</hi> of this kind, there is nothing more
common in Scripture Historie.</p>
               <p>1. I shall begin at the first war that is recorded in the
World: wherein some loss fell to the Godly at first, but
afterwards by the virtue &amp; valour of their Brethren they
were vindicated, and the victory recovered with honour.
<hi>Lot</hi> &amp; his family living in <hi>Sodom</hi> was taken Prisoner, by
<hi>Chedarlaomer</hi> and his Confederates <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 12. but <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
hearing of it, armed his trained servants, and pursued
them to <hi>Dan,</hi> and rescued him <hi>vers.</hi> 14-16. thereby
justifying that Rebellion of the Cities of the plain, by taking
part &amp; vindicating the Rebells. Hence, he that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue
subjects from the violence of any Tyrannizing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:41139:320"/>
by armes, may also rise with these subjects to
oppose that violence: But here is an example of that in
<hi>Abraham—Ergo</hi>—</p>
               <p>2. After the Lords people were possessed of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
and forgetting the Lord did enter into affinity with these
interdicted Nations, some of them were left to prove
<hi>Israel,</hi> that the Generations of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> might
know to teach them war. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 3. 1, 2. And when they
did evil in the sight of the Lord, He sold them into the hand
of <hi>Chushan-rishathaim</hi> King of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> whom they
served and were subject to eight years ver. 8. but when
they cried unto the Lord, their <hi>Rebellion,</hi> shaking off that
yoke, was successful under the Conduct of <hi>Othniel</hi> ver. 10.
And after a relapse unto the like defection, they became
subject to <hi>Eglon</hi> King of <hi>Moab,</hi> whom they served eighteen
years <hi>vers,</hi> 14. but attempting the same remedy by armes,
under the Conduct of <hi>Ehud,</hi> they recovered their Liberty.
And after his death, falling into that sin again which
procured the like Miserie, they became subject to <hi>Iabin</hi>
King of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who twenty years mightily oppressed them
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 4. 1-3. but by the Lords Commandment, under
the Conduct of <hi>Deborah</hi> &amp; <hi>Barak,</hi> they Rebelled &amp; prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Whence, If the Lords people, serving a Soveraign
Domineering power, may shake off the yoke of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
then it is duty to defend themselves and Resist
them, for there is no other way of shaking it off: But these
examples prove the former: <hi>Ergo—Object.</hi> If any Cavil
that these were not their oun Kings, to whom they owed
Allegiance, but only invading Conquerours, whom they
might resist. 1 <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) Yet they were the Soveraign
powers for the time: And therefore, if Royalists &amp; Loya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
grounds hold good, they ought upon no pretence
whatsoever to have been Resisted: And thô possibly they
might not be by Compact their oun Kings, yet by Conquest
they were, as much as that would make them, and by
their oun Consent, when they paid them Kings due,
viz, <hi>tribute.</hi> (2) No more are they our oun Kings, who
either intrude themselves into an Arbitrary Domination
over us (without any terms of a Compact, upon a pretence
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:41139:320"/>
of hereditary succession) or being our Covenanted Kings
overturn all the Conditions of their Compact, &amp; degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into Tyrants: To such we owe no Allegiance, more
than <hi>Israel</hi> did to these Dominators. (3) I retort that old
<hi>recocta Crambe,</hi> who should be Judge, whether they were
their oun Lawful Kings or not? For they acted as Kings,
and thought themselves their absolute Lords, and gave
themselves out to be such; And yet we find an approved
Rebellion against them. <hi>Mr Gee</hi> in his <hi>Magistrats Original
chap. 8. Sect. 4. Pag.</hi> 268. improves these Instances to the
same purpose, And addes <q>Neither (as far as my obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
goes) can any immediate or extraordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or Word for what they so did be pretended to, or
pleaded from the Text, for many of them, or for any
save <hi>Barak</hi> or <hi>Gideon.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>3. Yet <hi>Gideons</hi> example, thô he had an extraordinary
Call, cannot be pretended as unimitable on the matter;
for that was ordinary, thô the Call &amp; Manner was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.
He, with the Concurrence of a very few
men, did break the yoke of subjection, to <hi>Midian Iudg.</hi>
6. &amp; 7. Ch: And having called his Brethren out of all
mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> into a conjunction with him in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of his victory; When he demanded supply of the
Princes of <hi>Succoth,</hi> and of the men of <hi>Penuel,</hi> and they
denied it, he served them as Enemies. Whence, If a
small party may with Gods Approbation deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and the whole of their Community, from the
bondage of their oppressing Dominators whom they had
served several years, and may punish their Princes that do
not come out to their help, in a Concurrence with them
and encouragement of them in that attempt; Then must
it be duty to defend themselves against their Oppressours
that rule over them, and all ought to concur in it; or else
there would not be justice in punishing them that were
defective in this work: But we see the former from this
Example <hi>Ergo—Object.</hi> If it be said, <hi>Gideon,</hi> and the
rest of the extraordinary raised Judges, were Magistrats,
therefore they might defend &amp; deliver their Country,
which a private people that are only subjects may not do.
<hi>I ans.</hi> (1) They were subject to these Tyrants that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:41139:321"/>
them, who were then the Soveraign powers of that
time, and yet they shook off their yoke by defensive armes.
(2) They were not the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Magistrats, when they first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
for their Countries defence &amp; deliverance, neither
in that did they act as such, but only as Captains of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells,
in the esteem of them that had power over them. It
is clear <hi>Gideon</hi> was not Ruler, till that Authority was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
upon him after the deliverance. See <hi>Iudg.</hi> S. 22. &amp;c.
Yet he did all this before.</p>
               <p>4. When his bastard <hi>Abimelech</hi> Usurped the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and was made King by the men of <hi>Schechem;</hi> At
length God sending an Evil Spirit between him and his
Complices that set him up, not only was he Resisted by the
treacherous <hi>Shechemites</hi> (which was their brand &amp; bane, in
the righteous Judgement of God, for their aiding him at
first in killing his Brethren) <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9. 23; 24. &amp;c. but also he
was opposed by others of the men of <hi>Israel,</hi> as at <hi>Thebez,</hi>
where he was slain by a woman <hi>vers. 50. ad fin.</hi> Whence, If
an Usurping Tyrant, acknowledged as King by the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
may be disouned by the Godly, and threatened with
Gods vengeance to consume both him &amp; h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s Complices
that comply with him; and if he may be opposed &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
not only by those that set him up, but also by others
that were in subjection to him, and at length be killed by
them without resentment of the rest of the Nation; Then
must it be duty for a people, who had no hand in the erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of such a Dominator, to defend themselves against
his force: But the former is true by this Example: <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
               <p>5. When Israel fell under the Tyranny of <hi>Ammon,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
them eighteen years, they did by Resisting these
Supreme powers shake off their yoke, under the Conduct
of <hi>Iephthah.</hi> And being challenged sharply by the men of
<hi>Ephraim,</hi> who it seems claimed the Prerogative of making
war, and therefore came to revenge &amp; reduce <hi>Iephthah</hi> &amp;
his Company to order, Casting herein belike a Copy to our
regular <hi>Loyalists,</hi> who are very tenacious of this Plea of the
<hi>Ephraimites,</hi> that at least without the <hi>Primores Regni</hi> no war
is to be made; yet we find <hi>Iephthah</hi> did not much regard
it, but stoutly defended himself, &amp; slew of them 42000
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:41139:321"/>
men known by their <hi>Shibboleth Iudg.</hi> 12. If people then
when questioned for defending themselves, by them that
claim a Superiority over them &amp; should deliver them, may
defend themselves both without them &amp; against them; then
it is a peoples duty &amp; priviledge: But the former is true by
this Example.</p>
               <p>6. They were then made subject to the <hi>Philistims</hi> 40
years, whom the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> acknowledged for their
Rulers: yet <hi>Samson,</hi> that rackle-handed Saint, never ceased
from pelting them upon all Occasions; and when challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it by the men of <hi>Iudah,</hi> saying, <hi>knowest thow not that
the Philistims are Rulers over us? what is that that thow hast done?
Samson</hi> objects nothing against their being Rulers; but
notwithstanding prosecutes his purpose of vindicating
himself, in defence of his Country, <hi>As they did unto me,</hi>
sayes he, <hi>so have I done unto them Iudg.</hi> 15. 11. Hence, If
Saints may avenge themselves upon them whom the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
calls Rulers, and when enabled by God may do to
them as they did to them; then must it be duty for them
to defend themselves against them: But the Antecedent
is true by this Example.</p>
               <p>7. When <hi>Saul,</hi> in the pursuit of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> had
charged the people with a foolish Oath (like unto many of
the ensnaring Oaths that Monarchs use to impose upon
people) not to eat any food until the evening, <hi>Ionathan</hi>
his son tasted but a litle honey and <hi>lo he must die;</hi> Which
<hi>Saul</hi> confirmed with another peremptory Oath, <hi>God do so to
him and more also if he should not die?</hi> Whereupon the people,
as resolute on the other hand to save him, Resisted the
rage of that Ruler, and swore as peremptorly that not
one hair of his head should fall to the ground: So the people
rescued <hi>Ionathan</hi> that he died not 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 44, 45. Hence,
If people may Covenant by Oath to Resist the Commands,
and Rescue a man from a Tyrants Cruelty; then it is
duty to defend themselves against him: The Antecedent
is true here.</p>
               <p>8. Afterwards when the <hi>manner of the King,</hi> presaged by
<hi>Samuel</hi> was verified in <hi>Sauls</hi> degeneration into many abuses
of Government; this priviledge of Resistence was not
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:41139:322"/>
wholly mancipated, but maintained by <hi>Davids</hi> defensive
Appearance with his litle Army He took <hi>Goliahs</hi> sword
not for ornament, or only to fright <hi>Saul,</hi> but to defend
himself with it, and was Captain first to four hundred
men 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 2. had a mind to keep out <hi>

                     </gap>eilah</hi> against
him with 600 men 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 13. and afterwards a great
host came to him to <hi>Ziklag,</hi> while he kept himself closs
because of <hi>Saul</hi> the son of <hi>Kish 1 Chron.</hi> 12. 1. throughout<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where they left <hi>Saul,</hi> and came &amp; helped <hi>David</hi> against
him. This is proved at length by <hi>Lex Rex quest 32. Pag.</hi> 340.</p>
               <p>9. The City <hi>Abel,</hi> whither <hi>Shebah</hi> the Traitor had fled,
did well to Resist <hi>Ioab</hi> the Kings General, coming to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
a whole Citie for a Traitors sake, and not offering
peace to it (according to the Law <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 10.) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
themselves by Gates &amp; Walls, not withstanding he
had a Commission from the King 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. And after the
Capitulating, they are never challenged for Rebellion.</p>
               <p>10. The <hi>ten tribes</hi> revolted from the House of <hi>David,</hi>
when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> claimed an <hi>Absolute power,</hi> and would not
acquiesce to the peoples just conditions 1 <hi>King. 12. 2 Chron.</hi>
10. Which is before justified <hi>Head.</hi> 2. Hence, if it be
Lawful for a part of the people to shake off the King,
refuse subjection to him, &amp; set up a new one, when he but
resolves to play the Tyrant; then it must be duty to resist
his violence, when he is Tyrannizing: But the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
is clear from this Example. This is vindicated at more
length by <hi>Ius Pop. Ch. 3. Pag.</hi> 52.</p>
               <p>11. The Example of <hi>Elisha</hi> the Prophet is considerable
2 <hi>King. 6. 32. Elisha</hi> sat in his house, and the Elders with
him; And the King sent a man before him, but ere the
Messengers came to him, he said to the Elders, <hi>see how the
son of a Murderer hath sent to take away mine head; look when the
Messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door; is
not the sound of his Masters feet behind him?</hi> Here was violent
Resistence resolved against both the man &amp; the Master,
thô the King of the Land for the time. And this calling him
the <hi>son of a Murderer;</hi> and resisting him, is no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
(thô it was an extraordinary mans Act) than it
is for a plaintiff to lybel a true crime against a wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:41139:322"/>
and for an oppressed man to close the door upon a
Murderer, <hi>Lex Rex Quest. 32. Pag.</hi> 346. Hence, if a King
or his Messenger coming to use unjust violence against an
innocent Subject, be no more to be regarded than a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
Emissarie, but may be resisted by that innocent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
Then must a Community of such innocent Subjects
defend themselves against a Tyrant or his Emissaries, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against them on such a wicked errand: The Antecedent
is here clear.</p>
               <p>12. The City <hi>Libnah</hi> revolted from under <hi>Iehorams</hi>
Tyrannie 2 <hi>Chron. 21. 10. P. Martyr</hi> on the place saith,
they revolted because he endeavoured to compell them to
Idolatrie. This is justified above <hi>Head.</hi> 2. Hence, if it
be Lawful for a part of the people to revolt from a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Prince, making defection from the true Religion;
then it is duty to defend themselves against his force: The
Antecedent is here plain.</p>
               <p>13. When <hi>Athaliah</hi> usurped the Monarchy, <hi>Iehojada</hi>
the priest strenghtened himself, and made a Covenant with
the Captains &amp;c. to put her doun, and set up <hi>Ioash 2 King.
11. 2. Chron.</hi> 23. and when she came &amp; cried, <hi>Treason,
Treason,</hi> they regarded it not, but commanded to kill her
and all that help her. Whence, if those that are not Kings
may Lawfully kill an Usurpress, and all her helpers, then
may a people resist them: But <hi>Iehojada</hi> though no Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
did it.</p>
               <p>14. The repressing &amp; punishing <hi>Amaziah</hi> the son of <hi>Ioash</hi>
is an undenyable Instance, vindicated by <hi>Mr Knox;</hi> see
above <hi>Per. 3. Pag.</hi> 38. After the time that he turned away
from following the Lord, the people made a Conspiracy
against him in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and he fled to <hi>Lachish,</hi> but they
sent &amp; slew him there 2 <hi>King. 14. 19. 2 Chron,</hi> 25. 27.
Hence, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> If people may conspire &amp; concur in
executing Judgment upon their King turning Idolater
&amp; Tyrant, then much more must they defend themselves
against his violence.</p>
               <p>15. The same power of peoples Resisting Princes, was
exemplified in <hi>Uzziah</hi> or <hi>Azariah,</hi> when he would needs
be supreme in things Sacred as well as Civil 2 <hi>King. 15.
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:41139:323"/>
2 Chron.</hi> 26. fourscore priests, that were valiant men,
withstood him, and thrust him out of the Temple, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbarunt
eum,</hi> saith <hi>Vatablus, expulerunt eum</hi> saith <hi>Ar. Mont.
vid. Pool Synopss. in Loc.</hi> See this vindicated by <hi>Mr Knox.
Per. 3. Pag.</hi> 33. above. Hence, If private Subjects may by
force resist and hinder the King from transgressing the
Law, then must they resist him when forcing them to
transgress the Law of God.</p>
               <p>16. After the Return from the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity when
the <hi>Iewes</hi> were setting about the Work of building the
<hi>Temple,</hi> which they would do by themselves, and not
admit of any Association with Malignants (upon their
sinister misinformation, &amp; Sycophantick Accusation, that
they were building the rebellious &amp; bad City, and would
refuse to pay the King toll, tribute, &amp; custome) they were
straitlie discharged by <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to proceed in their Work,
and the inhibition was execute by force &amp; power <hi>Ezrah.</hi> 4.
But by the encouragement of the Prophets, <hi>Haggai</hi> &amp;
<hi>Zechariah,</hi> countermanding the Kings decree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would
not be hindered, the eye of their God being upon them,
thô <hi>Tatnai</hi> the Governour of those parts, <hi>Shetharboznai,</hi>
and their Companions, would have boasted them from it,
with the Usual Arguments of Malignants, <hi>who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
yow to do</hi> so &amp; so? <hi>Ezrah.</hi> 5. 3-5. And yet this
was before the decree of <hi>Darius</hi> was obtained in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
<hi>Ezrah.</hi> 6. Hence, if people may prosecute a duty
without &amp; against a Kings command, and before an
allowance by Law can be obtained; Then may a people
resist their Commands and force Used to execute them:
But here the Antecedent is manifest.</p>
               <p>17. When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and invited the
<hi>Iewes</hi> to build up the Walls of the City, they strengthened
their hands for that good work against very much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
And when challenged by <hi>San<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>what is this that ye do? will ye rebeli against the King?</hi> say they.
He would not plead Authority, thô in the general he had
the Kings warrant for it: Yet he would not give them any
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:41139:323"/>
other satisfaction, than to intimate, whether they had that
or not, having the Call of God to the Work, they would
go on in the duty, and God would prosper them against
their opposition, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2. 19, 20. And accordingly, not
withstanding of all Scoffs &amp; Plots &amp; Conspiracies to hinder
the building, yet they went on, and were encouraged to
remember the Lord, &amp; fight for their Brethren &amp;c. and
to build with weapons in their hands, <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h.</hi> 4. and brought
it to an end, notwithstanding of all their Practices to fright
them from it, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. Hence, If neither Challenges of
Rebellion, nor Practices of Malignant Enemies who
pretend Authority, nor any discouragements whatsoever,
should deter people from a duty which they have a Call &amp;
Capacity from God to prosecute, and if they may promove
it against all opposition by defensive armes; Then, when
a people are oppressed &amp; treated as Rebells, for a necessary
duty, they may &amp; must defend themselves, and maintain
their duty, notwithstanding of all Pretences of Authority
against them.</p>
               <p>18. I shall adde one Instance more, which is vindicated
by <hi>jus populi,</hi> from the Historie of <hi>Esther.</hi> Because <hi>Mordecai</hi>
refused to do homage to a Hangman (<hi>Haman</hi> I should say)
a cruel Edict was procured from <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> to destroy all
the <hi>Jewes,</hi> written &amp; sealled with the Kings ring, according
to the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> &amp; <hi>Persians,</hi> becoming a Law ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable
&amp; irreversible <hi>Esther.</hi> 3. 12, 13. Yet the Lords
Providence, always propitious to His People, brought it
about so, that <hi>Haman</hi> being hanged, &amp; <hi>Mordecai</hi> advanced,
the <hi>Jewes</hi> were Called &amp; Capacitated, as well as Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
to resist that armed Authority that decreed to Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre
them, and that by the Kings oun Allowance, <hi>Esther.</hi> 9.
When his former decree drew near to be put in execution,
in the day that the Enemies of the <hi>Jewes</hi> hoped to have
power over them, it was turned to the Contrary that no
man could withstand them. Here they had the allowance
of Authority to resist Authority: And this was not a Gift
of a new right by that Grant, which they had not before;
only it was corroborative of their radical right to defend
themselves, which is not the Donative of Princes, And
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:41139:324"/>
which they had power to exerce &amp; use without this, thô
may be not the same Capacity: for the Kings warrand could
not make it Lawful in point of Conscience, if it had not
been so before. Hence, If people may have the Allowance
of well advised Authority, to resist the decree &amp; force of
unlawful Authority; then may a people maintain right Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
in defending themselves against the injuries of
pretended Authority: But by this Instance we see, the
<hi>Jewes</hi> had <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> his Allowance to resist the decree &amp;
force of his oun ill-advised Authority, thô irreversible.
And hence we see, that Distinction, in this Point, is not
groundless, between resisting the Authority of Supreme
powers, and the abuses of the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secundly,</hi> We have in the Scripture both tacite &amp; express
<hi>Reproofs,</hi> for lying by from this duty in the season thereof.</p>

oun silliness: Hence I argue, If the Holy Ghost expro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
a people for their stupid subjection to prevailing Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
when they do not improve their Ability, Capacity,
&amp; Right to maintain &amp; defend their Liberties &amp; Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges;
Then this implies a Commanded duty to defend
them, according to their Capacity, from all unjust inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
But the former is true here: Therefore also the
later.</p>

2. <hi>In Deborahs</hi> Song after their victorious Resistence,
the people are severely upbraided for not concurring in that
Expedition <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. 16, 17, 23. and <hi>Meroz</hi> is particularly
cursed for not coming <hi>to the help of the Lord, to the help of the
Lord against the Mighty.</hi> This is Recorded as a resting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
against all that will withdraw their helping hand
from the Lords people, when necessitate to appear in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
Armes for the preservation of their lives &amp; Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
On the other hand, <hi>Zebulon</hi> &amp; <hi>Naphtali</hi> are commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for jeoparding their lives in the high places of the fields,
and are approved in that practice of fighting against the
Kings of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that then ruled over them <hi>vers.</hi> 18, 19.
Hence, if people be Reproved &amp; Cursed for staying at home
to look to their oun Interests, when others jeopard their
lives for their Countries defence &amp; freedom from Tyrannie
&amp; Oppression; Then this implies its a duty to concur in so
venturing: But here, <hi>Rubeen, Dan, Asher,</hi> &amp; <hi>Meroz,</hi> are
Reproved &amp; Cursed for staying at home, when <hi>Zebulon</hi> &amp;
<hi>Naphtali</hi> jeoparded their lives &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we have in the Scriptures many <hi>promises</hi> of the
Lords approving &amp; countenancing the duty of Defensive
Armes even against their Oppressing Rulers.</p>
               <p>1. In that forecited Testament of the Patriarch <hi>Iacob,</hi> in
that part of it which concerns <hi>Gad,</hi> he Prophecies that
Tribe should have a lot in the world answering his name,
and be engaged in many Conflicts with Oppressing Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,
who at first should prevail over him, but at length
God should so bless his endeavours to free himself from
their oppressions, that he should overcome. There is an
excellent Elegancy in the Original, answering to the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology
of the name <hi>Gad</hi> which signifies a <hi>Troop,</hi> reading
thus in the Hebrew, <hi>Gad a Troop shall overtroup him, but he
shall ouertroup them at the last Gen.</hi> 49. 19. And <hi>Moses</hi> homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logating
the same Testimony, in his blessing the Tribes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death, shewes that he should make a very forcible
&amp; successful Resistence, and should execute the Justice of
the Lord over his Oppressors <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 20. 21. Wherein
is implied a promise of Resistence to be made against Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
Conquerours, who should acquire the supreme
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:41139:325"/>
rule over them for a time: And the success of that Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for overcoming, necessarly supposes Resistence.
Hence, where there is a promise of success at last to a
peoples Conflicts against prevailing Tyrannie, there is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
an Approbation of the duty, and also a promise of its
performance wrapped up in that promise: But here is a
promise &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
               <p>2. In that Threatening against Tyrants, shewing how
they shall be <hi>thrust away</hi> &amp; burnt up with fire, there is couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a promise, and also an implyed Precept of Resisting
them 2 <hi>Sam 23. 6. The Sons of Belial shall be all of them as
thorns thrust away—with hands fenced with iron</hi> &amp;c. which
clearly implies Resistence, and more than that. Rejection
&amp; Repression. Hence, If it be threatened as a Curse against
Rulers of <hi>Belial.</hi> and promised as a Blessing, that they shall
be so roughly handled; then this implies a duty to resist
them, who cannot be otherwayes taken: But here this is
threatened &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. When the Lord shall have mercy on <hi>Iacob</hi> &amp; choose
<hi>Israel,</hi> It is promised <hi>Isai.</hi> 14. 2, 3. that <hi>they shall take them
Captives whose Captives they were, And they shall rule over their
Oppressors</hi>—This necessarly implies &amp; infers a Promise of
Resistence against these Oppressing Rulers, in the time off
their Domineering, as well as revenge after their yoke
should be broken; And some thing of mens action as wel
as Gods Judgement in breaking that yoke: for they could
not take them Captives, nor Rule over them, except first
they had resisted them whose Captives they were: There
is Resisting of the Supreme Power, subjection whereunto
was the bondage wherein they were made to serve. Hence;
If it be promised, that a Captivated &amp; subjugated people
shall break the yoke &amp; free themselves of the bondage of
them that had them in subjection; then it is promised in
that case, they must resist the Supreme Powers; for such
were they whose Captives they were: The Antecedent is
here express.</p>
               <p>4. There are promises that the Lords people, when
those that rule over them are incensed against the Holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and when many of their Brethren that should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:41139:325"/>
with them shall be frighted from their duty by fear, o<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
corrupted with flatterie, shall be made <hi>strong to do exploits,</hi>
thô in such Enterprizes they may want success for some
time, and <hi>fall by the sword &amp; flame and by captivity &amp; spoyl
many dayes Dan.</hi> 11. 30-34. Which is very near Paralel,
to the case of the Covenanted people of <hi>Scotland</hi> their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in Defensive exploits against their Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rulers these many years bygone. This was very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
fulfilled, in the Historie of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> before r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed.
Hence, If it be promised that a people shall be
strong to do exploits, in Resisting the Armes of their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
opposing their Covenant, and overturning their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
&amp; Liberties; Then it must be approven that such a
Resistence is Lawful, even thô it want success: But this
is here promised. To the same purpose it is promised,
that after the Lords people have been long kept as Prisoners
under the bondage of Oppressing Rulers, they shall by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
Resistence be saved from their Tyrannie <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.
13-17. <hi>when the Lord shall bend Iudah for him and raise up
Zions Sons against the Sons of Greece</hi>—So it was in their
Resistences &amp; victories, against the Successors of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
who had the rule over them for a time. And so it
may be again, when the Lord shall so bend His people for
Him. Hence, If the Lord promises to fit &amp; Spirit His
people for Action against their Oppressing Rulers, and to
Crown their Atchievements when so fited &amp; Spirited with
Glorious success; Then it is their duty, and also their
honour, to Resist them: But here that is plainly promised.</p>
               <p>5. There are promises of the Lords making use of His
people, and strengthening them to break in pieces the
power of His &amp; their Enemies, and His defending &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
them against all their power &amp; projects, when they
think most to prevail over them. As is promised, in the
threatened <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Usurpation <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.
20-24—<hi>Thow art</hi> (sayes He to <hi>Israel,</hi> of whom He
speaks as the rod of His Inheritance in the preceeding verse)
<hi>my battle ax &amp; weapons of war, and with thee will I break in pieces</hi>
&amp;c. Whensoever this hath been or shall be accomplished
(as it may relate to the vengeance to be execute upon the
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:41139:326"/>
New Testament <hi>Babylon</hi>) it clearly implies their breaking
in pieces Powers that were Supreme over them. Hence,
If the Lord will make use of His peoples vindictive Armes
against <hi>Babylon</hi> ruling over them, then He will Justifie their
Defensive Armes against <hi>Babylon</hi> Oppressing them: Here it
is promised &amp;c. So <hi>Mic.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11. <hi>to the end,</hi> Many Nations
shall be gathered to defile &amp; look upon <hi>Zion,</hi> and then the
Lord shall give Allowance &amp; Commission to His people
<hi>to arise &amp; thresh</hi> &amp;c. What time the accomplishment of
this is referred to, is not my concern to inquire: It seems
to look to the New Testament times, wherein the Lords
people shall be first in great straits, and then enlarged: But
to restrict it to the Spiritual Conquest over the Nations by
the Ministrie of the Word (thô I will not deny but that
may be included) seems too great a straitening of the Scope,
and not so apposite to the Expressions, which certainly
seem to import some forcible action of men, and more than
the Peaceable Propagation of the Gospel. It is usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the latter dayes of that Dispensation, when both
the <hi>Iewish</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentile Zion</hi> shall be totally &amp; finally delivered
from <hi>Babylon</hi> or Antichristian Tyrannie, before or about
which Period, the Enemies of Christ and of His people
shall attempt their <hi>Ultimus Conatus</hi> to destroy the Church
groaning under their bondage; but when they are all well
mustered in a General Randezvous, the Lords people
shall have a gallant game at the chase. But whensoever
the time be of fulfilling the promise, it ensures to the people
of God the success of their Defensive Armes against them,
that pretended a Domination over them. And it looks to
a time, when they should have no Rulers of their oun, but
them under whose subjection they had been long groaning,
and now brought to a very low pass: yet here they should
not only resist but thresh them. Hence, If in the latter
dayes the people of God are to be honoured, and acted forth
with such a Spirit &amp; Capacity to thresh &amp; beat doun these
powers under which they have been long groaning; Then
when the Lord puts them in such Capacity to attempt it,
they should be ambitious of such a honour: But here it is
promised &amp;c. The same may be inferred from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:41139:326"/>
vision <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 19, 20. He sees <hi>four Carpenters</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
the <hi>four hornes:</hi> the hornes scattered <hi>Iudah,</hi> so that
no man did lift up his head; but the <hi>Carpenters</hi> came to fray
them, to cast out the hornes of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which lifted
up their horn over the Land of <hi>Iudah.</hi> These <hi>hornes</hi> had
the Supreme power over <hi>Iudah</hi> for a time, while they were
in no Capacity to resist them; But as soon as the Lord fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
them with Capacity &amp; Instruments impowered to
resist them, they do it effectually. The <hi>Carpenters</hi> are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the Lords people themselves; for here they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the Gentiles, which all were except the Lords
people. Hence, If the Lord promises, when reconciled
to His people, to furnish them with Instruments to fray &amp;
scatter the power of Tyrants, who have long born doun
their head; Then when they are so furnished, they may
resist them: But the Lord here promises that &amp;c. This is
more plainly promised also <hi>Zech.</hi> 10. 5. &amp;c. <hi>Then they shall be
as mighty men which shall tread doun their Enemies—And
the pride of Assyria shall be brought doun</hi>—Hence, If the
Lord, when He shall have Mercy on His people, will
bless their Resistence so, as to bring doun the pride &amp; Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them that had the Supreme power over them; Then,
in hope of such a blessing, they may attempt such a duty,
when the Call is clear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> we have also <hi>Precepts,</hi> from whence we may
consequentially conclude the Approven duty of Defensive
Armes against Oppressing Rulers.</p>
               <p>1. The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> are Commanded to <hi>vexe the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites
&amp; sinite them,</hi> for saith the Lord, <hi>they vexe yow with
their Wyles Numb.</hi> 25. 17, 18. And to <hi>avenge themselves Numb.</hi>
31. 2. Which did not only oblige the people, when they
had <hi>Moses</hi> for their Magistrate to lead them forth; but in
the dayes of <hi>Gideon,</hi> when they were under their rule whom
they were to avenge themselves upon. Hence, If people
must vexe their Enemies, &amp; avenge themselves of them,
by a war offensive, when ensnared by their Craftiness;
much more may they resist them by a war Defensive, when
invaded by their Cruelty. 2. There is a Command to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ish
every City or party, making Apostasie into Idolatry
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:41139:327"/>
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 12-15. Upon this Moral Ground was <hi>Israels</hi>
war against <hi>Benjamin Iudg.</hi> 20. And their bringing <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi>
into Condign punishment, which is vindicated by <hi>Mr
Knox.</hi> See above <hi>Per. 3. pag.</hi> 41, 42. Hence, If people
are to bring to condign punishment Idolatrous Apostates
seeking to Intyce them; Then much more ought they
to resist such Tyrants seeking to Inforce them to such A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie.</p>
               <p>3. There is a precept, not only to defend, but also to
rescue &amp; deliver our Brethren when in hazard <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 11,
12. We must not <hi>for bear to deliver them</hi> when drawen to
death: which will at least infer the duty of assisting them
when forced to defend themselves; for, If it be a duty to
to rescue them from any prevailing power that would take
their lives unjustly, much more is it duty to defend them
and our selves both against their Murdering violence: But
it is duty to rescue them &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. All that would learn to do well, are commanded
<hi>Isai.</hi> 1. 17. to <hi>relieve the Oppressed:</hi> which is not spoken to
Magistrates only, many of whom were the Oppressors,
the <hi>Princes were rebellious &amp; Companions of thieves vers.</hi> 23. So
also <hi>Isai.</hi> 58. 6. It is required of a people that would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of God in their humiliations, to <hi>let the Oppressed go
free,</hi> and to <hi>break every yoke.</hi> Hence, If it be duty to relieve
the Oppressed by breaking the yoke of them that Oppress
them; Then it is duty to defend them and our selves both
against them that would oppress us more: But the former
is here commanded: Therefore &amp;c,</p>
               <p>5. There is a Command for a spoyled Oppressed people,
when the Lord is reconciled to them and Sympathises with
them, to deliver themselves from their Rulers servitude
<hi>Zech. 2. 7. Deliver thy self O Zion which dwellest with the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Babylon.</hi> Which comprehends all the ordinary Active
means of peoples delivering themselves, from oppressing
powers that rule over them: And consequently Defensive
Resistence; for it cannot only be restricted to <hi>flight</hi> included
(<hi>vers.</hi> 6.) the promise annexed (<hi>vers.</hi> 9.) imports more,
when they that spoyled them shall be a spoyl to their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
Whereby it is insinuated, they were so to deliver
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:41139:327"/>
themselves, as not only to free themselves from
their servitude, but to bring their Masters under subjection.
Hence, If the Lords people, being subject to Tyrants rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over them for the time, may deliver themselves from
their Oppressing Masters, then may they resist them &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves: The Antecedent is express here in the
Command.</p>
               <p>6. There is a Command given by Christ to His Disciples,
to provide themselves with Defensive weapens, necessary
for their Defence against them that would pursue after their
lives; as well as with other things necessary for their suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 36—<hi>Now he that hath a purse let him take it
and likewise his scrip, and he that hath no sword let him sell his
garment &amp; buy one.</hi> Before, when he had sent them out
upon an extraordinary Commission, as it were to serve
their Apprentship in the Work of the Gospel, He did not
allow them such sollicitous care to provide themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
He would give them a proof of His sufficiency to
sustain &amp; protect them, without the ordinary means of
their oun Diligence. But now, when He was about to
withdraw His bodily presence from them, and would
warn them of the Discouragements they were to expect in
the Prosecution of their more continued Work, which
they had a Commission for not to be retracted, He would
not have them to expect Provision &amp; Protection by a
Course of Miracles, but to provide themselves with means
for their sustenance, and also for their Defence against the
violence of men; which chiefly was to be expected from
their Rulers, who would persecute them under the notion
of Transgressors of the Laws of their Kingdoms &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
He was not indeed to make much use of them, at
that time, for Himself; Who was then to finish the Work
of Redemption by Suffering: Only, that what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
might be accomplished in Him, He would make so
much use of them, as voluntarely to be involved under the
censure &amp; reproach of Rebellion, being taken among men
in Armes, that He might be reckoned among Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
<hi>vers.</hi> 37. Therefore when they told him, they had
<hi>two swords,</hi> He said, <hi>It is enough vers.</hi> 38. I need not stand
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:41139:328"/>
upon that Impertinency of a Conceit, that these were <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
swords:</hi> Which deserves no Confutation, being fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be put among <hi>Quakers</hi> delirious distractions, than to
be numbered among the notions of men of understanding:
for then the <hi>Purse</hi> and the <hi>Scrip</hi> must be Spiritual too; And
these Spritual things must be bought by <hi>sellings of Garments;</hi>
And yet they would be such Spiritual tools, as would have
a sharp edge for cutting off of Carnal <hi>ears,</hi> and such as would
be both visible &amp; sensible; And two of them would be
enough. They were then ordinary Material swords, which
the Lord Commands His Followers to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with, for their defence as Men, in cases of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and, when they should be in a Capacity, to improve
them against their Murdering Persecuters, against whom
He gives His Royal Grant of Resistence; that the world
may know, His Subjects, thô they have more Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
Spiritual, yet they have no less humane Priviledges
than other men: Albeit at that Period of His determined
Suffering, He would not allow the present use of them.
Hence, If the Lords people should provide themselves
with Armes of defence, thô they should be reputed Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors
for so doing; Then may they use these Armes of
Defence, against them that Persecute them under that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But the Antecedent is clear: Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We may infer the same Truth from some of the
<hi>Prayers</hi> of the Saints, wherein they glory in the confident
expectation of the Lords strengthening them, &amp; favouring
&amp; approving their helpers, &amp; in the experience of the Lord
Assisting them, while in the mean time constitute in a
formed Appearance of Resistence. I shall only hint these.</p>
               <p>1. In that prayer <hi>Psal.</hi> 44. 5. They glory in hope that
through the Lord they will <hi>push doun their enemies</hi> &amp;c. yet
now they were under the power of Tyrannizing Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
which they were Resisting: for <hi>vers.</hi> 9. they complain
they were <hi>put to shame,</hi> because the Lord went not forth
with their Armies, &amp; they which hated them spoyled them—And
for His Sake were killed all day long: Hence they
plead, that the Lord would awake—and not forget their
affliction &amp; oppression. Whereby it is evident, they were
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:41139:328"/>
under the yoke of Tyrannizing powers, and Resisting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their might. Which, by whomsoever or upon
what occasion soever the Psalm was compiled, shewes,
that no want of Success in Resisting Tyrants, can mar the
Saints faith in pleading for the Lords Assistence &amp; Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the Duty. Hence, they that in faith may pray
for &amp; boast of their treading doun their Tyrannizing powers.
that rise up against them, may also in faith attempt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of them in their oun defence: But here the Lords
people did the former.</p>
               <p>2. We find <hi>David</hi> under <hi>Sauls</hi> persecution, while he
had a party of 600. men to defend himself against his rage,
in the Psalmes which he composed upon that occasion, not
only complaining of Oppressors, but encouraging himself
in the faith that God would be with them that assisted him,
in his essay of defending himself, and imprecating destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Saul</hi> &amp; his Complices; that the Lord would <hi>cut them
off in His Truth,</hi> and let him see his desire upon them <hi>Psal.
54. 4, 5. ult.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 57. 4. And <hi>Psal, 57. throughout,</hi>
And <hi>Psal.</hi> 140. 7, 9. He imprecates against the <hi>head of them
that compassed him about,</hi> and consequently against <hi>Saul.</hi>
Whence I argue. 1. If the Lords people, conflicting with
&amp; encompassed with Oppressing Rulers as so many <hi>Lyons</hi>
&amp; <hi>Dogs,</hi> may pray &amp; praise for the help of those that assist
them, in their endeavours of Self-preservation from them;
then may they make use of their help for their Defence,
for which they pray &amp; praise: But here we see the Lords
people did the former: Therefore they may do the latter.
2. If we may pray against Kings, and for preservation
from them; Then may we Defend our selves against them,
and endeavour the means of that preservation for which we
pray. The Connexion is before cleared: yet here I adde;
That which will give a Dispensation from our duty of
praying for them, will also dispense from the duty of being
passively subject to their will; And consequently will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
defending our selves from their violence: But here we
see Tyrannie &amp; Treacherie, and designed Mischief will
give a Dispensation from our duty of praying for them, thô
that be duty as indispensable as subjection. Again, if any
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:41139:329"/>
thing demur us from Resisting of Princes, it must be respect
to their Majestie, and the Character of the Lords anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon them: But we see, no respect to that will demur
a Believer from praying in faith against them: Therefore
no such respect will hinder, but that he may defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
against his violence. And indeed, if we consider it
right, if the impression of any Majestie God hath put upon
Princes should bind up our hands from any Resistence, it
will restrain from prayer-resistence: for, if that impression
have any force at any time, it must be when a man is most
solemnly stated before God, and speaking to God as a
Christian, rather than when he is acting as a man with a
man like himself: And as prayer-resistence is the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
&amp; forcible Resistence than any other (as this <hi>Saul,</hi>
and many other Kings, have found by their woful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience)
so it is more restricted than other Resistence; for,
we may defend our selves against many whom we must not
pray against, to wit, our private enemies, for whom we
are commanded to pray; yet no body will deny but we
may resist their violence: And likewise, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to pray for Kings, when invested with Gods Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
But when their degeneration looses us from that
obligation to pray for them, and allowes us to pray against
them when they turn Enemies to God (as we see in the
prayers of the Psalmist) Then also we may more warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
resist them by Defensive Armes.</p>
               <p>3. Among the <hi>Halle-luyahs,</hi> in the end of Psalmes, there

glory in the rest &amp; security the Lord will vouchafe upon
them, they are Prophetically &amp; very Pathetically excited to
praise prayer-wise <hi>Psal. 149. 6. to the end. Let the high praises
of God be in their mouth, and a two edged sword in their hand—
to bind their Kings with chains—to execute upon them the

the attainment of the Saints, in their Triumphant victories
over many of their Oppressors round about them. But it
looks to a further &amp; more famous execution of vengeance
upon the Tyrants of the earth, when they shall have long
kept under the Church of God, &amp; at length the Lord shall
give His people a Capacity to break their yoke: which,
when ever it shall be, shall be their honour. Hence, If it be
the honour of the Saints, when the Lord puts them in Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
to execute vengeance upon their Enemies, thô they be
Kings that Oppress them; Then it may be their ambition
to seek it, at least they may resist them. Thus from several
Scripture Practices, Reproofs, Promises, Precepts, &amp;
prayers, this Truth may be proven: from which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

Which, whensover there is a Concurrence &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification
of both together, makes it very incident,
and no wayes to be admired, that either some Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Oppressed be Censurable; Or that there be
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:41139:330"/>
found many to Censure them, either out of ignorance, or
prejudice, at a far off glance, which a nearer &amp; narrower
inspection of circumstances, through a Prospect of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
would not so readily condemn. When the Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Tyrants comes to such a hight &amp; pinch of Extremity,
that it not only threatens a Community with desolation,
but induces a necessity of unavoidable dissolution, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a people to such a paroxisme of Desperation &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
(in respect of humane deliberation bringing
them to their <hi>wits end</hi>) that either they must succumb as
slaves, and mancipate consciences, persons, Liberties,
properties, and all they are or have, to the lust of raging
Tyrants and their revening Emissaries; or surrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and their posterity, and which is dearer the Interest
of Religion, to be destroyed: Then it is no wonder, that
they be sometimes necessitated in such an extremity; <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremis
malis extrema adhibere remedia,</hi> and forced to fall upon
such expedients to prevent their utter extermination, as at
other times common Order, and ordinary Justice would
make extravagant. Yea it is no marvel, thô they fall into
several real Extravagances, which are not to be justified
nor extenuated; but rather it is to be acknowledged, as a
Miracle of the Lords Mercy, that in such a case they are
restrained from more scandalous Excesses of that nature.
Yet even then, such as live at ease, free of oppression,
who are blinded with prejudice at the Oppressed, and
bribed with the Indulgence &amp; Lenity of the Oppressours
towards themselves, will look upon these Actions as
transports of madness, and effects of extravagant zeal,
while they weigh them only in the scales of Ordinary Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
and do not ponderate them in the ballance of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
Virtue; nor perpend the circums<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ances which
made those extraordinary Acts of Judgement, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
are Lawful at all times to be executed by some, to
be then necessary Acts of Justice to be inflicted by them in
such a case. But if either the Oppressours themselves; Or
such who are blinded &amp; bribed with their gifts and killed
with their kindness, not only into an omission of concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
but into a condemning of such extraordinary At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:41139:330"/>
of taking off those Destroyers; Or if On-lookers at
a Distance, would seriously consider, and ingenuously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their opinion in a particular application of the case to
themselves, what they would do in such circumstances:
I doubt not, but as Charity should oblige them to be spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Censures, in a case whereof they have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
So Justice, in resolving this point for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
would constrain them to justify such extraordinary
necessitated Practices for self preservation, in preventing
perishing by destroying their Destroyers, and move them
rather to admire their Patience, who have suffered so much
and so long those beasts of prey to devour them, than to
censure their precipitancies, in being constrained to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to deliver themselves at last from, and put an end to
their Cruelty who did most annoy them. Yea (as <hi>Naphta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi>
sayes very well) <q>It were impossible that rational men,
after the feeling of so sore grievances, and the teaching of
so many &amp; sad experiences, should still couch under the
burden, and submit themselves to the yoke of such vile
Apostate Upstarts and bloody Villains, and not rather
acquit themselves like men, by pulling off these vizards,
under which they mask their Villanies and clock their
violence; and plucking them out of that Sanctuary of
Loyaltie, and Refuge of Authority, which they do not
more pretend than profane by all their horrid Rebellion
against God, and cruel Murders executed upon the Lords
people, to the effect that in the righteous &amp; deserved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment

and signally severe; and ouned of the Lord to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration

accession to the cutting of that Arch-Traitor <hi>Sharp,</hi> Prelat
of <hi>St Andrewes;</hi> And others for not condemning that
and the like Acts of Justice, thô they were as innocent of
the facts as the Child unborn. The foregoing Historical
Representation of the matters of fact, doth clear the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the Actions: which, if ever any of that nature
performed by private men without publick Authority,
could be justified, will at least demur the condemning of
them. For, the men, or rather monsters, thus remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
had not only <hi>been</hi> perjured Apostates from, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
Enemies against God, in a Conspiracy with the
Devil to destroy the Reformation and the Remnant that
professed it, affronted Blasphemers, perfidious Betrayers
of the Country, and Enemies to the Commonweath,
Malignant Incendiaries, and habitual Murderers of many
of the Lords people, who for many notorious Crimes had
forfeited their lives to Justice; But <hi>were</hi> insolently <hi>prosecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
their Murdering designs, informing the Council, and
<hi>instigating</hi> them against innocent people to destroy them
utterly, <hi>procuring</hi> from them bloody Orders to spare none
but cut off all who might fall into their hands, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
&amp; vigilantly with all violence <hi>pursuing</hi> their Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mandats, both in their oun persons, and by villains
whom they hounded out as <hi>Intelligencers</hi> to get &amp; to give
notice where any of those people might be detected, whom
they vowed (and avowed a design) to destroy, when in the
heat &amp; hight of their rage they were cut off. The Actors
were no wayes <hi>subject</hi> to them, nor any other way related
than declared &amp; Independent <hi>Enemies</hi> are to one another,
having renounced all relation to them and their Masters as
Magistrats or their superiours; and were in no terms of
<hi>peace</hi> with them, but maintaning an hostile opposition, and
carrying without cessation, <hi>armes</hi> to resist them; and when
they got that advantage over them, that these Enemies
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:41139:331"/>
were seeking against them, they declared solemnly to
them, and dyed declaring it to the world, that they were
not moved out of <hi>private revenge</hi> for personal injuries they
had done against themselves, but being touched with the
zeal of God, love to their Country, respect to Justice
trampled upon by Tyrants, and for saving themselves,
rescuing their Brethren, and preventing their Murthering
them, because there were none that would or could
execute Justice upon them legally, therefore they were
forced to put forth their hands against them as enemies,
with whose preservation their oun could not consist.
Their Circumstances were such, that they were redacted
to the greatest of Extremities, precluding all other humane
possibility of preserving themselves and their Brethren
from the destruction intended, and declaredly resolved,
and restlessly sought &amp; prosecuted, by these Murderers:
being persecuted to the death by them, daylie chased,
hunted, way-laid, turned out of their oun habitations,
intercommuned, discharged &amp; denyed all harbour in any
house, under the hazard of the same pains that themselves
were lyable to, which was <hi>death</hi> by the present Law, and
so forced to hide in Caves &amp; Dens; out of which they durst
not come forth, if it were but to seek bread for themselves,
without eminent danger of their lives; the Country raising
the <hi>hue &amp; cry</hi> after them, whensoever they were seen,
whereby many were killed as soon as they were apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Hence they could neither escape in the Land, nor by
flight out of the Land, all passages by sea &amp; Land being
stopt, and none suffered to go any where, without strict
examination what they were, which was impossible for
them to elude: And many other specialities of miserie &amp;
danger were ingredients in their Circumstances, that no
words can represent to them that are altogether strangers
to them. Wherefore in such a strait &amp; pinch of Perplexity,
when they could not otherwise escape the fury of these
firebrands, nor demur &amp; deter the rest of them from an
uncontrolled pursuit after the lives of Innocents, nor
otherwise avert the wrath of God against the Land for the
impunity of such vermine; And seeing there was no access
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:41139:332"/>
to address themselves to Magistrats, who by Office are
obliged to bring such villains to condign punishment, And
none were found in publick Authority but such as patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
&amp; Authorized them, whom in Conscience they
could not acknowledge, and in prudence durst not make
application to them for fear of their lives; What could they
do? what was left them to deliberate, but to fall upon this
Extraordinary Course; wherein if they have stumbled into
some extravagancies, as to the manner, who can think it
strange, considering the Case? But as that is not the debate;
so as for such Acts of vengeance as are peccant in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and were not circumstantiate as above rehearsed,
being disouned in their publick <hi>Declarations,</hi> and the Actors
excluded from their Communion for whom I plead; it
were iniquous to impute the scandal of them to that Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
people. It is only the so Circumstantiate, necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
extraordinary execution of Judgement, upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
gross &amp; grassant Incendiaries, Tyrants, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Murdering Enemies, when there is no living for
them, that I vindicate. And thô the handling of this
tender &amp; quick-sented subject may seem odious to some,
and my Discourse upon it as pregnant with an oblique
design; to obivate such unmerited surmises, I must say,
it is only the wiping off of such Reproaches as reflect on
Religion, the vindication of preterite extraordinary practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this nature, the investigation of present duty with
respect to future Emergencies, and the restraining all
Extravagancies incident in this Head, that I intend.
However this may be exploded by this generation as
odious &amp; un-couth Doctrine, yet in former Periods of this
Church it hath been maintained with Courage, &amp; asserted
with Confidence. How the Ancient <hi>Scots,</hi> even after they
received the Christian faith, served their Tyrants and
Oppressours, how in the begining of the Reformation the
killing of the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and of <hi>David Rizio,</hi> were and are
generally to this day justifed, and what was the Judgement
&amp; pleading of our Reformers for practising this principle
against Idolaters &amp;c. needs not be here repeated: <hi>Mr
Knox's</hi> Judgement in particular is before declared, and
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:41139:332"/>
will be further discovered, if we consider how he resented
his slackness, in puting people to execute Judgement in
these words, insert in <hi>Second Part of the Cloud of Witnesses
Pag.</hi> 60. <q>For God (said he) had not only given me know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and a tougne to make known the impiety of the
Idol, but had given me Credit with many, who would
have put in execution Gods Judgements, if I would only
have consented thereto: but so careful was I of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Tranquility, and loath was I to offend some, that
in secret conference with zealous men, I travelled rather
to slacken that fervency God had kindled in them, than
to animate &amp; encourage them to put their hands to Gods
Work; wherein I acknowledge my self to have done
most wickedly, and from the bottom of my heart I do
ask God pardon, that I did not what in me lay to have
suppressed that Idol in the begining.</q> But the preceeding
Historical Representation doth abundantly demonstrate
this is no Noveltie, to assert, That when the ruine of the
Countrie, suppression of Religion, destruction of the
Remnant professing &amp; suffering for it, and the Wrath of
God is threatened in &amp; for the impunity of Idolaters &amp;
Murderers, that by the Law of God &amp; Man should die the
death, and supposing alwayes such as are in publick Office
not only decline their duty, but encourage those destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
yea Authorize them themselves; we may not only
maintain defensive Resistence according to our Capacity,
but endeavour also vindictive &amp; Punitive force in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Judgment upon them in cases of necessity, as before
Circumstantiate. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> am the more confident to assert it,
that what I say cannot be condemned, till first what our
Reformers have proven be confuted. However to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make it some what clear, I shall first premit some
Assertions, to clear the State of the Question: And then
give some Reasons for it when clearly Stated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It will be needful for clearing our way, to shew
what length we may warrantably go in this matter of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
Judgment, in our private Capacity, in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Cases of necessity, by setting doun some propositions
negative &amp; positive: Signifying what we disoune, and what
we oune in this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="640" facs="tcp:41139:333"/>
I. What we disoune, may appear in these Assertions.</p>
               <p>1. No necessity not Circumstance supposible what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
can justify the Murder of the <hi>Righteous</hi> or <hi>Innocent,</hi>
or vindicate the unlawful taking away of their life directly
or indirectly, immediately or mediately, which in thought
as well as deed we must abhor, as a horrid breach of the
<hi>Sixth Command.</hi> The Guilt whereof may be incurred several
ways; As by killing them <hi>Immediately,</hi> as <hi>Cain</hi> did his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Abel;</hi> or <hi>Commanding</hi> them to be killed, as <hi>Saul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Doeg</hi> to kill the Lords Priests; or <hi>Contriving</hi> their
Murder, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Uriahs,</hi> and <hi>Iezebel Naboths;</hi> or
<hi>Counselling</hi> thereunto, as the people advised the Princes to
the murder of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and all that cryed <hi>Crucifie Iesus</hi>
were Murderers of Christ; Or by <hi>procuring</hi> it, as <hi>Haman</hi>
was guilty of the intended murder of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> Or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
therein, as <hi>Ioab</hi> was guilty of <hi>Uriahs</hi> death as well
as <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> of Christs by betraying him; Or by the
<hi>Patrocinie</hi> thereof, defending &amp; sparing the Murderers;
when called by Office to punish them, as <hi>David</hi> was guilty
in not punishing <hi>Ioab, Ahab</hi> in patronizing the Murder of
<hi>Naboth;</hi> Or by <hi>Consenting</hi> thereunto, as <hi>Saul</hi> consented to
the death of <hi>Stephen;</hi> or by <hi>knowing</hi> &amp; <hi>permitting,</hi> &amp; conniving
at it, as is condemned <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 11, 12. Whether this be
done under colour of Law, as <hi>Pilate</hi> Murdered our Lord,
<hi>Herod</hi> killed <hi>Iames;</hi> or without all colour, by <hi>Absolute
power,</hi> as <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Ascalonite</hi> murdered the Infants; or
whether it be done by purpose, as <hi>Ioab</hi> murdered <hi>Abner</hi> &amp;
<hi>Amasa;</hi> or without previous purpose, yet with knowledge
of the Action in the perpetrating of it, as men may do in
passion when provoked beside their purpose, or in a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
without intending it before hand, yet that is Murder,
<hi>Barabas</hi> committed Murder in the Insurection. For, as for
<hi>Casual killing</hi> contrary to intention without knowledge,
thats no breach of the Command. And, whatever may be
said of necessitated delivering up the Innocent, pursued by
a potent Enemy, to deliver the City from his fury; or of
prefering our oun life to our innocent neighbour, in a case
when both cannot be preserved, and by preserving the one
Lawfully the other happens to lose his life; I do not medle
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:41139:333"/>
with these Cases. But since this is taken for granted by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists,
I infer, if it be Lawful that an innocent man die in
case of necessity, that others may be preserved; Then much
more is it Lawful, that the nocent wo are guilty of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Righteous all these wayes above specified, and
actually prosecuting their murdering designs by these me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
should rather be made to die than the Righteous be
destroyed. But of this sort of Murder, taking away the
life of the Righteous, none hath the impudence to accuse
that Reproached people.</p>
               <p>2. Thô a man kill an innocent unwittingly &amp; unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
besides his knowledge and against his will; yet he may
be guilty of sinful homicide, if he was obliged to know that
he was in hazard of it, and <hi>neglected</hi> to consider, lest a man
might be killed by what he was doing: as if a man should
shoot at random, when he doth not know but some may
be killed thereby; or if one were hewing with an axe, which
he either knew or might have known to be loose, and the
head not well fastened to the helve, did not advertise
those about him of it, if by flying off it happened to kill any
person, he were not innocent, but if he knew not without
any inadvertency, then he were guiltless, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 5. See
<hi>Durham on 6. Com.</hi> So if a man built a house without
<hi>battlements,</hi> he should bring blood upon his house, if any
man fell from thence <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 8. But of this the question
is not.</p>
               <p>3. Thô a person be not altogether innocent, nor to be
reckoned among the Rigtheous; but suppose him wicked
&amp; profane, and engaged in an evil Course, dishonourable
to God, prejudicial to the Church &amp; Kingdom, and very
injurious to us: Yet it may be Murder to kill him, if he be
not guilty of <hi>Crimes</hi> that deserve death by the Law of God:
for the life of man is not subjected to the arbitrement of
any, but His who is the Author of life &amp; death: Its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to all to obey the Law, <hi>Thow shalt not kill,</hi> without
exception, but such killing as is approven by the Author of
the Law, as saith <hi>Ames<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this people so much reproached with extravagant Actions,
do abundantly clear themselves of that imputation of being
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:41139:334"/>
of the mind to kill all that differ from them, which was the
impudent forgerie of the father of lies, in their <hi>Informatory
Vindication Head. 2. Pag.</hi> 54. <q>We positively disoune (say
they) as horrid Murder, the killing of any because of a
different perswasion or opinion from us, albeit some
have invidiously cast this odious Calumny upon us.</q> And
it is as clear, they that took the <hi>Oath of Abjuration</hi> swore a
lie, when they abjured the <hi>Apologetical Declaration, in so
far as</hi> it asserted it was Lawful to kill all imployed in the
Kings service, when it asserted no such thing, as is shewed
above <hi>Head.</hi> 3. To think so much, let be to declare it,
far more to practise such a thing against all that served the
King, or any meerly because they served him, or because
they are in a wicked Course, or because they have oppressed
us, were abominable: for these things simply do not make
men guilty of death, to be punished Capitally by men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of God. But when they are stated in
such opposition to us, and serve the Tyrants Murdering
Mandats by all those wayes above specified; then we may
by the Law of God and Nature and Nations destroy, slay,
and cause to perish, and avenge our selves on them that
would assault us and are seeking our destruction, as it was
Lawful for the <hi>Iewes</hi> to do with <hi>Hamans</hi> Emissaries <hi>Esther.</hi>
8. 11, 13. &amp; 9. 1, 2, 5. This Charge then cannot reach
the Case.</p>
               <p>4. Thô Murderers, and such as are guilty of death by
the Law of God, must be punished by death, for <hi>he that
sheddeth mans blood by man must his blood be shed:</hi> Yet it may be
Murder for a man to kill another, because he <hi>thought</hi> him
so Criminal, and because he thought it his duty, being
moved by a pretended <hi>Enthusiastical Impulse,</hi> in imitation
of the extraordinary Actions of such as were really moved
by the Spirit of God. As when <hi>Iames</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> would have
commanded fire to come doun to consume the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>
the Lord rebuked them, saying, <hi>ye know not what manner of
Spirit ye are of, for the Son of man is not come to destroy mens lives
but to save them Luk.</hi> 9. 54-56. Such impulses had need to
be well examined, for ordinarly they will be found not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with a Gospel Spirit, which is alwayes averse from
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:41139:334"/>
act of Cruelty. Blind zeal sometimes may incite men to
fearful work: yea the persecuters have often most of that
Spirit, as our Lord foretells, <hi>the time cometh that whosoever

of <hi>Leyden</hi> and his followers, whose practices are deservedly
detested by all that have any spark of Christianity or huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
for if this were espoused as a Principle, there would
be no security for mens lives. But hence it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that God may not animate some to some rare En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises,
for the cutting off of Tyrants and their bloody
Emissaries, Incendiaries, Destroyers of innocent people,
and puting an end to and stoping the Career of their Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
in a time of real extreame necessity, the matter of the
action being unquestionably Lawful, their ends &amp; inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
really good &amp; commendable, there being also a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of others to do the work, and themselves in some
probable Capacity for it. See <hi>Ius Popul. Cap. 20. Pag.</hi>
410. Neither can it be denyed, but true zeal may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
incite people to such exploits, for the preservation of
Religion &amp; Liberty, their oun lives and Brethren, all like
to be destroyed by the impunity of beasts of prey. This will
be found very consistent with a Gospel Spirit: And though
this Principle be asserted, and also put in practice, all persons
notwithstanding thereof would have sufficient securitie
for their life, except such as hath really forefeited their lives
by all Law of God &amp; man. Those that are led by Impulses,
may pretend the imitation of extraordinary examples and
abuse them; yet hence it will not follow, that in no case
these extraordinary Examples may be imitated. Shall the
examples of good Magistrats, executing Justice on Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
&amp; Murderers, be altogether unimitable, because
Tyrants abuse them in persecuting the innocent? If this
arguing were good, it would make all vertuous Actions
in the world unimitable; for these may be abused by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders.
See <hi>Ius Popul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ubi supra Pag.</hi> 412. But it cannot be
charged upon the Sufferers upon this head, that they had
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:41139:335"/>
nothing to give as the reasons of their Actions but pretexts
of Enthusiasmes.</p>
               <p>5. Thô a man be really so Criminal, as tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he deserves
death by the Law of God &amp; man; yet it may be murder to
kill him, if we do not <hi>certainly know</hi> it, and can prove it,
and convict him of it upon Tryal: for no man must be
killed <hi>indictâ</hi> or <hi>incognitâ causâ.</hi> Thus even Magistrats
may Murder Murderers, when they proceed against them
without probation or cognition according to Law, far
more private persons. Thus the <hi>Abiezrites</hi> would have
murdered <hi>Gideon,</hi> not only unjustly for his duty of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
doun the Altar of <hi>Baal,</hi> but illegally, because they
would had him brought out that he might die without any
further Tryal <hi>Iudg.</hi> 6. 29, 30. So likewise the <hi>Iewes</hi> that
banded &amp; bound themselves under a curse to kill <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was tried, would have Murdered him, not only
unjustly for his duty, but illegally before he was tried <hi>Act.</hi>
23. 12. But this doth not condemn the Actions of those
Sufferers, in maintaining the necessary execution of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
upon persons who are Notorious Murderers, yea
professing a trade and prosecuting habitually a tract of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Murdering the people of the Lord.</p>
               <p>6. Thô it should be certainly known, and sufficiently
proven, that a man is a Murderer &amp;c. Yet it were Murder
for an inferiour, under a <hi>relation of subjection</hi> to him, to kill
him, as long as that subjection were acknowledged: for
whensoever the common &amp; mutual right or relation, either
Natural, Moral, Civil, or Religious, to the prejudice
or scandal of the Church or State or particular persons, is
broken by killing any person, that is Murder; thô the
person killed deserve to die. As if a Subject should kill an
acknowled King, a Son by Nature or in Law should kill
his Natural or legal father, a Servant should kill his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
breaking these relations, while their right &amp; tye were
acknowledged (as some of them must still be acknowledged
as long as the Correlates continue in being, to wit, that
of a father is not broken by his becoming a Murderer) and
to the danger, detriment, &amp; scandal of the Church &amp; State;
That were properly <hi>Assassination:</hi> for <hi>Assassines</hi> are they,
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:41139:335"/>
who being subject to others, either out of their oun head
for their oun ends, or by command of their Superiours,
kill their Superiours, or such as they command them to
kill, as <hi>Alstedius</hi> describes them <hi>Theolog. Cas. cap. 18. de
homicid. reg.</hi> 55. Therefore <hi>David</hi> would not kill <hi>Saul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he acknowledged him to be the <hi>Lords Anointed,</hi> to
whom he was under a relation of subjection; and because
he was his Master and Father in Law; And because it
would have tended to the hurt of the Kingdom, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
it in Combustions &amp; Contentions about the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
and prejudged his oun right, as well as to the
scandal of the people of God, thô <hi>Saul</hi> deserved otherwise
to be capitally punished. So <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> was killed by <hi>Baanah</hi>
&amp; <hi>Rehab 2 Sam.</hi> 4. 7. So <hi>Iozachar</hi> &amp; <hi>Iehozabad</hi> who killed
<hi>Ioash 2 King.</hi> 12. 21. were punished as Murderers <hi>chap.</hi>
14. 6. because they were his servants, and did assassinate
him to whom they were subject. So the servants of <hi>Amon</hi>
were punished by the people, as Conspirators against their
King &amp; Master 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 23, 24. though <hi>Amon</hi> deserved
to have been punished as well as <hi>Amaziah</hi> was. Hence ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
it is observed by some, that thô right be given to
equals or Superiours to bring their nearest relations to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign
punishment, when they turn entycers to Idolatry
<hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 6. Yet no right or <hi>jus,</hi> upon any cause or occasion
whatsoever, is given to inferiours, as Children &amp;c. to
punish their fathers. See <hi>Pool. Synop. Critie. in Locum.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, this cannot condemn the taking off of Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Murderers, by the hand of such as were no way
subject nor related to them, but as enemies, who in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
necessity executed righteous Judgement upon them,
without prejudice of the true necessary &amp; chief good of the

rushing upon such an Action, or hurrying the Murderer

or when he was <hi>sleeping,</hi> So <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> and <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were murdered; Or if it be done subtilly, when it may be
performed in more plain &amp; fair dealing; or teacherously,
under colour of friendship; or cruelly without regard to
humanity; and especially when the Actors are <hi>at peace</hi> with
the person, whose blood they shed, as <hi>Ioab shed the blood of

&amp; cruelly; and <hi>Absalom</hi> made his servants Assassinate
<hi>Amnon 2 Sam</hi> 13. 28, 29. But this cannot be charged
upon them, who executed righteous Judgement, as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly,
deliberately, and calmely, as the extraordinary
exigence of pressing necessity, in extremity of danger, could
allow, upon notorious Murderers, with whom they were
in open and avowed terms of hostility.</p>
               <p>8. Thô the manner also be inculpable; yet if the <hi>principle</hi>
and <hi>motive</hi> of killing, even those that deserve to die be out
of malice, hatred, rage, or revenge, for private or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
injuries, it is Murder. For the affection &amp; intention
doth make one and the same action of taking away the life,
homicide or no homicide, as <hi>Lex Rex</hi> saith <hi>Quest. 31. Pag.</hi>
338. If a man out of hatred deliberately take away another
mans life, he is a Murtherer <hi>eatenus;</hi> but if that same man
had taken away the others life, by the flying off of his axe
head, he neither hating him before nor intending to hurt
him, he is no Murtherer by Gods express Law, allowing
Cities of refuge for the one, and not for the other <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.

whose it is to take vengeance <hi>Deut. 32. 35. Rom.</hi> 12. 19.
<hi>Dearly beloved avenge not your selves, for vengeance is the Lords.</hi>
For which cause <hi>Iacob</hi> curses <hi>Simeon</hi> &amp; <hi>Levi</hi> their Murder
of the <hi>Schechemites,</hi> for in their <hi>anger</hi> they slew a man <hi>Gen.</hi>
49. 6, 7. So <hi>David</hi> would not put forth his hand against
<hi>Saul,</hi> for his oun private &amp; personal quarrel. So <hi>Ioab</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Abner,</hi> and <hi>Absalom Amnon.</hi> But this doth not make
the execution or Judgement, out of zeal for God, respect
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:41139:336"/>
to Righteousness, love to the Nations Interest, and care
to preserve the persecuted people of God from imminent
destruction, upon publick Enemies Incendiaries, that are
trampling upon all these precious Interests, and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the utter ruine of them, and in a particular manner their
destruction who thus prevent them.</p>
               <p>9. Thô the motive or cause were upon a publick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
yet it may be Murder to have a wrong <hi>End</hi> in it: as
either to intend simply the destruction of the person on
whom they execute Judgement, as the end to which all
their Action is directed, or to make their oun advantage
or honour the end of the Action. Thus <hi>David</hi> would not
kill <hi>Saul,</hi> because it might have been thought he did it to
obtain the Kingdom, of which he was rightfull successor:
And deservedly he punished the <hi>Amalekite,</hi> that brought
newes of his killing <hi>Saul;</hi> and <hi>Baanah</hi> &amp; <hi>Rechab,</hi> for their
killing <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> thinking thereby to advance themselves at
<hi>Davids</hi> Court. So also <hi>Ioab</hi> murdered <hi>Amasa</hi> to secure
himself in the Generals place. And <hi>Iehu,</hi> though upon
the matter he executed righteous Judgement, his end was
only himself, it is condemned as murder. But when the
execution of righteous Judgement is both formally intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Actors, and natively &amp; really doth conduce to
the Glory of God, the preservation of the Remnant threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
to be destroyed by these Murderers, the suppressing
of impiety, doing of Justice, turning away wrath, and
removing of present and preventing of future judgments,
then it may be duty <hi>Naph. Pag. 23. Prior edit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. Thô the end also were not culpable; yet it may be
Murder to kill Criminals by transgressing the sphere of
our <hi>vocation,</hi> and usurping upon the Magistrats sword:
for he by Office is a Revenger, to execute wrath upon him
that doth evil <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. none must make use of the sword
of vindictive Justice, but he to whom the Lord giveth it,
therefore they that came to take Christ are condemned &amp;

or excess, <hi>let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was
called 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 20. and <hi>study to be quiet and do his oun business
1 Thess.</hi> 4. 11. Therefore <hi>David</hi> would not kill <hi>Saul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would have done it beside his calling. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the killing of <hi>Ioash</hi> and <hi>Amon</hi> was murder, because
the Assassines did transgress their vocation. But when
Notorious Incendiaries do not only transgress their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the Limits of humane societie, and turn open
enemies to God &amp; man, destroying the innocent, making
havock of the Lords heritage, and vaunting of their villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and boasting of their wickedness, and thereby bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wrath upon the Land if such effrontries of insolence
should pass unpunished, and when there is no Magistrate
to do that work of Justice, but all in that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that can be acknowledged as a Minister of God to
be applied unto; in that case, it is no a transgression of our
vocation, nor an Usurpation upon the Magistrats, where
there is none, to endeavour to avert wrath, by executing
righteous Judgement. Otherwise if for fear, or suspicion
of the accidental hazard of private mens Usurping the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
or doing of the duty of Publick persons, every vertuous
Action which may be abused shall be utterly neglected,
Impiety shall quickly gain Universal Empire, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of all goodness <hi>Naph. Pag. 24. Prior edit.</hi> To
clear this, it must be considered, that a mans calling is two
fold; his particular calling, whereunto in the ordinary
course of things he is regularly confined; and his general
calling, not circumscribed by particular rules, which
from the common obligation of the end for which all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
are institute, in the clear exigence of an extraordinary
emergent, according to the general rules of righteousness,
bind to an aggreeable practice: Therefore circumstances
may sometimes so diversitie Actions, that what in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
&amp; undisturbed state of things would be accounted an
excess of our particular calling, &amp; an Usurpation, in an
extraordinary occurrence may become a necessary duty of
our general calling.</p>
               <p>11. Thô it were no Usurpation beyond our calling;
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:41139:337"/>
yet it may be murder, to kill any without the <hi>Call of God</hi> in

                     <hi>David</hi> might have killed <hi>Saul</hi> when he was
sleeping, and when he cut of the lap of his garment, but
it was unlawful for him to kill the Lords anointed, as it
is unlawful to kill a man because he is the image of God
<hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 6. except in case of necessity—<hi>David</hi> having
<hi>Saul</hi> in his hand, was in a remote posture of defence, the
unjust invasion then was not actual, nor unavoidable,
nor a necessary mean in humane prudence for self preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
for King <hi>Saul</hi> was not in an actual pursuit of the
whole Princes, Elders, Community of <hi>Israel; Saul</hi> did
but seek the life of one man <hi>David,</hi> and that not for
Religion, or a National pretended offence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could not in conscience put hands on the Lords
Anointed, but if <hi>Saul</hi> had actually invaded <hi>David</hi> for his
life, <hi>David</hi> might in that case make use of <hi>Goliahs</hi> sword
(for he took not that weapon as a Cypher to boast <hi>Saul</hi>)
and rather kill then be killed</q>: Thus he. By a Call here
we do not mean an express or immediate Call from God,
such as the Prophets might have to their extraordinary exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
of Judgement, as <hi>Samuel</hi> &amp; <hi>Elijah</hi> had to kill <hi>Agag</hi>
and <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets: but either the allowance of man, then
there is no question about it; Or if that cannot be had, as
in the case circumstantiate it cannot, Then the Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
&amp; Morall Call of extream necessity, for preservation of
our lives, and preventing the murder of our Brethren,
may warrant an extraordinary executing of righteous
Judgement upon the Murderers. Men may have a Call
to a necessary duty, neither every way mediate nor imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
as the Call of runing together to quench a fire in a
City, when Magistrats through wickedness or negligence
will not or do not call people forth unto that work; they
have not mans call, nor an immediate call from Heaven,
yet they have a Lawful Call from God: So they do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trud
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:41139:338"/>
upon the Magistrats Office, nor want they a call to
this execution of Judgement, who do materially that work
for that exigent which Magistrats by Office were bound to
do, being called thereto by God, by Nature, and the call
of inevitable Necessity, which knoweth no h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>12. Thô this be a principle of reason &amp; natural Justice,
when all the forementioned circumstances are clear, that
it is Lawful for private persons to execute righteous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
upon notorious Incendiaries and Murdering pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
Enemies, in cases of necessity: yet it might be a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
breach of the Sixth Command, to draw extraordinary
examples of it to an ordinary practice in killing all who
might be found Criminal, and would deserve death by the
Law, as all that have served under a banner of Tyrannie &amp;
violence, displayed against God &amp; His people, to the ruine
of the Reformation, wasting of the Country, oppression of
many honest families, and destruction of many innocent
people, are and would be found guilty of Murder; as the
Chief Captain would have truly alledged <hi>Paul</hi> to have been
a Murderer, if he had been the <hi>Egyptian</hi> which made an
uproar, and led out four thousand men that were Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<hi>Act.</hi> 21. 38. As for the vulgar &amp; ordinary sort of those
Vermine of Varlets, it is of no advantage for oppressed
people to foul their fingers upon them, when their slaughter
would not put a stop to, but rather encrease, the destruction
of the people of God; and were unlawful to prevent &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
the due &amp; Legal execution of Justice, where there
is any prospect or expectation of its runing in its right chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.
But for the chief &amp; principal Ring-leaders, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
publick &amp; habitual Incendiaries, and Masters of the

                  </gap>rade of Murdering the Lords people, when there is no
other way of being rid of their rage, and preserving our
selves and preventing the destruction of our Brethren, we
may in that case of necessity make publick examples of
them, in an extraordinary Procedure against them, that may
be most answerable to the Rules of the ordinary Procedure
of Justice, and in imitation of the Heroick Actions record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:41139:338"/>
and justified in the Word of God, in the like extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
cases; which are imitable, when the matter of their
Actions is ordinary, that is, neither preternatural nor Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
thô the occasion was singular, just and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
both by Divine precept, and as a mean to good &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
ends, and when there is no other to do the work,
nor any prospect of access to Justice in its ordinary &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
course, nor possibility of suspending it till that can
be obtained. We need not then any other call than a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of holy zeal for God, and for our oun &amp; our Brethrens
preservation, in that pinch of extremity. We do not hold
these extraordinary Actions for regular &amp; ordinary Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
for all times &amp; persons universally: which if people
should fancy, and heed more the glory &amp; fame of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than the sound &amp; solid Rule of the Scriptures, they
may be tempted &amp; carried to fearful extravagances. But
they may be Warrants, for private persons in their doing
of these things, in an extreame necessity, to which at other
times they are not called. And when the Lord, with
Whom is the residue of the Spirit, doth breath upon His
people moe or fewer, to the exciting of more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
zeal, for the execution of Justice upon such Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
we should rather ascribe Glory &amp; Praise to Him,
Whose hand is not shortened, but many times chooseth
the weak &amp; foolish things of the world to confound the
mighty &amp; the wise, than condemn His Instruments for
doing such things <hi>Naph. pag. 24, 25. Prior Edit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All these cases, which are all I can think on at present,
comprehending all that may any way infer the guilt of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
I have collected; to the end I may conclude this one
Argument, and leave it to be considered: If this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
executing of Judgement, upon Notorious Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries
and Murdering publick Enemies, by private persons,
in the circumstances above declared, cannot be reduced to
any case that can infer the guilt of murder; Then it cannot
be condemned but justified: But this extraordinary execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Judgement &amp;c. cannot be reduced to any case that
can infer the guilt of murder (as will appear by the induction
of all of them) <hi>Ergo</hi> this extraordinary executing of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp;c. cannot be condemned but justified.</p>

II. In the Next place, What we oune may be done
warrantably in taking away the life of men without breach
of the Sixth Command, will appear by these propositions
&amp; Assertions, which will bring the matter to the present
Circumstantiate Case.</p>
               <p>1. It is certain, thô the Command be indefinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
it doth not prohibite all killing, but only that
which is condemned in other explicatorie Commands.
Our Lord Jesus repeating this Command, explains it by
expressing it thus, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 18.—<hi>Thow shalt not Murder.</hi>
And if any be Lawful, it is granted by all, that is, which is
unavoidable by the invincible necessity of Providence,
when a man following his duty doth that which beside &amp;
contrary his intention and without any previous neglect or
oversight in him, proveth the hurt &amp; death of another, in
which case he was allowed to flee to the City of refuge by
the Law of God. Whence if that Physical necessity did
justify that kind of killing, shall not a Moral necessity
every way invincibly unavoidable (except we suffer our
selves and our Brethren to be destroyed by beasts of prey)
vindicate this kind, in an extraordinary extremity, when
the Murderers are protected under the sconce of pretended
Authority? In which case the Law of God would allow
deliberate Murderers should be pursued by the Avenger of
blood, and not to have Liberty to flee to these subterfuges
and pretexts of Authority (meer Tyranny) but to be taken
from the horns of such altars, and be put to death, as
<hi>Mr Mitchel</hi> sayes in vindicating his oun Action, in a <hi>Letter
dated Feb.</hi> 1674.</p>
               <p>2. It is Lawful to take the life of known &amp; convicted
Murderers by publick Justice: Yea it is indispensably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
by the Law of God, and no mercy nor pardon of
the Magistrate may interpose to spare them; for, <hi>Whoso
killeth any person the Murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of
Witnesses—ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer</hi>—<hi>but
he shall surely be put to death,</hi> He was not to be
admitted to the benefit of any refuge: And the reason is,
<hi>blood defiles the Land, and the Land cannot be cleansed of the blood
that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it Numb.</hi> 35.
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:41139:339"/>
30, 31, 32, 33. Hence if it be so necessary to cleanse the
Land, then when the Magistrate is not only negligent in
his duty, but turns a Patron &amp; Protector of such Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and imployes them as his Emissaries to murder &amp;
destroy, it cannot be expected he should cleanse the Land,
for then he should free it of the burden of himself, and
begin with himself: Therefore then there must be more
incumbent upon private persons, touched with the zeal
of God, than at another time. And as <hi>Mr Knox</hi> in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> sayes <q>They that in the fear of
God execute Judgement where God hath commanded,
offend not God thô Kings do it not: and adduces the
examples of <hi>Samuel</hi> killing <hi>Agag, Elias</hi> killing the
Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> and of <hi>Phineas</hi> killing <hi>Zimri &amp; Cozbi.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>3. It is Lawful for private persons to kill, <hi>in Moderamine
inculpatae tutulae,</hi> their unjust Assaulters, in defending
themselves against their violence, and that both in <hi>Tutela
vitae proxima,</hi> in the immediate defence of our life against
an immediate assault, in the instant of the assault, and also
<hi>in tutela remotâ</hi> in a remote defence of our selves, when
that is as necessary as the first, and there is no other way of
escaping the destruction intented by Murtherers, either by
flight or resistence; then it is Lawful to preserve our selves
by taking advantages to cut them off.</p>
               <p>4. It is Lawful in a just war to kill the enemie; yea in
the defensive war of private subjects, or a part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
against their oppressing Tyrants, as is proven
<hi>Head.</hi> 5. Where several of the Arguments used to evince
that Truth will confirm this: as namely those Arguments
taken from the peoples power in Reformation, and those
taken from the hazard of partaking of others sin &amp; Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For if all the Magistrats, Supreme &amp; subordinate,
turn principal patrons and patterns of all abominations,
and persecuters and destroyes of the people for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with them, then the people are not only under an
obligation to resist them; but seeing otherwise they would
by lyable to their sin, in suffering them thus to trample on
Religion and the Interests of God as well as their oun, in
order to turn away the wrath of God, it is incumbent
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:41139:340"/>
upon them to vindicate Religion, and Reform the Land
from these Corruptions, in an endeavour to bring those
Malignant Enemies of God and Destroyers of the people
to condign punishment, that <hi>the heads of the people being
hanged up before the Lord against the sun, the fierce anger of the
Lord may be turned away from the Land Numb.</hi> 25. 4. In this
case, as <hi>Buchannan</hi> sayes of a Tyrant, <hi>de jure regni,</hi> 
                  <q>A Lawful
war being once undertaken with such an enemy as a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
is, every one out of the whole multitude of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
may assault with all the calamities of war a Tyrant,
who is a publick Enemy, with whom all good men have
a perpetual warfare.</q> And thô the war <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e not alwayes
actually prosecute in a hostile manner, yet as long as peace
is not concluded and the war ceased, they that have the
just side of the quarrel may take advantages in removing &amp;
taking off (not every single souldier of the Contrary side,
for that would contribute nothing to their prevailing in the
end) but the principal Instruments &amp; promoters of the war,
by whose fall the offending side would suffer great loss,
and the defending would be great Gainers. So <hi>Iael</hi> killing
<hi>Sisera Iabins</hi> Captain-General, is greatly commended.
Now this was the Case of the Sufferers upon this head, as
<hi>Mr Mitchel</hi> one of them represents it, in his fore-cited
letter <q>I being (sayes he) a Souldier, not having laid doun
my armes, but still upon my oun defence, having no
other end nor quarrel at any man—besides the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the ends of the Covenant, Particularly the
overthrow of Prelats &amp; Prelacy; And I being a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
enemy to him (that is <hi>Sharp</hi>) on that account, and
he to me in like manner, I never found my self obliged—to
set a sentinel at his door for his safety, but as he
was alwayes to take his advantage, as it appeareth, so I
of him to take any opportunity offered; Moreover we
being in no terms of Capitulation, but on the contrary,
I by his instigation being excluded from all grace &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
thought it my duty to pursue him at all occasions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>5. It is Lawful to kill enemies in the <hi>rescue</hi> of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
when they are keeping them in bondage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
them for a sacrifice to the fury of Tyrants, or
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:41139:340"/>
leading them forth to the slaughter, or in the time of acting
their Murdering violence upon them, Then, to break
Prisons, beat up Garrisons, surprise the Murderers, and
kill them in the rescue of our innocent Brethren, is very
Lawful, according to that Command <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 11, 12. and
the practice of <hi>Moses,</hi> who seeing one of his Brethren suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was
oppressed, and slew the <hi>Egyptian Act.</hi> 7. 24. For that is
a certain Truth, which <hi>Grotius</hi> saith <hi>in locum, jus naturae dat
innocenti &amp; innocentem tutanti jus in nocentem.</hi> Hence it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be Lawful also, in a case of necessity, when both
our selves and our Brethren are pursued incessantly by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
Murderers, to avenge our selves on them, and slay
them, when there is no other way to be rid of their violence.</p>
               <p>6. It is Lawful to <hi>prevent</hi> the Murder of our selves or
our Brethren, when no other way is left, by killing the
Murderers before they accomplish their wicked design, if
they be habitually prosecuting it, and have many times ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
it before. This followeth upon the other:
And upon this account it had been duty for <hi>Gedaliab</hi> to have
suffered <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>banan</hi> to slay <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and so prevent the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
murder, if it had been certainly known that <hi>Ishmael</hi>
was sent by the King of <hi>Ammon</hi> to assassinate him <hi>Ier.</hi> 40.
14, 15. for nothing is there objected against the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the thing, but only it was alledged that he spoke
falsly. <hi>Alstedius</hi> asserts this <hi>Theol. Cas. de h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>micidio reg.</hi> 6.
<hi>pag. 331. Licitum est praevenire eum qui vult invadere, &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniendo
occidere antequam invadat, si necessarium est praevenire,
quia aliter vita propria defendi non potest nisi preveniendo.</hi> It is
Lawful to prevent him that would assault us, and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
to kill him before his invasion, if it be so necessary,
to prevent him, that our life cannot be otherwise defended
but by preventing. And hence he justifies that saying, <hi>lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
est occidere insidiantem,</hi> It is Lawful to kill him that lyeth
in wait to murder, <hi>ibid.</hi> This is all the length that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
Sufferers, whom I am vindicating, go in assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this principle, as may be seen in their <hi>Informatory Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
Head 2. pag.</hi> 55. where they say, <q>We maintain it as
both righteous &amp; rational, in defence of our lives, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:41139:341"/>
&amp; Religion, after an orderly &amp; Christian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to endeavour by all means Lawful &amp; possible, to
defend our selves, rescue our Brethren, and prevent
their murder, in a martial opposition against wicked Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters,
who are seeking to destroy them &amp; us, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue
their hands in our blood, according to the true im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the <hi>Apologetical Declaration.</hi>
                  </q> Which is very ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
Especially considering.</p>
               <p>7. These Murderers, who are thus to be prevented, are
such whom the Law of God commands to be put to death,
and no where allowes to be spared being publick Enemies
to God and good men, Open Blasphemers, avowed Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
affronted Adulterers, Notorious Murderers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
Tyrants, suppressing Religion, oppressing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and professing a trade of destroying the Lords
people. Surely if God hath expressly in His Laws provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Blasphemers, Idolaters, Murderers &amp;c. should
not be suffered to live, He never intended men dayly
guilty, yea making profession of these Crimes, should be
allowed impunity, either by virtue of their Office, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is none in Office to execute Judgement upon
them; but in a case of extreame necessity these Laws will
not only allow but oblige people, dayly Murthered by
them, for their oun preservation, for vindication of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
for purging the Land of such wickedness, for turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away the wrath of God, to prevent their prosecuting
their Murdering designs any further, and put a stop to their
persecution by puting an end to their wicked lives. Seeing,
as <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Buchannan</hi> sayes <hi>de jure Regni,</hi>
                     </bibl> It is expressly commanded
to cut off wickedness &amp; wicked men, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of rank or degree, and yet in no place of Sacred
Scripture are Tyrants more spared than private persons.</q>
Much less their bloody Emissaries.</p>
               <p>Now seeing all these Cases of <hi>Killing</hi> I have collected,
are justifyable in Scripture, and none of the Sufferers upon
this Head whom I am vindicating, have exceeded in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
or practice the amount of these Assertions, What is
said already may have some weight to demur a censorious
condemnation of them. But as the <hi>True Non-Conformist</hi>
                  <pb n="657" facs="tcp:41139:341"/>
well observes, in answer to <hi>Dial. 7. pag.</hi> 391. Seeing the
consideration resulting from the Concurrence of all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
whereupon the right dignoscing of such deeds
when actually existent doth mostly depend, doth more
contribute to the clearing &amp; passing a judgement on a case
of this nature, when the whole contexture is exposed to
certain examination, than to set doun general rules direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of such practices (which yet will all justify this in ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
Therefore to clear the case further, all may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
into this State of the Question.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whether or not private persons, incessantly pursued
unto death, and threatened with ineluctable destruction
by Tyrants and their Emissaries, May, to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from their violence in case of extreame Necessity,
put forth their hand to execute righteous Judgement
upon the Chief &amp; principal Ringleaders, Instruments, &amp;
Promoters of all these destructive Mischiefs &amp; Miseries,
Who are open &amp; avowed Enemies to God, Apostates,
Blasphemers, Idolaters, Tyrants, Traitors, Notorious
Incendiaries, Atrocious Murderers, and known and
convict to be publick Enemies, prosecuting their Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Designs notourly &amp; habitually, and therefore
guilty of death by all Laws of God &amp; man; And in such
an extraordinary case, put them to death who have <hi>de
jure</hi> forefeited their lives to Justice, when there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to publick Justice, nor prospect of obtaining it in an
orderly way, nor any probability of escaping their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
destruction, either by flight or resistence, if they
be past longer unpunished; And so deliver themselves
from their Murdering Tyranny, while they are under
no acknowledged subjection to them, nor at peace with
them, but maintaining a defensive resistence against them;
And in this extraordinary execution of Justice, being not
chargable with ignorance of matters of fact so manifest,
nor mistake of circumstances so palpable, nor with
malice rage or revenge against their persons for private
&amp; particular injuries</q>, nor with Enthusiastick Impulses pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
as their Rule, nor with deceit or Treacherie in the
manner, nor with any breach of relation or obligation,
nor Usurpation upon or prejudice to any Lawful Right
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:41139:342"/>
whatsoever in the matter, nor with any selfish or sinistrous
ends in the design; But forced to performe this Work of
Judgement, when there is none other to do it, out of zeal
for the Glory of God, Care of the Countries good, love to
their Brethren, sense of their oun Danger, &amp; Respect to Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
to the end, that by the removal of these wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers,
their war against the prevailing faction of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Enemies may be more successfully maintained, their
Religion, Lives, Laws, &amp; Liberties more securely defended,
their Brethren rescued, their Murder prevented, Impietie
suppressed, the Land cleansed from blood, and the wrath of
God averted; That this is the true State of the Question,
the preceeding Assertions all comprehended here do make
it evident. To which I answer in the Affirmative. And
shall come to give my Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then I shall offer some Reasons for this, first
from some grounds &amp; <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of Reason: Then more
expressly from Scripture proofs.</p>
               <p>I. There may be some Arguments offered from the
Dictates of <hi>natural reason.</hi> Which I shall but only glance at.</p>
               <p>1. I premit the Consideration of the <hi>Practice of all Nations,</hi>
even such from whom Patterns have been taken for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and who have had the most polite &amp; purest Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
and have been the severest Animadverters upon all
Extravagants &amp; Transgressers of their vocation: Yet even
among them, for private persons to destroy and rid the
Common-wealth of such burdens, and vile vermine so
pernicious to it, was thought a virtue meriting rather Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
than a thing to be Condemned. I shall not
here instance the laudable practices recorded in Scripture:
These may be seen in their oun place. Neither do I speak
of ruder Nations, among whom this is a rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct of reason,
not of ruderness: as the <hi>Oriental Indians</hi> have a Custome,
whenever any person <hi>runs a muck,</hi> that is, in a revengeful
fury takes such a quantity of <hi>Opium,</hi> as distracts them into
such a rage of mad animosity, that they fear not to assault
(which is the common operation of that potion there) and
go through destroying whom they can find in their way:
Then every man Armes against him: and is ambitious of
the honour of first killing him: which is very rational, for
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:41139:342"/>
otherwise no man could be safe; and it seems to be as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
to take the same Course with our mad Malignant
<hi>mucks,</hi> who are drunk with hellish fury, and are runing
in a rage to destroy the people of God whom they can meet
with. But all the Nations where the best Policy was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
have been of this mind. In <hi>Greece</hi> publick rewards
were enacted to be given, and honours appointed by several
Cities, to those that should kill Tyrants, from the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest
of them to the meanest; with whom they thought there
was no bond of humanity to be kept. Hence <hi>Thebe</hi> is
usually commended for killing her husband, <hi>Timoleon</hi> for
killing his Brother, because they were pernicious &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to the Common-wealth: which, thô it seem not
justifyable, because of the breach of relation of natural sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
yet it shewes what sentiments the most politick
Nations have had of this practice. As also among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Cassius</hi> is commended for killing his son, and <hi>Fulvius</hi>
for killing his oun son going to <hi>Catiline,</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his kinsmen having understood they had conspired to
introduce Tyranny again. <hi>Servilius Ahalas</hi> is commended
for killing even in the Court <hi>Sp. Melius,</hi> turning his back
and refusing to compear in judgement, and for this was
never judged guilty of bloodshed, but thought nobilitate by
the slaughter of a Tyrant, and all posterity did affirme the
same. <hi>Cicero,</hi> speaking of the slaughter of <hi>Cesar,</hi> stiles it
a famous &amp; divine fact, &amp; <hi>positum ad imitandum. Sulpitius
Asper,</hi> being asked, why he had combined with others
against <hi>Nero,</hi> and thought to have killed him? made this
bold reply, that he <hi>knew not any other way to put a stop to his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies,
and redeem the world from the infection of his example,
and the evils which it groaned under by reason of his crimes.</hi> On
the contrary, <hi>Domitius Corbulo</hi> is reprehended by all, for
neglecting the safety of mankind, in not puting an end to
<hi>Nero's</hi> Cruelty, when he might very easily have done it:
And not only was he by the Romans reprehended but by <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridates</hi>
the <hi>Persian</hi> King, being not at all afrayed lest it should
afterward befall an example unto himself. When the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of <hi>Cajus Caligula,</hi> a most cruel Tyrant, were with
the like crueltie tumultuating for the slaughter of their
Master, requiring them that killed him to be punished, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:41139:343"/>
Asiaticus</hi> the Senator cried out aloud, <hi>I wish I had
killed him,</hi> and thereby both composed their clamour &amp; stopt
their rage. <q>For there is so great force in an honest deed
(saith <hi>Buchannan de jure Regni,</hi> relating this passage) that
the very lightest shew thereof, being presented to the
minds of men, the most furious assaults are allyed, and
fury will languish, and madness it self mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the soveraignity of reason.</q> The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> did
often approve the fact, thô done without their order often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by private hands: As upon the slaughter of <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
in stead of revenging it, they decreed that his Carcass
should be exposed and torn in pieces. Sometimes they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
before hand to have it done; As when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<hi>Didimus Iulianus,</hi> they sent a Tribune to slay him
in the Palace: Nay they have gone so far, as in some cases
to appoint reward for such as should kill those Tyrants that
trampled upon their Laws, and murdered virtuous &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
people; As that sentence of the Senate against the
two <hi>Maximim</hi> doth witness, <hi>qui cos occiderit proe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ium merebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.
Buchannan ubi supra,</hi> rehearsing many instances of this
nature, gives reasons of their approvableness. And these
I find here and there scattered, in his book <hi>de jure Regni.</hi>
1. They that make a prey of the Common-wealth, are not
joined to us by any civil bond or tye of humanity, but
should be accounted the most Capital enemies of God and
of all men. 2. They are not to be counted as within hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
societie, but transgressors of the limits thereof;
Which who so will not enter into, and contain himself
within, should be taken &amp; treated as wolve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, or other
kinds of noysome beasts, which whosoever spares he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
them to his oun destruction, and of others, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
killeth doth not only good to himself, but to all
others, and therefore doth merit rather reward than to be
condemned for it. For if any man, divested of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
should degenerate into such Crueltie, as he would not
meet with other men but for their destruction) as the
Monsters I am speaking of could meet with none of the
party here treated on, but to this effect) he is not to
be called a man, no more than Satyres, Apes, or Bears.
3. It is expressly Commanded to cut off, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:41139:343"/>
&amp; wicked men, without any exception of rank or
degree: And if Kings would abandon the Counsells of
wicked men, and measure their greatness rather by duties
of virtue, than by the impunity of evil deeds; they would
not be grived for the punishment of Tyrants, nor think that
Royal Majestie is lessened by their destruction, but rather
be glad that it is purged from such a stain of wickedness.
4. What is here to be reprehended? is it the cause of their
punishment? that is palpable: Is it the Law which adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
them to punishment? All Laws were desired as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for repressing Tyrants; whosoever doth condemn this
must likewise condemn all the Laws of Nations: Is it the
person executing the Laws? where will any other be found
to doe it, in such circumstances. 5. A Lawful war being
once undertaken with an enemy for a just cause, it is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
not only for the whole people to kill that enemy, But
for every one of them: every one therefore may kill a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
who is a publick enemy, with whom all good men
have a perpetual war-fare. Meaning, if he be habitually
Tyrannical, and destructive to the people, so that there
is no living for good people for him: Otherwise, thô a
man by force or fraud acquire Soveraignity, no such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is to be done to him, providing he use a moderate
way in his Government, such as <hi>Vespasian</hi> among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;
Hiero</hi> in <hi>Syracuse.</hi> 6. Treason cannot be committed
against one who destroyes all Laws and Liberties of the
people, and is a pernicious plague to the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>2. Such is the force of this Truth in the case circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate;
that it extorts the acknowledgment of the Greatest
Authors, Ancient &amp; Modern, Domestick &amp; Forreign,
and even of all rational Royalists, (as <hi>Mr Mitchel</hi> sayes in
his <hi>Post-script</hi> to the forecited letter) that <q>it is Lawful for
any private person to kill a Tyrant <hi>sine titulo</hi> and to kill
<hi>Tories</hi> or open Murderers as devouring beasts, because
the good of his Action doth not only redound to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
himself, but to the whole Common-wealth, and the
person acting incurs the danger himself alone.</q> 
                  <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ltan,</hi>
though a man loyal to excess, sayes, <hi>Every man is a
souldier enrolled to bear Armes against all Traitors &amp; publick Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
The Ancient Ecclesiastical Historian, <hi>Sozomene,</hi>

He propones the question: If sometimes it be Lawful to
kill a man by private Authority? He answers, <q>It is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Lawful to kill another without publick Cognition,
proceeding, but then only when the cause doth evidently
require it that it be done, and publick Authority cannot
be implored; for in that case any private man is consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
in stead of a publick Minister of Justice, both by Gods
allowance, and by the consent of all men.</q> These pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
carry such evidence in them, that the Authors
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:41139:344"/>
thought it superfluous to confirme them, and sufficient to
affirme them. And from any reason that can be adduced to
prove any of these Assertions, it will be as evident that this
Truth I plead for is thereby confirmed, as that it self is
thereby strengthened. For it will follow natively, if Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
and Tyrants <hi>sine titulo,</hi> be to be thus dealt with; then
the Monsters of whom the question is, those Notorious
Incendiaries and Murdering publick Enemies, are also to
be so served: For either these Authors assert the Lawfulness
of so treating Tyrants <hi>sine titulo,</hi> because they are Tyrants,
or because they want a title: If the first be said; Then all
Tyrants are to be so served; and reason would say, and
Royalists will subscribe, if Tyrants that call themselves
Kings may be so animadverted upon, because of their
perniciousness to the Common-wealth by their Usurped
Authority, then the subordinate firebrands that are tho
immediate instruments of that destruction, the inferior
emissaries that act it and actually accomplish it in Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
innocent people, may be so treated; for their persons
are not more sacred than the other, nor more impunible:
If the second be said, it is Lawful to kill them because they
want a title; Then it is either because they want a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
title, or because they want a real &amp; Lawful one: The
Latter is as good as none, and it is proved <hi>Head. 2. Arg.</hi>
7. that no Tyrants can have any: The former can not be
said, for all Tyrants will pretend some, at least before they
be killed.</p>
               <p>3. But thô some of these Great Authors neither give
their reasons for what they assert, nor do they extend it to
all Tyrants that Tyrannise by virtue of their pretended
Authority, yet it will not be difficult to prove, that all
great &amp; small that murder, destroy, and Tyrannise over
poor people, are to be punished, though they pretend
Authority for what they do. And hence, If all Tyrants,
Murderers, &amp; Destroyers of mankind ought to be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
then when it cannot be done by publick Authority, it
may be done by private: But all Tyrants, Murderers, &amp;
Destroyers of mankind, ought to be punished: <hi>Ergo</hi>—
The <hi>Minor</hi> is manifest from the General Commands of
shedding the blood of <hi>every man that sheds<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

of respecting <hi>no mans person in Iudgement Deut.</hi> 1. 17. and
universally all penal Laws are general without exception
of any, for under that reduplication of criminal transgressing
those Laws, under that general Sanction, they are to be
judged; which admits of no partial respect: for if the
greatest of men be Murderers, they are not to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as great, but as Murderers; just as the meanest are not
to be considered as mean or poor, but as Murderers. But
I need not insist on this, being sufficiently proved <hi>Head.
2. Arg.</hi> 9. And through out that Head, proving that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
can have no Authority. And, if they have no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
then Authority (which they have not) cannot exempt
them from punishment. The Connexion of the <hi>Major</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
may be thus urged: When this Judgement cannot
be executed by publick Authority, either it must be done by
private Authority in case of extreame necessity, or not at
all: for there is no <hi>Medium</hi> but either to do it by publick
Authority, or private: If not at all, Then the Land must
remain still defiled with blood, and cannot be cleansed
<hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 33. Then the fierce anger of the Lord cannot
be averted <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 4. for without this executing of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
He will not turn it away <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 1. Then must Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
be encouraged by their impunity to make havock of
all according to their Lust, besides that poor Handful
who cannot eschape being their prey, as their Case is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiate.
Besides, this is point blank contrary to these
General Commands, which say peremptorely, <hi>The Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
shall be put to death,</hi> but this supposed Case when pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
Authority will not or cannot put them to death, sayes,
<hi>they shall not be put to death.</hi> In this Case then I demand,
whether their impunity is necessary, because they must
not be put to death? or because they cannot be put to death?
To say the Latter, were an untruth: for private persons
can do it, when they get access, which is possible: If the
former, then it is clearly contradictory to the Commands,
which say, <hi>they must be put to death,</hi> excepting no Case, but
when they cannot be put to death. If it be said, they must
not be put to death, because the Law obliges only publick
Authority to execute Judgement. To this I reply. 1. I
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:41139:345"/>
trust to make the Contrary appear from Scripture and
by. 2. If the Law obliges none but those in publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to execute Judgement, then when there is no
Judgement execute, it must be the sin of non but those in
publick Authority: And if it be only their sin, now comes
others to be threatened &amp; punished for this, that Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not executed? if they must only stand by and be
spectators of their omissions unconcerned, What shall
they do to evite this wrath? Shall they exhort them? or
witness against them, But that more than all this is required
is proved before several times, where this Argument of
peoples being punished for the sin of their Rulers hath
been touched. 3. Then when there is no Authority, it
must be no sin at all that Judgement is not executed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the sin of none: it can not be sin, except it be the
sin of some. 4. What if those in publick Authority be the
Murderers? who shall put them do death? By what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
shall Judgement be execute upon them? Whither
publick or private? publick it cannot be: for there is no
formal publick Authority above the Supreame, who are
supposed the party to be punished: If it be by the radical
Authority of the people, which is the thing we plead for,
then it is but private, as that of one party against another:
The people are the party grieved, and so cannot be Judges:
At best then this will be extrajudicial executing of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And if the people may do it upon the Greatest of
Tyrants, then a part of them who are in greatest hazard
may save themselves from those of Lesser Note, by puting
them to death: for if all the people have right to punish
Universal Tyrants, because they are destroyers of all;
then a part hath right to punish particular Tyrants, because
they are destroyers of them, when they cannot have
access to publick Authority, nor the concurrence of the
whole body.</p>
               <p>4. Let these Murderers &amp; Incendiaries be considered,
either as a part of the Community with them whom they
murder &amp; destroy, or not: If they be a part, and do belong
to the same Community (which is not granted in this case,
yet let it be given) Then when the safety of the whole or
better part, cannot consist with the sparing or preserving
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:41139:346"/>
of a single man, especially such an one as prejudges all and
destroyes that better part; he is rather to be cut off, than
the whole or the better part be endangered: for the cutting
off of a Contagious Member that destroyes the rest of the
body, is well warranted by Nature, because the safety
of the whole is to be preferred to the safety of a part, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
a destructive part: But now who shall cut it off? since
it must be cut off, otherwise a greater part of the body will be
presently consumed, and the whole endangered. It is sure
the Phisicians duty: but what if he will not? or can not? or
there be no Phisician? then any that can may &amp; must: yea
one member may in that case cut off another. So when
either the Magistrate will not, or dare not, or does not,
or there is none to do this necessary work of Justice, for
the preservation of the Community; any member of it may
rather prevent the destruction of the whole, or a greater
part, by destroying the Murdering &amp; destructive Member,
than suffer himself &amp; others to be unavoidably destroyed
by his being spared. If they be not within, or belonging to
that Societie, then they may be dealt with &amp; carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
as publick Enemies &amp; Strangers, and all advantages
may be taken of them in cases of necessity, as men would
do if invaded by <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Tartars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Let it be considered, what men might have done in
such a case before Government was erected, if there had
been some publick &amp; notour Murderers still preying upon
some sort of men. Certainly then private persons (as all
are in that case) might kill them to prevent further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
Hence if this was Lawful before Government
was established, it cannot be unlawful when people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have the benefit of the Government; when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
that is, instead of giving redress to the grieved &amp;
oppressed, does allow &amp; impower them to destroy them:
otherwise people might be better without Government
than with it, for then they might prevent their Murderers
by cutting them off. But so it is that this was Lawful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Government was established. For let it be adverted,
that the Scripture seems to insinuate such a Case before the
flood. <hi>Cain,</hi> after he Murdered his brother, feared that
<hi>every man that found him should slay him Gen.</hi> 4. 14. If he had
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:41139:346"/>
reason to fear this, as certainly he had, if the Lord had not
removed that by proroguing the execution of vengeance
upon him, for his greater punishment and the worlds
more Lasting instruction, and by seting a mark upon him,
and inhibiting under a severe threatening any to touch him;
Then either every man that should have killed him was
the Magistrate (which were ridiculous) or every man was
every &amp; any private person universally, which might have
killed him if this inhibition had not past upon it. <hi>Anisworth</hi>
upon the place sayes, that among the ancient Romans
every one might kill without a challenge, any man that
was Cursed for some publick Crime, and cites <hi>Dyonis. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licarnas.
L.</hi> 2. And so <hi>Cain</hi> spoke this from a dictate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and a guilty Conscience.</p>
               <p>6. At the Erection of Government, thô the people
resign the formal power of life &amp; death and punishing Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals
over to the Governour, Constitute by them; yet as
they retain the radical power &amp; right virtually, So when
either the Magistrats neglects their duty of vindicating the
innocent and punishing their destroyers, or impowers
Murderers to prey upon them; In that case they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the exercise of it to destroy their destroyers, when
there is no other way of preventing or escaping their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions:
because <hi>extremis morbis extrema remedia.</hi> In an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
exigent, when <hi>Ahab</hi> &amp; <hi>Iezebel</hi> did undo the
Church of God, <hi>Elias</hi> with the peoples help killed all
<hi>Baals</hi> Priests against and without the Kings will, in this
case its evident the people resumed their power, as <hi>Lex
Rex</hi> saith <hi>Quest. 9, Pag.</hi> 63. There must be a Court of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
no less than a Court of Justice, when it is in this
extremity as if they had no Ruler, as that same Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Author sayeth <hi>Quest. 24. Pag.</hi> 213. If then the people may
resume that power in cases of necessity which they resigned
to the Magistrate; then a part may resume it, when a part
only is in that necessity, and all may claim an interest in
the Resumption, that had an interest in the Resignation.</p>
               <p>7. Especially upon the dissolution of a Government,
when people are under a necessity to revolt from it, and so
are reduced to their primeve Liberty, they may then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
all that power they had before the resignation, and
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:41139:347"/>
exert it in extraordinary exigents of necessity. If then a
people that have no Magistrats at all may take order with
their destroyers, then must they have the same power
under a Lawful revolt. As the ten tribes, if they had not
exceeded in severity against <hi>Adoram R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>boams Collector,</hi>
had just cause to take order with that Usurpers Emissarie,
if he came to oppress them: But if he had come to Murder
them, then certainly it was duty to put him to death, and
could not be censured at all, as it is not, in the Historie
1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 18. But so it is that the people pursued by these
Murderers, some of which in their extreame exigences
they put to death; have for these several years maintained
a declared Revolt from the present Government, and have
denyed all subjection to it upon the grounds vindicated
<hi>Head.</hi> 2. And therefore they must be considered as reduced
to their primeve Liberty, and their pursuers as their
publick Enemies, to whom they are no otherwise related
than if they were <hi>Turks,</hi> whom none will deny it Lawful
to kill, if they invade the Land to destroy the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>8. Hence, seeing they are no other than publick Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
unjustly invading, pursuing, and seeking them to
destroy them; what Arguments will prove the Lawfulness
of Resistance, and the necessity of self Defence, <hi>in tutelâ
vitae proximà,</hi> will also prove the Lawfulness of taking
all advantages upon them, <hi>in tutelâ remotà<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for if it be
Lawful to kill an enemy in his immediat assault, to prevent
his killing of them when there is no other way of preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves from his fury; Then it must be Lawful
also, in his remote but still incessant pursuit, to prevent
his Murdering them by killing him, when the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e is no other
way to escape in a case of extreame necessity. But that this
was the Case of that poor people, Witnesses can best
prove it; And I dare appeal to two sorts of them that know
it best, that is, all the pursuers, and all the pursued.</p>
               <p>9. This is founded, and followes upon the 4 <hi>Art.</hi> of the
<hi>Solemn League &amp; Covenant:</hi> Where we are bound with all
faithfulness to endeavour, the <hi>discovery of all such as have been
or shall be Incendiaries, Malignants, or evil Instruments—that
they may be brought to publick trial &amp; receive condign punishment.</hi>
Now as this obliges to the orderly &amp; ordinary way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:41139:347"/>
them, when there is access to publick Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
so when there is none, Either this Article obliges to
no endeavour at all (which cannot be, for it is Moral duty
to endeavour the punishment of such) or else it must oblige
to this extraordinary Action &amp; execution of Judgement, if
to any at all. Especially considering, how in the sense of
the short comings of this duty, it is renewed in the <hi>Solemn
Acknowledgment of sins &amp; Engagement to duties That we shall
be so far from conniving at Malignity, injustice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that we
shall—take a more effectual Course, than heretofore, in our
respective Places &amp; Callings, for punishing &amp; suppressing these
evils</hi>—Certainly we were called to one way of prosecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this obligation then, when it was first engaged into,
and to another now, when our Capacity &amp; Circumstances
are so materially &amp; formally altered: if the effectual Course
then, was by publick Authority; then now when that is
wanting, there must be some obligation to take some
effectual Course still, that may suit our Places &amp; Callings,
which will certainly comprehend this extraordinary way of
suppressing those-evils, by preventing their growth in
curbing the Instruments &amp; executing Judgement upon
them, in a case of extreame Necessity, which will suit with
all Places &amp; all Callings.</p>
               <p>II. From the Scriptures, these Arguments are offered.
<hi>First,</hi> Some approven <hi>Examples,</hi> and imitable in the like
Circumstances, will clear &amp; confirm the Lawfulness of
this extraordinary Work of Judgement executed by private
persons, upon notorious Incendiaries, firebrands, &amp;
Murderers, guilty of death by the Law of God.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Moses</hi> spyed an <hi>Egyptian</hi> smiting an <hi>Hebrew</hi> one of his
Brethren, and he looked this way and that way, and when
he saw that there was no man, he slew the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and hid
him in the sand. <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 11, 12. Here's an uncondemned
Example: whereof the Actor who was the Relator did
not condemn himself, thô he condems himself for faults
that seem less odious; yea in effect he is rather commended
by <hi>Stephen</hi> the Martyr <hi>Act.</hi> 7. And thô it be extraordinary,
in that it was done by private Authority, not by a Judge,
as it was objected to him <hi>the second day:</hi> yet it was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable;
Because that Action, thô Heroical, whereof
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:41139:348"/>
the ground was ordinary, the Rule Moral, the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
commonly incident, the managment directed by
humane prudence, cannot be unimitable: But such was
this Action, thô Heroical. The ground was ordinary,
spying his Brother in hazard, whose Murder he would
have prevented. The Rule was Moral, being according
to that Moral precept of rescuing our Brother in hazard
<hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 11, 12. The Circumstances were incident in a
case of extreame necessity, which he managed very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
looking this way &amp; that way, and hiding him in
the sand. Therefore it may be imitated in the like Case. It
signifies nothing to say that he was moved by the Spirit of
God thereto: for unto every righteous performance, the
motion of the Spirit of God is requisite. This Impulse that
<hi>Moses</hi> had and others aftermentioned, was nothing but a
greater measure of that assisting Grace, which the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinariness
of the case and the difficulties therein occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
did call for; but the intervening of such motions, do
not alter the Rule, so as to make the action unimitable.
Impulses are not the Rule of duty, either under an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
or extraordinary exigence; but when they are subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

up before the Lord against the Sun, that the fierce Anger of the

                  <hi>and thrust both of them through—So the Plague was stayed</hi>—And

Action was some way extraordinary; because <hi>Phinehas</hi> was
not a Magistrate, nor one of the Judges whom <hi>Moses</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to slay every one his men <hi>vers</hi> 5. Otherwise, if this
had been only an ordinary execution of Judgement by the
Authority of <hi>Moses, Phinehas</hi> his Action would not have
been so much taken notice of, nor so signally rewarded;
but here it is noted as a singular act of <hi>zeal,</hi> which it could
not have been, if it was only an ordinary execution of the
Magistrats command: yet thô this action was signally
Heroical, proceeding from a Principle of pure zeal for
God, and prompted by a powerful motion of the Spirit of
God to that extraordinary execution of Judgement: It is
notwithstanding imitable in the like Circumstances. For,
the matter is ordinary, being neither preternatural nor su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural,
but just &amp; necessary. The end was ordinary,
to turn away the wrath of God, which all were obliged to
endeavour. The principle was ordinary, (thô at the time he
had an extraordinary measure of it) being zealous for the
Lord, as all were obliged to be. The rule was ordinary, to
wit, the Command of slaying every man that was joined
to <hi>Baal-Peor vers.</hi> 5. only this was extraordinary, that the
zeal of God called him to this Heroical Action, thô he was

the true honour &amp; Glory of God to the affection of flesh &amp;
wicked Princes, as <hi>Mr Knox</hi> affirmeth in his conference
with <hi>Lithingtoun,</hi> rehearsed before <hi>Per.</hi> 3. Further, let it
be inquired, what makes it unimitable? Certainly it was
not so, because he had the motion &amp; direction of Gods
Spirit; for men have that to all duties. It was not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was raised &amp; stired up of God to do it, for God
may raise up Spirits to imitable actions. It was not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had an extraordinary Call, for men have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Call to imitable actions, as the Apostles had to
Preach. We grant these Actions are extraordinary &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable;
which, first, do deviate from the rule of com;
mon virtue, and transcend all rules of common reason &amp;
Divine Word; but this was not such, but an heroick Act
of zeal &amp; fortitude: Next these Actions, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to a Moral ordinary Command are unimitable, as
the <hi>Israelites</hi> robbing the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> borrowing &amp; not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again, <hi>Abrahams</hi> offering his son <hi>Isaac;</hi> but this was
not such: Next those Actions, which are done upon some
special Mandate of God, and are not within the compass
of ordinary obedience to the ordinary rule; are unimitable;
but this is not such: As also Miraculous Actions, and such
as are done by the extraordinary inspiration of the Spirit
of God, as <hi>Elias</hi> his killing the Captains with their fifties
by fire from Heaven; but none can reckon this among
these. See <hi>Ius populi</hi> at length discussing this point, and
pleading for the imitableness of this Action <hi>cap.</hi> 20. If
therefore the Lord did not only raise up this <hi>Phinehas</hi> to that

particular act of Justice, but also warrant &amp; accept him
therein &amp; reward him therefore, upon the account of his
zeal, when there was a Godly &amp; zealous Magistrate, able,
and whom we cannot without breach of charity presume,
but also willing to execute Justice, how much more may
it be pleaded, that the Lord, who is the same yesterday,
to day &amp; for ever, will not only pour out of that same
Spirit upon others, but also when He gives it, both allow
them, thô they be but private persons, &amp; also call them,
being otherwise in a Physical &amp; Probable Capacity, to do
these things in an extreamely necessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

state of the Church, to which in a more intire
condition He doth not call them? And particularly, when
there is not only the like or worse provocations, the like
necessity of execution of Justice &amp; of Reformation, for
the turning away of wrath &amp; removing of Judgments, that
was in <hi>Phinehas's</hi> case; but also, when the Supreme Civil
Magistrate, the <hi>Primores regni</hi> &amp; other inferiour Rulers,
are not only unwilling to do their duty, but so far corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
&amp; perverted, that they are become the Authors &amp;

brought a present unto <hi>Eglon,</hi> and put forth his left hand,
and took the dagger from his right thigh, and <hi>thrust it into
his belly Iudg.</hi> 3. 21. That this Action was approven will
not be doubted, since the Lord raised him up as a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer,
who by this Heroical Action commented it, and
since it was a Message from God. And that it was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
were ridiculous to deny, for sure this was not the
judicial Action of a Magistrate: Neither was <hi>Ehud</hi> a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate

an attempt upon this part of the holy Canon of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Whence we see, what inconveniences they are
driven to, that deny this principle of natural Justice the
Lawfulness of cutting off publick Enemies to procure the
Deliverance of the Lords people. Hence, if it be Lawful
for private persons, under subjection to and at peace with
the publick Enemies of the Lords people, to take all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to break their yoke, and deliver the oppressed
from their bondage, by killing their Oppressors; it must
be much more Lawful, for such as acknowledge no such

and to kill a thousand more of them <hi>vers.</hi> 11. &amp;c. These
were extraordinary Heroick facts, not only because they
flowed from an extraordinary power wherewith he was
endued, and from an extraordinary Motion &amp; Call, but
because of his avenging his oun private injuries for the
publick good, in a way both of fortitude &amp; prudence,
without a declared war, provoking the enemies against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and diverting from the people and converting against
himself all their fury, in which also he acted as a Type of
Christ; and also because he acted not as a Magistrate at
this time, for by whom was he called or counted a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate?
not by the <hi>Philistines,</hi> nor by the men of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
for they tell him that the <hi>Philistines,</hi> were their Lords,
and they bound him and delivered him up to them: Yet
in his private Capacity, in that extraordinary exigence, he
avenged himself and his Country against his publick ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
by a Clandestine war: which is imitable in the like
case, when a prevailing faction of Murdering enemies
domineer over &amp; destroy the people of God, and there is
no other way to be delivered from them: for his ground
was Moral, because they were publick enemis to whom
he might do as they did to him. Hence, If Saints sometimes
in cases of necessity may do unto their publick enemies as
they have done unto them, in prosecuting a war not declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against them; then much more may they do so in cases
of necessity, to deliver themselves from their Murdering
violence, when a war is declared: But here is an example
of the former: <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
               <p>6. When these same <hi>Philistims</hi> again invaded and overran
the Land in the time of <hi>Saul, Ionathan</hi> his son and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour-bearer
fell upon the Garrison of these uncircumcised,
and killed them 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 6, 13. This was an Heroick
Action, without publick Authority, for he told not his
father <hi>vers</hi> 1. And singular indeed, in respect of the effect,
and were a tempting of the Lord for so few to assault such
a multitude, as it were to imitate <hi>Sams<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n</hi> in his Exploits:
but in this respect, these Actions are only unimitable in
consideration of prudence, not of Conscience, or as to the
Lawfulness of the thing: their ground was Moral, to cut
off publick enemies. Hence, If it be Lawful to fall upon a
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:41139:351"/>
Garrison of publick enemies, oppressing the Country,
then it must be Lawful to fall upon one or two, that are
the Ring-leaders of publick Enemies, and main promoters
of their destruction, that are as pernicious, and have no
more right or power, than the <hi>Philistims:</hi> But such is the
Case of those about whom the question is.</p>
               <p>7. When <hi>David</hi> dwelt in the Country of the <hi>Philistims,</hi>
he and his men went up &amp; invaded the <hi>Gesharites</hi> and the
<hi>Gezrites</hi> and the <hi>Amalekites:</hi> And <hi>David</hi> smote the Land,
and left neither man nor woman alive 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 8, 9. This
was without publick Authority, having none from <hi>Saul,</hi>
none from <hi>Achish</hi> in whose Country he dwelt, and none
of his oun, being no Magistrate. We deny not the Divine
motion, but plead that it is imitable from its Moral ground,
which was that Command to cut off the <hi>Amalekites Exod.</hi>
17. and the <hi>Amorites</hi> whose relicts these Nations were;
the same Ground that <hi>Saul</hi> the Magistrate had to destroy
them. Whence it is Lawful sometimes for others than
Magistrates to do that which is incumbent to Magistrates,
when they neglect their duty. All I plead for from it, is, If
it be Lawful for private persons, upon the Call of God,
to cut off their publick enemies, when they are obliged by
the Command of God to destroy them, thô they be living
quietly &amp; peacably in the Country; then may it be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
in cases of necessity, for private persons, to cut off
their publick enemies, whom they are obliged by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of God to bring to condign punishment, and to
exstirpate them (as the Covenant obliges in reference to
Malignant Incendiaries) when they are ravening like

cases private persons may execute Judgement on Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
after the example of <hi>Elias</hi> here. Which fact <hi>Peter,

<pb n="677" facs="tcp:41139:351"/>
of God: for <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 20. <q>God decerned that the false
Prophet should die, and <hi>chap.</hi> 17. the same is said of
private men &amp; women, who would worship Idols:
But <hi>chap.</hi> 13. not only is death threatened against a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
Prophet, but a Command is added that no man
should spare his Brethren—thirdly it is Commanded,
that the whole City when it becometh Idolatrous, should
be cut off by fire, &amp; sword: And <hi>Levit.</hi> 24, 14—16. it
is Statute, that the Blasphemer should not live, to
which we may adde the Law or equity of <hi>Taliation;</hi> for

Servants of the Lord.</q> See <hi>Ius Pop. cap. 20. Pag.</hi> 425.
Upon this also <hi>Mr Mitchel</hi> defends his fact <hi>ubi supra</hi>—
<q>Also <hi>Elijah</hi> by virtue of that precept (<hi>Deut.</hi> 13) gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
to the people to destroy <hi>Baals</hi> priests, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the command of the seducing Magistrate, who
was not only remiss &amp; negligent in executing Justice, but
became a Protector &amp; defender of the Seducers, then &amp;
in that case I suppose the Christians duty not to be very
dark:</q>
               </p>
               <p>9. This Idolatrous &amp; Tyrannical house was afterwards
condignly punished by <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

destroyed all the Idolaters, who were before encouraged
&amp; protected by that Court <hi>chap.</hi> 10. 25. This extraordinary
fact was not justified by his Magistratical Authority: for
that was as extraordinary as the fact it self; and conferred
as a mean to accomplish the fact. He had no Authority by
the peoples suffrages, nor was he acknowledged as such by
the Court or body of the people, only the Lord gave it
extraordinarly. But it is not the imitation of his assumption
of Authority that is here pleaded for, but the imitation of
his fact in extraordinary cases, when not only Tyrants &amp;
Idolaters pass unpunished, but their insolency in Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Innocent is intolerable. <hi>Mr Knox</hi> vindicates this at
length <hi>ubi supra,</hi> and shewes that it had the ground of Gods
ordinary Judgement, which commands the Idolater to die
the death; And that thô we must not indeed follow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
examples, if the example repugn to the Law,
but where it agrees with and is the execution of the Law,
an example uncondemned stands for a Command, for
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:41139:352"/>
God is, constant and will not condemn in ages subsequent
what He hath approved in His Servants before. See the

               <p>10. When <hi>Athaliah,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> had Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized
six years, at length <hi>Iehojada</hi> with others made a
Conspiracie against her, to depose her and make <hi>Ioash</hi>
King: which when it was discovered, she cried <hi>Treason,
Treason,</hi> as indeed it would have been so if she had been
the Lawful Magistrate; for it was an attempt of Subjects
against her that had the possession of the Soveraign power.

11. 14—16. That this is imitable in the punishment of
Tyrants, is cleared above. If therefore it be Lawful for
Subjects to kill Usurping Tyrants, and such as follow them
to help them, under, whom nevertheless people might
have a life; then it must be Lawful for private persons to
put forth their hand against their Cut-throat Em<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Period</hi> 3. afterward <hi>Head</hi> 2. and <hi>Head</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>12. When <hi>Esther</hi> made suite to reverse <hi>Hamans</hi> Letters,
the King granted the <hi>Iewes</hi> in every City, not only to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
themselves together and to stand for their life, but also
to <hi>destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish,</hi> all the power of the
people and Province, that would assault them, both litle
Ones &amp; Women—and to avenge themselves on their
Enemies: And accordingly in the day that their enemies
hoped to have power over them, the <hi>Iewes</hi> gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to lay hand on such as sought their hurt, and smote all
their enemies with the stroke of the sword, <hi>Esther</hi> 8. 11,
13. <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 1—5. &amp;c. They had indeed that Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
fortified by the Kings accessory Authority, as <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>

                  </hi>
by his Edict granted the like Liberty, to resist any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
invader to depopulate the Lands of his Subjects, <hi>ut
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:41139:352"/>
digno ilico supplicio subjugetur ac mortem quam ininabatur accipiat</hi>—And
the like of <hi>Arcadius</hi> is extant <hi>in Codice Iustina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,
titulo, Quomodo liceat unicuique sine judice se vindicare vel
publicam devotionem.</hi> But that doth not exclude the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of such Resistences in case of necessity, without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
Authority: So here, it was not the Kings command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that made the <hi>Iewes</hi> avenging themselves Lawful, if
it had not been Lawful before &amp; without it; it gave them
only Liberty to improve that priviledge, which they had
from God and Nature. Surely their power of Resisting
did not depend on the Kings Commandment, as is proven
<hi>Head 5. Ergo</hi> neither their power of avenging themselves, to
prevent their Murder by their enemies: Which they could
and were obliged to do, if there had been no such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
<hi>Ergo</hi> it was not only suspended upon the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
And as for <hi>Hamans</hi> sons and adherents, being
<hi>Agagites,</hi> they were obliged by a Prior Command to avenge
themselves on them, on all occasions, by that Command
to destroy <hi>Amalek:</hi> Therefore it must be Lawful, even
without publick Authority, in some cases of necessity, to
prevent the Murder of publick Enemies, by laying hands
on them that seek the hurt of all the people of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secundly,</hi> There are some <hi>Precepts</hi> from which the same
may be concluded.</p>
               <p>1. There is a Command, and the first Penal Statute
against Murderers, we read <hi>Gen. 9. 6. Whoso sheddeth mans
blood by man shall his blood be shed.</hi> Here the Command is
given in general to punish Capitally all Murderers: but
there may be some that no Magistrate can punish, who
are not here exempted, to wit, they that are in Supreme
Authority and turn Murderers, as was said above. Again
the Command is given in general to <hi>Man,</hi> involving all the
Community (where the Murderer is) in guilt if his blood
be not shed: as we find in the Scripture, all the people
were threatened &amp; punished because Judgement was not
executed, and when it was executed even by these that
were no Magistrates, the Wrath of God was turned away,
Whereof there are many examples above. Further, if
the Command to shed the blood of Murderers be given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Institution of Magistracy, then in case of necessity
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:41139:353"/>
to stop the Course of Murderers, it may be obeyed. When
there is no Magistrate to execute it: But here it is given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Institution of Magistracy, when now there was
no Government in the world, but family-Government,
as <hi>Grotius</hi> on the place saith, <hi>Cum enim lex haec <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> When this Law was given
publick Judgement was not yet constitute, Therefore the
natural right &amp; Law of Taliation is here held forth, which
when mankind was increased and divided into several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
was justly permitted only to Judges, some cases ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
in which that primaeve right did remain. And if in
any, then in this case in question. Hence <hi>Lex Rex</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the <hi>P. Prelate</hi> essaying to prove that a Magi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>racy is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in the Text, denyes that <hi>Ba Adam, by man,</hi> must

                     </gap>
                  </hi> of the same mind, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
is not spoken of here. Though this Command af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
was given to the Magistrate <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 30. yet in a
ease of necessity, we must recur to the Original Command.</p>
               <p>2. This same Command of punishing Murdering Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
is even after the Institution of Magistrates, in several
cases not astricted to them, but permitted to the people,
yea enjoyned to them: As (1) Not only Magistrates,
but the people, are Commanded to avenge themselves on
their publick Enemies, as the <hi>Israelites,</hi> after their being
insnared in the matter of <hi>Peor;</hi> are Commanded to <hi>vexe the
Midianites &amp; smite them,</hi> because they beguiled them, and
brought a Plague upon them <hi>Numb</hi> 25. 17, 18 and <hi>Numb.</hi>
31. 2. to <hi>avenge themselves on them,</hi> and for this end to arme
themselves, and go against them, and <hi>avenge the Lord of
Midian:</hi> Which they executed with the slaughter of all the
males. So likewise are they Commanded to destroy <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek.</hi>
It is true these Commands are given primarly &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to Magistrates, as there to <hi>Moses,</hi> and afterwards
to <hi>Saul:</hi> yet afterwards we find, other than Magistrates
upon this Moral Ground, having the Call of God, did
execute Judgement upon them, as <hi>Gidion</hi> &amp; <hi>David,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:41139:353"/>
they were Magistrates, did avenge themselves and the
Lord upon them, as is before cleared. It is also true, that
there was some holy severity then to be extended against
particular Nations as such, peculiar to that Dispensation,
which is not pleaded as imitable: but the ground was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and the right of a peoples saving themselves by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of their enemies; when there is no other way for
it, is Natural. And this is all we plead for here. If
people may vexe their enemies, and avenge themselves
against them, even without publick Authority, when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared
by their Craftiness; Much more may they put a stop
to their insolency, by cutting off their principal &amp; most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Instruments, in case of necessity, when invaded
by their Cruelty: But here a people is Commanded to
vexe their enemies, and avenge themselves on them, and
accordingly <hi>Gideon</hi> &amp; <hi>David</hi> did so, without publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and that upon a ground which is Moral &amp; Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
<hi>Ergo</hi>—(2) The execution of the punishment of
Murderers is committed to the people: <hi>The revenger of blood
himself shall slay the Murderer, what he meeteth him he shall slay
him, Numb.</hi> 35. 19, 21. So that if he met him before he got
into any Refuge, he might Lawfully slay him, and if he
did flee to any, he was to be rendered up to the Avengers
hands <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 12. that the guilt of innocent blood may be
put away from <hi>Isra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l vers.</hi> 23. This revenger of blood was
not the Magistrate: for he was the party pursuing <hi>Numb.</hi>
35. 24. between whom and the Murderer the Congregation
was to judge: He was only the next in blood or kindred.
In the Original he is called <hi>Goel,</hi> the redeemer, or he to
whom the right of redemption belongs, and very properly
so called, both because he seeks redemption and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
for the blood of his Brother, and because he redeems
the Land from blood guiltiness, in which other-wise it
would be involved. I do not plead that this is alwayes to
be imitated, as neither it was alwayes practiced in <hi>Israel:</hi>
but If a private man, in a hot pursuit of his Brothers Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
might be his avenger, before he could be brought
to Judgement, then much more may this power be assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in a case of necessity, when there is no Judgement to
be expected by Law, and when not only our Brethren
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:41139:354"/>
have been murdered by them that profess a trade of it, but
others also and our selves are dayly in hazard of it, which
may be prevented in cutting them off. I do not see what
is here meerly <hi>Iudicial,</hi> so as to be rejected as <hi>Iudaical:</hi> for
sure Murderers must be slain now as well as then, and
there is the same hazard of their escaping now as then, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
involves the Land in guilt now as well as then, and in
this case of necessity especially, that Law that gives a man
right to preserve himself gives him also right to be his oun
avenger, if he cannot otherwise defend himself. (3)
Not only the execution, the decision of matters of life &amp;
death, is committed to them; as in the case of Blasphemie
&amp; Cursing, all that heard were to lay their hands upon his
head, and all the Congregation was to stone him <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.
14, 16. The man-slayer was to stand before the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
in Judgement, <hi>Then the Congregation shall judge between
the slayer and the avenger of blood Numb.</hi> 35. 12, 24. The
people claimed the power of life &amp; death, in seeking to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
Judgement upon those that had spoken Treason
against <hi>Saul, bring the men</hi> (say they) <hi>that we may put them to
death 1 Sam.</hi> 11. 12. Especially in the case of punishing
Tyrants, as they did with <hi>Amaziah.</hi> Certainly this is not
so <hi>Judicial</hi> or <hi>Judaical,</hi> as that in no case it may be imitated:
for, That can never be abrogated altogether which in many
cases is absolutely necessary; but that the people, without
publick Authority, should take the power of life &amp; death,
&amp; of puting a stop to the insolency of Destroyers by puting
them to death, is in many cases absolutely necessary; for
without this they cannot preserye themselves against Gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Tyrants, nor the fury of publick enemies or fire-brands
within themselves, in case they have no publick Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or none but such as are on their Destroyers side. (4)
Not only the power of purging the Land, by Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
is incumbent on the people, that it may not lye under
blood guiltiness; but also the power of Reforming the
Courts of Kings, by taking Course with their wicked
Abetters and evil Instruments, is committed to them,
with a promise that if this be done, it shall tend to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of their Throne: which is not only a supposition
in case it be done, but a supposed Precept to do it, with an
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:41139:354"/>
insinuation of the necessity &amp; expediency of it, that it is as
suitable as the taking away of the dross from silver, in order
to the production of a vessel <hi>Prov. 25. 4, 5. Take away the
wicked from before the King, and his throne shall be established in
Righteousness:</hi> Which is not only there given to Kings, for
then it would be in the second person spoken to them, but
to the people to do it <hi>before them;</hi> as the people did with <hi>Baals</hi>
Prophets from before <hi>Ahab.</hi> And Our Progenitors many
times have done with wicked Counsellors, as may be seen
in the foregoing Representation, and more fully in the His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
of the <hi>Dowglasses,</hi> and in <hi>Knox</hi> &amp; <hi>Calderwoods Histories.</hi>
Hence If it be duty to Reforme the Court, and to take
away a Kings wicked Sycophants Counsellors, Agents &amp;
Instigators to Tyrannie; Then it must be Lawful, in some
cases of necessity, to restrain their Insolency, &amp; repress
their Tyrannie, in executing Judgement upon such of
them, as are most unsupportable, who are made drunk
with the blood of Innocents: But the former is true: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore—(5)
For the Omission of the executing of this
Judgement on Oppressors &amp; Muderers, involving the
whole Land in blood guiltiness, which cannot be expiated
but by the blood of them that are so Criminal; Not only
Magistrates, but the whole people have been plagued: As
for <hi>Sauls</hi> murdering the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> the whole Land was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued,
until the man that consumed them, and devised
against them to destroy them, seven of his sons were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
unto them, to be <hi>hanged up before the Lord 2 Sam.</hi> 21.
5, 6. So also for the sins of <hi>Manasseh.</hi> The reason was,
because if the Magistrate would not execute Judgement,
the people should have done it: for not only to the King,
but also to his Servants, and to the people that entered in
by the gates, the Command is, <hi>Execute yee Iudgement, and
deliver the spoyled out of the hand of the Oppressor Jer.</hi> 22. 2, 3. thô
it be true, this is to be done by every one in their station,
<hi>salvâ justitia, salvo ordine, &amp; pro modulo vocationis,</hi> and it
chiefly belongs to Judges &amp; Magistrates: Yet this is no
wrong to Justice, nor breach of Order, nor sinful trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of peoples vocation, not only to hinder the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of innocent blood, to prevent Gods executing of what
He there threatens, but also to execute Judgement on the
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:41139:355"/>
Shedders, to prevent their progress in Murdering Villanie;
when Inferiour as well as Superiour Magistrates are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
&amp; Tyrannizing: Therefore this <hi>seeking</hi> &amp; <hi>doing</hi> &amp;
<hi>executing judgement</hi> is so often required of the people, in such
a Case, when Princes are rebellious &amp; Companions of
Thieves, and in the City where Judgement used to be,
now Murderers bear sway <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. 17, 21. the Lord is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased

<hi>If thy brother—or thy friend, which is as thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Idolatry, was not brought to the Judges, as common
Idolaters, and such who were entyced to serve other
gods &amp; worship them, were to be brought to the gates,
and to be stoned first by the hands of the Witnesses, and
afterwards by all the people <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 3, 5, 7. But this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Law: Of which the <hi>Iewish</hi> Antiquaries, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<hi>Grotius</hi> out of <hi>Philo</hi> and the <hi>Rabb. in Loc</hi> saith, <hi>Cum

crimes the guilty used to be kept after the sentence a night
&amp; a day, that if he could say any more for himself he
might, these were excepted from this benefit; And not
only so, but it was permitted to any to execute Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon them (<hi>viz.</hi> Entycers to Idolatry) without
waiting for a Judge: The like was used against the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious
Robbers of the Temple, and priests who
sacrificed when they were polluted, and those who curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:41139:355"/>
God by the Name of an Idol, and those who lay with
an Idolatress, chiefly those who denyed the divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Law: And this behoved to be before the
people, at least ten, which in Hebrew they called <hi>Hheda</hi>—Neither
is this to be admired in so grievous a Crime,
when even the manslayer without the place of refuge
might have been killed by the Kins-man of the defunct,</q>
And upon <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 30. the punishment of presumptuous

&amp;c.</hi> i. e. <q>But here these are to be understood thus, that
the guilty shall not be brought to the Judges, but be killed
by them that deprehended them in the Crime, as <hi>Phin. has</hi>
did to <hi>Zimri:</hi> and proves it out of <hi>Mamonides Pool. Synops.
Critic. in Loc.</hi>
                  </q> And it must be so: for in this case no mention
is made either of Judges, or Witnesses, or further Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
about it, than that he that was tempted by the Entycer
should fall upon him, and let the people know it, that
they might lay hands on him also; otherwise evil men
might pretend such a thing when it was not true. But in case
of a Cities Apostasie, and hearkening to Entycers, the
thing was only to be sollicitously enquired unto, and then
thô it was chiefly incumbent upon the Magistrate to punish
it, yet it was not astricted to him, but that the people
might do it without him. As upon this Moral Ground, was
<hi>Israels</hi> war stated against <hi>Benjamin Judg.</hi> 20. 13. when there
was no King nor Judge, and also when there were Kings
that turned Idolaters &amp; Tyrants, they served them so, as
here is Commanded: Witness <hi>Amaziah,</hi> as is shewed
above. Hence not only <hi>Moses,</hi> upon the peoples defection
into Idolatrie in the Wilderness, commanded all on the
Lords side, every man to put his sword by his side—and
<hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay every man his brother and every man his Companion and every
man his neighbour,</hi> whereby three thousand fell at that time
by the sword of the <hi>Levites Exod.</hi> 32. 27, 28. But also <hi>Joash,
Gideons</hi> father, upon the same Moral Ground, thô he was
no Magistrate, could say to the <hi>Abiezrites, Will ye plead for
Baal—he that will plead for him, let him be put to death while
it is yet morning—Judg.</hi> 6. 31. Moreover (as <hi>Mr Mitchel</hi>
adduces the example very pertinently, we see that the
people of <hi>Israel</hi> destroyed Idolatry, not only in <hi>Judah</hi>
                  <pb n="686" facs="tcp:41139:356"/>
wherein the King concurred, but in <hi>Ephraim</hi> and in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h,</hi>
where the King himself was an Idolater; and albeit
they were but private persons, without publick Authority:
for what all the people was bound to do by the Law of
God, every one was bound to do it to the uttermost of his
power &amp; Capacity. <hi>Mr Mitchel</hi> offers this place to vindicate
his fact of shooting at the prelate. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 9. Wherein
(sayes he) it is manifest, that the Idolater or intycer to
<q>Worship a false god, is to be put to death by the hand of
those whom he seeks to turn away from the Lord:
Which precept I humbly take to be Moral, and not
meerly <hi>Iudicial,</hi> and that it is not at all <hi>Ceremonial</hi> or <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical.</hi>
And as every Moral precept is Universal, as to
the extent of place, so also as to the extent of Time, &amp;
persons.</q> The chief thing <hi>Objected</hi> here is, that this is a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial</hi>
precept, peculiarly suited to the Old Dispensation;
which to plead for as a Rule under the New Testament,
would favour of <hi>Jewish</hi> rigidity inconsistent with a Gospel
Spirit. <hi>Ans.</hi> How <hi>Mr Knox</hi> refells this, and clears that the
Command here is given to all the people, needs not be
here repeated; but it were sufficient to read it in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Representation <hi>Period. 3. Pag.</hi> 30. as it is also cited by
<hi>Ius Pop. Pag.</hi> 212. &amp;c. But these General Truths may
be added, concerning the <hi>Iudicial Laws.</hi> 1. None can say
that none of the <hi>Judicial</hi> Laws, concerning political Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
is to be observed in the New Testament: for
then many special Rules of Natural &amp; Necessary equity
would be rejected, which are contained in the Judicial
Laws of God: Yea all the Laws of equity in the World
would be so cast; for none can be instanced, which may
not be reduced to some of the Judicial Laws: And if
any of them are to be observed, certainly these Penal Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
so necessary for the preservation of Policies, must
be binding. 2. If we take not our measures from the
Judicial Laws of God, we shall have no Laws for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of any Malefactors by death, <hi>juris Divini,</hi> in the
New Testament. And so all Capital punishments must be
only humane Constitutions; and consequently they must be
all <hi>Murders:</hi> for to take away the life of man, except for
such Causes as the Lord of our life (to whose Arbitriment it
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:41139:356"/>
is only subject) hath not approven, is Murder, as <hi>Dr
Ames</hi> saith <hi>de homocidio Conscience. Lib. 5. cap. 31. quest.</hi> 2.
For in the New Testament, thô in the general the power
of punishing is given to the Magistrate, yet it is no where
determined, neither what, nor how Crimes are to be
punished. If therefore Penal Laws must be taken from
the Old Testament; the Subject of executing them, as well
as the Object, must be thence deduced, that is, what is
there astricted to the Magistrate must be so still, and what is
permitted to the people must remain in like manner their
Priviledge; since it is certain, the New Testament-Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
is not more restricted as to Penal Laws than the Old.
3. Those Judicial Laws, which had either somewhat <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical,</hi>
or <hi>Paedagogical,</hi> or peculiar to the then <hi>Iudacial</hi> State,
are indeed not binding to us under that formality; thô even
these Doctrinally are very useful, in so far as in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
nature, of equity of proportion, they exhibite to us
some Documents of Duty: But those Penal Judgements,
which in the matter of them are appended to the Moral
Law, and are in effect but accurate determinations &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations
of the Law of Nature, which may suit our
Circumstances as well as the <hi>Jewes,</hi> do oblige us as well as
them. And such are these Penal Statutes I adduce; for,
that Blasphemy, Murder, &amp; Idolatry, are heinous Crimes,
and that they are to be punished, the Law of Nature
dictates; and how, and by whom, in several cases, they
are to be punished, the Law <hi>judicial</hi> determines. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Moral equity even of the strictest of them,
<hi>Amesius de Conscienc. lib. 5. de Mosaicis appendicibus praecepto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
doth very learnedly assert their binding force. 4. Those
Judicial Laws, which are but <hi>Positive</hi> in their forme, yet if
their special internal &amp; proper Reason &amp; Ground be Moral,
which pertains to all Nations, which is necessary &amp; useful
to Mankind, which is rooted in and may be fortified by
humane reason, and as to the substance of them approven
by the more intelligent Heathens; those are Moral, and
oblige all <hi>Christians</hi> as well as <hi>Jewes:</hi> And such are these
Laws of punishing Idolaters &amp;c. founded upon Moral
grounds, pertaining to all Nations necessary &amp; useful to
Mankind, rooted in &amp; fortified by humane Reason, to wit,
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:41139:357"/>
that the Wrath of God may be averted, and that all may
hear &amp; fear and do no more so wickedly; especially if
this Reason be superadded, when the case is such, that
innocent &amp; honest people cannot be preserved, if such
wicked persons be not taken order with. 5. Those Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Laws, which being given by the Lords immediate
Authority, thô not so solemnly as the Moral Decalogue,
are neither as to their end <hi>Mortuae,</hi> dead, nor as to their
use <hi>Mortiferae,</hi> deadly, nor as to their nature, <hi>Indifferent,</hi>
nor in any peculiar respect restringible only to the <hi>Jewes,</hi>
but the transgressions whereof both by omission &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
are still sins, and were never abolished neither
Formally nor Consequentially in the New Testament,
must be Moral: But such as these <hi>Penal Laws</hi> I am speaking
of, They cannot be reputed among the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Laws,
dead as to their end, and deadly as to their use, or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in their nature: for sure, to punish the Innocent upon
the account of these Crimes, were still sin, now as well
as under the Old Testament; and not to punish the Guilty,
were likewise sin now as well as then. If then the matter
be Moral and not abolished, the execution of it by private
persons, in some cases when there is no access to publick
Authority, must be Lawful also. Or if it be Indifferent,
that which is in its oun nature Indifferent, cannot be in a
case of extreame necessity unlawful, when otherwise the
destruction of our selves &amp; Brethren is in all humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
inevitable. That which God hath once Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and never expressly Forbidden, cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
in extraordinary cases, but such are these precepts
we speak of: Therefore they cannot be in every case un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.
Concerning this case of the obligation of Judicial
Laws, <hi>Ames. de Conscienc. lib. 5. cap. 1. quest.</hi> 9. 6. Those
Laws which are predicted to be observed &amp; executed in the
New Testament times, cannot be <hi>Judicial</hi> or <hi>Judaical,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricted
to the Old: But such is this. In the day, that a
<hi>fountain shall be opened for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> house of David for sin &amp; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaness;</hi>
which clearly points at Gospel-times, It is said,
<hi>the Lord will cause the Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts and the unclean Spirits to pass
out of the Land: And it shall come to pass. that when any shall
yet Prophesie, then his father &amp; his mother that begat him shall say
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:41139:357"/>
unto him, thow shalt not live—and shall thrust him through when
he Prophesieth Zech.</hi> 13. 3. Which cannot be meant of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
penetration of the heart: for it is said, he shall not
live; and the wounds of such as might escape, by resistence
or flight, are visible in his hands <hi>vers</hi> 6. It is therefore to
be understood of Corporal killing Intycers to Idolatrie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 9. either by delivering them
up to the Judges, as <hi>Piscator</hi> on the place sayes; Or as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
saith, <hi>transfodient ut Phineas Zimri Numb. 25. hoc intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
de Pseudo-propheta populum volente abducere ad cultum falso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
deorum; nam in tales quemvis Iudaeum Lex armabat, Deut.</hi> 13.
<hi>quae Lex expresse addit, in tali crimine nec filio parcendum.</hi> From
all which I conclude, If people are to bring to condign
punishment Idolatrous Apostates, seeking to intyce them;
Then may oppressed people, dayly in hazard of the death
of their Souls by Complyance; or of their bodys by their
Constancy in Duty, put forth their hand to execute Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in case of necessity, upon Idolatrous Apostates &amp;
Incendiaries, and the principal Murdering Emissaries of
Tyrants, that seek to destroy people, or enforce them to
the same Apostasie: But the former is true: Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. The same may be inferred from that Command of
Rescuing &amp; Delivering our Brother, when in hazard of his
life; for omitting which duty. no pretence even of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
will excuse us <hi>Prov. 24. 11, 12. If thow forbear to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them that are drawen unto death, and those that are ready to be
slain, if thow sayest, behold we knew it not; doth not He that
pondereth the heart consider it? and He that keepeth thy Soul doth
not He know it, and shall not He render to every man according to
his works? eripe</hi> h. e. <hi>ex manu invasoris, latronis, injusti Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistratus
&amp;c. idque vel manu, vel lingua defendente, vel quovis alio
modo licito: Solent homines multas excusationes nectere, se nescire
illius vel periculum, vel innocentiam, non tanta authoritate valere
ut eum liberent, rerum suarum satagere, alienis nolle se ingerere &amp;c.
hic unam excusationem reliquas omnes complectentem exempli causâ
proponit, &amp; refellit:</hi> as Commentators say, <hi>Pool Synops.
Critic. in locum.</hi> This precept is indefinitely given to all:
Principally indeed belonging to righteous Magistrates; But
in case of their omission, And if instead of detending them
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:41139:358"/>
they be the persons that draw or send out their destroying
Emissaries to draw them to death, then the precept is no
more to be restricted to them, than that <hi>vers</hi> 2. not to be
envious against evil men, or that <hi>vers 10. If thow faint in
the day of Adversity thy strength is small,</hi> can be said to be spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
only to Magistrates. Hence, If it be a Duty to Rescue
our Brethren from any prevailing power that would take
their lives unjustly, and no pretence even of ignorance
will excuse the forbearance of it; Then it must be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
in some extraordinary cases, to prevent the Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
violence of publick Incendiaries, by killing them rather
than to suffer our selves or our Brethren to be killed, when
there is no other way in probability either of saving our
selves or Rescuing them: But here the former is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
as a duty: Therefore the Later also must be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when the duty cannot otherwise be discharged.</p>
               <p>Now having thus at some length endeavoured to discuss
this some way odd &amp; esteemed odious Head: to which
Task I have been as unwillingly drawn, as the Actors here
pleaded for were driven to the occasion thereof; whom
only the necessity of danger did force to such Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to preserve their oun and Brethrens lives, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
the Cause; and nothing but the necessity of duty,
did force me to this Undertaking, to defend their Name
from Reproach, and the Cause from Calumnies. I shall
Conclude with a humble Protestation, that what I have
said be not stretched further than my obvious &amp; declared
Design doth aim at: which is not to press a practice from
these precedents, but to vindicate a Scripture Truth from
invidious or ignorant Obloquies; and not to specify what
may or must be done in such Cases hereafter, but to justify
what hath been done in such Circumstances before.
Wherein I acknowledge, that thô the Truth be certain,
such things may be done, yet the duty is most difficult to
be done with Approbation. Such is the fury of corrupt
passion, far more fierce in all than the pure zeal of God is
to be found fervent in any, that too much Caution, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
&amp; Fear, can scarce be adhibite, in a Subject
wherein even the most warrantable provocation of holy
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:41139:358"/>
zeal is ordinarly attended with such a concurrence of Self-interest
and other carnal Tentations, as it is impossible
without the signal Assistance of special Grace to have its
exercise in any notable Measure or Manner, without the
Mixture of sinful allay, as the <hi>True Non-conformist</hi> doth
truly observe <hi>ubi supra Pag.</hi> 391. Yet this Doctrine, thô in
its defined and uncautioned Latitude be obnoxious to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
abuses (as all Doctrines may be abused by mens
corruption, or ignorance; misapplying the same) is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
built upon such Foundations, that Religion will
oune to be firme, and Reason will ratify their force. And
I hope it is here so circumscribed with Scripture-boundari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and restricted in the narrow Circumstantiation of the
Case, that as the Ungodly cannot captate advantage from
it, to encourage themselves in their Murdering villanies,
seeing they never were, never can be so Circumstantiate,
as the Exigence here defined requires; So as for the Godly,
I may presume upon their tenderness, and the Conduct of
that Spirit that is promised to lead them, and the zeal they
have for the honour of Holiness, with which all real
Cruelty is inconsistent, to promise in their Name, that if
their Enemies will repent of their wickedness, and so far
at least Reforme themselves as to surcease from their cruel
Murdering violence, in persecuting them to the death,
and devouring them as a prey; then they shall not need to
fear from them the danger of this Doctrine, but as saith the
proverb of the Ancients, <hi>Wickedness proceedeth from the
Wicked but their hand shall not be upon them.</hi> But if they shall still
proceed to Murder the Innocent, they must understand,
they that hold this Truth in <hi>Theorie,</hi> will also reduce it to
<hi>practice.</hi> And bloody Papists must know, that Christians
now are more Men, than either stupidly to surrender their
throats to their Murdering swords, or supinely to suffer
their villanie to pass unpunished; and thô their favours
have flattered many, and their sury hath forced others,
into a faint succumbing &amp; superceding from all Action
against them; Yet all are not asleep: and I hope there are
some, who will never enter in any terms of peace with
them, against whom the Mediator hath declared and will
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:41139:359"/>
prosecute a war for ever, but will still oune &amp; aim at this,
as the highest pitch of their ambition, to be found among
His chosen, called, &amp; faithful ones, who maintain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
opposition against them. However, thô the Lord
seems in His providence, to put a bar upon all publick
Appearances under a display of open war against them;
and it is not the design of what is said here on this and the
foregoing Head, to incite or invite to any: Yet Certainly,
even at this present, all that have the zeal of God and love
to His righteous Cause rightly stated in their hearts, will
find themselves called not to supercede altogether from all
Actions, of avowed and even violent opposition against
them, whom we are all bound both by the Morality of the
duty, and the Formality of Solemn &amp; Sacred Covenants,
to hold out from a violent intrusion into and peaceable
possession of this Land devoted to God, and to put them
out when they are got in either by their fraud or force; And
this plea, now brought to an end, will oblige all the Loyal
Lovers of Christ, to an Endeavour of these. 1. To take
Alarms, and to be fore-warned and fore-armed, reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
&amp; ready to withstand the invasion of <hi>Poperie;</hi> that it
be neither established by Law, through the supineness of
such, who should stand in the Gap, and resolve rather to
be sacrificed in the spot, by a valiant resisting, than see
such an Abomination set up again; Nor introduced by this
Liberty, through the wyles of such, whose chiefest prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of policy is perfidie, who design by this wide Gate,
and in the womb of the <hi>wooden horse</hi> of this Toleration, to
bring it in peaceably; Nor intruded by force &amp; fury, fire &amp;
sword, if they shall fall upon their old game of Murders &amp;
Massacres. It concerns all to be upon their Guard, and
not only to <hi>come out of Babylon,</hi> but to be making ready to
go against it, when the Lord shall give the Call. 2. To
resist the beginings of their Invasions, before they be past
remeady: And for this effect, to oppose their gradual
erections of their Idolatrous Monuments, and not suffer
them to set up the Idol of the <hi>Mass,</hi> in City or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
without attempting, if they have any force, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the same. 3. In the mean time, to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:41139:359"/>
and the Gospel, against all their Assaults, and
to Rescue any out of their hands upon all occasions,
that for the Cause of Christ they have caught as a
prey, &amp; to oppose &amp; prevent their oun &amp; the Nations
ruine &amp; slaverie.</p>
               <p>But to Conclude: As it will be now expected, in Justice
&amp; Charity, that all the Vassals &amp; Votaries; Subjects and
Servants, of the One Common Lord &amp; King, Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
every where through out His Dominions, who may
see this Representation of the case and Vindication of the
cause of a poor wasted &amp; wounded, persecuted &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
Remnant of the now declining, sometimes
Renouned, Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> will be so far from stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Esaw</hi>-like on the other side; either as <hi>Enemies,</hi> rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to look on their Affliction in the day of their Calamity;
or as <hi>Neutral,</hi> unconcerned with their distressed Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
or as <hi>Strangers,</hi> without the knowledge or sense of
their Sorrowes &amp; Difficulties; Or as <hi>Gallio's</hi> caring for none
of these things, or thinking their case not worthy of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
or their cause of Consideration, or possibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
their Sufferings, as at best but Stated upon slender,
subtile, &amp; nice Points, that are odd &amp; odious, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously
represented: It is now expected, I say, that Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
not possessed with Prejudice (which is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for any that bear that Holy &amp; honourable Signature)
and not willing to be imposed upon by Misinformations,
will be so far from that Unchristian temper towards them,
as to be easily byassed with all Reports &amp; Reproaches to their
disadvantage, that if they weigh what is in this Treatise of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
and truly I may say candidely Represented, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any design of prevarication, or painting, or daubing,
to make the Matter either better or worse than it will seem
to any impartial Observer; they will admit &amp; intertain a
more charitable Construction of them, and not deny them
Brotherly Sympathie and Christian Compassion, nor be
wanting in the duty of Prayer &amp; Suppltcation for them,
that at length the Lord would turn His hand upon the litle
Ones, and bring at least a thrid Part, a Remnant of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
through the fire. So to that litle Flock, the poor
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:41139:360"/>
of the Flock, that wait upon the Lord, and desire to keep
His way; I shall only say, Though I judged Necessity was
laid upon me, in stead of a better, to essay this Vindication
of your cause: as stated betwixt yow and your, and your
Lords Enemies, the men that now ride over your heads,
that say to your Soul, <hi>bow doun that we may go over yow,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
not that yow should, yea I obtest that yow may not,
lay any Stress on the strength of what I have said; but let
its weight lie where it must be laid, on that firm Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that will bear yow and it both, that Stone, that tried
Stone, that Precious Corner Stone, that sure Foundation,
Christ Jesus: And search the Scriptures of Truth, to see
whether these things be so or not: And I doubt not, but
by that Touchstone if these Precious Truths be tried, they
will be found neither hay nor stubble, that cannot abide the
fire, but as silver tried in a furnace of earth purified seven
times. Do not offend, that they are contemned as small,
and contradicted as odious, but look to the importance of
His Glory, whose Truths &amp; Concerns they are, and from
Whom they are seeking to draw or drive yow, who oppose
and oppugu these Truths. Stand fast therefore in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
where with Christ hath made yow free, and hold fast
every Word of His patience, that yow may be kept in this
hour of tentation. Let no man take your Crown, or pull
yow doun from your excellency, which is alwayes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of your wicked Enemies, in all their several shapes &amp;
shewes, both of force &amp; fraud, craft &amp; cruelty. Beware
of their snares, and of their tender Mercies, for they are
cruel; and when they speak fair beleeve them not, for there
are seven abominations in their hearts. Say ye not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy,
to all them to whom this people shall say a
Confederacy, neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraied;
Sanctify the Lord of Hosts Himself, and let Him be your
fear, and let Him be your dread, And He shall be for a
Sanctuary, but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of
offence, to both the houses of <hi>Israel,</hi> for a gin &amp; for a snare
to the Inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Wait upon the Lord, who
hideth His face from the House of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and look for Him,
among His Children, though now yow be reputed for signs
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:41139:360"/>
&amp; wonders in <hi>Israel,</hi> from the Lord of Hosts Which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in Mount <hi>Zion.</hi> Who knowes, but therefore will the
Lord wait, that He may be Gracious unto yow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will He be exalted that He may have Mercy upon
yow, for the Lord is a God of Judgement, Blessed are
all they that wait for Him. To Whom be all the Glory.</p>

               <p>IT will possibly seem impertinent, or at least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous
at such a time, when the pressure of these
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urdens is not more pinching to the Generality of
professing people, and in such a retrograde order, as
after the discussion of the foregoing Heads, to subjoyne
any disquisition of these Questions, which are now out
of date and doors with many. But considering that
the Impositions of these Burdens are still pressing to
some and the difficulties of doubts &amp; disputes about
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:41139:362"/>
them still pusling, the sin &amp; scandal of complying with them
still lying upon the Land, not confessed nor forsaken, the
leaven of such Doctrine as daubs &amp; defends the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
still intertained, the Sufferings of the Faithful for
refusing them, still contemned &amp; condemned, and the
fears &amp; expectations of more snares of that nature, after
this fair weather is over, still encreasing, if I may be so
happy as to escape impertinencies in the manner of manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this disquisition, I fear not the Censure of the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
or needlessness of this Essay. As to the order of it, it
was intended to have been put in its proper place among
the <hi>Negative</hi> Heads of Sufferings: But knowing of how
litle worth or weight any thing that I can say is with the
prejudged, and having a Paper writ by two famous Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of Christ against the Defections of their day, <hi>Mr. Mc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>Ward
&amp; Mr. Broun,</hi> more fully &amp; largely detecting the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of the Cess (from which the wickedness of other
exactions also may be clearly deduced) thô at such distance
at the writing of the foregoing Heads, that it could not be
had in readiness to take its due place, and time would not
allow the suspending other things until this should come to
hand; I thought it needful, rather than to omit it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
to insert it here. However, thô neither the form
of it, being by way of <hi>Letter,</hi> nor the method adapted to the
design of a moving disswasion, nor the length &amp; prolixitie
thereof, will suffer it to be here transcribed as it is; yet to
discover what were their sentiments of these things, and
what was the Doctrine Preached and Homologated by the
most faithful both Ministers and Professors of Scotland,
eight or nine years since, how closely continued in by the
Contendings of this Reproached Remnant, still persecuted
for these things, and how clearly abandoned &amp; resiled from,
by their Complying Brethren now at Ease, I shall give a
short Transumpt &amp; Compend of their Reasonings; in a
method subservient to my Scope and with Additions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for applying their Arguments against the other
Exactions here adduced in this Head, and bringing them
also under the dint of them, thô not touched by them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly.
I must put altogether, because it would dilate the
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:41139:362"/>
Treatise already excressed into a bigness, far beyond the
boundaries I designed for it, to handle them distinctly; and
their affinity, both as to their fountain, nature, &amp; ends,
is such, that what will condemn one of them will condemn
all. What and how many &amp; manifold have been the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
Exactions, as the fruits &amp; soments of this crwel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
that the Godly in our Land, have been groaning
under these 27 years, and upon what occasions they have
been at diverse times, and in diverse manners &amp; measurs
imposed, I need not here relate, the first part of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
doth represent it. The first of these Tyrannical Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,
were the <hi>Fynes</hi> for not hearing the Curats, and other
parts of Non-conformity; which, together with paying the
Curats stipends, were too universally at first complyed
with: But afterwards upon more mature consideration and
after clearer discoveries of the Imposers projects &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,
they were scrupled &amp; refused by the more tender.
And their Sufferings, upon the account of that Recusancy,
have been very great &amp; grievous, to the utter impoverish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; depopulation of many Families, besides the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Sufferings of many in long Imprisonments, which
some chose rather to sustain with patience, than pay the
least of those Exactions. Yea, some when ordered to be
legally liberate, and set forth out of Prison, choosed rather
to be detained still in bondage, than to pay the <hi>Iaylour-fees,</hi>
their Keepers demanded of them. Many other wicked Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
have been pressed &amp; prosecuted, with great rigor
&amp; rage, as <hi>Malitia-money,</hi> and <hi>Locality,</hi> for furnishing
Souldiers, listed under a banner displayed against Religion
&amp; Liberty, with necessary provision, in and for their wicked
service; which of late years have been contended against
by the Sufferings of many, and daylie growing a Tryal to
moe. But the most impudently insolent of all these Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
and that which plainly paraphrases, openly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
&amp; explains all the rest, calculate for the same ends,
was by that wicked Act of Covention, enacted Anno 1678.
Declaring very plainly its ends, to levy &amp; maintain forces
for suppressing Meetings, and to shew unanimous affection
for maintaining the Kings Supremacy established by Law.
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:41139:363"/>
Or as they represent it in their Act, for continuation of it,
<hi>Act. 3. Parl. 3. Char. 2. August</hi> 20. 1681. <q>Seeing the
Convention of Estates holden at Edinburgh in the moneth
of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1678 upon weighty Considerations therein speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and particularly the great danger the Kingdom was
under, by seditious &amp; rebellious <hi>Conventicles,</hi> and the
necessity which then appeared, to encrease the forces,
for securing the Government, and suppressing these <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Commotions,</hi> which were fomented by <hi>seditious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
&amp; practices,</hi> did therefore humbly &amp; dutifully offer a
chearful &amp; unanimous Supplie of 800000 pound Scots—in
the space of five years—And the Estates of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
now conveened, having taken to consideration,
how the dangers from the forsaids Causes do much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
in so far as such as are seditiously &amp; rebelliously
enclined, do still propogate their pernicious principles,
and go on from one degree of rebellion to another, till
now at last the horrid villanies of murther, assassination,
&amp; avowed rebellion, are ouned, not only as things <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
but as obligations from their Religion—Do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in a due sense of their duty of God, to their Sacred
Soveraign, and the preservation of themselves and their
posterity, of new make an humble, unanimous, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
&amp; heartly offer, for themselves, and in name of,
and as representing this his Maj. ancient Kingdom, of a
continuation of the foresaid Supply, granted by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of Estates; And that for the space of five years
or ten terms successive, begining the first Terms pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at Martin-mas 1683. which yet is to be continued
until Martin-mas 1688.</q> Here is a Sample of their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Demands, shewing the nature, quality, &amp; tendency
of all of them: Wherein we may note. 1. That they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it upon the same Considerations, upon which it was
first granted. 2. That these were, &amp; yet remain to be, the
danger of the Meetings of the Lords people for Gospel
Ordinances, by them forced into the Fields, which they
call <hi>Rebellious Conventicles;</hi> and the necessity of securing their
Usurpation upon the Prerogatives os Christ, Liberties of
His Church, and Priviledges of Mankind (which they call
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:41139:363"/>
their Government) and suppressing the Testimonies for the
Interest of Christ (called by them <hi>Rebellious Commotions.</hi>)
3. That their motive of continuing it, was their Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of some weak Remainders of former zeal for God,
in prosecuting the Testimony for the Interests of Christ,
and Principles of the Covenanted Reformatton (which
they call <hi>propogating pernicious Principles</hi>) and some weak at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to oppose &amp; resist their Rebellion against God, and
vindicate the Work, &amp; defend the people of God, from
the destruction they intended against them, and their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
&amp; obliged endeavours to bring the Destroyers &amp; Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
to condign punishment (which they call <hi>horrid vil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Murder, Assassination, &amp; av<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wed Rebellion.</hi>) Here all
the Active Appearances of the Lords people, vindicated in
the foregoing Heads, are industriously Represented, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these odious &amp; invidious Names, as motives to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
this Supplie of means to suppress them, and to involve
all the Contributers in the guilt of condemning them.
4. That as a Test of their Allegiance unto, &amp; Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>acy
with that Execrable Tyrant (which they call <hi>their duty to
their Sacred Soveraign</hi>) they enact this as Representatives of
the Kingdom, and must be ouned as such by all the payers.
5. That it is the same Cess, that was granted by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of Estates,</hi> and the Terme of its continuation is not
yet expired. And hence it is manifest, that that Act of
Convention, thô its first date be expired, and thereupon
many plead for the Lawfulness of paying it now, that
formerly scrupled at and witnessed against it, yet is only
renewed, revived, &amp; corroberated, and the Exaction
continued upon no other basis or bottom but the first State
Constitution. Which was, &amp; remains to be a Consumating
&amp; Crimson wickedness, the cry whereof reaches Heaven:
Since upon the matter it was the setting of a day, betwixt
&amp; which (exceeding the <hi>Gadarens</hi> wickedness, &amp; short of
their Civility) they did not beseech Christ &amp; His Gospel to
be gone out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but with armed violence declared,
they would with the strong hand drive Him out of His pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session;
in order to which their Legions are levied, with
a professed Declaration, that having exauctorate the Lords
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:41139:364"/>
Anointed by Law, and cloathed the Usurper with the
spoils of His Honour, they will by force maintain what they
have done, and having taken to themselves the House of
God in possession, they will sacrifice the Lives, Liberties,
&amp; fortunes of all in the Nation, to secure themselves in the
peaceable possession of what they have robbed God; And
that there shall not be a Soul left in the Nation, who shall
not be slain, shut up, or sold as slaves, who will oune
Christ and His Interest. All which they could not, nor
cannot accomplish, without the subsidiary Contribution of
the peoples help. This is the plain sense of the Act for the
<hi>Cess;</hi> and, thô not expressed, the tacite &amp; uniforme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of all the rest. Yet for as monstrous and manifest
the wickedness of these designs are, so judicially were the
bulk of our Seers plagued with blindness, that many of
them were left to plead for the payment of these Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
others, thô they durst not for a world do it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to be silent, and by their silence to encourage &amp;
embolden many to such a Complyance; presuming with
themselves, and without furrher enquirie, that the zeal
of God, and love to His Glory, and the Souls of their
Brethren, would constrain them to speak in so clamant a
case, if they did observe any sin in it. Whereby the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality
was involved in the guilt of these things, especially
deceived by the patrociny &amp; pleadings of such of late, who
formerly witnessed against it. O that it might be given to us
to remember Lots wife, turned into a Pillar of Salt, to
season us lest the stink of our Destruction, and what may
follow upon it, be all that the posterity get for a warning
not to tread our paths. As for the few that have suffered
upon this Head, they have been so discruciated with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
in their Conflicts with the rage of Enemies, and
reproach of Friends, and fear of these snares attending
every lot or occupation they could put themselves in, that
they have been made to desire death, as their best refuge, and
only retreat wherein they may find rest from all these rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
For in no place could they escape the reach of some of
these Impositions, nor the noise of their clamarous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendings
of Arguments that pleaded for it. But some have
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:41139:364"/>
had more Love to Christ and His Interests, than language
to plead for Him, and more resolution to suffer than
learning to dispute for His Cause; And where pure zeal for
Christ, and love to His bleeding Interests, in a time when
He is crucified afresh, and put to open shame, and the
Concurrence of all is required to help forward the War
against Him, is in integrity &amp; vigor, it will burn with its
flame those knots that it cannot in hast loose; And chuse
rather to lie under the imputation of being zealous without
knowledge, than lose or let go such an opportunity of
witnessing a good Confession; yea when it could do no
more, expire with an Ichabod in its mouth.</p>
               <p>But shortly to come to the point. I shall 1. Permit some
<hi>Concessions.</hi> 2. Propose some paralel <hi>Questions.</hi> 3. Offer some
<hi>Reasons</hi> to clear it.</p>
               <p>1. I shall willingly grant in the General, concerning
paying of Exactions, Impositions, or Emoluments.</p>
               <p>1. They are to be paid to these to whom they are <hi>due:</hi>
As <hi>Tribute &amp; Custom</hi> is to be paid to the Powers ordained of
God, and <hi>for this Cause that they are Gods Ministers attending
continually upon this very thing Rom.</hi> 13. 6, 7. So Stipends and
all outward Encouragments are due to Ministers of the
Gospel, who sow Spiritual things and should <hi>reap these
carnal things 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 11, 12. Fynes also, and all legal
Amercements for Delinquencies against just Laws, must
be payed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 19. And whatsoever is due by Law to
Officers, appointed by Law for keeping Delinquents in
Custody: As all Debts whatsoever. But Tyrants Exactions,
enacted &amp; exacted for promoving their wicked designs
against Religion &amp; Liberty; Hirelings Salaries, for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
them in their intrusions upon the Church of God;
Arbitrary Impositions of pecuniary punishments for clear
Duties; And extorted hirings, of the subordinate instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Persecuters oppressions, are no wise due and
cannot be debt, and therefore no equity to pay them.</p>
               <p>2. Its Lawful to pay them, when due and debt either by
Law or Contract, even thô they should be afterward <hi>abused</hi>
and misimproven to pernicious ends. But these payments
for such wicked ends, either particularly specified &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:41139:365"/>
in the very Act appointing them, or openly avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Exactors are of another nature, than Impositions
fundamentally appointed for the publick good; and the
after misapplication thereof, made by such as are entrusted
therewith, is no more imputable unto the Land or Payers,
than is the theft of a Collector stealing or running away
with the same without making Count or reckoning to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.
It is then a foolish thing to say, that former Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
were peacably payed, thô we saw and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that their use was perverted, and they were used
against the good of the Land and Gods people. For no such
thing was laid doun as the ground, or declared as the end,
of these exactions; but what fell out was by the personal
abuse and perversion of those in power; which was rheir
oun personal fault, and posteriour to the legal engagment
and submission to the payment thereof by the Land in their
Representatives.</p>
               <p>3. Its Lawful to pay them sometimes, even when fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally
and <hi>Originally</hi> from the first Constitution of them
they were not due, but <hi>Illegally</hi> or Usurpatively challenged
&amp; exacted, if afterwards they were by dedition or volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
engagment legally submitted unto by the true Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives.
But not so, when they were never either
Lawfully enacted, or legally exacted, or voluntarly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
by the Representatives, except such as represented
the enslavement of the Nation, and betrayed the Country,
Religion, Liberty, Property, and all precious Interests,
and declaredly imposed to further the destruction of all.
Nor can any with reason say, that this Case is but like the
Case of the people of <hi>Israel</hi> under the feet of Enemies,
paying to them of the fruits of their Ground, as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated
&amp; lamented by <hi>Nehemiah</hi> Chap. 9. 36, 37. For so they
must say, the Exactions now in debate are their <hi>Redemption-money,</hi>
and by these they purchase their Liberty of Life &amp;
Lands, and oune themselues to be a people under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.
And yet they cannot deny, but they are both exacted
&amp; payed as Tests of their Allegiance as Subjects, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dges
of their Loyaltie &amp; Obedience. But this is answered
before <hi>Head 2. Conces.</hi> 7. §. 2. <hi>Pag.</hi> If any should object the
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:41139:365"/>
practice of Christ, thô otherwise free, yet paying Custom
lest He should offend: It is fully solved <hi>ibid. Head 2. Conces.</hi> 9.
<hi>Pag.</hi> Here its sufficient to hint (1) That which made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hem
marvel at His wise Answer was, that He left the Title un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stated,
and the Claim unresolved, whether it belonged to
<hi>Cesar</hi> or not, and taught them in the general to give nothing
to <hi>Cesar</hi> with prejudice to what was Gods; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
all the Payments we speak of, which are all for
carrying on the War against God. (2) <hi>Cesar</hi> was no Tyrant
nor Usurper at this time, because they had legally submitted
themselves unto several <hi>Cesars</hi> successively before. (3) It
was, lest He should offend: But here it will be evident,
that the offence &amp; scandal lyeth upon the other hand, of
paying the Exaction: And it is against all Religion to say,
that both the doing and refusing to do the same Act, can
give offence. But (4) make the Case like ours, and I doubt
not to call it Blasphemy to say, that Christ would have payed,
or permitted to pay a Taxation, professedly imposed for
levying a War against Him, or banishing Him and His
Disciples out of the Land; Or to fill the mouths of the
greedy <hi>Pharisees,</hi> devouring widowes houses, for their
pretence of long Prayers; Or that He would have payed,
or suffered to pay their Extortions, if any had been exacted
of Him, or His Disciples, for His Preaching, or working
Miracles; Or if help or hire had been demanded, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
those that rose to stone Him for His good deeds.</p>
               <p>4. It is Lawful to pay <hi>a part to preserve the whole,</hi> when it
is extorted only by force &amp; threatenings, and not exacted
by Law; when it is a yeelding only to a lesser suffering, and
not a consenting to a Sin to shift suffering. The Objection
of a man being seised by a Robber, transacting with him to
give him the one half or more to save the rest and his life,
commonly made use of to justify the paying of these Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
while under the power and at the reverence of such
publick Robbers, cannot satisfie in this Case. It is thus far
satisfying, that there is a manifest Concession in it, that
instead of righteous Rulers, we are under the power, and
fallen into the hand of Robbers, from whom we are not
able to rise up. But there is no paritie. For to bring it
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:41139:366"/>
home without halting, and make it speak sense, we must
suppose that the Robber, not only requires a part for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and a part for his underling Shavers, horse-rubbers
&amp;c. but a part upon this declared Account, that he may by
that supplie be enabled &amp; furnished with all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
for murdering my Father, Mother, Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Kinsmen, &amp; Friends (all whom he hath now in his
power) yea, and for doing that besides, which is worse
than all these put together: Whether then shall I, by giving
the Robber that part which he seeks, enable him to do all
these mischiefs? Or by refusing, expose my self to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of being robbed or slain? Let the Conscience of any
man answer this (for nothing can be here alledged against
the paritie as now propounded) and then I fear not but the
Objection shall be found a blaze of empty words, blown
away by any breath. But Alas! will this Tattle of a Robber
be found relevant in that day, when the publick Robbers
shall be proceeded against by the just Judge? Let them who
think so, think also, they see the Court fenced, and the
Judge set, and hear these words sounding in their ears,
<hi>ye are cursed with a Curse, for ye have robbed Me. even this whole
Nation;</hi> And then they are like to lay as litle weight on the
Objection, for fear of falling under the weight of the Curse,
as I do.</p>
               <p>5. It is Lawful <hi>Passively</hi> by forcible constraint to submit
to the execution of such wicked <hi>Sentences,</hi> as impose these
burdens, if it be not by way of <hi>Obedience</hi> to them: This is
suffering and not sinning. Hence it is easie to refell that
Objection: If it be Lawful (which hitherto was never
questioned) for a man, who is sentenced to die, to go to
the place of execution, then a man being under the Moral
force of a Law, which is equivalent, may pay <hi>Cesses, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calities,
Fines</hi> &amp;c. Ans. 1. Might it not be doubted, whether
a mans going upon his oun feet to be execute, had as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
and <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> a tendency, yea &amp; proper Causua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to advance the design of the enemy, and his refusing to
go had as clear a Testimony against the Clamant wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Course, as his refusing to pay their Impositions;
Whether, I say in this case a man might no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, yea ought
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:41139:366"/>
not to refuse to go to the place of execution. But 2. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
would conclude any thing from it, to give it either
life or legs, must make it run thus: Let the order run in this
forme (else there is no paralel, and so no inference) we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
all the Opposers of our Course (that is all the lovers of
our Lord Jesus) whom we have for their Rebellious Rande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouzing
at Conventicles sentenced as Enemies &amp; Traitors
to die, to come and be hanged by virtue of our sentence;
Otherw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se besides the Moral force of the Law, adjudging
them to die, we shall use force, and drag them like Dogs
to the place of execution; And in puting us to this Trouble,
they shall fall under the reproach, that being sentenced to
die, they scrupled forsooth, yea refused to go on their oun
legs to the Gibbet. Let this I say be made the Case, which
to me is the exact paralel, and their every Child will know
what to Answer, or to hiss the Objection as pure ridicule.
3. I suppose the Objection speaks of a righteous &amp; innocent
person, who for Righteousness is brought, as a Sheep to
the slaughter (for a Malefactor, who hath lost all right to
his life, is not to be understood) Then to make the Case
paralel, it must be taken for granted (1) There is a publick
Law with the penaltie of death statute for the violation
thereof. (2) That the person to be executed, hath not
only transgressed that Law, but his disobedience to the
Law is notour. (3) That he is processed and convict of the
transgression thereof: Whereupon followes (4) The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and then the Execution. Now the Law being
wicked, and the man from the fear of God being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to disobey the Law, he can in nothing be justly
construed Active, but in that disobedience or renitence:
But in the whole of what befalls him for this, he being a
captive Prisoner, is to be looked upon as passive. Yea the
very Act of going to the place of execution in the present
Case, howbeit as to its Physical entitie, it is of the same
kind with the Executioners Motion that goes along with
him, yet in its Moral &amp; Religious being, whence it hath
its specification, its wholly the Suffering of a Captive,
Well then, ere any thing can be pleaded from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
paritie; seeing there are Laws, made for paying
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:41139:367"/>
such Exactions, <hi>Cesses, Salaries, &amp; Fynes,</hi> for the declared
ends of ruining the people &amp; Interests of Christ. Its neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
in order to a just paralel, that the Law must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irst
disobeyed. (2) The disobedience must be notour. (3) The
delinquent must be processed &amp; pursued, as guilty of the
transgression, and convicted thereof, whereupon Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
passeth against him for the breach of the Law. Here
I grant all with advantage to the Cause: As in the first Case,
so in this, he who is judged guilty of the breach of this
wicked Law, and who is sentenced for that violation,
ought to suffer <hi>patiently the spoiling of his goods,</hi> and not to
decline suffering, if it were unto blood, striving against
this sin.</p>
               <p>6. Its Lawful of <hi>two evils</hi> of Sufferings to chuse the least:
where both come in the election, as in the Cases fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
and in a mans throwing of his goods over
board in a storm: These and the like are deeds in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
exigent voluntary &amp; rational, being upon deliberation
&amp; choise, where the least evil is chosen under the notion of
good, yea of the best that can be in the present case, and
accordingly the will is determined, and meets &amp; closes
with its proper object: Or one of them only be proposed
to be submitted to, but another lesser evil of suffering is in
a mans power to chuse &amp; propose, for purchasing his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
from a greater; which is not imposed nor exacted
of him, either by a wicked Law, or for wicked ends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
but voluntarely offered; As in the Case of parting
with some money to a Robber or Murderer to save the
life, when he is seeking only the life; As the ten men that
were going to the House of the Lord said unto <hi>Ishmael, slay
us not for we have treasures in the field,</hi> for which he <hi>forebare and
slew them not Ier.</hi> 41. 8. In this a man does nothing, which
under such circumstances is not only Lawful (one of the
main ends for which goods are given to him, to wit the
preservation of his life, being thereby attained) but it were
a grievous sin, and would conclude him guilty of self-murder,
not to make use of such a mean for preservation of
his life, which God hath put in his power, and is in the case
called for by His Precept. But however force may warrant
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:41139:367"/>
one to do that, which may be done for shunning a greater
evil of loss; yet it is never sufficient to make one do that
which is a greater evil, than all the evil that can be said to
be shunned: For the evil shunned is suffering, but the evil
done to shun this, is real and active Concurrence, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
measure, &amp; method, enjoyned by Law, in strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
the hands of those who have displayed a banner
against all the Lovers of our Lord Jesus Christ; A manifest
chusing of sin to shun suffering, and a saving of life with the
prejudice of that in the preservation whereof he should be
ready to lay doun all, and be at a point to endure the worst
this wicked world can make him suffer, ere he be found
guiltie in the matter of a Complyance of that nature. And
thô the rod of the wicked should seem to rest on his lot, for
his refusal, and he be the object of their rage &amp; revenge,
for holding his integritie; yet he shall be honoured as a
faithful Witness, helped to endure as seeing Him who is
invisible, and amidst all his sufferings &amp; sorrowes, made
to rejoice, in the hope that when God shall lead forth these
Workers of iniquity, he shall not be found amongst the
Company of these who have turned aside with them into
their crooked Courses, and for that shall be overturned &amp;
crushed with them, under the Curse that is hovering over
their heads,. Its true a man should not cast himself and his
family (which if he provide not for, he is worse than an
Infidel) upon sufferings, either needlessly or doubtfully,
when he is not perswaded it is Trurh &amp; Duty he suffers
for, and of value sufficient to countervail the loss he may
sustain for it. But on the other hand, in the present and all
like cases it is highly of the concernment of all men to be
careful &amp; circumspectly Cautions, when the Case comes
to be stated upon suffering or not suffering, in examining
well whether the Course whereby a man shuns suffering<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be
of God, and not to take Plausibilities for Demonstrations;
seeing the flesh is not only ready to inculcate that Doctrine,
<hi>spare thy self,</hi> but is both witty of invention to plead for
what will affourd ease, and as unwilling to listen to what
would, if attended unto, expose us to the malice &amp; rage
of rigorous enemies: It being alwise more becoming the
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:41139:368"/>
Professors of the Gospel, and the Followers of our Lord
Jesus, who must walk to Heaven bearing His Cross, to
abstain at all hazards when the case is doubtful, than to rush
forward upon an uncertainty, when it is not evident they
have Gods approbation for what they do. Yea suppose a
person erred to his oun hurt in the first case, through
weakness, yet it will argue much more sincerity &amp; upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
towards God, and is done with less danger than in the
other. And as many as walk according to this Rule, are
like to have the Peace of the <hi>Israel</hi> of God, to compense
whatever of trouble or loss they may meet with in the
world, when others shall not have this <hi>bird of Paradise</hi> to
sing in their bosome.</p>
               <p>II. But shunning prolixity, to come neare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the point,
because perhaps some may alledge such Cases are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
in the Scriptures, nor can any Case be found
paralel to these under Consideration, from which we may
gather the determination thereof; Which I think indeed
hard to find, because in the wickedness of former ages such
monstrous Exactions had never a Precedent, for such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
ends, so declaredly impudent. I shall make some
Suppositions, and propose some Questions, all of a piece,
and some way paralel to this under debate, and leave any
Conscience touched with the fear of God to answer.</p>
               <p>1. Suppose, when our Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> and His Disciples
were tossed upon the waves by the storm at sea. and he was
sleeping, that then <hi>Herod</hi> or <hi>Pilate,</hi> or the Chief Rulers had
sent peremptory orders to all men, to supply and furnish
with such things as he had, the men they imployed, to
capacitate them once for all and for ever to sink that floating
bottom out of sight; and that somewhat should be given to
the Souldiers engaged in that Enterprise, somewhat to the
<hi>Pharisees</hi> fot perswading them to it, and <hi>fynes</hi> to be exacted
from the Recusants, and Rewards to be given to such as
should keep them in Custody that should fall in their hands,
either of them that refused to pay the Moyety prescribed,
or of such of them as should escape drouning. In this Case
would, or durst any of the Lovers of <hi>Iesus</hi> comply with
any of these demands? and not rather chuse to perish with
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:41139:368"/>
Him, or in opposition to such wicked attempts? Now
hath not the Lord Jesus, and all the Interest He hath in the
Nation, been imbarqued as it were in one bottom, and
floating like a wrack in the sea? And have not these called
Rulers in this Land, in their rage against the Lords Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the handful who adhere to Him, sent their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
orders to pay a <hi>Cess</hi> for sinking His floating In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests;
and to pay the <hi>Curats</hi> for perswading to it; and <hi>fynes</hi>
for not concurring in it; And rewards to <hi>Iaylors</hi> &amp; others
that are appointed to oppress the Recusants? Who durst
concur then in this Complyance, who had love to Christ in
exercise, and who had his friends in the same bottom im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued?
And besides seeing the Great God had the man of
whom this is required, bound with his oun consent, under
a Sacred &amp; Solemn Oath, and under the penaltie of never
seeing His face, if he do not venture life &amp; fortune to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that precious Interest, and all who are embarqued
with it from perishing. Shall he notwithstanding of this,
give what these enemies to Christ, call for as His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence,
to enable them to execute their wicked Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance?
Does any man think or dream that the pitiful
Plea, of what they call a <hi>Moral force,</hi> will clear and acquit
him before God from the guilt of a Concurrence in this
Conspiracie, while in the mean time he furnished what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
these Enemies demanded of him with this express
<hi>Declaro</hi> that it was for this Cause exacted, and for this end
imposed? Or can he think to be saved, when they shall be
sentenced who with so much deliberation &amp; despight have
done this thing? O let us consider the after reckoning! And
let us not with pretences distinguish our selves into a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
or distract our selves into the oblivion of this, that
God is righteous to whom the reckoning must be made.</p>
               <p>2. Let it be supposed, under <hi>Sauls</hi> Tyranny, when the
<hi>Ziphims</hi> informed him of <hi>Davids</hi> hiding himself with them,
Or when <hi>Doeg</hi> informed him of <hi>Abimelechs</hi> resetting him,
That an order had been given forth to all <hi>Israel,</hi> with this
Narrative: Whereas that Rebel <hi>David</hi> had now openly
despised Authority, had been intertained by the Priest, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>Goliabs</hi> sword from him, and gathered a Company
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:41139:369"/>
of armed men together, therefore to the end he and his
Complices, may be brought to Justice, We ordain all
from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beersheba,</hi> to concur either personally in this
Expedition against him, or to pay <hi>Cess</hi> to our standing
forces to maintain them in this expedition, or so much to
gratify the <hi>Ziphims</hi> for their kindness, or to furnish <hi>Doeg</hi>
with a sword, to murder the Priests of the Lord. Would
any that favoured <hi>Davids</hi> righteous Cause, have dared to
do any of these? Would these that durst not concur them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
contribute any encouragment to the Concurers?
Would <hi>Sauls</hi> Servants that would not fall upon the Priests
of the Lord themselves, have given <hi>Doeg</hi> one of their
swords to do it, or money to buy one, if it had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded?
To the same purpose, suppose a party comes to
a <hi>Dissenter,</hi> with an express order, and this Narrative,
Whereas there is such a Minister, meet with some people,
at an <hi>execrable Conventicle</hi> as they call it (but in it self the
pure Worship of God) therefore to the end the Minister
may be taken &amp; murdered, and the Servants of the Lord
for the Countenance they gave him may be brought to the
same punishment, they ordain him, for the accomplishing
of their design, to furnish that partie with all necessares,
or to pay such a summ of money for not concuring with
them: Now should he in this case not only forbear to lay
doun his life for his brethren, and forbear to deliver them,
that are thus drawn unto death on such an account, (into
which forbearance the Great God will make so accurate
an inquirie <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 11, 12. as may make us tremble,
whether we look backward or forward) but also furnish
according to the tenor of this Order, that partie of the
<hi>Dragons</hi> Legions, in their War against the Prince <hi>Michael</hi>
&amp; His Angels, with supplies, and think to put off the
matter and plead innocent with this, that he was under the
Moral force of a Law, accompanied with such military
force, as if he had refused, they would have taken away
all he had &amp;c.? For this Plea in its full strength, is to do
evil that some good may come of it (no true good) which
brings just damnation <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. or to chuse sin rather than
affliction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="713" facs="tcp:41139:369"/>
3. What if <hi>Manasseh,</hi> or other Idolatrous Princes, that
sacrificed to Devils, and made Children pass through the
fire to Molech, had enacted a <hi>Cess,</hi> or under severe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of <hi>Fynes</hi> had commanded all to concur to a solemn
Sacrifice of that nature, charging every man against a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
day, to bring in his proportion in order to celebrate
the Sacrifice with all its statute solemnities; Or should
have taken a child from every father, and then made a Law
that each of these should contribute such a summ, for
furnishing with all necessaries, and maintaining these Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
whom they had conduced to shed the blood of their
innocent Children or sacrifice them to Molech: Could it
be expected that any of the Godly would have payed such
Exactions, and then have wyped his mouth with the
notion of a moral force? This comes home enough to our
Case: For no sacrifice they can offer to the Devil, can be
more real or so acceptable, as what they declare they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to do; being so direct, not only an opposition to the
coming of the Kingdom of Christ, but the deletion of His
precious Interests, and exstirpation of His faithful Remnant,
and the giving Satan such an absolute Dominion in the
Nation, as that they who have made the decree, and all
who put it in execution, practically declare thereby they
have mancipate themselves to his slavery, and sold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to work wickedness, in the sight of the Lord: So
likewise, that all the rest of the Nation, may with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
become his vassals, and in evidence of their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to Christ, and in recognition of Satans Soveraignity
&amp; their subjection, they are appointed to pay these black
Meales.</p>
               <p>4. Let it be supposed, that after <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had
made the decree, for all to fall doun &amp; worship his Image,
and the three Children were apprehended for refusing it, he
had made another, that all the Jewes especially should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,
every one a Faggot, or money to buy it, to heat
the furnace, or a rope to lead them to it: Can any man
suppose, that <hi>Daniel,</hi> or the rest of the faithful, would have
payed it? Even so, let it be supposed, that any one of these
faithful Ambassadours of Christ, or all these zealous
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:41139:370"/>
Workers together with God, who have laboured among
the people in the Preached Gospel, should fall into the
hands of these Hunters; And then they should make a Law,
and appoint every man in the Nation, to send but one
threed, to make a Towe, to hang that Minister, or to
hang the whole Company of Christs Ambassadours, and a
farthing to pay the Executioner: Can any man, without
horrour think of complying so far as to contribute what is
commanded? Or would not a Gracious man frighted into
an abhorrence at the attrociousness of the wickedness, or
fired into a flame of zeal for God, say without demur, as
not daunted, with fear of what flesh could do unto him, I
will rather venture my All to keep them alive, or be hanged
with them, than by doing what is demanded be brought
forth &amp; classed in the cursed &amp; cruel Company of those who
shall be dragged before the Tribunal of Christ, with their
fingers dyed &amp; dropping with the blood of those who are
peculiarly dear to Him? I know it will be said that in all
these cases it would be a clear case of Confession. Well,
thats all I would have granted: For that which doth over
ballance to a Testimony, in all the cases mentioned, is so
far from being wanting in the cases now under consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
that they have all to enforce the duty, that all of
them put together do include; As will be clear to any who
consider (1) The preciousness of the things &amp; Interests to
be destroyed (2) The Concurrence called for from every
one, that this desperate design may be accomplished. (3) The
great, manifold, &amp; indispensible obligations all are under,
not only to abstain from the required Concurrence, but
to preserve also &amp; maintain these things in opposition to all,
whom Satan sets on work to serve him in this Expedition
against the Son of God, and to do it or endeavour it with
the loss of life, and all things dearest to men, to the end
that these things which are Satans eyesore, as only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
of His Kingdom, may be preserved among the
poor Remnant, and propogate in their power &amp; purity to
the posteritie. Happy he who shall be found so doing now,
when the <hi>Dragon</hi> and his Angels are drawn into the fields,
and have proclaimed the War, and published to the world
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:41139:370"/>
the Causes thereof; So that now this General having laid
aside all his old disguises, doeth in his true shape march upon
the head of his black Legions, who wear his badge &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and fight under his banner &amp; standart.</p>
               <p>III. In the last place, with all possible brevity, I shall
offer some <hi>Reasons</hi> against Complyance with these Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions
<hi>in Cumulo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. To pay these Impositions, upon such declared Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
for such declared Causes, and for such declared
ends, would condemn the Contendings &amp; Sufferings of
many eminently Godly, especially in our day who have
refused them. Of these Questions &amp; Sufferings thereupon
among the Godly in former times, we cannot instruct
much, for such insolent Impositions, as to all the dimensions
of their heinousness, were never heard before. But we
want not Examples of the Saints refusing to give their
money and other such things to wicked men, either to
comply with their wicked demands, obey their wicked
Laws, encourage their wicked courses, or furtheir their
wicked designs. In Scripture we find <hi>Paul</hi> would not give
<hi>Felix</hi> money that he might be loosed, thô he sent for him
often for that end <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 26.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Mr Durham</hi> in his exposition of the <hi>Revelation. Chap.</hi> 6.
<hi>vers</hi> 9. <hi>Lect. 6. Pag.</hi> gives an account, that when in the
persecution of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> the Persecutors sought but the
Bibles, poors coats, money, or Cups (wherewith they
served) to be given them, as some Evidence of their
ceding; But they refused to accept deliverance upon these
terms: yea when the Souldiers, partly wearieing to be
so bloody, partly desirous of seeming victory over
Christians, did profess themselves content to take any
old paper or clout in place of the Bible, they refused to
give any <hi>Ecvola</hi> (as it was called from the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)
or cast-away clout; yea when Souldiers would violently
pluck such things from them against their wills, they
would follow them, professing their Adherence unto the
Truth, and that they had not any way willingly delivered
these things, as it is to be seen in <hi>Baronius. An. 303. pag.</hi>
748. It is reported of one <hi>Marcus Arethusius,</hi> who was
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:41139:371"/>
put to torment under <hi>Iulian,</hi> because he would not build
the Idol Temple which he had formerly demolished,
when they were content to accept some part of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses
from him, and to spare his life, he refused to give
<hi>obolum</hi> or one half penny, <hi>Sozom. Lib. 5. 9. Cent. Mag. Cent.
4. pag. 797. and</hi> 833. By which and many other instances
we may see, how resolutly the primitive Saints held fast
their Testimonies: from which especially they were
called <hi>Martyrs</hi> or <hi>witnesses;</hi> and by which often, not only
many weak ones were strengthened, but also many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters
convinced and made to cry out, <hi>Certainly great is
the God of the Christians;</hi> while as they saw that no Allur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on the one side, nor Terrors on the other, could
make them loose their grips, but still Truth and Christ
were born witness unto, and well spoken of by them.
It will not be unnecessary here to consider some of Mr.
<hi>Durhams</hi> observations in the fourth Lecture, for clearing
thereof, he adduced these matters of <hi>fact.</hi> Such as <hi>Obs.</hi> 7.
That the giving of a Testimony by outward Confession
of the Truth when called for, is necessary, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
as well as soundness of faith; yea it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the outward testifieing of the Truth before men,
more than the faith of it before God, that bringeth on
suffering: And there was nothing more abhorred in the
primitive Christians than dissembling of a Testimony, to
evite suffering, as appeareth in <hi>Augustins</hi> writings <hi>de
mendacio &amp; contra mendacium,</hi> and the writings of others to
that purpose. <hi>Obs.</hi> 8. That every Truth of the word may
be a ground of suffering warrantably: For the least thing
that hath a Truth in it, as well as the more concerning
fundamental Truths, is the word of God, and so can not
be dispensed with by His people. <hi>Obs.</hi> 9. Every Truth in
the word hath an outward Testimony joined to it, and
sometimes may be called for upon very great hazards.
<hi>Obs.</hi> 10. When it is called for, this Testimony or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
to any Truth befor men, is no less necessary, and
ought as peremptorily to be held and st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck to as the
former: Therefor it is called (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10.) <hi>Confession unto
Salvation.</hi> And called for by a peremptorie certification.
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:41139:371"/>
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. 32. 33. Obs. 11. That these who are sound in
the Faith of the word, will be also exceeding tonacious
of their Testimony, in Scripture, and in primitive times,
we will find the Saints sticking at, and hazarding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
on things which appear of very small moment, yet
were to them of great concernment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because of the
Testimony, which was involved in them, which they
would not let go. Such was <hi>Mordecai, Ester 3. Daniel</hi> 6.
his not shutting of his windowes. Yea further in his lately
printed Sermons on Matth. 16. 24. Serm. 7. pag. 155.
the same Author saith. There is not in some respect a
more and a less in the matter of duty and in the matter of
Truth or in respect of Suffering. And a little after. §. 5.
he sayes, We would not limit sufferings for Christ to
things simply Lawful or unlawful, for it may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for things <hi>indifferent</hi> in their oun nature, which yet
being so &amp; so circumstantiated to us may draw on suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
a thing may be indifferent &amp; Lawful to some, which
to others stated under such &amp; such circumstances may be
counted a receding from some part of a just Testimony;
even thô the matter be not such in it self and in its oun
nature, yet it may be so circumstantiate to some persons
as it may be lyable to that Construction if they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
from or forbear it; as in the Example of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who
suffered for opening his windowes, which was a thing
indifferent in it self and not essential to his worshiping of
God, but—he finds himself bound in conscience, and
that on very just ground, to do as he was wont to do
before, and that on the manifest hazard of his life, left his
malicious enemies should have it to say, that he receded
from his duty, &amp; that he thought more shame now, or was
more afraid now, than before to worship the true God.</q>
               <p>How worthy <hi>Mr Knox</hi> argueth for withholding Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments
from the false Bishops and Clergy may be seen
before, <hi>part. 1. per. 3. pag.</hi> 28, 29.</p>
               <p>The general Assembly in their Declaration dated Jullij
ult: 1648. concerning the then unlawful engadgement in a
War against England, plainly &amp; positively Dehorteth all
members of the Kirke of Scotland from contributing any
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:41139:372"/>
assistence thereunto, expressed as followeth; <q>That they
do not concur in, nor any way assist this present engadge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they would not partake in other mens sins, and
so receive of their plagues but that by the grace &amp; assistence
of Christ, they stedfastly resolve to suffer the rod of the
wicked, and the utmost which wicked mens malice can
afflict them with, rather than to put forth their hands to
iniquitie.</q> In which Declaration may be seen at large, that
candor, faithfullness &amp; freedom which becometh the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Gospel, &amp; dignitie of Watchmen, in their
seasonable warning &amp; disswading all from assisting any way
to that unlawful engadgement, perceiving the sin and snare
thereof, So obviously tending to the involveing the Land in
guilt, &amp; exposeing to wrath; yea and that notwithstanding
of the fair and plausible pretexts of the engadgers and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
therein, who pretended &amp; professed their undertaking
to be for the furthering reformation, establishing and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
the Covenanted Religion from the plotings &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of the Popish, Prelatick &amp; Malignant enemies
thereof, and prosecuting the ends of the Covenants; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
which no doubt our silent &amp; time-serveing Ministers
(if they had any such now to plead) would streniously
improve, in vindication of their prudent silence, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
&amp; shamfull Complyances. Alas how sad &amp; lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
is the condition of the Church &amp; Nation now! that
even when the case is so far altered that not only all such
pretences are laid aside, Reformation deserted &amp; disdained,
the established Religion razed &amp; ruined, the Covenant
broken &amp; burned, and the owning the obligation thereof
declared Treason, but also an absolute Power pleaded &amp;
exercised to the suspending, stoping &amp; disabling all penal
Laws against Poperie &amp; Prelacy, a gap opened by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
toleration to the leting in all the Heresies, Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atries
&amp; blasphemies of the mother of Harlots, and the
Land openly defiled therewith, unjust &amp; wicked Taxations

                  </gap>shed to the
world, far exceeding in wickedness these testified against
by the Assembly 1648, or any formerly. While the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:41139:372"/>
have so far abandoned their duty of seting the trumpet
to their mouth and giveing due warning of the sin and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of those dreadfull and Judgement-procuring courses,
that they are caught in the snare &amp; found complementing &amp;
encouraging, the principall Instrument of all these evills,
by their scandalous flattering Adresses.</p>
               <p>How faithfull &amp; tender some have been even in our day
their sufferings and losses in a measur above others makes
manifest, amongst whom the worthy <hi>Laird of Kersland</hi> is
not to be forgotten, whose Estate heritable &amp; moveable was
declared forfeited, and seased, for his appearing in Arms
to joyn with that faithfull party who by horrid oppression
were forced to betake themselves to defensive resistence
anno 1666; who considering the equitie of the cause he
appeared for, the indispensibleness of the obligations bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to that duty, and how much a good Conscience is
to be prefered to an Estate, durst not part with the sweet
comforts of the one for the uncertain profits of the other;
And as he was earnest with God by frequent &amp; fervent
Prayer for light &amp; stedfastness in the matters of his suffering
&amp; Testimony, So it pleased the Lord, so to determine his
heart therein, as that all the endeavours &amp; perswasions used
both by friends &amp; foes to move him to a composition with
the enemies for his Estate proved unsuccessfull, yea it is well
known how that severals, both of his near relations &amp;
others, who used the most forcible &amp; perswasive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as the consideration of the ancient &amp; honourable
Familie he was descended from; The miserable case that
he, his Lady and Children should be in, without his Estate;
The Counsel &amp; Judgement of grave &amp; Godly Ministers;
The freedom &amp; practice of other learned and knowing
men; Togither also with the imputation of vain scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,
simple &amp; unwarrantable nicitie &amp; precisness &amp;c,
that yet even some of those who dealt most with him, were
by his defences &amp; reasonings convinced of the equitie of his
cause, and brought to commend his upright resolution,
and to applaud his tenderness and faithfullness; and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
his own father, who pleaded much that he would
only consent, that he with others of his friends might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:41139:373"/>
in favours of his Familie, and that he himself should
be no wayes concerned in it further than to assent that the
thing be done, but could not prevail, who afterwards
blessed God that he did not, declaring that he had much
more satisfaction, &amp; comfort in his sons honestie, &amp; sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness
than many such Estats could ever have affourded
him.</p>
               <p>I shall here mention some considerations which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with him to decline all composition directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly
with the enemies in that matter. (1) That he
could never attain to freedom to use any such manifest dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
as deliberatly to assent to any thing that might
import his acknowledgeing that to be a sin &amp; fault (yea
such a sin &amp; fault as Rebellion) which he was convinced in
his conscience to be unquestionable duty both before God &amp;
man, nor therby dissemblingly to insinuat his undoubted
right to his Estate, to be in the person or at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>isposeing of
any other. (2) Considering that there can be no new right
procured upon a composition, and granted to any, but such
as shall carry in the narative thereof that he had forfeited
that Estate by Rebellion, with a long preamble condemning
the cause of God, and dutyfull endeavours of his people
for Reformation, and in defence of Religion &amp; Libertie,
all as Sedition, Rebellion &amp; Treason; whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
rather to part with his Estate, than be any way instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
&amp; occasional to the indignifieing that holy &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Cause with such disdainfull, reproachful &amp; blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Epithets. And albeit such tenderness in principle
&amp; practice of this Worthy Gentleman, and of many others
of the faithfull sufferers in our day, be censured &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the luke-warm &amp; worldly-wise Professors in
this age, as an unprecedented noveltie, or precise &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
notion, yet we find it the same with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
sufferers in former ages, and exactly agreeing with the

<pb n="721" facs="tcp:41139:373"/>
and Answered. <hi>An a principe peti possit confiscatio bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,

certum est illud fieri non posse sine peccato, rescriptum enim sive

can be sought back again from a Prince, in the name and

he Answers, that it is certain it cannot be done without sin;
for the new right, or the <hi>de novo damus,</hi> (as we call it)
granted by the Prince, doeth really contain, open blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
against the glory of God; because therein mention

the condemned are found guilty; which new right most in

and that is a certain kind of approbation no ways to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerat.
Wherfore I see not that it is Lawfull for a Godly man
rightly instructed in the Gospel, to involve himself into such
fictions.</p>
               <p>2. From the <hi>Fountain</hi> &amp; <hi>Conveyance,</hi> whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
the iniquity of these payments might be concluded;
which is nothing else than that Arbitrary Power domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over us, and oppressing &amp; overpressing the Kingdoms
with intolerable Exactions; which to pay is all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
&amp; Concurrence required of us to entail slaverie on the
posterity. I mean to pay it, out of submission only to the
Moral force of its Imposition, which is all the justification
required of that absolute Tyranny imposing it. For we have
the Testimony of a King for it (<hi>K. Iames Speech to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
anno</hi> 1609.) that a <hi>King degenerateth into a Tyrant, when
he leaveth to rule by Law, much more when he begins—to set up
an Arbitrary Power, impose unlawful Taxes</hi> &amp;c. It can be
denyed by none, that know either Religion or Liberty,
and are not enemies to both, that these Impositions under
consideration, upon such accounts, for such ends, are as
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:41139:374"/>
unlawful Taxes, and as illegally and arbitrarily imposed,
as ever could demonstrate the most Despotical Absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Paramount to all Law, or precedent, but that of
<hi>Benhadad,</hi> of a very Tyrannical strain, <hi>Thus saith</hi> Benhadad,
<hi>thy silver &amp; thy gold is mine—yet I will send my Servants, and
they shall search thine house, and it shall be that whatsoever is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

this were not so intollerable, as from such as pretend

of a prevalent faction made up of perjured Traitors, in a
Course of enmity against God, and the Country, who to
prosecute the War against the Almighty, and root out all
His people out of the Land, condescend upon these <hi>Cesses,
Fynes</hi> &amp;c. as a fit &amp; adapted <hi>Medium</hi> thereunto. Wherefore,
of necessity all that would not oune that Conclusion, as
their oun deed, in these Representatives, and oune them
as their Representatives in that deed, must bear witness
against the same, by a Refusal, to oune the debt, or pay
the same. But I shall conclude this, with observing (1) The
holy &amp; remarkable righteousness of the Lord, that we,
who would not contend earnestly for the Liberty of the
Gospel, who would not acquit our selves like men, in
witnessing our Loyaltie to Christ, were not fixed in our
Engagements, nor stedfast in holding the Liberties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Christ hath made us free, did not reclaim nor reluctate
when we saw our Royal Masters Prerogative invaded;
should be trode upon in all Civills, and treated as Slaves,
even by these, whom we had gratified with a base &amp; sinful
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:41139:374"/>
forbearance to plead for God, and preserve from their
violence these things, these precious &amp; invaluable things,
which we should have kept more tenderly than the apple
of our eye. O the relucency of this Righteousness, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gods whom we have served smite us, and in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, whose interest we minded with a misregard &amp;
Perjury-involving neglect of the Interest of Christ, thus to
destroy our poor pitiful Interests! And thus having taught
them to be Captains over us, we must now sit in the house
of bondage in our Land. (2) Who will not adore &amp; admire
the Righteousness of the Lord, particularly in leaving
some of these to be designedly trode upon, who not only
were involved in the common guilt of not with-standing
these Encroachments, but first went a great way in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
to the making of these wicked Laws; And now
have been made to lye under the load, laid upon their loyns,
by the hands of such, to whom they gave the hand in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
the Work of God? Why should not they be spoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Why should not the young Lyons roar upon them, and
make their Land wast? Why should not men of the same
mettal &amp; soul with the Children of <hi>Noph</hi> &amp; <hi>Tahapanes,</hi> break
the Crown of their head (or feed upon their Crown) who
have sold &amp; set the Crown of Christ upon anothers head, and
concured to crush His faithful Remnant? O let us learn to
read &amp; revere! Let us not be wheedled with we know not
what, out of our good old Principles into the espousing the
Interest, or embarquing into the same bottom with men
of such Principles &amp; Practices. And whoso is wise, and will
observe these things, even they shall understand the loving
kindness of the Lord: Great loving kindness, that He hath
shewed to his poor Remnant, in delivering us from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
by such Deliverers, whereby the work had been
more really and more shamefully ruined, and the hope of
the posterity more certainly razed.</p>
               <p>3. From the declared <hi>Ends</hi> of all of them, declared either
verbally or virtually, and indisputably &amp; universally known:
To wit, that by such Exactions they might be enabled to
maintain &amp; prosecute the National Rebellion against
Christ, and root out His Gospel, and all the faithful

Preachers &amp; Professors thereof. These designs being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
and the Impositions demanded being the best expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,
and most adapted means to attain them, it cannot
but be manifest, that whosoever complyes with the means
do cooperate with the ends: Which, if any thing, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
the Complyers in the Contrivers sin, and make the
Payers obnoxious to the Enacters judgments. If they that

11, 11. it must be, when they demand such rewards, and
the demands are complyed with. But some may pretend,
and under that pretence think to shut the shour of suffering,
and command the serenity &amp; sun-shine of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seience
too, and to shelter their soul under that shadow;
That these Exactions may be necessary for other ends: Can
any State be without Exactions? Is it not necessary that
forces be maintained and such as are in publick office in the
Kingdom? Wherewithall shall the Nation be guarded
against forreign invasion? Alas! the pretence is so false &amp;
frivolous as he could not escape the Censure of foolish, who
in answering it appeared serious, save in a just indignation
at its empty vanitie. What are these forces and publick
Officiers for? What are they employed about, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the <hi>Dragons</hi> designs, and serve his drudgerie? Shall
these guard the Nation, who together with Religion tread
upon the poor remaining shadow of Liberty? Do they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
fear a forreign invasion? No, it doth not hold us here:
These called Rulers hide not their designs, but hold them
to our eye that we may not pretend ignorance. They will
do the greatest hast first: Christ and His Interest is their
great eyesore. This one <hi>Iesus</hi> who calls Himself a King
(yea and He will be so to their cost) and His Subjects as the
most dangerous partie, are to be discussed in the first place:
And thereafter, when they are liberate from that fear of
His returning to His Throne, whom they have exauctorate

and have eaten the flesh and drunk the blood of His people,
then they will be in a better case to defend the Land, by
shewing the Enemy those Teeth &amp; Tusks, wherewith
they have torn the people of the Lord. But will men put
out their oun eyes, that they may be taken with the more
tameness to grind in their Mill, and make them merry at
our madness? Have we lost our senses, that we may with
confidence jeopard our Souls? Have they not invaded the
Mediators Kingdom, and taken to themselves His House
in possession? And because Reavers may not be Rewers,
they will destroy all in the Land, who seem faithful to
Christ, and resolute to follow the Captain of the host of
Israel. But is it not enough that they menace Heaven?
Will they mock us into the same Rebellion with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
He will not be mocked, but turn their jest into
earnest. I cannot here shift the transcribing some of the
very words of that Author, whose Reasonings I am but
gleaning on this subject. <q>Oh Brittain! O Scotland! bent
into, &amp; bold in backsliding, the wrath of God, and thy
wo seems to be upon the wing. And alas! I am afraid,
that by this Crowning &amp; Crimson wickedness, the Lord
God Almighty is making a way to His Anger, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the Nation for a Sacrifice, to expiate in the sight
of the world our Perjurie, defection &amp; Heaven-daring
Provocations. Alas! I am afraid that the sword of the
Lord, which shall avenge the quarrel of His Covenant,
is near to be drawn—that the Contributers, as well as
the stated partie of contrivers, decreers and cruel Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
of these decrees, may fall under the blow of the
forbished sword of the Lord God: And that the Land of
such abominations, may be swept of its Inhabitants with
the besome of destruction, and soaked with the blood of
those, who instead of contending for Christ, have by
this payment associate with His stated, His declared,
and implacable Enemies, whose rage is come up before
Him, and will bring Him doun to take revenge. Alas!
My fears, My fears are multiplied upon me, that the
war shall not only at last Land in Britain: But that He
hath been all this while training up a <hi>Militia</hi> abroad,
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:41139:376"/>
breeding them in blood, and teaching them how to be
skillful to destroy, against the time He give them order
to march, and put the flaming sword in their hand, to be
bathed in the blood of backsliding Brittain! Oh if our
turning unto Him, that He might turn away from the
fierceness of His Anger, might prevent this woful day!
But since instead of any turning unto Him, we surpass
the deeds of the heathen, and out do in wickedness all
that went before us, and proceed with a petulancy
reaching Heaven from evil to worse; I am afraid that all
the bloodshed since the sword was drawn in the Nations
about, all the sacked Cities all the burnt dorps &amp; villages,
all the wasted Countries, all the slain of the Lord by sea
or Land, all the pillagings, rapes, Murders outrages
(which rage it self, could hardly outdo) all the horrid &amp;
inhumane Cruelties, that have been committed during
this bloody war (wherein the sea hath been dyed, and
the Land as it were drouned with the blood of the slain)
all the truculent &amp; treacherous Murthers of that Monster
<hi>Alva</hi> in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> all the incredible Cruelties
of the <hi>Guises,</hi> and the bloodshed in the Massacres of
<hi>France,</hi> all the Tortures that the people of the Lord have
been put to in the valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> by that Litle fierce
Tyger the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> all the savage and barbarous
butcheries of the <hi>Irish</hi> Massacre; shall be forgotten, or
seem things not to be mentioned in one day; when what
shall be done in <hi>Brittain</hi> comes to be reinembered. O
<hi>Brittain ô Brittain:</hi> of all Nations under the Cope of
Heaven, most ripe for the sickle of vengeance! shall this
Throne of iniquity, which hath framed so many mischiefs
into Laws, and all that are Complices in this wicked Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie,
who now are gathering themselves against the
soul of the Righteous, &amp; condemning the innocent
blood, be able to save its subjects, when He comes to
make inquisition for that blood? or shall the subjects
calling in all from 60 to 16, be able to support the
Throne? Alas! in vain shall they offer to draw up, and
draw the sword &amp; defend, when the Lord God of hosts
drawes His sword, to accomplish upon them the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:41139:376"/>
written, &amp; wrapt up in these words, <hi>He shall
bring upon them their oun iniquity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and shall cut them off in their

if it come to this, then in that day escape who will,
Professing Gentlemen, and others who in this have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with the Rulers, shall not escape: Then shall they
be payed for this Payment. The storme of His displeasure
(even thô they get their souls for a prey, yea so much the
more as He will not suffer them to perish eternally) shall
be observed to fall particularly upon their houses, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
&amp; Estates. Who can think upon the wickedness
of <hi>Brittain,</hi> with its just aggravations, and imagine the
righteous Lord will proportion His Judgments, to the
heinousness of our guilt, and His revenges to the rage,
whereby He, and His Christ hath been, and is opposed,
and take other measures?</q>
               </p>
               <p>4. From the <hi>Nature</hi> of these <hi>Payments,</hi> it is not our they
are sinful <hi>Complyances</hi> &amp; Transactions with Christs declared
Enemies, and do partake of Unitive Confederacies with
them; which are demonstrated to be sinful, <hi>Head 3. Arg.
1. in gen. Pag.</hi> Certainly such bargains cannot be discretive,
exacted and complied with by Persons no wayes incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
together, being only overcome by meer force: since
they are not only demanded and granted Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of that Power that imposes them, as legally Lording
over them, but obediential submissions to these wicked
Laws that enacts them; which is a formal justifying of
these Laws: For Laws cannot be obeyed except they be
justified, seeing Laws unjust and unjustifyable cannot be
obeyed. Therefore, seeing the Payment of the <hi>Cess,
Locality, Fynes stipends, fees</hi> &amp;c. is an obediential Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with the Laws that enjoyn them, that obedience
can no more be justified, than the Laws enacting such
Payments: which none can justify but he that is an enemy
to those things for opposing which they are exacted. If
then Complyances with the wicked Impositions &amp;
exactions of Arbitrary Dominators, enemies to the Work
&amp; People of God, be in Scripture condemned, then such
Payments cannot be justified: But such Complyances are
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:41139:377"/>
condemned, and cannot be approven. This was <hi>Issachars</hi>
brand, that being a <hi>strong Ass,</hi> he couched between burd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,
and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant
to Tribute <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 14. This was <hi>Asa's</hi> folly, that he so
far Complyed with <hi>Benhadad,</hi> as to give money to take his
help 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 18. Condemned by the Prophet <hi>Hanani
2 Chron.</hi> 16. 7. &amp;c. much more if he had given it to help
him. Its one of the instances of the Evil that <hi>Menahem</hi> did
in the sight of the Lord, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 18—2c. that when
<hi>Pul</hi> the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> came against the Land he gave him
a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with
him, which he exacted of <hi>Israel:</hi> This was certainly evil
in the sight of the Lord, for if the Confederacy was evil,
then this price to procure it was evil also: And if <hi>Menahems</hi>
exaction was evil, then <hi>Israels</hi> Complyance was evil also;
for thus <hi>Ephraim</hi> was oppressed &amp; broken in judgement,
because he <hi>willingly walked after the Commandment, Hos.</hi>
5. 11. It was also a part &amp; proof of <hi>Ahaz's</hi> Confederacy
with <hi>Tiglith-Pileser</hi> King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> that he sent money to
him 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 8. Which to all the fearers of the Lord is
condemned &amp; discharged <hi>Isai.</hi> 8. 12, 13. Which if it was
evil, then also <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Complyance with <hi>Sennacherib,</hi>
giving him money, and offering to <hi>bear</hi> that which was <hi>put
on him, 2 King.</hi> 18. 14, 15. was evil: And also <hi>Iehojakims</hi>
taxing the Land, to give the money according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of <hi>Pharoh 2 King.</hi> 23. 35. was sinful to the
Exacter, and likewise to the Complyers. These were all
sinful Complyances and Confederacies with the wicked,
making their peace with them to whom they payed them:
Therefore all Peace-making payments, by way of
Unitive aggreement with the wicked, must be sinful. And
accordingly in the time of <hi>Montrose,</hi> the <hi>Gen. Ass.</hi> made
an Act for <hi>Censuring the Complyers with the Publick Enemies
of this Church &amp; Kingdom, Iun. 17. 1646. Sess.</hi> 14. See
<hi>Part. 1. Per. 5. Pag.</hi> 82.</p>
               <p>5. Where these Exactions are extorted only as badges
of bondage, without Consent unto the Law imposing
them, its a Case more suitable for lamentation then Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that <hi>she that was Princess among the Provinces should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:41139:377"/>
tributary Lam.</hi> 1. 1. But when they are Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgemens
of the Lawgivers, and an exact obedience to the
Law, and voluntary agreement &amp; bargain with them,
strengthening them to the prosecution of their Mischiefs,
they cannot be free of the Imposers sin. It was the sin of the
men of <hi>Shechem,</hi> and a proof of their hearts <hi>inclination</hi> to
follow <hi>Abimelech,</hi> that they gave him threescore and ten
pieces of silver, enabling him to kill threescore &amp; ten per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and to hire vain &amp; light persons to follow him, which
they payed as an acknowledgement of his usurped Power,
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 9. 3—5. for which afterwards fire came out of the
house of <hi>Abimelech</hi> &amp; devoured them. Certainly a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
consent into a Mischief is a partaking with the sin of it,
a consent unto Theft is a partaking with it <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 18. But
if there be any consent unto a Mischief, it must be when
the person agrees it be done against himself, and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
subjects himself to the force of the Law imposing it,
and not only does not oppose or witness against the doing
of it against others, but yeelds to its reaching himself, and
gives what is demanded to strengthen the Robbers to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their Robberie over all. As the Payer of the <hi>Cess,
Fynes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Fees,</hi> &amp;c. gives all the consent required of him,
to these Mischiefs framed into Law, not only to rob him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but the Church &amp; Nation of its dearest Treasure the
Gospel, for the punishment of ouning which, and as means
to remove it, these Payments are exacted. But the Plea of
the payers is, that they are constrained to it, and they do
it against their will. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1 He who sayes he understands
this, that the Payer of these Exactions can purge himself of
the guilt of them, is like to buy an after wit at a dear rate.
Can it be thought by any man of knowledge &amp; conscience,
that so remote a force makes the deed unvoluntary, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the payer is purged from the guilt of accession to the
Imposers deed, whom hereby in this very Imposition he
ounes as his Representatives! 2. The payment cannot be
involuntary; for the Law enjoyning it, being the publick
&amp; declared will of the Nation, requires no other volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tareness
but obedience, and judgeth no other thing invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntareness
but disobedience. So that the Law being fatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:41139:378"/>
it absolves the Satisfier from all transgression, and
looks npon all who yeeld obedience as equally willing, and
equally out of the reach of its appended penaltie, in case of
disobedience. Neither are we to please our selves with
other fancies &amp; fictitious unwillingness, when real obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is yeelded, whereby the Law is satisfied, and the
Law-maker capacitated thereby to act all his intended Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.
For to be unwilling to part with money in the Case,
as it is no vertue in it self, so I suppose there are few who
will be sollicitous to purge themselves of this. And to be
unwilling from some struglings of light &amp; conscience, is
such an unwillingness as aggravates the guilt of the Giver,
and makes it more heinous in the sight of God, and hateful
in the eyes of all tender men: The Law enjoyning such
payments takes no notice of such reluctancies, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
obedience, and when that is yeelded, the Law is
satisfied, as to the voluntareness of the Action, and must
construe the Agent a willing walker after the Command,
and a voluntary Complyer with the publick will of the
Nation. 3. It must be simply, really, &amp; truly a voluntary
deed, when there is <hi>Deliberation</hi> and <hi>Election.</hi> The Law
requiring these payments being promulgate, every man
must be supposed to put the question to himself, what shall
I do in the case? Shall I obey and be free? Or disobey and
suffer? Here is Election &amp; choice upon mature deliberation:
And so the deed becomes truly voluntary. This will be
confirmed, if we consider the Law of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 25.
concerning <hi>Rapes.</hi> Where, to make the unvoluntareness
of the betrothed Virgin, she must not only be supposed to
strugle &amp; resist the attempt made upon her chastitie &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
by the villain, but she must cry for assistence in that
resistence, without which she is held in Law willingly to
consent to the committing of that wickedness. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
if we consider the Law <hi>vers.</hi> 13. it will be manifest, in
order to her escaping of death, that when violented and the
villain hath committed this villany, she is to carry as <hi>Tamar</hi>
(when defiled of that beast, thô of the blood Royal) did
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 19. that is, to complain &amp; cry, and crave
Justice against him, and be wanting in nothing, that may
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:41139:378"/>
bring him to condign punishment. This doth aptly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond
to our Case. <hi>Scotland</hi> is the betrothed Virgin: We
were espoused to Jesus Christ, and joyned to Him, by a
Marriage Covenant, never to be forgotten; But the
Rulers, and with them the body of the Land have treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
broken it: yet there is a Remnant that adhere to Him
as Head &amp; Husband; because of which, these called Rulers
incensed against Him will violently commit a <hi>Rape</hi> upon
them, and have them prostitute their bodies, their fortunes,
yea their Souls &amp; Consciences to their lusts, and thus they
will needs ravish the Queen in the Kings presence. And so,
while with displayed banner they declare they will drive
our Covenanted Husband out of the Nation, and destroy
all who will oune Him as such, they call for our Assistence
&amp; Complyance, to enable them to accomplish this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.
Now either must we make all the Resistence that is
in our power; or the Law judgeth us willingly to consent;
and because of that we fall in the hands of the righteous
Judge, and have neither the evidence of our Resisting, nor
Crying, nor pursuing the wicked for this violent <hi>Rape,</hi> to
produce and plead upon, why Sentence should not pass,
and the Laws just severity be execute upon us. What? Alas!
do they declare they will stone our Husband? (Ah! for
which of His good deeds is this done) And shall they make
a Law whereby we shall be obliged to furnish them with
stones to do it? And shall they be obeyed? Is this our
strugling? Is this our Crying? Is this our endeavour that
the wicked may be brought to condign punishment? Oh!
let us meditate terror, lest we be brought forth as willing
Consenters! For whatever vengeance the jealous &amp; just
God shall execute upon them, who have committed the
Rapt, shall equally, in its crushing &amp; everlastingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
weight, fall upon them who do not by their-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing,
&amp; their Resisting make their unwillingness manifest;
which in the present Case is their strugling their Crying, and
calling God and man, to witness, they are not Consenters,
but continue constant &amp; loyal in their love to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed
Husband.</p>
               <p>6. A formal <hi>Consent</hi> to the wickedness of these Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:41139:379"/>
were the less matter, if the payment of them were
not also a <hi>Concurrence</hi> to assist them, and a strengthening
their hands in it. But this is so manifest, that the paying of
the <hi>Cess, Locality, Fynes, Fees,</hi> &amp;c. is a Concurrence with
and a Contributing towards the promoving the wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
for which they are imposed, that he must have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of brass, and in a great measure seared who will
run upon such a formal Engagement against the Lord and
His anointed King in <hi>Zion.</hi> If it was <hi>Aarons</hi> sin which <hi>made
the people naked,</hi> and <hi>which brought so great a sin upon them,</hi> to
take, and the peoples sin &amp; shame to give, that Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of Golden ear-rings for making a Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 3.
&amp;c. And if it was <hi>Gideons</hi> sin to take, and <hi>Israels</hi> to give, that
Contribution of the ear-rings of their prey, to make an
<hi>Ephod Iudg.</hi> 8. 25. Then, as it is our oppressors sin to take,
so it must be our sin &amp; shame to give, their demanded
Exaction to help them in erecting such Idols of Jealousie,
as they have set up, and are commanding al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to bow to,
to provoke the Lord to Jealousie, especially when they
affrontedly require such Contributions to be payed, both as
punishments for not assisting, and as means to assist in their
establishment. <hi>Should we thus help the ungodly, and love them
that hate the Lord?</hi> And will not this bring doun <hi>wrath</hi> upon
us <hi>from the Lord? 2 Chron.</hi> 19. 2. Alas! instead of Arguing,
it were more fitt to fall a weeping, when its come to be a
question amongst us, whether, in stead of coming to the
<hi>help of the Lord, against the Mighty,</hi> we shall really <hi>help the
Mighty against the Lord,</hi> and that while they call for our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
formally upon this declared account. As the very
inscription of their Acts does carry it in their front, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>supply to his Majestie</hi> &amp;c. If this be not a <hi>Casting in a Lot
among them,</hi> who can tell what it is? Sure it is a <hi>preparing a
table for that troup,</hi> and a <hi>furnishing a drink-offering unto that
number, Isai.</hi> 65. 31. Seeing it is a supplying them with
necessaries, to solemnize their Idolatrous fest vities, who
forsake the Lord, and not only forget but lay waste His
Holy Mountain, for which all that have any accession to
it, are threatned to be numbered to the sword. If any thing
be a <hi>strengthening the hands of evil doers, Ier.</hi> 23. 14. certainly
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:41139:379"/>
this is. For as they cannot accomplish their cursed ends
without these Exactions, so the payment of them, is all
the present, personal, &amp; publick Concurrence in wageing
this war with Heaven, that is required of the Nation, to
wit, such a summ to furnish them with all necessaries,
and maintain the Executioners of their hell-hatched and
Heaven-daring Decrees &amp; Orders: And the Law requiring
no more but contributing what is appointed, looks equally
upon all the Givers, as followers of the Command, and
active Concurrers in complying with its end, and carrying
on &amp; promoving its design, and so assoils them from all the
statute serverities, in case of Deficiencie.</p>
               <p>7. If it were only a <hi>Concurrence</hi> in their wickedness to
pay those their Exacted supplies, it were more easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with: But I fear it shall be found a <hi>hire</hi> &amp; <hi>reward</hi> for
their wicked service. At first they were only enacted &amp;
exacted as <hi>Helps</hi> to capacitate this Popish Prelatical &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
faction to prosecute the war they had undertaken
&amp; declared against Christ: But now, having thereby been
enabled to carry it through this length that they have almost
got all visible Appearances for Christ, in ouning His
Gospel, and propagating His Testimony, quite suppressed
by means of these Impositions, and having got the fields
cleared of those that formerly opposed their Course &amp;
Career, and all obstacles removed that might stand in the
way of the Reception, they have prepared for their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris,
the <hi>Babylonish</hi> lady, the <hi>Mother of Harlots;</hi> they now
demand these payments, as their wages and <hi>Hire</hi> for
their labour: Which to pay now is more than a justifying,
seeing it is a rewarding them for their work. And to pay
these Pimps, and to purchase their peace thereby, is worse
than to <hi>bring the hire of a whore into the House of the Lord (Deut.</hi>
23. 18.) since it is a hyring them to bring the whore into
the House of the Lord. O how hath <hi>Scotland</hi> plaid the
Harlot with many Lovers! Is this the zeal we should have
had to our Covenanted husband, and the honour of His
House, that we have not only suffered His Enemies, to
come in and take Possession of it, but Consented to their
invasion, and not only Consented, but Invited them to
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:41139:380"/>
come in, and not only Invited them, but Prostitute our
Estates &amp; Consciences also to their Arbitrary Lusts, and
not only plaid the harlot with them, but hyred them also
when they had done! And for this the Lord may say to
<hi>Scotland,</hi> as He said to His People of old, <hi>They give gifts to
all whores, but thow givest thy gifts to all thy Lovers, and hirest
them that they may come unto thee on every side, for thy whoredome;
And the Contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms—in
that thow givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee,
therefore thow art contrary, Ezek.</hi> 16. 33, 34. There <hi>Israel</hi> is
taxed for hyring the <hi>Assyrians:</hi> But let it be considered and
enquired into in the History, how this was: What evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
can be given of this in their Transactions with them?
Was only that they were entysed, or did entyse them into
a Communion with their Idolatry? It is true, <hi>Ahaz</hi> may
be an instance of that, in his sending the pattern of the
Altar he saw at <hi>Damascus, 2 King.</hi> 16. 10. And it cannot
be denyed but in several respects they did partake with the
<hi>Assyrians</hi> in their <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> which was their <hi>Adulterie.</hi>
But what could be their hire they gave them for it, if it was
not their Taxations they payed, and money they sent unto
them? as <hi>Ahaz</hi> did <hi>vers.</hi> 8. and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> also, thô a good
man, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 14, 15. Which can no more be justified,
than <hi>Asa's</hi> paying to <hi>Benhadad.</hi> It was then their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies,
and the hire of them the Lord calls the hire they
gave unto their lovers. With this also <hi>Ephraim</hi> is charged,
that he hyred lovers, <hi>Hos.</hi> 8. 9, 10. of this we have instances
in <hi>Menahems</hi> giving to <hi>Pul</hi> a thousand Talents of silver,
and exacting it of the People, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 19. 20. And in
<hi>Hoshea</hi> his becoming servant to <hi>Shalmanesar</hi> King of <hi>Assyria,</hi>
and giving him presents, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 3. If then hyring wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men in Confederacies to help the Lords People, be a
hyring of lovers so much condemned in Scripture, what
must a hiring of them to hurt them, and rewarding them
after they have done, and when they formally seek it for
such work be? but a giving the reward they seek to slay the
Innocent (<hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 25.) and a voluntary yeelding that
which they take (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 12.) Which if it be sin in the
Takers, cannot be justified in the Givers, but will render
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:41139:380"/>
both obnoxious to the Indignation of a provoked God, in
the day when He shall begin to Contend for the wrongs
He hath got, both by the Work and the wages. Now let
all the Acts for the <hi>Cess</hi> and <hi>Continuation</hi> thereof, and other
Acts &amp; Edicts for <hi>fines</hi> &amp; <hi>forfeitures,</hi> be considered in their
just import, according to the trwe meaning of the Enacters,
and the Causes for which they exact them, and will have
them Complyed with, It will be found they were both
declared, intended, &amp; improved, and accordingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the Complyers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not only as <hi>Helps</hi> but as <hi>Hyres</hi>
for our Oppressours and Destroyers, and for such as have
been, and are more destructive and explicitely declared
Enemies to Christs Interests &amp; People in <hi>Scotland,</hi> than
ever the <hi>Assyrians</hi> were to the Church in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The <hi>Cess</hi> was not only a help but a hire to the Tyrant
&amp; His Complices, for suppressing Meetings for Gospel
Ordinances; Especially the <hi>Continuation</hi> of it, from time
to time was <hi>humbly, unanimously, chearfully &amp; heartily offered,
for themselves and in name of, and as representing this Kingd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m,</hi>
as a hire for the doing of it, and an encouragment to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
what remained of these <hi>Conventicles.</hi> The <hi>Localitie</hi> was
intended as a help to the Souldiers in their quarterings
upon this account, But afterwards, being expressly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
to be furnished without payment according to
the current rates of the Countrie, <hi>Act. 3. Parl.</hi> 3. K. <hi>Char.

not only for a punishment of Contraveeners of their
wicked Laws, but for a hire to their most violent Execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
<hi>Stipends</hi> for a hire to their <hi>Hireling Curats.</hi> And <hi>fees</hi>
as a hire to <hi>Iaylors</hi> to keep the Lords People in bondage.
By which hyres these destroyers have been rewarded, by
them whom they have destroyed, and for which the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Lord will reward both.</p>
               <p>8. Let it be considered, how far these submissions are
short of, and how clearly these Complyances are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with, that duty which lies upon us with reference
to them. Our obligation to God and our Brethren doth
indispensibly bird us to a Contrary carriage. If it bind us
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:41139:381"/>
in our Station &amp; Capacity to an Active renitency, It doth
much more bind us up from such Complyances. Neither
is it imaginable, how Moral force can ever justify our doing
that deed, we are obliged by all imaginable bonds, yea if
in any probable Capacity, by the utmost of real force, to
counteract. Can we give them that which they require,
and by which they are enabled to murder our Brethren,
which we are so indispensibly obliged to rescue our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 11, 12. to relieve the oppressed <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. 27.
to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the heavy
burdens, to let the oppressed go free, and to break ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
yoke <hi>Isai.</hi> 58. 6. What do we owe to these Enemies, but
seeing they have constitute themselves by these Acts impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Enemies to Christ, His People &amp; Interests <hi>in habitu,</hi>
not only plainly &amp; importunately to pray that He would
overturn them, but to oppose their Course, to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of our power, and to concur to wrest that power out
of their hands? And since they will needs make the whole
Nation a Curse, they are so far from being to be complyed
with, that for these Exactings &amp; Exactions they are to be
looked upon, and carried unto, not only as these who
have sold themselves to work wickedness, but endeavour
also to engage with themselves all in the same guilt, and
expose them to the same Curse. And therefore that the
Anger of the Lord may be turned away from His people,
every one in his station is obliged to endeavour to bring
these <hi>Achans</hi> to condign punishment.</p>
               <p>9. As it must be taken for granted, that these wicked
Oppressions by Law are <hi>Perjurie</hi> avouched in the sight of
God, yea in a peculiar manner, our Covenanted subjection
unto Him is turned into an open War against Him: So we
cannot but beleeve, that for this hight of wickedness the
Curse of God (to which in the Covenant the Nation in
case of breach, is liable by their oun consent) and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators
Malediction shall follow, pursue, overtake, and
fall upon the head of these, who have made the Decrees,
and upon all who concur in the execution, and carry on
this Course: Oh! its impossible to keep them company,
and not fall with them into the hands of the living God.
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:41139:381"/>
Well then, seeing every one from whom these Exactions
are required, is under an anterior obligation to God and
the Brethren, to preserve these precious Interests, which
the Imposers have been long essaying to root out &amp; ruine,
and His people whom they have been destroying, with the
loss of all he hath, life not excepted. (For I suppose none,
who acknowledgeth his Soul is still under the bond of the
Covenant (and its like to cost him his soul who denies it)
but he will oune this to be duty; Nay none who hath any
sense of Religion, but abstracting from the subjective ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of a sworn Covenant, he will oune an objective
obligation from the Law of the great superior, that doth
immediately bind the Conscience to witness against this
course, and to lay doun, if it should come to that, his
life for his Brethren) Then for a man to give his goods to
destroy these things &amp; persons, which he is obliged to
defend &amp; preserve with the loss of all, is so clear a making
himself a Tyransgressor, in paying his proportion, and
being at the expense of destroying what he built, and
building what he destroyed, that it seems inexplicable
how he can dream to be innocent; especially when more
lies upon it than the souls of the Complyers are worth,
even the Interest of Christ in the Land. And to close this
I would put home the question, and pose the Conscience
of any that took that Covenant; If in that day the question
had been asked at him whether he would have judged the
paying of a <hi>Cess</hi> for the ends narrated, to suppress a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
for that Covenanted Reformation, the paying of
<hi>fines</hi> &amp; <hi>fees</hi> (for ouning it) to the overturners, Breakers &amp;
Burners of it, to be a plain Perjurie &amp; palpable counteract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ends thereof? And let him speak his soul, and
its beyond debate with me, he will not dare to say he took
it in a sense which can subsist with these Complyances. Nay
I doubt not, if to any Morally serious, it had been then
said, yow will pay money &amp;c. for destroying this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and its ends, and deleting the Remnant that shall be
found to adhere to it, he would have given <hi>Hazaels</hi> answer.
It concerns every man, that would be free of the Curse
of it, to consider how he is brought to make enquirie
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:41139:382"/>
after vowes; or to dream of Consistencies betwixt the
performing those Engagements, and the plainest concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in a Counteracting thereof.</p>
               <p>10. If then these Impositions be so wicked, and for such
wicked Ends &amp; Causes; Then, in order to my being free
of this heinous guilt there is a necessity of my giving a <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,</hi>
and such an one, which when brought to the
Touchstone, will get Gods approbation, and be my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance
from a Concurrence. Now it is not imaginable
that my Testimony, can be the exact obedience to the
Law, against the wickedness whereof it is witnessed: But
on the Contrary, it must be at least a plain &amp; positive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to yeeld obedience to that Law, when I am in no
other case to counteract these Commands, for I must either
obey and be guilty, or refuse and be innocent. I shall not
here plunge into the Labyrinth of these debates &amp; difficulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
wherewith this matter of Testimonies hath been
perplexed, and mostly by those who have had no great
mind to the thing. I shall only propound these few Queries
(1) Wether any thing less than a Testimony can free me of
this guilt, whereby the Nation involved in it, is made
a Curse? (2) Wether we beleeve that the Testimony of
every one shall be called for, in the day when God shall
seek out this wickedness? (3) Whether, if ever it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
it be not then when Christ is openly opposed, and
every one is called either to concur or to testifie? (4) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Testimony against a wicked Law must not be not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our?
for my Testimony must make it evident that the Law
is not obeyed by me, else it is no Testimony. (5) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not necessary also, that it be with that plainness
&amp; boldness, as it may keep some proportion with the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giousness
of that wickedness testified against? (6) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the making it a Testimony indeed, it is not only
required, that an opposition be made at first, out that this
be so persisted in, as by no subsequent deed, it be weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
(7) Whether we do not take it for granted, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as a man hath Testified, the sentence of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Judge shall pass? For he who hath not purged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
thereby from the guilt of this Conspiracy, shall be led
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:41139:382"/>
forth &amp; punished with these Workers of iniquity. Its a
saying which should sink in the soul of every one who
would be saved, especially in such a day, <hi>Whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall Confess me before men, him will I Confess also before
my Father which is in Heaven, but whosoever shall deny me before
men him will I also deny &amp;c.</hi> Oh that men would now judge
of things &amp; Courses, as in that hour they desire to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and then there would be litle difficulty, what to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
in the Case.</p>
               <p>11. From what is said it appears, that there is no other
way of Testifying against it, or shunning the sin of this
wickedness, imposing &amp; enjoyning these Complyances,
but by Refusing them: Which as it is clear duty, so it hath
many <hi>Advantages</hi> to countervail all the supposed loss that
can be sustained thereby. It is a shameful subterfuge to say,
I strengthen them more by doing thus which will make
them take all, and so put themselves in better case to do
the Mischief decreed. For as it is then my suffering not my
sin, so it is simply false that I do hereby strengthen their
hands; for hereby I do more certainly weaken their hands,
and wound their Cause by my Counteracting, Testifying
&amp; Suffering. For. 1. I do really to the uttermost of the
sphere of my activity Counteract their design, And hence
besides my oun upmaking Peace of Conscience (which is
my hundredfold in this Life) I glorify God in the day of
visitation, behaving as the Subject &amp; Souldier of the Prince
<hi>Michael:</hi> And thô I losse my life in the Conflict, yet the
victory over the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and his Lievtennant &amp; Trustees,
and their <hi>Lictors</hi> is thereby gained, and they are foiled,
while I fight &amp; overcome by my not loving my life in the
present case unto the death. 2. I do by my example en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
my Brethren to stand fast, and withstand in this
evil day. 3. I hereby transmitt to Posterity a Pattern for
imitation, and so propogate an opposition to this Course
to succeeding generations. 4. I hereby (so to speak) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
God to arise &amp; appear to plead His oun Cause and
His Peoples. For when we out of love to Him and zeal
for His Interests, take our lives in our hands, or expose
our substance as a prey in witnessing for Him, then He is
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:41139:383"/>
engaged to oune us, and to plead His Cause taking the
quarrel then to be against Himself. Hence it is that when
He puts on the Garments of vengeance for cloathing,
and goes forth to meet them who in their risings up against
His People run upon the bosses of His Buckler, His Arm
is said to bring salvation to Himself, <hi>Isai.</hi> 59. 16, 17. and
<hi>Isai.</hi> 63. 5. This keeps a man in case to Pray against such a
Partie; Whereas a Complyance with them in the least
degree, will wound a mans faith, and weaken His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
so that he cannot wrestle with God to prevail:
For that wherein his strength lay, a good Conscience
being sinned away, in vain doeth he essay, when he hath
cut his oun hair, to shake himself as at other times. Alas!
If by keeping a due distance from his enemies, we were in
case to play the <hi>Samsons</hi> or <hi>Iacobs</hi> on our knees, this Enemy
who think it their stability to stand upon the ruines of
Christs Interest, should not stand long upon their feet. He
who would have his prayer heard, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> should
make his Practice in a conformity thereto speak this plain
language, <hi>If I perish I perish,</hi> but Comply I will not: For
its not necessary that I live, or have an estate, but its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
I should witness a good Confession against the
wrongs done to Christ. 6. This keeps a man in case,
either to Act for God with advantage, if an opportunity
be put in his hand, or to Suffer, as under His supportings,
and the shinings of His face, whereby even while dieing
he becomes an Ornament to his Profession, gives a dash to
the Enemy, and so becomes more than a Conquerer.</p>
               <p>12. Let us consider the matter of Scandal in the present
case, and remember whose words these are, <hi>Wo to the
World because of offences,</hi> and <hi>Wo to him by whom offences <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ome:</hi>
And it will appear the payers of these Exactions become
highly guilty before God. 1. In stumbling &amp; hardening
this Partie of Enemies. For, thô there was never a Partie
before them in the Nation (and I much doubt if ever a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
can come after them to outdo them) who had so many
evidences of Plagues poured upon their hearts, that He
may pour furth His wrath, &amp; cause His fury to rest upon
them; And that, in His spotless Justice He will rain snares
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:41139:383"/>
upon them, that thereafter He may rain fire &amp; brimstone,
&amp; a horrible tempest as the portion of their Cup, when He
shall come to plead His oun Cause: yet we would beware
lest we do any thing that may embolden them, or make
them bless themselves in this their stated opposition to
Christs. And because we know not but some of the Elect,
may for a time be carried doun with the Current of this
impetuous opposition to Him, and may concur actively
for a season in promoving this Course, we ought even
upon this supposition so to witness, and so to keep a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from all apparent or interpretative Complyance
with what they contrive &amp; carry on, as they may by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
our stedfastness be provoked to consider their oun
Course; that considering at last how their feet go doun to
death, and their steps take hold on hell, they may hasten
their escape from the Company of His Enemies, lest they
be consumed with the fire of His Indignation, if found
congregate with the men of these God-provoking practices.
2. By paying what is required, I stumble also &amp; offend my
weak Brethren, while by my example they are encouraged
to rush into the same Complyance. O let every man,
whose Practice may be pleaded as a Pattern, remember
that Word, and who spoke it, <hi>It were better that a Mistone
were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the midst of the sea,
than offend any of these litle ones.</hi> 3. Sufferers for refusing this
payment are offended, when the payer doth not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Persecuters to proceed with rigor &amp; rage
against him as a peevish &amp; froward Malecontent, but does
what in him lies to wound the heart &amp; weaken the hands
of such a faithful Witness: Whereas, if the poor Sufferer
saw himself by a Joynt Testimony ouned by his Brethren,
he would be comforted, strengthened, &amp; become more
confident in the Conflict. 4. In paying these things, the
Complyers either by their Example lay a snare for the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
to whose knowledge their Carriage may come;
and so in stead of leaving them a Pattern of contending
earnestly for the faith, they spread a net for their feet, yea
pave them a way to defection &amp; Apostasie: Or else they
engage the Great God, out of zeal to His oun Glory, and
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:41139:384"/>
tenderness to His People who shall succeed, for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their following of such Progenitors, wherein they
have not been followers of Him fully, to give such a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
against their untenderness, and set such marks of
displeasure upon their Course, that the thoughts of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aside with them, and following their steps shall be
terrible to all that hear of it, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t for such a Complyance
they fall as they did, for falling from their oun stedfastness
into the hands of the living God. But Alas! for the Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
under whose Curse we are like to go off the stage,
because of our not having done what we ought, yea what
we might, both for transmitting pure Ordinances unto
them, and for not transcribing in our Pactice the noble
Example of our zealous &amp; Heroick Ancestors, who va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly
resisted vvhen violently attacqued, and by their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
wrestled us into a State of Liberty? Well, if we
leave those that shall succeed us such an Example as this,
He is like to make us such an Example as will fright the
following Generations, and force them to serve themselves
heirs to them who have gone before us, who did acquit
themselves as the good Souldiers of Jesus Christ, and not
to us, the debt of whose declensions &amp; defections cannot
be payed, without the destruction of those who shall serve
themselves heirs to us. But Alas! who does think on what
he owes to the poor Posterity! Or who doth make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to preserve for them that precious Treasure put
in our Custodie, and judges it more necessary than to live, to
leave the Tract of a way of Contending zealously for God,
and the Preservation of His Interests, and the Propogation
of His oun pure Ordinances to the Posteritie, shining so
clearly by suffering &amp; blood, as the way-faring man, and
they who shall come after, though fools need not erre
therein. Our only Comfort is, that the Lord who shall
see His seed, and must prolong His dayes, will make His
pleasure prosper, and preserve some to be Witnesses of it
to His Praise.</p>
