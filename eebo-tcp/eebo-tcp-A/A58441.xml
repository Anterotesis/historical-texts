            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ACcording to your Request, I send you Inclos'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Commissioners appointed by the Lords
of His Majestys most Honourable Privy Councill, for
enquiring into the <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Witchcrafts</hi> in the Shiriffdome of
<hi>Renfrew,</hi> of which I have had Opportunity of knowing more
than many others, as having been with the Commissioners on
the Tryalls; And shall add nothing here, save what passed at
the first <hi>Dyet</hi> of the <hi>Tryall,</hi> which was at <hi>Paislaw,</hi> where were
Met of the Commissioners, my Lord <hi>Blantyre,</hi> my Lord <hi>Halcraig,</hi>
Sir <hi>Iohn Maxwell</hi> of <hi>Polock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Francis Montgomery, Blackhall,
Duchall,</hi> with several others, to the Number of Eleven. There
was Deputed in the room of the King's Advocate, Three Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates,
<hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>John Menzies,</hi> Mr. <hi>Grant</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stuart.</hi>
The <hi>Panalls</hi> being 21 in number, were frequently call'd
to see if they could be brought to Confession; They were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
with <hi>Bargarens</hi> Daughter, and the three <hi>little Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
Elizabeth Anderson,</hi> and the two <hi>Lindsays.</hi> But they still
deny'd all: which put the Court to Cull out 7 of them, against
whom <hi>Threatnings,</hi> and some <hi>Malifice</hi> following could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
These were <hi>Margaret Lang,</hi> in <hi>Cartinpan,</hi> a Woman Famous
for <hi>Religion,</hi> ever since the 60 year of God, and really a Person
of extraordinary <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Wisdom;</hi> I know not whether to
call it <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Diabolical;</hi> but I have never heard a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
speak so <hi>Gravely, Pertinently,</hi> and <hi>Religiously</hi> both to the
<hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> then she did. The other were <hi>Katharine
Campbell, Agnes Nasmith, John</hi> and <hi>James Lindsays, Agnes Fostur,</hi>
and <hi>Margaret Fulton:</hi> This <hi>Kate Cambell</hi> is a young Well-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
Lass, 20 years of Age; but the rest most part Old, both
Men and Women.</p>
            <p>The Commissioners, after their first Assay to have them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
before they brought them to a Formal Tryal, would have
them Try'd by Pricking, which really to me seems strange, for
there was not any of them, save <hi>Margaret Fulton,</hi> but <hi>Marks</hi>
were found on them, which were altogether <hi>Incensible,</hi> That
a Needle of 3 Inches length was frequently put in without
their Knowledge, nor would any blood come from these places,
and tho many, especially <hi>Doctors,</hi> ridicul'd these as <hi>Storys,</hi> yet
after we cal'd Dr. <hi>Bisbin</hi> and <hi>Baird,</hi> and let them see a Needle
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50363:3"/>
of a great length put into the top of one of the <hi>Vertibrae</hi> of the
Back, and one into <hi>Margaret Lang,</hi> a handbreadth beneath her
Ribbs in the Region of the Lower Belly, they both thought it
wonderful, being in a place where, in another Woman, the
Needle could not but peirce the Gutts: All the other 14 were
also prickt and marks found in most of them. But I was most
concern'd for <hi>Martha Semple</hi> Daughter to <hi>Margaret Lang,</hi> who
was most exactly search'd twice, yet no mark found; tho the
pricker mist not to search the very <hi>Soles</hi> of her <hi>Feet</hi> and other
more <hi>Secret Places,</hi> for when there was any difficulty to find the
mark they did quite uncloath them, but then it was in a Room,
and not publickly, before one or two of the <hi>Justices,</hi> a <hi>Minister,</hi>
one of the <hi>Advocatrs,</hi> and the <hi>Clark,</hi> my Lord <hi>Halcraig</hi> and I
were only present with <hi>Martha;</hi> but realy she is as well <hi>Favourd</hi>
and <hi>Gentile</hi> a Lass as you'l look on, and about 17 or 18 years of
Age, I took up Mr. <hi>Wylie</hi> to her to see if he could bring her to
any Confession, he spoke long to her but she deny'd all notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of what you see in the Encloased paper, but she was
the only person amongst them all that ever I saw Weep.</p>
            <p>They were at last on the 15<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> to have been brought
to their Tryall, after 3 or 4 days triflling with them by prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to bring some of them to Confession, but just as the
Assize was constitute they mov'd to have a little more time to
provide themselves <hi>Advocates,</hi> which the <hi>Justices</hi> yeilded to,
and adjourn'd to the 2<hi>d. Tuesday</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and in this Interval
the two Brothers did Confess, and upon Examination said the
same things that the two <hi>Lindsays</hi> and <hi>Anderson</hi> had declared, as
you have it in the within Paper. Another Man also confes'd,
But the <hi>Devil</hi> Strangled him in Prison, for he was found fitting
in a Chair with a Cord about his Neck but slack and ty'd to
no thing. After the Adjournment the <hi>Judges</hi> met again, and
having Sufficient Evidence of several <hi>Mallefices</hi> done by each of
the Seaven above-named, with the Testimonys of the five Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
<hi>Witches,</hi> all concuring in the same Acts, Sentenc'd them
to be burn'd the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> which was accordingly Execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The other 14 being Respited till the <hi>Kings</hi> Advocates
Pleasure, among whom is one <hi>Morison</hi> Wife to <hi>Francis Duncan</hi>
in <hi>Greenock</hi> call'd in the paper the <hi>Devils Gentlewife Antiochia,</hi> on
whom many marks are found; of which you'l receive further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation

NARATIVE
Of the RECOGNITION Taken by the Commissioners, Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Lords of His Majesties
Privy-Council, for Enquiring into
the Witchcrafts, and Witches, in the
Shirrifdom of Renfrew; with Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Afflicted Case of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Shaw, Daughter to the Laird
of Bargarren. At the Place of <hi>Bargarren,</hi>
Feb. 5. 1697. Present, the Lord Blantyre, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE said <hi>Christian Shaw,</hi> being Confronted with one
<hi>Iames Lindsay</hi> (whom <hi>Elizabeth Anderson,</hi> one of the
Confessing <hi>Witches</hi> Under-written Declared, Was
one of the said <hi>Christians</hi> Troublers in her Fits) Did, upon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50363:4"/>
Touching the said <hi>Iames,</hi> take a very Violent Fit, Leaping,
Starting and Staring, with such a Stiffning of all her Joynts,
that it was hard for the Assistants to keep her from Falling,
and, at last, fell, as quite Dead, and Senseless, for some time;
and, after Recovery, being Confronted with one <hi>Catherine
Campbell,</hi> who being once Servant to her <hi>Father,</hi> for a Mis-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of her to her Mistress, <hi>Curst her;</hi> and is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
Instrument of all the said <hi>Christian</hi> her Trouble. The
said <hi>Katherine</hi> being by the said <hi>Commissioners</hi> Interrogate on
several Points, in the Hearing of the said <hi>Christian,</hi> she De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
all, and particularly her Accession to the said <hi>Christian</hi>
her Trouble, or the Rise thereof. But the Child still Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, Conjured her to tell the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> Why she
would never Pray, <hi>That God would deliver her from that Ill,
and Restore her well again. Katherine</hi> did not disown her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal,
but shifted about for frivolous Excuses which the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi>
bearing home on her, as a Great Argument of
her Guilt; and finding she could hardly evade the Force of
it, <hi>Katherine</hi> offers to run at the Child (they being then at
some distance from one another) and the Child did all she
could to shun her Touch. <hi>Katherine</hi> Complain'd; saying,
<hi>Now I would Pray for her, but she will not let me.</hi> But the
Child being forc'd to suffer her Touch by the By-standers,
the most Unwillingly, and with great Fear, she immediately
after fell down, in a most Violent Fit, as before, on <hi>Iames
Lindsay</hi>'s Touch: But thereupon <hi>Katherines</hi> Tongue was loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and she said, <hi>The Lord Bless her, The Lord Deliver her;</hi>
which nothing could Oblige her to do before: And the
Child her self declared, after that <hi>Fit,</hi> and <hi>Katherines</hi> Prayer,
she now found her self free of all Fear to Touch the said
<hi>Katherine,</hi> or any other of her Tormentors.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Commissioners</hi> were then Earnest with <hi>Katherine,</hi> to tell
why she would, or could <hi>not Pray</hi> before she Touch'd the
Child? But, to this, she could give no Satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the <hi>Commissioners</hi> call'd a <hi>Young Damsel,</hi> Nam'd
<hi>Elizabeth Anderson,</hi> whom they found a very Useful Person
in the said Enquiry, as being many times admitted by her
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50363:4"/>
               <hi>Father,</hi> and other <hi>Friends,</hi> to their Meetings with the <hi>Devil,</hi>
as her Confession hereto Subjoyned does Evidence, to which
you are Referr'd. As also the <hi>Commissioners</hi> having Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
<hi>Christian Shaw,</hi> about the Persons Represented to her
as her Tormentors in those Fits; and finding her Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Confirmed by <hi>Elizabeth Anderson</hi> her Confession, with
relation to many of the Persons Accused by <hi>Christian.</hi> The
<hi>Commissioners,</hi> on that Evidence, Ordered them all to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
(viz.) <hi>Alexander Anderson,</hi> Father to the said <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,
Agnes Nasmith, Iohn Lindsay</hi> in <hi>Barrcloch, Iohn Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi>
in <hi>Formachin, Iames Lindsay</hi> his Brother, <hi>Agnes Foster,
Margaret Fulton,</hi> and the said <hi>Katherine Campbell,</hi> where
they are to lie till farther Orders. But the said <hi>Christian
Shaw</hi> knows and remembers another Person, whom she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
she has not the Power to Name: And she has many
times attempted it, but is still seized with Fits when she
Assays to Express it; She came, at last, to say, for her first
Name, <hi>Margaret,</hi> or <hi>Pincht Margaret</hi> (a Name given her
by the <hi>Devil,</hi> from a Pincht Cross-Cloath, ordinarily worn
on her Brow) But cannot express her Patronimick, or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name.
The <hi>Commissioners</hi> were so concern'd at this, that
they urged her to Write it, which being loth to try for
fear of Torture, she nevertheless essayed it; And beginning
to Write other Names, she was desir'd to try that too, but
could Write no more save <hi>Margaret,</hi> and the Letter L. of
her Sirname, being presently taken with a most Violent
Fit, the Pen falling out of her hand, and she falling Dead, as
above, with Groans, heavier and sorer then ordinary. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a while the <hi>Commissioners</hi> having caus'd her to take a
little of a Julip, after her Recovery, some Ministers stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by, Presented her with a Bible, desiring her to Read a
Passage in it, which they pointed to her; but no sooner had
she cast her eyes on the Book, but instead of Reading, she fell
to Sing a very Melodious Tune, such as is used in <hi>Opera</hi>'s;
and, within a little while after fell in her Fits again, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
then the Musick ceas'd not, tho she appear'd as one dead,
with her Mouth open, but neither her Lips nor Tongue stirring,
She remain'd long in the Fit, till one of the <hi>Commissioners,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50363:5"/>
desir'd the Book might be Clos'd; which done, she Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
came to her Self; and being Askt what she meant by Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                  <hi>Elizabeth Anderson</hi> was with the Deceas'd <hi>Iean Fulton,</hi>
her Grandmother; and playing about the door of the House
she saw ane Black grim Man go into the House to her Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother;
who abode with her a considerable space, talking
with her; and afterward she came to the door, and desired
the said <hi>Elizabeth Anderson</hi> to come in; and upon her incoming,
desired her to take the Gentleman (as she named him) by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50363:6"/>
the Hand, and she would give her ane Bony Black new Coat,
which accordingly she did; which seemed to her very cold:
whereupon she was affraid, and immediatly he vanished and
went away. About a Month after her Grandmother and she
were both in the House together, when the aforesaid Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
appeared to them, (which the said <hi>Elizabeth</hi> then suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be the Devil) and he and her Grandmother fell a talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, by rounding in others Ears, but understood not
what they said; and afterward her Grandmother desired her
to take the Gentleman by the hand, but she refusing, saying,
It was the Devil, which her Grandmother denying, said, It
was a Gentleman a Friend of hers; and she still insisting and
threatning her if she would not take him by the hand, she
would get none of her Cloaths, but the said <hi>Elizabeth Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
would not be perswaded to do it, but saved her self from
him, saying, the Lord be between me and him, whereupon her
Grandmother said, she need not fear for it was not ill thing,
and upon that the Devil went away in a Flight, she knew not
how; and declares, for a long time after, she was no more
troubled with the said Gentleman. Till one time her Father
<hi>Alexander Anderson</hi> desired her to go with him through the
Country to seek their Meat; to which she replyed, she need
not go seek her Meat, seeing she might have Work: But her
Father pressing her, she went with him, where he took her
to ane <hi>Muir</hi> in <hi>Kilmacolme,</hi> where were gathered together,
before they came, <hi>Agnes Nasmith, Margaret Fulton, Iohn

her Renounce her Baptism, promising her if she would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
thereto, she should be better then she was then, and she
would get better Meat and better Cloaths, and she would
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50363:6"/>
not need to beg. But (as she declared) she would not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

thither? then she replied, That she came with her Father.
Whereupon the Devil and her Father went together, and
talked to one another; but she knew not where-about: And
declares that the cause of her meeting at that time (as she
said) was about the forming of a Picture, of Mr. <hi>William
Flemings</hi> Minister at <hi>Innerkeppe</hi> his Child, who at that time effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the same; the Main Actors being, her Father, <hi>Agnes Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith,

and heard the said <hi>Margaret Rodger</hi> say, stay a little till I
stop ane Pin in the Heart of it, which accordingly she did.
And declares, she went with her Father to the <hi>Ferrie-Boat</hi>

she said she saw the <hi>Devil</hi> in likness of a Man, she
seemed to be somewhat feared, and I desired her to say
<hi>The Lord Rebuke thee Satan,</hi> but the use of her Tongue was
taken from her, yet recovering it in a short space she
asayed to speak, but was presently seised with a Fit, and
when that was over she went about the Room deaf and
blind as you your self have seen her before, but still speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as to a Bumbee, said, <hi>VVith the Lords Strength thou shalt

thee in the Name of God to be gon and thy Papers too, for I

me then I for thee;</hi> then turning she went up and down the
Room as before, and again was bitten with Teeth in the
hands very deep, and Impressed with Nails of Fingers
more then twenty four times, which made her cry aloud
every time she received them, and shewing the place where
she was hurt by getting her hand upon it; but we neither
saw nor heard any thing about her. She continued in this
