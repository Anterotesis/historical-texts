            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CHristian Reader, I present vnto thee heere, a Sermon, preached by the right reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and learned Father the Lord Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> at the late Coronation of the Kings most excellent Maiestie: which hauing (with much adoe) obtained of a good friend of mine about his Lordship, I hope it shall no whit offend his Lordship, if by this meanes hee doe more seruice to the Church, then by the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it hee could doe in one (though so hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) assembly. I dare not presume to censure it. The Sermon it selfe, the Royall presence before which it was vttered, and the learning and grauitie of the Preacher, grace it much more, then whatsoeuer I could studie to say in commendation of it. Reade it therefore dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and learne by it to obey Gods ordinance willingly; and so I commit thee to God.</p>

            <p>SO true, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception it is,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> which the Apostle saieth in the next wordes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>There is no power but of God,</hi> that man at his first Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and in his perfection could haue no power ouer Beasts, Birds, and Fishes; till GOD with his owne voyce made him Ruler ouer his Creatures, and put all things in subiection vnder his feete.

Priuate and inferior powers, as the husband ouer his wife, the father ouer his children, the maister ouer his Seruantes, were to be allowed and ratified by God, from whome is all power, before they could be lawfull: Publike then and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our powers, as they containe and commaund all those gouernments, and farre exceede them, so must they haue a larger and stronger war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the worde of GOD, than any other Regiment hath.</p>
            <p>Which, that wee may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

perceiue, I thinke it fitte for this present time, and place, to obserue, not onely, how the Princes functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in generall is established by God, but more specially, how the braunches thereof, namely, their power, their honour, and their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice are ordained and confirmed of God. To expresse them more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly. Their Authoritie is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from GOD, resembling his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; Their dignitie is allowed of GOD, to partake with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: Their Duetie is enioyned them by GOD, to preserue his heretage. The first they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from GOD; the second they must receiue from men; the third they must yeelde to both. And first of resembling Gods Image.</p>
            <p>The likenesse that Princes haue with the kingdome of GOD and of Christ, consisteth in the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:2100:5"/>
of the names, and signes, which they haue common with Christ; in the <hi>Sufficiencie</hi> of the spirite, wherewith God indueth them; in the <hi>Sanctitie</hi> of their persons, which may not be violated in the <hi>Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie</hi> of their power, which must not be resisted.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 82.</note>The Societie of their names is euident. <hi>I haue sayd, ye are Gods, and all the Sonnes of the most High:</hi> And of this very Scripture our Sauiour saith,<note place="margin">Iohn 10.</note>

               <hi>Is God as Man, that hee should lie?</hi> Hath he spoken it, and wil he not performe it? <hi>Or shall his worde returne to him emptie,</hi> and without effect?

            <p>As Christ giueth Princes his name, by calling them <hi>Gods,</hi> and, the <hi>Sonnes</hi> of the most High: So he taketh their Names and Signes to shew the Vnitie and Soueraigntie of his Kingdome, and to seuer it from all other kindes of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for Christ is neuer called in Scripture, a <hi>Consull,</hi> a <hi>Senatour,</hi> or a <hi>Tribune</hi> of the People, but, <hi>the name on his garment, and on his thigh,</hi> as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Reuel. 19.</note> 
               <hi>is King of Kings,</hi> and, <hi>Lord of Lordes,</hi> that is, a most mightie King and Lord. Insomuch that when Christ is described in the Scriptures, as a King, all the ornaments and ensignes of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, are namely recited and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally referred to him, though in him they be spirituall and eternall, which to men must be materiall and

               <hi>Thy Throne, O God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for euer,</hi> saieth the Scripture of Christ, as the Apostle expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it,<note place="margin">Hebr. 1.</note> 
               <hi>The</hi> SCEPTER <hi>of thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is a Scepter of Righteousnesse.</hi> Wherefore,<note place="margin">Reuel. 19.</note> 
               <hi>God euen thy God, hath annoynted thee with the Oyle of Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse aboue thy Partners. On his head</hi> (saieth Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>are many Crowns, and out of his Mouth</hi> (as working his Wil by his Worde) <hi>goeth a sharpe</hi> SVVORD, <hi>wherewith hee shall smite the Heathen.</hi> To Princes then, as Partakers with Christ in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, honour and iustice of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome heere on Earth, are allowed of God a <hi>Sword,</hi> in signe of <hi>Power,</hi> a <hi>Crowne,</hi> in shew of <hi>Glory,</hi> a <hi>Scepter,</hi> for a token of <hi>Direction,</hi> a <hi>Throne</hi> for a seate of <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Iudgement</hi>; and <hi>Invnction</hi> as a pledge of outward <hi>Protection,</hi> and inward <hi>Infusion</hi> of grace. All which Signes and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

of a Kingdome since Christ assumeth from Princes, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to himselfe, he confirmeth to be lawfull in Princes, because they are common to them with him, who admitteth or accepteth no vnlawful or superstitious thing as pertinent to his person.</p>
            <p>The Spirit also, which Princes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from God, &amp; wherewith they are guided in doeing their office, sheweth their Resemblance with the Sonne of God. Men choose the fittest they can finde to supply their places, because they want meanes to make others meeter than they are. But God who worketh all in all according to the good pleasure of his wil, and hath power most abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to enable all his Agents for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny work he hath in hand; neuer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth any man to serue him, whome hee doth not furnish with gifts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording.
<pb facs="tcp:2100:8"/>
Workemen hee would haue none to the making or deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Tabernacle, but such as he replenished with the spirit of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding for that purpose: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets he neuer sent any, but with his words in their mouthes, and his truth in their hearts, which all their Aduersaries could not withstand: gouernors then, whose <hi>harts, mouths</hi> and <hi>hands,</hi> he vseth to keep his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in peace and pietie; God neuer chooseth any but he first endewed them with a Principal spirit. Whiles <hi>Moses</hi> alone sustayned the burden of the whole people in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the abundance of Gods spirit on <hi>Moses</hi> was sufficient for the whole: but when hee desired part of that labour to be eased, God <hi>took off the spirite,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 11.</note> which was vpon <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>diuided thereof</hi> to the seauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Elders, who assisted <hi>Moses.</hi> As

            <p>The inward Annoynting, which is the diffusing of heauenly wisedome &amp; corage in the harts of Princes, God testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by externall Inunction, when hee first appointed a King in <hi>Israel:</hi> And by that his Ordinance taught vs, that their persons once dedicated to his seruice, ar not only protected by his stretched out Arme, but are and ought to be <hi>Sacred</hi> &amp; <hi>Secured</hi> from the violence &amp; iniurie of al mens hands, mouthes, and hearts.<note place="margin">Psal. 105.</note>

               <pb facs="tcp:2100:10"/>The force of their Annointing being perpetual &amp; general, we must not think the outward action Iudaicall or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.

greatnes of the Honour they must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from men, in partaking with gods homage. The one is Gods ordinance as well as the other, for God hath not put Princes in his place, and giuen them his power, to be despised or disobeyed, but to be honoured and serued as his Lieutenants and Vicegerents here on earth.

            </p>
            <p>The Apostle in this place nameth three things due to Princely dignitie,
<pb facs="tcp:2100:14"/>
               <hi>Subiection, Honor,</hi> and <hi>Tribute</hi>: teaching vs, that Princes must be obeyed with conscience, Reuerence and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; with conscience acknowledging they are ordained of God, whose will is always the only sure ground of a good conscience. It is therfore sin to despise or refuse, their Lawes commaunding that which is good, &amp; likewise to resist or reproch their power, punishing that which is euill euen in our selues. In the one appeareth Gods will directing our outward actions heere on Earth; in the other, Gods hand reforming our vices, whiles here wee liue, and since in either we must obey for conscience, in neither can wee resist without euident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods ordinance. Howbeit when Princes cease to command for god, or bend their swords against God, whose Ministers they are: we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence their Power, but refuse their willes. It is no resistaunce to obey the greater before the lesser, neither hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man cause to be offended, when god is preferred. Yet must wee not reiect
<pb facs="tcp:2100:15"/>
their yoke with violence, but rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure their Swordes with patience, that God may be Iudge betweene Prince and People, with whome is no vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, nor respect of persons.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13. v. 4.</note>Reuerence due to Princes must come from the whole man, and haue the whole man, that is, it must haue the loue of our harts, the prayer of our lips, and the submission of our bodies. <hi>They are Gods Ministers for our wealth.</hi> They must therefore be loued euen from the hart. We must loue their places appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by god to partake, aswel with his ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nor, as with his power. We must loue their Persons giuen vs of God insteede of Parents, and doing that for vs, which naturall Parents cannot do. Wee must loue their paines, procuring vs greater benifits then any we can yeeld to them, and so leauing vs stil their debtors, when we haue done our most and best seruice to them.</p>
            <p>For which cause our power failing vs to requite them as wee ought, wee must pray to the God of all power, for
<pb facs="tcp:2100:15"/>
the safetie, peace, and prosperitie of Princes, that our prayers may testifie the zeale of our hearts, and desire of our willes, to obtaine from God farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter recompence for them, then wee can any way render them. Yet may we not slacke to do them all the honor we can, aswell with humilitie of the outwarde Man, as with fidelitie of the inward. When S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Honour the King,</hi> we must not thence exclude bodily ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which is sensible to others, and restraine it to the honour of the minde, which neither wee can shew, nor they can see, but by externall signes. The Commaundements of God binde the whole Man: no part is exempted where Submission is required.</p>
            <p>And because it is growen a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion in needelesse curtesie to bow and touch the anckle, and in necessarie due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to stand starke and stiffe, let vs see in a word or two, whether the Custome of this Countrie, in kneeling to their Princes, bee seruilitie or flatterie, as some reckon it, or a parte of their due

honour and dignitie. <hi>Ioseph</hi> suffered his Brethren to bow <hi>downe to the ground</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,<note place="margin">Genes. 43.</note> as hee dreamt and saide they should, and yet was <hi>Ioseph</hi> but the next person to King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.

               <hi>bowed himselfe with his face to the Earth before Saul</hi>: and when he was King,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 9.</note> he receiued the like homage from <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ionathan,</hi>

               <hi>bowed himselfe</hi> (saieth the Scripture) to King <hi>Dauid, with his face on the ground,</hi> when hee asked him, who should sit on his Throne after him. God neuer alloweth the outward Man to dissent from the inward in any kinde of dutie: the mouth blesseth, where the heart loueth: and the bodie stoopeth, when the minde honoureth.</p>
            <p>The third point which belongeth to Princely dignitie, is that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle calleth <hi>Custome</hi> and <hi>Tribute,</hi> I call Recompence. The dutie may not be denied, howsoeuer the reason thereof may be somewhat varied.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.6.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore pay ye also Tribute,</hi> saith the Apostle. If wee referre this to the former words, you must be subiect, for therefore pay ye tribute, then is <hi>Tribute</hi> a <hi>signe</hi> or sequele of our <hi>subiection:</hi> For since wee our selues must be subiect, all that is ours, both goods and lands must needes be vnder the same condition. More wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy are our bodies then our goods, and our liues then our lands. If the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb facs="tcp:2100:17"/>
be not exempted from Subiection, how should the Accessarie? If we refer it to the words following, for this cause pay we Tribute, for they are Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters attending their charge, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is very sound and dependeth on the maine proportion of Gods Iustice and prouidence. Parents must be requited, because they cared for vs, when wee could not help our selues. Preachers must be maintained because they labor in the Word and Doctrine; generally God would haue no man attend any office, by which he shuld not liue. How euident a Right then is it, that Princes supplying Gods place, and applying themselues wholy to the preseruation of their People, and safegard of the Commonwealth, should haue their paines recompenced with all honour and aboundance, and their Affaires both of peace and warre supported by the goods and lands of their Subiects?</p>
            <p>Our Sauior (when it was asked) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were lawfull to pay Tribute vnto <hi>Caesar,</hi> giueth a farther reason, in saying,
<pb facs="tcp:2100:17"/>
               <hi>Render vnto</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesars:<note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> in effect, Restore him his own. A double right hath <hi>Caesar</hi> to the things which we thinke and call ours: one by donation, another by preseruation: for if we looke to the first subduing of all countries by the Sword, and the first endewing of each place and person by the Prince, and the strengthening and setling thereof by the Law so long as men obey, we shall finde, that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things in euery Kingdome, as they were first receiued from <hi>Caesar,</hi> and haue beene continued by <hi>Caesar,</hi> so they are still enioyed vnder <hi>Caesar,</hi> and must, in cases of disobedience, by Law returne to <hi>Caesar:</hi> and when neede requireth, by parts be refunded to <hi>Caesars</hi> vse. By pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, not onely our goods and our lands, but our bodies and liues are <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars,</hi> though he neuer gaue them, yet because they are kept and garded by his power and care, that they might bee ours. Otherwise we should enioy them but a while, if euery man might freely
<pb facs="tcp:2100:18"/>
haue his forth, &amp; execute his fury with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out restraint or feare of Reuenge: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice &amp; mischiefe would so fast multiply. There is therefore a Tribute or Due to <hi>Caesar</hi> as well of our labours and liues, as of our goods and lands; all which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preserued by <hi>Caesars</hi> Sworde and Scepter, must be employed and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Caesars</hi> Seruice. Whether there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Tribute and Custome be a seale of our Subiection, or a debt of Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, or a part of Restitution, it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods ordinance, and a manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, Argument, or monument of our obedience to Princes.</p>
            <p>Howbeit to lighten the burthen, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the welfare, and retaine the loue of their subiects, both Heathen and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes, that haue beene wise and moderate, haue rather eased, then flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their People; and hauing Lands and Reuenewes sufficient of their owne to maintaine their Royall estate, haue not imposed, nor expected Taxes oftner, nor greater then their needefull occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:2100:18"/>
required. <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was wont to say; Shepheards do sheere, not flea their sheepe; and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be Shepheards of their People, as God said to <hi>Cyrus, thou art my Shepheard.</hi>

            <p>Feare is added by the Apostle, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Princes power, not properly, but conditionally, when wee doe euill. <hi>Wilt thou be without feare of the power,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.3,4</note> saith he, <hi>Doe well, so shalt thou haue praise of the same: but if thou do euill, feare: he is Gods Minister to take vengeance on him that doth euill.</hi> Feare of vengeance is a medicine prouided to preuent sinne; Praise is Prize appoynted to prouoke vertue. The King, as a Father, should cherish the good with fauour and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement: as a Lord hee should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the badde with feare and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The righteous are the sonnes of God, and worthie to receiue consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The wicked are the seruants of sin, and well deserue due correction: both feare and praise haue their vses; the one as a bridle to restraine malefactours, the
<pb facs="tcp:2100:19"/>
other as a spurre to edge on well doers. Rewarde of good, and reuenge of euill, are the sinews of each common-wealth. I may not deny, but mercy on the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, where the men are not wicked, nor the Offences hainous, is a most princely vertue, considering mans weakenesse, &amp; resembling Gods goodnesse: yet in sins that crie to heauen for vengeance, if se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie be not vsed, Gods anger is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and he often spareth neither Prince nor People, where such outragious sins are freely suffered.</p>
            <p>The Ensigne of all this Honour due to Princes, is the Crowne, which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them of God: for as the Sword presenteth their Power, so dooth the Crowne their Glorie, and both from God. The signification of a Crowne <hi>Dauid</hi> sheweth, where he saith to God,<note place="margin">Psal. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast crowned him with Honour and Glorie:</hi> and the approbation of the Crowne, that Princes weare, hee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise referreth to God in saying,<note place="margin">Psal. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Thou diddest set a Crowne of pure golde vpon his
<pb facs="tcp:2100:19"/>
head:</hi> not meaning, it was Gods act, but his ordinance, that Crownes were set on Princes heads.</p>
            <p>There remaineth the end, why all this power and honor is giuen to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, which is the preseruing of his heretage. God hath not lifted them to this height, either to forget him, who aduanceth them; or to neglect those, of whom they haue charge; but to conuert all their Authoritie and Dignitie to the faithfull discharge of their duety. And this is Gods ordinance no lesse than the former: For God erected no powers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himselfe, but vnder him; neither did he ordain them for themselues, but for others. Heads are to moderate their bodies, Shepherds to guide their flocks, Fathers to nourish their children, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to restraine their Seruants; &amp; so are Princes to gouerne their Realmes. In the Princes duetie I may be shorter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I speake before a religious and learned King, who both by penne and practise these many yeeres hath witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="tcp:2100:20"/>
to the world, how well acquainted he is with christian and godly gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Yet my duety to God will not suffer me supplying this place, wholy to passe it ouer with silence. I wil there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather touch, then treate the things pertinent to the Princes charge. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are three things necessarie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred: the <hi>Reseruation of Gods right,</hi> from whom all is receiued: the <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of mans life,</hi> to which all must bee referred: the <hi>Execution of iust iudgement,</hi> by which al must be measured. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of Gods right, <hi>Dauid</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in these words:<note place="margin">Psalm. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Be wise now ye Kings, serue the Lord in feare. Be wise, and serue the Lord,</hi> noteth a restraint; <hi>in feare,</hi> she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth an Accompt: <hi>Be wise,</hi> that is, so raigne in earth, that yee may raigne in Heauen; so liue heere, that ye may liue for euer. Let not your power or honor deceiue you, your Kingdome hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and shall haue an end, onely the Kingdome of Christ is ouer all, and for euer. <hi>Serue</hi> therefore <hi>the Lord.</hi> You are
<pb facs="tcp:2100:20"/>
great Lords aboue others, but there is a farre greater aboue you. Your Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty ouer men must be a Seruice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God. You are not called to do your owne willes, but his that exalted you. His Law must be your leuell, his worde your warrant. If you serue not him, you serue sinne, which is an ignominious &amp; dangerous Seruice for men to haue so many Maisters, as they haue vices. <hi>Serue the Lorde in feare,</hi> not distrusting his goodnes, but reuerencing his greatnes. Life and death are in your handes, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and hell are in his. Men haue no power to iudge you, but the iudgement of God ineuitable. All shal appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and all accompt to him:<note place="margin">Psal. 76.</note> 
               <hi>He is terrible to the Kings of the Earth,</hi> where he is neglected or resisted:<note place="margin">Psal. 21.</note> 
               <hi>but he maketh them blessings for euer,</hi> where he is regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and serued.</p>
            <p>The Moderation of mans life, and keeping vs aswell in <hi>godlines</hi> and <hi>honesty</hi> as in <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>tranquilitie,</hi> is set downe by the Apostle, as the maine cause, why
<pb facs="tcp:2100:21"/>
powers were ordained, and the Sword authorized here on Earth.<note place="margin">1. Timoth. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Let Prayers and supplications,</hi> saith he, <hi>be made for Kings, and for all in authoritie, that wee may leade a quiet and peaceable life in all godlinesse and honestie:</hi> he meaneth that by their Lawes and Labors we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy these blessings vnder them. To the Princes charge then belongeth, as well the care of true religion, and honest conuersation, as the conseruing of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and priuate peace, whereby our States and Liues are defended from all hostilitie, miserie, and iniurie. What benefits redound to vs by Peace and Tranquilitie, daily experience teacheth vs, not only by freedome from warres, Inuasions, and spoyles of Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, but also by safety from wrongs, oppressions, and grieuances of Defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Maligners at home; insomuch that where God was neither knowen nor serued, yet so great was the vtilitie and necessitie of the Princes Sword, that God commaunded Heathen Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
<pb facs="tcp:2100:21"/>
and bloudy Persecutors to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed and honored in Regard of their power from him, by which they vpheld ciuill societie &amp; honestie amongst men. And besides the procuring of publike and priuate peace to each place and person, it is no small seruice, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe vnto GOD by repressing the vnbrideled lusts of mans corruption, and reuenging the wicked attempts of mans presumption; I meane Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Incests, Rapes, Robberies, Periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Conspiracies, Witchcrafts, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Rebellions, Treasons, and such like hainous and impious enormities, which would ouerflow each Kingdome and Country, if the Princes Sword did not take due Reuenge of the Doers and Committers of such Outrages. To these Commodities of publike Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie when Godlines is ioyned, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Christian Princes wee may enioy safetie, sobrietie, and pietie; what greater blessings can be desired in this life, except the inward graces and gifts
<pb facs="tcp:2100:22"/>
of gods spirit, which he reserueth to his owne power and choyse. So that no Subiection, nor seruice of ours to Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior powers can match the good things which wee receiue by their gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore no maruell, if God so sharpely threaten and punish the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisters of his Will, Wisdome, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, whereby hee conteineth men in their dueties, and keepeth the Earth from brutish Confusion.</p>
            <p>So maine and weighty Matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Princes charge, the care of Gods Truth and Church must be the chiefest: for should the bodies, goods, and credites of men be preserued, and the honor and glory of God be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Should earthly ease be so much in request, and heauenly blisse so little in desire? Feare we the Ruine of al things, where iniuries and violences to men are not repressed by the Princes Sword; and doubt we no danger where Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, Heresie, Atheisme, and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie against God goe vnpunished? Is
<pb facs="tcp:2100:22"/>
Gods hand shortned that hee cannot strike? Or his will altered that hee will honour those that dishonour him, and blesse them that hate him? It is a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Error Repugnant to the word of God, and to the examples of the best Kings and Monarchs before and since Christ, to restraine Princes from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting and promoting the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of GOD within their Realmes. Neither hath the Man of sinne more grosely betrayed his Pride and Rage in any thing, than in abasing the honor and abusing the power, and impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Right of Princes; by depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them from their Seats, and transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Kingdomes to others, by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing their Subiects from all allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and giuing them leaue to rebell, by setting his feete in Emperors necks, and spurning off their Crownes with his shooe, by making them his Bailiffes and Sergeants to attend and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish his will, and not to meddle with supporting the Trueth, or reforming
<pb facs="tcp:2100:23"/>
the Church, but as hee liketh. In all which he hath shewd himself like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, to yoke, whom God hath freed, and to free, whom God hath yoked, to deiect, whom God hath exalted, and to erect, whom God hath humbled, to chalenge, what God hath reserued, and to crosse, what God hath commaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Yet must not Christian Princes for all this neglect their charge to preserue Gods Heretage. Their Scepters and Thrones, allowed them by God, are proofes that they may and must make Lawes, and execute Iudgement, as well for godlinesse and honesty, which by the Apostles rule are within the charge and compasse of their commission. As for peace and tranquilitie, from obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this no man may draw them, since for neglecting this no man shall excuse them. They must not be carefull in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things, and carelesse in Diuine; God ought to be serued and honoured by them, that is, by their princely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and care, as much afore men, as his
<pb facs="tcp:2100:23"/>
truth and glory excelleth the peace and welfare of men. It wanteth many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of a Christian Gouernment to looke to the keeping of things, that must perish, and to leaue the soules of men as an open prey to Iniquitie and Impietie.</p>
            <p>Of righteous Iudgement, which the Royall Throne (wherein Princes sit) being Gods Seate, puts them in minde to execute, much might be saide, did not the Time prefixed straighten and hasten me to make an end. It shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice therefore to admonish, that Princes themselues no lesse then other sent and authorized by them, doe execute the Iudgements, not of Man, but of the Lord; and in that respect, as the Seate is Gods, wherein they sit, so it must bee guided by Gods Lawe, and they must imitate Gods steppes, who sitteth and iudgeth in the middest of them; and with whome is no leuitie, partialitie, nor iniquitie. They must heare indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, discerne wisely, and pronounce vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly. Their eares must not lie open
<pb facs="tcp:2100:24"/>
or easie to false and priuie accusers. If it be enough to accuse, who shall be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent? Their hearts must not be carried with corrupt affections. If preiudice be Iustice, who shall be acquited? Their handes must not be armed, or aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with priuate Reuenge. If secret mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like may measure punishment, who can be safe? By Iustice is the Throne esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, which neither stoppes the eare, fireth the heart, nor loadeth the hand without, or aboue desert.</p>
            <p>To conclude, since it pleased God, not long since, to take from vs to his heauenly rest, a Prince, that with great moderation and wisedome swayed the Scepter of this Realme 45. yeeres, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting trueth and peace amongst vs, maugre all her opposites and enemies. Blessed be God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, that hath magnified his mercies so much towards vs, as to place in the Throne of this Land, after hir, the rightfull Heire of her Crowne, and a <hi>King</hi> most worthy to succeede her, as
<pb facs="tcp:2100:24"/>
nothing inferiour to her, in knowledge, prudence, magnanimity, bountie, mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of disposition, zeale of true religion, and resolution to doe Iustice and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and hath matched him with a most noble Spouse of so rare giftes, graces &amp; vertues, as our most gratious Lady and Queene heere present is: And GOD graunt, they both may long sit on their Thrones in all holinesse and happinesse of life, to their perpetuall honour, and our continuing comfort; and their Princely Progenie after them, euen all the dayes of heauen, if it so please God: to the glorie of God the Father, the Sonne, and the Holie-Ghost, to whom the only wise, inuisible, and immortall <hi>King</hi> of all worlds be all power, and praise, now, and for euer,</p>
