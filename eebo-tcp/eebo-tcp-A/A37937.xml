            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMongſt all men, thoſe in Authority ought to be moſt cautious, and ought to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves circumſpective in the Function of their Offices, that no occaſion of ſuſpition may be at any time reflected on, for according to that oraculous ſentence,</p>

            <p>Every vice of the mind maketh the crime more hainous and conſpicuous, by how much the more that perſon is eſteemed greater who offendeth. For he that is placed in Dignity, ought to be a Cynoſura, a Guide, and as it were, a propitious Starre to direct others in the unqueſtionable path of the truth: but if theſe directions be contrary, and oppoſite to truth, it is a moſt deſpicable error, <hi>Non tam quod ipſe peccat, ſed quod peccatum in alios diffundit:</hi> not ſo much that he doth offend himſelfe, but that he diffuſeth the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed to many other, who are taught by his example to offend. I accuſe no man, but deſire, and do heartily wiſh, that all Men, who are exalted to ſuch ſuper-eminece, may be ſo indubitable in their lives, and the reall execution of their offices. <hi>John,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99701:3"/>
Lord <hi>Finch,</hi> Lord Keeper of the great Seale before, being found very culpable in many things, and being guilty of many impoſitions and grievous taxes on the Subjects, was voted a Delinquent, but he eſcaped in a diſguiſed habit, and fled beyond Sea. Then the Parliament giving great approbation to the Lord <hi>Littleton</hi> of his ſufficiency, immediately choſe him Lord Keeper, and ſpeaker of the Houſe of Peeres, who ſucceeded <hi>Finch,</hi> and continued (as appeared by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſilence) unqueſtionable in that place. Till of late his Majeſty ſent ſome expreſſe orders to him, That he ſhould give out Writs for the removing the Terme to Yorke, and to ſubſcribe the great Seale of England to ſome other ſtrange things: which the Parliament conceiving to be diſadvantagious, and prejudiciall to the generall good of the Kingdome; contrarily ordered, That he ſhould neither give out any Writs, or ſubſcribe any Seale, not knowing the dangerous conſequence that might enſue thereby. Then his Majeſty being highly incenſed, threatned to turne him out of his place, if he did not obey his commands, which if he had performed, he had not poſſibly eſcaped the Parliaments cenſure. And being thus variouſly diſtracted, his fancy guided ſometime with the ſmiling Winde of Hope, another time toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the impetuous Tempeſt of Feare; he at length intended to eſtabliſh ſome reſolution in his minde, and taking the broad Seale along with him, he eſcaped from the Parliament the 25 day of this Moneth, and fled for protection to his Majeſty now reſiding at Yorke. But Poſts, and the Purſevants of the Houſe being ſent after him, he went above
<pb facs="tcp:99701:3"/>
twenty miles wide, that ſo he might not be traced and overtaken. Notwithſtanding, ſome conceive the cauſe of his flight was of more impendent conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, That there were ſome Articles, wherein he was highly impeached to have been delivered againſt him: other report, That it was for certaine words ſpoken in the Kings behalfe againſt the Parliament; but the truth and certainety hereof is ſomewhat du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious; and without queſtion the ſure: ground of his departure will be ſhortly publiſhed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>St <hi>Thomas Gardiner</hi> Recorder of the City of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, being greatly attached of Articles of high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and being conſcious of the ſame, knew not how to purge himſelfe, either from the imputation of that high Impeachment, or avoid the imminent cenſure, which he ſuppoſed would be ſuddenly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Parliament. Wherefore to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from Impriſonment, or the ſuſpition of any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture danger, he without detraction of time, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtination of intention, ſent a Letter the ſame day, that the Lord Keeper fled to York, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Savill,</hi> the Lord <hi>Seymer,</hi> the Lord <hi>Rich,</hi> &amp;c. by the command of the King, went to Yorke, without either the aſſent or conſent of the Houſe of Peeres. Wherefore they were incontinently ſent for by ſpeciall order from the Parliament, to attend the Houſe, whereof they were members, and ought not to abſent themſelves upon no occaſion whatſoever,
<pb facs="tcp:99701:4"/>
without the Houſes leave, eſpecially at this time, they having ſuch weighty and ſerious matters of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> in hand, and the great affaires of the Kingdome, being ſo dangerous withall. But the Houſes received intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and certaine Information from Yorke, from the Committee ſitting there, that theſe Noblemen were refrectory to their Meſſage, &amp; denied abſolutely to come, ſaving confidently, That they were bound by the Oath of Allegiance to attend and obey his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; and having received his ſpeciall command there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, dare not preſume to returne without his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties leave. But although they refuſe, rather to attend the King, then the Parliament, whoſe members they are, and ought not therefore either to abſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without the Houſes conſent, or ſtay from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when as they ſend ſpeciall Order for their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; yet without doubt, the Parliament have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to command them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the 23 day of this preſent Moneth, the Houſe of Commons being compleated, took into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate and mature conſideration, the abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of thoſe ſeverall Lords (aforenamed) ſent for to attend the Houſe. And after ſome ſerious delate thereon, they Voted them delinquents, and therefore worthy to be ſuſpended the Houſe: which Vote they ſent and acquainted the Lords with, by Meſſage, and deſired their aſcents, and concurrance therein: but they being greatly imployed, tooke longer time to conſider thereof.</p>
            <p>May all Offendors and Delinquents whatſoever, who do meritoriouſly deſerve cenſure, ſuffer exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and condigne puniſhment according to their deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb facs="tcp:99701:4"/>
without partiality or connivance. May the King and his Parliament concurre and agree, that no occ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
