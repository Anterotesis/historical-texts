         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have certainly the
beſt Right to this ſmall
Preſent, which gives me
an opportunity to declare the
great Eſteem, and Value I have
for you, ſince your two Sons are
amongſt the Tranſlators: and
all that know you muſt own
that your Latitude in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of Men, Affairs, and Books
is very great; by the ſcrutiny of
which, the conduct of your Life
is ſo exact and eminent. To
theſe from my particular obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
I muſt add, that your
<pb facs="tcp:98079:3"/>
Friendſhip is excellent, your
Worth unſpotted, and your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
unbiaſs'd: yet leſt I ſhould
ſeem to lay the common Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
of Dedicators, I ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contract my ſelf, and at
preſent unite all theſe Rays, that
illuſtrate you, into one Point of
an incomparable Father, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you tranſmit, and kindle
theſe Virtues in your Poſterity,
and labor to gratifie the preſent
and future time. The Hopes
and Advantages of your Sons,
beſides my management, are
much to be aſcribed to your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Care. If your true Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
towards them, your ſearch
for the beſt methods, and your
Zeal in the performance was
more follow'd, as 'tis exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the ſleepy Genius of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:98079:3"/>
would rouſe it ſelf, and we
ſhould not only read Stories of
Noble Predeceſſors heretofore,
but view them living. Then
<hi>Horace</hi>'s words might not be
ominous.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Aetas parentum pejor avis tulit</l>
               <l>Nos nequiores, mox daturos</l>
               <l>Progeniem vitioſiorem.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Your nice aſſiſtance in Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
well imitated, might adorn
our Country within it ſelf, and
ſave many the trouble of dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurſing
their Youth abroad. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
has ordain'd us all things
at home neceſſary for our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and why not for our Mind?
May not the Muſes as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
themſelves in our Rivers of
<hi>Cam, Iſis,</hi> and <hi>Thames;</hi> as the
<hi>Sein,</hi> the <hi>Loire,</hi> and the <hi>Tiber?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98079:4"/>
To the gaining of this greatpoint,
in my experience, I never found
any motive more charming to a
Youth to proſecute his Studies in
any Language than Hiſtory,
which inſenſibly draws on the
Student to gain the Tongue, and
inſinuating an Appetite from the
beginning, continues it to the
end. All our Learning termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
in it; and in alluſion to
Hiſtory, I might ſay with the
Platoniſt, That Science was
only reminiſcence of things
paſt. But laying aſide their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I am ſure, the Wiſdom of
the greateſt Scholar, after all
the Labors of his Mind extends
no farther than to know the
Actions of former Ages, when,
where, and how they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;
that is, Hiſtory rais'd
<pb facs="tcp:98079:4"/>
up with the two Wings of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,
and Geography: hence
from Obſervations, and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
he gains the name of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to regulate his preſent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and wiſely to foretel others
by conſequences; what may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
Why does the young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
viſit Forrein Countries,
but to learn Hiſtory by the eye,
and to obſerve Actions and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
Hiſtory cultivates the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and improves the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
without which, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
is either dry or vain. Well
might the Roman Orator ſay,
That not to know what has been
done before us, is always to be
a Child. Wherefore he ſtiles
Hiſtory, <hi>Teſtem temporum, lucem
veritatis, vitam memoriae, &amp; nunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
vetuſtatis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98079:5"/>
The remembrance of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
Actions warm'd <hi>Caeſar</hi> no
leſs than the ſight of <hi>Miltiades</hi>
Trophies excited <hi>Themiſtocles;</hi>
and it as much deters Vice, as it
inſpires Virtue. <hi>Livy</hi> tells us,
that, <hi>Inde tibi tuaeque reipublicae
quod imiteris capias, inde foedum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptu,
foedum exitu, quod vites.</hi> And
<hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
deſcrib'd its nature, when
he ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that Hiſtory is Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
teaching by examples.
I am ſure <hi>Homer</hi>'s Wiſe man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Character of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes
incredible dangers to
gain his experience in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whilſt the Hiſtorian in his
Study without trouble enjoying
what others have ſmarted for,
may repeat theſe Verſes of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius.</hi>

            <p>Wherefore for theſe reaſons,
ſince 'tis the humor of the Age,
and to promote private dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
with mutual aemulation,
I thought it highly advantageous
to have this Hiſtorian Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by a ſelect number among
us. The uſefulneſs of Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I know you much approve
of, who are ſo good a Judg of
Letters: it procures two Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
and diſcovers their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties
the eaſieſt and quickeſt
way. I am ſure the reputation
<pb facs="tcp:98079:6"/>
of the thing made them ſtudy
hard, which was a pleaſant ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to me, and perhaps
may puſh them on all their life
to a true love of Books, ſince
they have already found the
conqueſt of an Author not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult;
and <hi>Eutropius</hi> ſo eaſie by
their former Converſation with

very honeſtly be called their

Then be pleas'd to excuſe the

            <p>
               <hi>E<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tropius</hi> was an <hi>Italian,</hi> by <hi>Suidas</hi>
called the <hi>Sophiſt;</hi> he writ many
other things which are loſt by the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

when <hi>Julian</hi> was kill'd by the <hi>Perſians,</hi>
which hapned <hi>An. Chr. 365.</hi> or with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
363. He drew up this <hi>Breviary of

Valens</hi> the Emperor, brother to <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
from the building of the City

the ſtile good, and conſidering the

application of Chronology to every
great action ſurpaſſes <hi>Florus,</hi> who
wants it: he has been well entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Some alſo would (through ignorance in

the Presbyter and Hiſtorian, Scholar
to S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whilſt our Author cannot
be a Chriſtian; for he praiſes <hi>Julian</hi>
too much, tho he ſays he perſecuted
them; and is angry with <hi>Jovian</hi> for
not falſifying his Oath, and breaking
the Peace with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> which
cannot be the advice of a Profeſſor of
Chriſtianity; and makes no mention

was founded by <hi>Romulus,</hi> who was
the Son of a Veſtal Virgin, and as 'tis

twin with his Brother <hi>Remus,</hi> He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Shepherds being eighteen years old
built a little City upon the <hi>Palatine</hi>-hill
on the eleventh of the Kalends of
<hi>May</hi> in the third year of the ſixth O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad,
as they ſay who ſpeak moſt
probably, in the three hundred and
ninety fourth year after the ſacking
of <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having built this City, which he
called <hi>Rome</hi> from his own Name he
performed theſe things, He made a
great many of his Neighbours free of
his City, chooſing a hundred out of
the old Men, whom he called <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
from their age, by whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
he would manage his Affairs.
Then when <hi>Romulus</hi> and his people
wanted Wives, he invited the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nations to publick Sports
and took away their young Women
by force. He overcame the <hi>Caeninen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
the <hi>Antemnates</hi> the <hi>Cruſtumii,</hi> the
<hi>Sabins,</hi> the <hi>Fidenates</hi> and the <hi>Vejen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>

for the injury offered to their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
All theſe Cities lay about <hi>Rome.</hi>
And when upon a ſudden Tempeſt
at an Aſſembly he was never ſeen
after, in the thirty ſeventh year
of his Reign he is conſecrated, being
believed to have gone to the Gods.
Then the Government of <hi>Rome</hi> was
in the power of Senators for the ſpace
of five days by turns, which Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
laſted one year.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> was
made King, who waged no War, yet
he was no leſs ſerviceable to <hi>Rome</hi>
than <hi>Romulus,</hi> for he founded the
Laws and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
who were now thought half <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
and Robbers from their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Wars. He divided the year in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ten Months, which before was
confuſed without any account, he
conſtituted very many holy Rites,
and built many Temples at <hi>Rome,</hi>
and died in the forty third year of his
Reign.</p>

               <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius</hi> ſucceeded him,
he renewed the War and overcame
the <hi>Albani</hi> who dwelt twelve miles
from <hi>Rome.</hi> He ſubdued the <hi>Vejen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
and the <hi>Fidenates,</hi> ſome of theſe
were ſix miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> others
eighteen. He enlarged the City ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
added the Hill <hi>Caelius.</hi> When
he had reigned thirty two years he
was killed by Thunder, and his Houſe
burnt up with Lightning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ancus Marcius</hi> Reigned after him,
he was the Grandchild of <hi>Numa</hi> by
his Daughter, he warred againſt the
<hi>Latins,</hi> and joyned the <hi>Aventine</hi> Hill
and the Hill <hi>Janiculus</hi> to the City,
built <hi>Oſtia</hi> a Sea-Town ſixteen miles
from <hi>Rome.</hi> He died a natural death
in the twenty fourth year of his
Reign.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Priſcus Tarquinius</hi> was made
King. He doubled the number of
the Senators and built the <hi>Circus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus</hi>
at <hi>Rome.</hi> He firſt inſtituted
the <hi>Roman</hi> Sports, which are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to our time. He alſo overcame
the <hi>Sabins:</hi> and having conquered
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98079:14"/>
much of their Country joyned it to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Territory, and firſt of all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the City in Triumph; he built
the Walls and the Common Sewers,
he began the Capitol; and was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the Sons of <hi>Ancus,</hi> whom he
ſucceeded, in the thirty eighth year
of his Reign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> ſucceeded him, born
of a Noble Woman being a Captive
and a Handmaid. He alſo overcame
the <hi>Sabins,</hi> and added the three Hills
<hi>Quirinalis, Viminalis</hi> and <hi>Eſquilinus</hi>
to <hi>Rome.</hi> He digged Ditches about
the City. And firſt of all numbered
and taxed the people, which thing
was unknown throughout the whole
World. Upon the Aſſeſsment there
were found eighty four thouſand <hi>Roman</hi>
Citizens with thoſe who lived in the
Country. He was murthered in the
forty fifth year of his Reign by the
treachery of his Son-in-law <hi>Tarqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
the Son of <hi>Priſcus</hi> his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
and his Daughter <hi>Tullia,</hi> whom
<hi>Tarquinius</hi> had married.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98079:15"/>
               <hi>Lucius Tarquinius Superbus</hi> was the
Seventh, and laſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Kings.
He overcame the <hi>Volſci,</hi> which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
dwelt not far from <hi>Rome</hi> as we
go to <hi>Campania;</hi> he took the City
<hi>Gabii</hi> and <hi>Sueſſa Pometia,</hi> and made
peace with the <hi>Thuſci,</hi> and built the
Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Capitol.
Afterwards beſieging <hi>Ardea,</hi> a City
ſituated eighteen miles from <hi>Rome,</hi>
he loſt his Kingdom. For when his
Son <hi>Tarquinius</hi> the younger raviſhed
<hi>Lucretia</hi> a Woman of great quality,
and the moſt chaſt Wife of <hi>Collatinus,</hi>
and ſhe complaining of the injury to her
Husband, her Father and her Friends,
killed her ſelf in the ſight of them
all. For which reaſon <hi>Brutus,</hi> her
Father, and her Husband <hi>Tarquinius
Collatinus</hi> ſtirred up the people, and
depos'd <hi>Tarquinius:</hi> Soon after the
Army, which beſieged <hi>Ardea</hi> with
<hi>Tarquinius,</hi> deſerted him, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to <hi>Rome,</hi> was ſhut out. When
he had reigned five and twenty years,
he fled away with his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98079:15"/>
Thus <hi>Rome</hi> was governed by ſeven
Kings for the ſpace of two hundred
forty three years, the <hi>Romans</hi> hitherto
ſcarcely poſſeſſing fifteen miles about
their City.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon two Conſuls were
choſen for one King, that if one had
ill Deſigns, the other having equal
Power might reſtrain him. And
'twas enacted by the <hi>Roman</hi> people
that they ſhould rule no longer than
one year, leſt they ſhould grow proud
by a long continuance of their Power;
but be always courteous, knowing
they were to be private Men within
one year. Therefore <hi>Lucius Junius
Brutus,</hi> who had been very induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in expelling King <hi>Tarquin,</hi> and
<hi>Tarquinius Collatinus</hi> the Husband of
<hi>Lucretia</hi> were Conſuls the firſt year.
But the Conſulſhip was taken away
ſoon from <hi>Tarquinius Collatinus,</hi> for
the <hi>Romans</hi> were not willing that
any ſhould remain in the City who
was called <hi>Tarquinius;</hi> therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gathered together his Eſtate he
departed from <hi>Roome: Valerius Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licola</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98079:16"/>
was made Conſul in his ſtead.
But King <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> who
was driven out waged War againſt
<hi>Rome,</hi> and by the aſſiſtance of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
people fought with them that he
might be reſtored to his Kingdom,
<hi>Brutus</hi> the Conſul and <hi>Aruns</hi> the
Son of <hi>Tarquinius</hi> kill'd one another
in the firſt Battel, yet the <hi>Romans</hi>
came off Conquerors. The <hi>Roman</hi>
Matrons mourned one year for <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
as the Defender of their Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and their common Father; <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Publicola</hi> took <hi>Spurius Lucretius
Tricipitinus</hi> for his Collegue, who was
the Father of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> upon whoſe
Death he took <hi>Horatius Pulvillus</hi>
into his place, ſo that there were five
Conſuls in this firſt year: <hi>Tarquinius
Collatinus</hi> went out of the City by
reaſon of his name, <hi>Brutus</hi> was kill'd
in the Battel, <hi>Sp. Lucretius</hi> died a
natural Death. <hi>Tarquinius</hi> again made
War againſt <hi>Rome</hi> the ſecond year
that he might be reſtored, <hi>Porſena</hi> the
King of <hi>Thuſcia</hi> aſſiſting him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
took it, but was overcome at

years. In the fourth year after
the Kings were driven from <hi>Rome,</hi>
the <hi>Sabins</hi> waging War againſt the

of King <hi>Tarquinius</hi> had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together a great Army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the injuries done to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law,
the <hi>Romans</hi> created a
new Authority, which was called
the <hi>Dictatorſhip</hi> being greater than
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98079:17"/>
the Conſulſhip. In the ſame year
alſo the General of the Horſe, who
was ſubordinate to the Dictator was
made. Nor doth Roman Story re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
any thing more like the preſent
Government of the Empire, which
Your Majeſty now enjoys, than the
ancient Dictatorſhip, chiefly when
<hi>Caius Caeſar,</hi> and after him <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
otherwiſe called <hi>Octavianus</hi> reigned
with the name and honour of Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor;
of whom I ſhall ſpeak hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But <hi>Largius</hi> was the firſt <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Dictator, and <hi>Spurius Caſſius</hi> the

            <p>The firſt Sedition of the <hi>Roman</hi>
People was in the ſixteenth year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the expulſion, under pretence
that the Commons were oppreſſed by

the Tribunes of the people were
made as their proper Judges and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
by whom the people might
be defended from the Senate and
Conſuls.</p>

The next year the <hi>Volſci</hi> renew'd
the War againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> and were
overcome, loſing their chief City <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the eighteenth year <hi>Quintius

the ſame <hi>Volſci,</hi> and having an Army
committed to him againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
evercame them in many Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels:
until he came within five miles
of <hi>Rome,</hi> deſigning to ruin his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, having ſent back thoſe
Embaſſadors, who deſired peace, had
not his Mother <hi>Veturia</hi> and Wife <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnia</hi>
come to him from <hi>Rome.</hi> But
he being overcome by their Tears
and Entreaties, he drew off his Army:
And was the ſecond who led an Army
againſt his own Country, after King
<hi>Tarquin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coeſo Fabius</hi> and <hi>Titus Virginius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conſuls, three hundred Noble
Men who were of the <hi>Fabian</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
undertook the War againſt the
<hi>Vejentes</hi> without aid, promiſing the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98079:18"/>
Senate and the People, that they would
by themſelves maintain it. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all of them marched out of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and every one of them was ſlain, each
of them deſerving to have been a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
One only ſurvived of this great
Family, who being too young was left
at home. Soon after a new Regiſter is
made at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the number of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Citizens was found to be a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and nineteen thouſand.</p>
            <p>The year following when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Army was blocked up in the
Mount <hi>Algidus,</hi> almoſt twelve miles
from <hi>Rome, Lucius Quintus Cincinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
was made Dictator, who mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
a Farm of four Acres, tilled it
with his own hands. He, when he
was found Plowing, having wiped
off the ſweat from his Face put on
his Robe and relieved the Army, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
overthrown his Enemies.</p>
            <p>Three hundred and one year from
the building of the City, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular
Power which was Supreme end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ten Men were elected inſtead
of two Conſuls, called the <hi>Decemvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri:</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98079:18"/>
but when they had paſſed over
the firſt year well, in the ſecond year
<hi>Appius Claudius</hi> one of the <hi>Decemvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi>
would have defloured a certain
young Maid the Daughter of one
<hi>Virginius,</hi> who at that time was in
ſervice againſt the <hi>Latins:</hi> whom her
Father killed, leſt ſhe ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour'd
by him, and returning to
the Army raiſed a Mutiny. The Power
of the <hi>Decemviri</hi> was taken away, and
they condemned.</p>
            <p>In the three hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
year from the building of the
City the <hi>Fidenates</hi> rebelled againſt
the <hi>Romans:</hi> the <hi>Vejentes</hi> with their
King <hi>Tolumnius</hi> aided them, both of
which Cities were ſo near <hi>Rome,</hi>
that <hi>Fidena</hi> was but ſeven, and <hi>Veii</hi>
eighteen miles off: and alſo the <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſci</hi>
joyned themſelves to theſe. But
they were conquered by <hi>Aemilius</hi> the
Dictator and <hi>Lucius Quintius Cincin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi>
General of the Horſe; King
<hi>Tolumnius</hi> being ſlain, the City <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi>
was taken and razed. Twenty
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98079:19"/>
years after the <hi>Vejentes</hi> revolted and
<hi>Furius Camillus</hi> the Dictator was ſent
againſt them, whom he overcame
firſt of all in a pitch'd Battel, and
took <hi>Veii</hi> one of the moſt ancient
and the wealthieſt Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long Siege. Then he took the
noble City of the <hi>Faliſci.</hi> But he was
maliciouſly accuſed, as if he had not
rightly divided the prey, for which
reaſon he was condemned and baniſh'd.
Not long after the <hi>Galli Senones</hi> came
to <hi>Rome</hi> (in purſuit of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
overcome at the River <hi>Allia</hi> twelve
miles from <hi>Rome)</hi> and took it, nor
could the <hi>Romans</hi> defend any thing
but the Capitol, which when the
<hi>Gauls</hi> had beſieged a long while, and the
<hi>Romans</hi> very much wanting proviſion,
<hi>Camillus,</hi> who paſs'd his baniſhment in
a neighbouring City came upon them
on a ſudden and overthrew them.
Afterwards they departed having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a Sum of Gold to raiſe their
Siege before the Capitol: But <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
chaſing them, ſo overcame them,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98079:19"/>
that he recovered the Gold which
was given them, and all the Military
Enſigns which they had taken. So the
third time he entred <hi>Rome</hi> in triumph
and was ſtil'd the Second <hi>Romulus,</hi> as
if he alſo had been the founder of his
Country.</p>

the <hi>Gauls,</hi> they changed their Officers,
and inſtead of two Conſuls ſet up
Military Tribunes with a Conſular
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98079:21"/>
Power. From this time the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire began to enlarge its Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:
for <hi>Camillus</hi> in the ſame year
took the City of the <hi>Volſci,</hi> which
had waged War againſt the <hi>Romans</hi>
for Seventy years, and the City of
the <hi>Aequi,</hi> and the <hi>Sutrini,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſlain their Armies, ſeized all
their Cities, for which actions he
triumphed thrice. Alſo <hi>Titus Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius

who had come armed even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

actions in twenty days, for which

            <p>The Authority of the Military

again their Dignity with a Conſular

In the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lucius

               <hi>Titus Quintius</hi> the Dictator was
ſent againſt the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
invaded <hi>Italy.</hi> They had pitched
their Camps four miles from the City
<hi>Rome</hi> on the other ſide of the River
<hi>Anio. Titus Manlius</hi> a moſt noble
Senator fighting with a <hi>Gaul,</hi> who
challenged him, ſlew him in ſingle
Combat, and having taken off the

put it upon his own, which procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a perpetual honour to his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they ſhould be called <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quati:</hi>
the <hi>Gauls</hi> were put to flight;

The ſecond time the People were
taxed and muſter'd, and when the
<hi>Latins,</hi> whom the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
would not ſend them Soldiers:
they from themſelves liſted their
young Soldiers, and made ten Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which amounts to ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
armed Men or more. Yet in
theſe ſmall Affairs the <hi>Romans</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
great valour in their Wars: for
when they marched againſt the <hi>Gauls</hi>
under their General <hi>Lucius Furius Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus,</hi>
one of the <hi>Gauls</hi> challenged
the valianteſt Man of the <hi>Romans</hi> to
fight with him. Then <hi>Marcus Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
a Tribune profer'd himſelf, and
when he marched out armed, a Crow
ſat upon his right Arm, and a little
while after when they were fighting,
the ſame Crow ſtruck at the eyes of
the <hi>Gaul</hi> with his Wings and Claws
that he could not ſee before him:
wherefore the <hi>Gaul</hi> being ſlain, <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
the Tribune gained not onely the
Victory, but alſo a Name. For after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he was called <hi>Corvinus</hi> for
this Deed, and made Conſul in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98079:22"/>
three and twentieth year of his Age.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Latins,</hi> who would not ſend
the <hi>Romans</hi> Soldiers, began to exact
this of them, that one of the Conſuls
ſhould be choſen out of their People,
and the other from the <hi>Romans,</hi>
which being denied, they took up
Arms againſt them; but being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with a great ſlaughter, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
triumphed, and for this brave
Action the Statues of the Conſuls
were placed upon the Pulpit, from
whence they ſpoke their Orations.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Romans</hi> begun to grow
powerful: for they made War with
the <hi>Samnites,</hi> living about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirty miles from the City,
who were ſituate between <hi>Picenum,
Campania</hi> and <hi>Apulia. (L.) Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Curſor</hi> commanded in this War
with the honour of Dictator. Who
going to <hi>Rome,</hi> charged Q. <hi>Fabius
Maximus</hi> General of the Horſe, to
whom he committed the care of the
Army, not to fight in his abſence.
But he having found an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
fought very ſucceſsfully, and rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98079:23"/>
the <hi>Samnites.</hi> For which thing the
Dictator commanded him to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
becauſe he had fought againſt
his Command, yet he was freed by
the great favour of the Soldiers and
the People: and there aroſe ſo great
a mutiny againſt <hi>Papirius,</hi> that he had
like to have been killed amongſt
them.</p>
            <p>Afterwards in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Veturius,</hi> and <hi>Spurius Poſthumius,</hi>
the <hi>Romans</hi> very diſhonourably were
overcome by the <hi>Samnites</hi> and made
Slaves by them. But the Senate and
the People broke the Peace, which
had been made through meer neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
Afterwards <hi>L. Papirius</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul
overcame the <hi>Samnites,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſeven thouſand of them Slaves,
triumphed for the Victory obtained
againſt them. At the ſame time <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius
Claudius Cenſor</hi> brought into the
City <hi>Rome</hi> the Water called from his
name <hi>Claudia,</hi> and paved the <hi>Appian</hi>
way. The <hi>Samnites</hi> having renewed
the War, overcame Q. <hi>Fabius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus,</hi>
and ſlew three thouſand of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98079:23"/>
his Men. Afterwards having his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> for his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
he ſubdued the <hi>Samnites</hi> and took
moſt of their Towns. Then <hi>P. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius
Rufinus,</hi> and <hi>Manius Curius
Dentatus</hi> being Conſuls were both
ſent againſt the <hi>Samnites,</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
them in ſeveral great Battels.
Then they finiſhed the War, which
the <hi>Romans</hi> had waged with the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>
for nine and forty years. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was there now any Enemy in
<hi>Italy,</hi> who would make trial of
<hi>Roman</hi> Valour. A few years after,
ſome Forces of the <hi>Gauls</hi> joined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the <hi>Tuſci</hi> and the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites:</hi>
but as they marched to <hi>Rome,
Cn. Cornelius Dolabella</hi> defeated them.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time the <hi>Romans</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
War againſt the <hi>Tarentini,</hi>
who lived in the farthermoſt part of
<hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe they had affronted their
Embaſſadors: they deſired <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>
the King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> who was deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from <hi>Achilles,</hi> to help them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Romans,</hi> who came ſoon
after into <hi>Italy.</hi> This was the firſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98079:24"/>
time the <hi>Romans</hi> fought with a forein
Enemy. <hi>P. Valerius Laevinus</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul
was ſent to fight them, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s Spies, commands
them to be led about his Camp to
view his Army, and then be ſent
back to tell <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> how the <hi>Romans</hi>
managed their Actions. Upon the
joyning of the Battel <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> fled;
yet he overcame the <hi>Romans</hi> by the
help of his Elephants, which they
feared, having never ſeen them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
But the Night putting an end
to the fight <hi>Laevinus</hi> fled. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>
took eighteen hundred <hi>Romans,</hi> whom
he uſed very honourably, and alſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
their dead, whom when he ſaw
lying upon the ground, with their
wounds in their Breaſt and Face, and
with a ſtern countenance, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to have held up his hands to
Heaven uttering theſe words, That
he might have conquered the whole
World, if it had been his fortune to
have had ſuch valiant Soldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98079:24"/>
Afterwards <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> having joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Samnites,</hi> the <hi>Lucani,</hi> and the
<hi>Brutii</hi> to his Army marched to <hi>Rome,</hi>
waſting all places with fire and ſword:
he deſtroyed <hi>Campania,</hi> and came
to the City <hi>Praeneſte</hi> eighteen miles
from <hi>Rome.</hi> A little while after he
retreated into <hi>Campania,</hi> being affraid
of the Army, which followed him
under the command of a Conſul.
The <hi>Romans</hi> ſent Embaſſadors to <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi>
to deſire him to reſtore them
their Captives, whom he received
very honourably, and ſent back their
Captives without ranſom. He very
much admired one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours,
<hi>Fabricius</hi> by name, and
when he knew him to be poor, he
would have enticed him to leave the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and come over to him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
the fourth part of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<hi>Fabricius</hi> deſpiſed it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> eſteeming the <hi>Romans</hi> at
a high rate; ſent an Embaſſadour a
great Man by name <hi>Cineas</hi> to make
Peace with them on equal terms,
which were, that he might reſerve
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98079:25"/>
that part of <hi>Italy</hi> which he had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd.
The <hi>Romans</hi> liked not the
Propoſitions. Therefore the Senate
ſent word to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> that he could
have no peace with the <hi>Romans,</hi> if
he ſtayed in <hi>Italy.</hi> Then the <hi>Romans</hi>
commanded all thoſe Captives, which
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had reſtored, to be eſteemed
infamous, who ſhould have defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves with their Arms, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhould they regain their former
credit, till they had brought back
the ſpoils of their Enemies. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>
his Embaſſadour returned with this
anſwer; whom when <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> asked,
what ſort of place he found <hi>Rome?</hi>
he reply'd, That he had ſeen a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of Kings, that they were all as
brave Men there, as he was counted
in <hi>Epirus,</hi> and <hi>Greece. P. Sulpicius,</hi>
and <hi>Decius Mus</hi> the Conſuls are ſent
Generals againſt him. Upon the join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Battel <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and his Elephants ſlain, he loſt
in the Fight twenty thouſand: the
<hi>Romans</hi> onely five thouſand. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>
fled to <hi>Tarentum</hi> the ſecond year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98079:25"/>
               <hi>Fabricius</hi> was ſent to fight him,
whom before he could not bribe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the Embaſſadours, having
promiſed him the fourth part of
his Kingdom. Then his Camp and
the King's being nigh one another,
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his Phyſician came to him
by Night, promiſing to poyſon the
King, if he would reward him for it:
whom he commanded to be carried
bound to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and to be told
that he had undertaken to kill
him. The King admiring at him, is
reported to have ſaid, This is that
<hi>Fabricius,</hi> whom 'tis harder to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade
from honeſty, than to alter the
Sun's courſe, Then the King went
into <hi>Sicily, Fabricius</hi> having defeated
the <hi>Samnites,</hi> and the <hi>Lucani,</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed.
Then <hi>Manius Curius Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus,</hi>

Dentatus</hi> triumphed in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip;

four in number. A little while after
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> departed from <hi>Tarentum,</hi> and
was ſlain at <hi>Argos</hi> a City of <hi>Greece.</hi>
In the Conſulſhip of <hi>Caius Fabricius
Luſcinus,</hi> and <hi>C. Claudius Cinna,</hi> and
in the four hundred ſixty firſt year of
the City, <hi>Ptolemy</hi> ſent Embaſſadours
from <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to make a
friendſhip with the <hi>Romans,</hi> which
they obtained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quintius Gulo</hi> and <hi>C. Fabius Pictor</hi>
being Conſuls, the <hi>Picentes</hi> raiſed a
War, and the next Conſuls <hi>Pub. Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius,</hi>
and <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
them, for which Conqueſt they
triumphed. At this time the <hi>Romans</hi>
built theſe Cities, <hi>Ariminum</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi>
and <hi>Beneventum</hi> in <hi>Samnium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Conſulſhip of <hi>Marcus Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Regulus,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Junius Libo,</hi>
the <hi>Roman</hi> people proclaimed War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Salentini,</hi> a people living
in <hi>Apulia,</hi> and vanquiſhed the <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſini</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:98079:26"/>
with their City, for which there
was another Triumph.</p>
            <p>In the four hundred ſeventy ſeventh
year of the City, the <hi>Roman</hi> Name
was famous to all the World; yet
they had not waged War out of <hi>Italy.</hi>
Wherefore they made a Muſter to
know their Forces: there were found
two hundred ninty two thouſand,
and three hundred thirty four, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they had always been fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ever ſince the building of the
City. The firſt forein War they made,
was againſt the <hi>Africans,</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip
of <hi>Appius Claudins,</hi> and <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Fulvius.</hi> They fought them in
<hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> triumphed
over the <hi>Africans</hi> and <hi>Hiero</hi> the King
of <hi>Sicily.</hi> The next year <hi>Valerius
Marcus,</hi> and <hi>Octacilius</hi> being Conſuls,
the <hi>Romans</hi> performed great Actions
in <hi>Sicily;</hi> they received into their
protection the <hi>Taurominitani,</hi> the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanenſes,</hi>
with fifty Cities. The
third year they deſigned to make
War with <hi>Hiero</hi> the King of <hi>Sicily;</hi>
But he with all the Nobility of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:98079:27"/>
deſired to make Peace with the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and gave them two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Talents; the <hi>Romans</hi> overcame
the <hi>Africans</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> for which they
triumphed the ſecond time. In the
fifth year of the <hi>Punick</hi> War, which
was carried on againſt the <hi>Africans,</hi>
in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Caius Duillius,</hi>
and <hi>Cnaeus Cornelius Aſina,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
fought firſt by Sea, having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Ships headed with Iron, which
they call <hi>Liburnae. Cornelius</hi> the
Conſul was killed by ſtratagem; <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illius</hi>
having joyned Battel defeated
the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Admiral, and having
took one and thirty of his Ships,
ſunk fourteen, he took ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Priſoners, and ſlew three. There
was no Victory more acceptable to
the <hi>Romans</hi> than this, becauſe being
a people invincible at Land, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
now very powerful by Sea.
In the Conſulſhip of <hi>Caius Aquilius
Florus,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Scipio, Scipio</hi> took
the Iſlands <hi>Corſica,</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and
having brought captive from thence ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
thouſand, obtained a Triumph.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98079:27"/>
               <hi>L. Manlius Volſo</hi> and <hi>M. Attilius Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
being Conſuls, the <hi>Romans</hi> carried
the War over into <hi>Africa,</hi> and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Sea againſt <hi>Hamilcar</hi> the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi>
General, defeated him; for
he having loſt ſixty four Ships, made
homewards, the <hi>Romans</hi> loſt two and
twenty; but being come into <hi>Africa,</hi>
they firſt made the City <hi>Clypea</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
it ſelf. The Conſuls went unto
<hi>Carthage,</hi> and having waſted many
of their Towns, <hi>Manlius</hi> after his
Conqueſt returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> bringing
with him ſeven and twenty thouſand
Captives; <hi>Attilius Regulus</hi> tarried in
<hi>Africa;</hi> He drew up his Army, and
fighting againſt three <hi>Carthaginian</hi>
Captains, overcame them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſlain eighteen thouſand of their
men, and taken five thouſand with
eight Elephants, received ſeventy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
into the <hi>Roman</hi> protection. Now
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being routed deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to make peace with the <hi>Romans,</hi>
which <hi>Regulus</hi> denying but upon
very hard terms, they deſired the
<hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> to help them, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98079:28"/>
               <hi>Xantippus</hi> the General, which they had
ſent, defeated <hi>Regulus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
with a total overthrow, for of
all his Army there eſcap'd onely two
thouſand; fifteen thouſand men were
taken with their General, thirty
thouſand ſlain, and <hi>Regulus</hi> caſt into
Priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcus Aemilius Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius
Fulvius Nobilior</hi> being Conſuls,
ſailing to <hi>Africa</hi> with a Fleet of three
hundred Ships, overcame the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
firſt in a Sea-fight. <hi>Aemilius</hi> the
Conſul having ſunk one hundred and
four of their Ships, took thirty with
the men in them, and having ſlain or
taken fifteen thouſand of the Enemy,
enriched his Souldiers with coſtly
Spoils. Now the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
all <hi>Africa,</hi> if the ſcarcity of
proviſions had not been ſuch, that
their Army could not ſubſiſt there
any longer. The Conſuls, as they
ſailed homewards were Shipwrecked
about <hi>Sicily:</hi> and the Tempeſt ſo
great, that out of four hundred and
ſixty four Ships, they could ſcarce ſave
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98079:28"/>
eighty: neither was ſo great a ſtorm
ever heard of. But the <hi>Romans</hi> ſoon
ſet out another Fleet of two hundred
Sail; nor was there any one daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with their former misfortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cnaeus Servilius Cepio</hi> and <hi>C. Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius
Blaeſns</hi> the Conſuls ſailing to
<hi>Africa</hi> with two hundred and ſixty
Ships, took ſome Cities, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home with rich Spoil were alſo
Shipwracked. Wherefore the <hi>Romans</hi>
being afflicted with theſe continual
calamities, the Senate Decreed they
ſhould abſtain from Sea-fights, and
onely keep a Fleet of ſixty Ships to
guard <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lucius Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Metellus,</hi> and <hi>Caius Furius Pacilus,
Metellus</hi> the Conſul in <hi>Sicily</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a General of the <hi>Africans,</hi>
marching with thirty Elephants, and
great Forces, and having ſlain twenty
thouſand of his men, took ſix and
twenty Elephants, and gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
divers others ſtragling up and
down in the Country by the aſſiſtance
of the <hi>Numidians,</hi> who helped him in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98079:29"/>
that War, and brought them to <hi>Rome</hi>
in great Pomp, filling all the Roads
with an hundred and thirty Elephants.
After theſe misfortunes the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
ſent <hi>Regulus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
whom they had taken Priſoner,
to deſire the <hi>Romans</hi> to make peace,
and exchange their Captives: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and brought into
the Senate, acted nothing as a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
ſaying, he was no <hi>Roman</hi> from
that Day he had been taken by the
<hi>Africans,</hi> hindering even his Wife
from embracing him, he perſuaded
the <hi>Romans</hi> not to make peace with
the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> for they being
weaken'd with ſo many misfortunes
were now hopeleſs; he was not of
ſo great value that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
ſo many Captives for him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an old Man, and for a few <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
who had been taken. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he obtained his requeſt: For
no body granted Peace to the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
deſiring it. Upon his return
to <hi>Carthage,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> would have
had him to have ſtay'd at <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:98079:29"/>
but he anſwered, he could not live
there with the ſame honour as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
having been a Slave to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>
Wherefore when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Africa,</hi> they put him to
a very cruel Death. <hi>P. Claudius Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi>
and <hi>C. Junius</hi> being Conſuls,
<hi>Claudius</hi> fighting with ill Omens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> was defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
for of two hundred and twenty
Ships he fled with thirty, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
having taken ninety and ſunk the
reſt, twenty thouſand being made
captive. Alſo the other Conſuls Fleet
was ſhipwracked, but he ſaved his
Army, having landed it on the
coaſt hard by. <hi>Caius Luctatius Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus</hi>
and <hi>Aulus Poſthumius Albinus</hi>
being Conſuls in the twenty third
year of the <hi>Punick</hi> War, having the
management of the War, ſailed into
<hi>Sicily</hi> with three hundred Ships, the
<hi>Africans</hi> had a Fleet of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
againſt him. <hi>Luctatius Catulus</hi>
went ſick a Shipboard, for he had
been wounded in the former Battel.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98079:30"/>
The <hi>Romans</hi> fought very valiantly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
againſt <hi>Lilybaeum</hi> a City of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
they took ſeventy three <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi>
Ships, and ſunk an hundred
and twenty five; they took thirty
two thouſand Priſoners, having ſlain
thirteen thouſand: with a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Gold and Silver. Of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Fleet there were but twelve
Ships ſunk. This fight was on the
ſixth of the Ides of <hi>March.</hi> The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
ſoon after deſired to make
Peace with the <hi>Romans,</hi> which they
granted them. They reſtored the
<hi>Romans</hi> their Captives; and the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
having deſired their own
Captives might be ranſomed, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
commanded thoſe who were in

The ſame year the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>

Foot and twenty thouſand Horſe.
The <hi>Romans</hi> ſent to <hi>Hannibal</hi> to keep

               <hi>Hannibal</hi> not to wage War againſt
the Allies of the <hi>Roman</hi> people, they
received no civil anſwer. In the
mean while the <hi>Saguntines</hi> were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
through Famine; and being
taken by <hi>Hannibal</hi> were put cruelly
to the Sword. Then <hi>Publius Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius

to have brought along with him eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thouſand Foot, and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Horſe, and ſeven and thirty E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants.
In the mean while many
<hi>Ligurians</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> liſted themſelves
under <hi>Hannibal: Sempronius Gracchus</hi>
having notice of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s coming,
ſhip'd his Army out of <hi>Sicily</hi> to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum.
Publius Cornelius Scipio</hi> firſt
fought <hi>Hannibal:</hi> the Battel being
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98079:34"/>
joyn'd, his Soldiers fled, and <hi>Scipio</hi>
returned wounded into his Camp.
<hi>Sempronius Gracchus,</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi>
fought at the River <hi>Trebia.</hi> He alſo
was overcome. Many in <hi>Ital</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
themſelves to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he
coming from thence into <hi>Tuſcia,</hi> fought
<hi>Flaminius</hi> and ſlew him with five and
twenty thouſand <hi>Romans,</hi> the reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put to flight. After that <hi>Quintus
Fabius Maximus</hi> was ſent againſt him;
He by not fighting ſtop'd the career
of the Conqueror: and after having
found an opportunity, overcame him.</p>
            <p>In the five hundred and fortieth

<hi>Lucius Aemilius</hi> and <hi>P. Terentius Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>

<hi>Fabius</hi> in that War; who admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
both the Conſuls that they
could overcome the eager and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>Hannibal</hi> no otherwiſe than by
deferring the Battel. But through
the raſhneſs of <hi>Varro,</hi> the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul

a Village in <hi>Apulia,</hi> called <hi>Cannae,</hi> both
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98079:34"/>
the Conſuls were overcome by <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal.</hi>
In that Battel three thouſand
<hi>Africans</hi> were ſlain; and a great part
of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army wounded: the
<hi>Romans</hi> never ſuffer'd more in any
Punick War; for in this Fight <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Paulus</hi> the Conſul was ſlain, and
twenty, that had been Conſuls or
Praetors: thirty Senators were taken
or kill'd: three hundred Noble Men:
forty thouſand Soldiers; three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
and five hundred Horſe. In
which misfortunes the <hi>Romans</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
to mention Peace. They liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Servants, having made them
free, a thing never done before. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that Battel many <hi>Italian</hi> Cities
which obeyed the <hi>Romans,</hi> yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves to <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Who,
profering the <hi>Romans</hi> to redeem their
Captives: it was anſwered by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
that they wanted no ſuch Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
who when they were armed,
could not defend themſelves. After
that he put them all to death with
divers Torments; and ſent three
buſhels of golden Rings to <hi>Carthage;</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:98079:35"/>
which he pulled from the Fingers of the

In the mean while <hi>Aſdrubal Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>'s
Brother remaining with a great

that Nation under the power of the
<hi>Africans,</hi> was overcome by the two
<hi>Scipio</hi>'s, and loſt in that Battel thirty
five thouſand Men, ten thouſand of
theſe being taken, and twenty-five
thouſand ſlain; but twelve thouſand
Foot, four thouſand Horſe, with
twenty Elephants were ſent to him
from <hi>Carthage</hi> to repair his Forces.
The fourth year after <hi>Hannibal</hi> came
into <hi>Italy, Marcus Claudius Marcellus</hi>
the Conſul fought ſucceſsfully againſt
him at <hi>Nola</hi> a City of <hi>Campania.
Hannibal</hi> took many of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Cities in <hi>Apulia, Calabria,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

this condition, that having deſtroy'd
them, <hi>Hannibal</hi> would help him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98079:35"/>
of King <hi>Philip</hi> being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
and their Embaſſy known;
the <hi>Romans</hi> commanded <hi>Marcus Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Laevinus</hi> to go into <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
and <hi>Titus Manlius Torquatus</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul

King <hi>Philip;</hi> in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> againſt

the Pro-conſul, who had been ſent
into <hi>Sardinia;</hi> twelve thouſand of his
Soldiers were ſlain in that Battel,
a thouſand five hundred taken; and
<hi>Sardinia</hi> being ſubdued by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Manlius</hi> the Conqueror brought
the Captives and <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi>
In the mean while King <hi>Philip</hi> was
overcome by <hi>Laevinus</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
and <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> and <hi>Mago</hi> the third Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

The tenth year after <hi>Hannibal</hi>
came into <hi>Italy</hi> in the Conſulſhip of
<hi>P. Sulpicius,</hi> and <hi>Cnaeus Fulvius,</hi> He
came within four miles of <hi>Rome,</hi> his
Horſe came up to the Gates: Not
long after, for fear of the Conſuls
coming with an Army, <hi>Hannibal</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
into <hi>Campania;</hi> both the <hi>Scipios</hi>
were ſlain by <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> his Brother
in <hi>Spain,</hi> who had been Conquerors
for many years: yet the Army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
intire: for they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more by accident than by <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi>'s
valour. At which time alſo
a great part of <hi>Sicily</hi> was taken by
<hi>Marcellus</hi> the Conſul, which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans</hi>
had ſeized: and great plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was carried to <hi>Rome</hi> from the
famous City <hi>Syracuſe. Laevinus</hi> made
a League in <hi>Macedonia</hi> with King
<hi>Philip</hi> and many people of <hi>Greece,</hi> and
with <hi>Attalus</hi> King of <hi>Aſia:</hi> and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
into <hi>Sicily</hi> he took <hi>Hanno</hi> an
<hi>African</hi> Captain at the City <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentum,</hi>
together with the Town, and
ſent him to <hi>Rome</hi> with the principal
Captives; forty Cities having ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98079:36"/>
he took twenty ſix. Thus
having ſubdued all <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi>
he returned to <hi>Rome</hi> with great
glory. <hi>Hannibal</hi> having ſet upon <hi>Cnae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Fulvius</hi> the Conſul unawares, ſlew
him with eight thouſand Soldiers.
In the mean time both the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s
being ſlain, and no <hi>Roman</hi> General
in <hi>Spain, Publius Cornelius Scipio,</hi> was
ſent, being four and twenty years old;
the Son of <hi>Publius Scipio,</hi> who had
been General there, a Man far ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
almoſt all the <hi>Romans</hi> of his time
and thoſe that came after him. He
took <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> in which the
<hi>Africans</hi> kept all their Gold, Silver,
and proviſions for War: alſo the beſt
Hoſtages which <hi>Hannibal</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> he took
<hi>Mago Hannibal</hi>'s Brother in that City;
whom he ſent with others to <hi>Rome.</hi>
There was great joy at <hi>Rome</hi> for this
news: <hi>Scipio</hi> reſtored the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Hoſtages to their Parents: for which
kindneſs almoſt all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimouſly
ſurrendered themſelves to
him. After which things he put to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98079:37"/>
flight <hi>Aſdrubal Hannibal</hi>'s Brother,
and took very great Spoil.</p>
            <p>In the mean while <hi>Q. Fabius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus</hi>
re-took <hi>Tarentum</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where
<hi>Hannibal</hi> had great Forces: he ſlew
there <hi>Carthalo</hi> one of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and ſold twenty five thouſand
Captives: and having diſtributed
the plunder among his Soldiers,
ſent the price of thoſe that were ſold
to the Treaſury. Then many Cities
of the <hi>Romans</hi> which ſided with <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
yielded themſelves to <hi>Fabius
Maximus.</hi> The year following <hi>Scipio</hi>
performed famous actions in <hi>Spain,</hi>
and recovered ſeveral Towns by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his Brother <hi>Lucius Scipio.</hi> Yet
they fought unſucceſsfully in <hi>Italy;</hi>
for <hi>Claudius Marcellus</hi> the Conſul was
ſlain by <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third year after <hi>Scipio</hi> came
into <hi>Spain,</hi> he continued his noble
Deeds: he receiving into protection
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> overcome in a great
Battel, and was the firſt that asked
no Hoſtage of the Conquer'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:98079:37"/>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> deſpairing that <hi>Spain</hi> could
be kept againſt <hi>Scipio</hi> any longer, ſent
for his Brother <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> to <hi>Italy</hi> with
all his Forces; who coming the ſame
way his Brother <hi>Hannibal</hi> had come,
fell into the Ambuſh laid by <hi>Appius
Claudius Nero,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Livius Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linator</hi>
at <hi>Sena</hi> a City in <hi>Picenum:</hi> yet
he was ſlain fighting valiantly; his
great Forces were either taken or
kill'd, and a great Sum of Gold and
Silver ſent to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this <hi>Hannibal</hi> began to doubt
of the event of the War, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
being mightily encouraged, ſent
for <hi>Publius Cornelius Scipio</hi> out of
<hi>Spain,</hi> who came to <hi>Rome</hi> with great
glory.</p>
            <p>In the Conſulſhip of <hi>Quintus Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
and <hi>Lucius Valerius,</hi> all the Cities
which were under the Power of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
among the <hi>Brutii,</hi> deliver'd
themſelves up to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fourteenth year after <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
came into <hi>Italy, Scipio</hi> who had
acted in <hi>Spain</hi> ſucceſsfully, was made
Conſul and ſent to <hi>Africa:</hi> ſomething
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98079:38"/>
Divine was thought to have been in
that Man; inſomuch that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to have conference with the
Gods. He fought in <hi>Africa</hi> againſt
<hi>Hanno</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General, and
routed his Army. In the ſecond
Battel he took his Camp with four
thouſand and five hundred Soldiers,
with the ſlaughter of eleven thouſand.
He took <hi>Syphax</hi> King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> who
had aſſiſted the <hi>Africans,</hi> and ſeized
his Camp, who was ſent by <hi>Scipio</hi> to
<hi>Rome</hi> with the moſt conſiderable <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians,</hi>
and infinite Spoils; which
thing being known almoſt all <hi>Italy</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> who was commanded
by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to return into
<hi>Africa,</hi> now laid waſte by <hi>Scipio.</hi>
Thus the ſeventeenth year <hi>Italy</hi> was
freed from <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have left it with tears.</p>
            <p>Embaſſadours from <hi>Carthage</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Peace of <hi>Scipio,</hi> were ſent by him
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate: a Truce for
forty five days was granted them,
till they could return from <hi>Rome,</hi>
where they made a Preſent of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98079:38"/>
thouſand pound in Silver. The
Senate commanded a Peace ſhould
be made with the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the will of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who
granted it upon theſe Conditions:
That they ſhould keep a Fleet but of
thirty Ships, that they ſhould pay
five hundred thouſand pound in Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and reſtore the Captives and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives.
In the mean time <hi>Hannibal</hi>
arriving in <hi>Africa,</hi> the Peace was
broken, and many Hoſtilities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the <hi>Africans;</hi> yet their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
coming out of the City,

it came to a Treaty, Peace was
granted upon the ſame Conditions
as before: <hi>Scipio</hi> having added to the
old Sum of five hundred thouſand
pound a thouſand pound more for their
late Rupture. The Propoſitions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and they
commanded <hi>Hannibal</hi> to fight; The
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98079:39"/>
War was carried on againſt <hi>Carthage</hi>
by <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Maſiniſſa,</hi> another King
of the <hi>Numidians,</hi> who had made a
League with <hi>Scipio. Hannibal</hi> ſent
three Scouts to the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp:
whom being taken, <hi>Scipio</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be led through the Camp,
that the whole Army ſhould be
view'd by them, that a Dinner ſhould
be given them preſently, and after
that to be diſmiſſed that they might
tell <hi>Hannibal</hi> what they had ſeen in
the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp. In the mean time
the Armies are drawn up in Batalia
by both theſe Captains, the like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was ſeen in the memory of Man:
the Armies being drawn up by the
moſt skilful of all Generals. <hi>Scipio</hi>
was Conqueror, <hi>Hannibal</hi> himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

with many Horſe, then with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

in his Camp, and eight hundred in
Gold with other rich furniture. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that Battel Peace was made with

the <hi>Carthaginians. Scipio</hi> returning to

and hence was ſtil'd <hi>Africanus.</hi> Thus

came to <hi>Rome</hi> to this great Sight; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt <hi>Attalus</hi> and <hi>Eumenes</hi>
Kings in <hi>Aſia,</hi> with <hi>Pruſias</hi> King of
<hi>Bithynia</hi> were entertained with much
honour, and, they laid up the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
which they brought in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol,
with the conſent of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
Alſo <hi>Pruſias</hi> recommended his
Son <hi>Nicomedes</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>The following year <hi>Lucius Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi>
fought ſucceſsfully in <hi>Spain,</hi> and
afterwards <hi>Marcellus</hi> the Conſul for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
managed his Affairs there.</p>
            <p>Then the third <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War
begun, in the ſix hundredth year from
the building of the City, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip
of <hi>Lucius Manlius Cenſorinus,</hi>
and <hi>Marcus Manilius,</hi> fifty one years
after the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> War. Theſe
carried the War to <hi>Carthage,</hi> againſt
whom <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> fought as General,
and <hi>Famea</hi> commanded the Horſe;
then <hi>Scipio</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Scipio A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus</hi>
was a Tribune of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
him all the <hi>Romans</hi> feared and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98079:44"/>
reſpected, for he was eſteemed very
ſerviceable both in their Battels and at
their Councils, therefore many things
were managed fortunately through
him by theſe Conſuls; neither did
<hi>Aſdrubal</hi> or <hi>Famea</hi> ſhun any thing
more, than to fight againſt that Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> where <hi>Scipio</hi>
fought. About the ſame time <hi>Maſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa,</hi>
the King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> who for
ſixty years was in League with the
<hi>Romans,</hi> in the ninety ſeventh year
of his age, died, leaving fortry four
Sons behind him, and ordered <hi>Scipio</hi>
to divide his Empire amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Scipio</hi> being grown famous
though but a young Man, was made
Conſul, and ſent againſt <hi>Carthage;</hi>
he took it, and ſack'd it; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there the Spoils, which <hi>Carthage</hi>
had gathered together from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of many Cities, he reſtor'd
back upon proof to ſeveral Cities of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,
Italy</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> their Ornaments.
Thus <hi>Carthage</hi> was deſtroyed, about
ſeven hundred years after it was
built, and <hi>Scipio</hi> by his merit obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Name, which his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98079:45"/>
had, being ſtil'd for his Valour
<hi>AFRICAN<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> the <hi>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NGER.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time one called <hi>Pſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dophilippus,</hi>
took up Arms in <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi>
and utterly defeated <hi>Publius
Juvencius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Praetor, ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. After him <hi>Quintus Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Metellus</hi> was ſent thither by the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and twenty thouſand of the
Enemy being ſlain, he recovered <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi>
and reduced <hi>Pſeudophilippus</hi>
under his Power.</p>
            <p>War was alſo proclaimed againſt
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the Inhabitants of a
moſt famous City in <hi>Greece,</hi> for an
affront done to the <hi>Roman</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.
This City <hi>Mummius</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul
took and deſtroy'd; then there
were three noble Triumphs at <hi>Rome</hi>
at the ſame time of <hi>Africanus</hi> out
of <hi>Africa,</hi> before whoſe Chariot
<hi>Aſdrubal</hi> was led, of <hi>Metellus</hi> from
<hi>Macedonia,</hi> before whom <hi>Andriſcus</hi>
went, otherwiſe called <hi>Pſeudophilip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
of <hi>Mummius</hi> from <hi>Corinth,</hi> before
him were carry'd brazen Statues, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
and other Ornaments of that
famous City.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:98079:45"/>
One <hi>Pſeudoperſeus</hi> alſo rebelled in
<hi>Macedonia,</hi> having gathered together
ſeveral Slaves, pretending himſelf to be
<hi>Perſeus</hi>'s Son, but was overcome with
ſeventeen thouſand of his Men by
<hi>Tremellius</hi> the Quaeſtor. At this time
an Hermaphrodite being ſeen at <hi>Rome,</hi>
was drowned in the Sea by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of the Southſayers.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time <hi>Metellus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
noble Acts in <hi>Celtiberia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Spaniards. Quintus Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi>
ſucceeded him, a little after
<hi>Quintus Caepio</hi> was ſent Commander
to the ſame War; which indeed <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatus</hi>
waged againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> in
<hi>Luſitania,</hi> upon which through fear
<hi>Viriatus</hi> was ſlain by his Soldiers,
after having made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> for fourteen
years. He was a Shepherd at firſt,
afterwards chief amongſt the Thieves,
at laſt he ſtir'd up ſo many people
to this War, that he was thought
the aſſertor of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> liberty
againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and, when his
Murtherers ſought their rewards from
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98079:46"/>
               <hi>Caepio</hi> the Conſul; he anſwered, 'twas
never acceptable to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to
have a General murther'd by his own
Men.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Quintius Pompeius</hi> the Conſul
being overcome by the people of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantia,</hi>
a rich City of <hi>Spain,</hi> made a
diſhonourable Peace. After him <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Hoſtilius Mancinus</hi> made another
League with the <hi>Numantians,</hi> which
the Senate and People commanded
to be broken; and <hi>Mancinus</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it, to be given up to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies:
that they might revenge the
injury of this Rupture upon the cauſe
of it; wherefore after ſo great an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny,
the <hi>Roman</hi> Army being twice o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
by the <hi>Numantians, Publius
Scipio Africanus</hi> was made Conſul the
ſecond time, and ſent to <hi>Numantia,</hi>
he firſt corrected the vicious Soldiers
without any cruelty, more by labour
than puniſhment. Then he took ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Cities in <hi>Spain,</hi> partly by force
and partly by ſurrendry; after a long
Siege he took the City <hi>Numantia</hi>
by Famine and ras'd it; taking the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98079:46"/>
reſt of the Province into his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>About that time <hi>Attalus</hi> a King in
<hi>Aſia</hi> the leſs, the Brother of <hi>Eumenes</hi>
died, and by making the <hi>Roman</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
his Heir, added <hi>Aſia</hi> to their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
by his Will.</p>
            <p>A little after <hi>Decimus Junius Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
triumphed with great glory for
his Victory over the <hi>Callaeci,</hi> and the
<hi>Luſitan,</hi> and <hi>Publius Scipio Africanus</hi>
triumphed the ſecond time over the
<hi>Numantians</hi> the fourteenth year after
his firſt Triumph in <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time War was rais'd in
<hi>Aſia</hi> by <hi>Ariſtonicus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
whom he had by an Harlot; this
<hi>Eumenes</hi> was the Brother of King <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus,
Publius Licinius Craſſus</hi> was
ſent againſt him with the aſſiſtance of
many Kings. For <hi>Nicomedes</hi> King of
<hi>Bithynia</hi> help'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> with whom
afterwards the <hi>Romans</hi> had a ſevere
War, and <hi>Ariarathes</hi> King of <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia,
Pylaemenes</hi> King of <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi>
yet <hi>Craſſus</hi> was overcome and ſlain
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98079:47"/>
in Battel; his head brought to <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi>
and his body buried at <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
Afterwards <hi>Perpenna</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul,
who ſucceeded <hi>Craſſus,</hi> hearing of
the event of the War haſtened into
<hi>Aſia,</hi> and having overcome <hi>Ariſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
in Battel, compelled him through
want of Proviſion to a ſurrendry at
the City Stratonice whither he had
fled; <hi>Ariſtonicus</hi> was ſtrangled in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the command of the
Senate; but <hi>Perpenna</hi> could not enjoy
his triumph, dying in his return home
at <hi>Pergamum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lucius Caecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us

            <p>In the ſix hundred twenty ſeventh
year from the building of the City,
<hi>Caius Caſſius Longinus,</hi> and <hi>Sextus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius

the ſpoil was great, from the very

ſurrender'd himſelf to <hi>Domitius,</hi> and

where both the Conſuls triumphed
with great Glory.</p>
            <p>In the Conſulſhip of <hi>Marcus Porcius

            <p>In the Conſulſhip of <hi>Caius Caecilius

Brothers of <hi>Metellus,</hi> triumphed the

In the Conſulſhip of <hi>P. Scipio Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica,</hi>

War began againſt <hi>Jugurtha</hi> King of

bribed with the King's Money, he
made a diſgraceful Peace with him,
which was diſliked by the Senate;

taking or hilling his Elephants,

thouſand there ſcarce remain'd ten,
and of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Army onely fourteen
were ſlain. <hi>Mithridates</hi> upon the
news of this Battel recruited <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
with eighty thouſand choſen
Men out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> with whom <hi>Sylla</hi>
fought again. In the firſt Battel twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98079:52"/>
thouſand of the Enemy were ſlain
with <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Son of <hi>Archelaus:</hi>
In the ſecond, all the Forces of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
were cut off, <hi>Archelaus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
three days lying hid in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes.
<hi>Mithridates</hi> upon hearing of
this began to treat with <hi>Sylla.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At that time alſo <hi>Sylla</hi> overcame
the greateſt part of the <hi>Dardani, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſci,
Dalmatians</hi> and <hi>Moeſians,</hi> and
received the reſt into his protection.
When Embaſſadours came from King
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> deſiring a Peace, <hi>Sylla</hi>
anſwered that he would not grant it,
unleſs the King deſerting thoſe places
which he was poſſeſſed of, returned
into his own Kingdom. Yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in a perſonal Treaty, Peace
was made between them; That <hi>Sylla</hi>
haſting to the civil War might be in
no danger in his abſence. For whilſt
<hi>Sylla</hi> overcame <hi>Mithridates</hi> in <hi>Achaia</hi>
and <hi>Aſia, Marius,</hi> who was fled, and
<hi>Cornelius Cinna,</hi> one of the Conſuls,
renewed the War in <hi>Italy,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
entred the City <hi>Rome,</hi> ſlew the
moſt Noble and conſular Men of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98079:53"/>
Senate, and proſcribed many, having
pulled down the Houſe of <hi>Sylla,</hi> they
compelled his Sons and Wife to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
themſelves by flight; every one
of the Senate that remain'd, flying
out of the City came to <hi>Sylla</hi> in
<hi>Greece,</hi> intreating him that he would
ſuccour his native Country. He paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
over into <hi>Italy</hi> to fight againſt
<hi>Norbanus,</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> the Conſuls; he
fought the firſt Battel againſt <hi>Norba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
not far from <hi>Capua;</hi> where he
ſlew ſeven thouſand of the Enemy,
and took ſix thouſand, with the loſs
of one hundred twenty four of his
own, Then he marched againſt <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi>
but before the Battel, <hi>Scipio</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
his Army without blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.
But upon the new Election of
Conſuls at <hi>Rome, Marius</hi> the Son of
<hi>Marius,</hi> and <hi>Papirius Carbo</hi> being
choſe, <hi>Sylla</hi> fought <hi>Marius</hi> the younger,
and fifteen thouſand of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
being ſlain, loſt four hundred
Men. Afterwards entring the City,
and purſuing <hi>Marius</hi> the younger to
<hi>Praeneſte,</hi> he beſieged him there, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98079:53"/>
forced him to kill himſelf. Then he
had a fierce Battel with <hi>Lamponius,</hi>
and <hi>Carinates</hi> Captains of <hi>Marius</hi>'s
Party at the Gate <hi>Collina.</hi> Eighty
thouſand Men were reported to have
been in the Army againſt <hi>Sylla,</hi>
twelve thouſand yielded themſelves,
the reſt were either ſlain in Battel,
in the Camp, or in flight, ſo unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
was the revenge of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.
<hi>Cnaeus Carbo</hi> the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul
fled from <hi>Ariminum</hi> into <hi>Sicily</hi>
and there was ſlain by <hi>Cnaeus Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius,</hi>
whom but a young Man
twenty one years of age, <hi>Sylla</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the obſervation of his induſtry,
had made Commander of his Armies,
with the eſteem of being next to
himſelf. Upon the death of <hi>Carbo
Pompey</hi> recovered <hi>Sicily,</hi> and paſſing
into <hi>Africa,</hi> ſlew <hi>Domitius</hi> one of
<hi>Marius</hi>'s Faction, and <hi>Hiarbas</hi> King
of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> who aided <hi>Domitius.</hi>
After theſe things <hi>Sylla</hi> triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for conquering <hi>Mithridates</hi> with
great Glory. And <hi>Cnaeus Pompeius</hi>
in the twenty fourth year of his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98079:54"/>
age (which never had been granted
to any of the <hi>Romans)</hi> triumphed for
his Victory in <hi>Africa.</hi> Thus theſe
two cruel Wars ended, the <hi>Italian</hi>
which is called the <hi>Social,</hi> and the
Civil War, both which carried on for
the ſpace of ten years, deſtroyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a hundred and fifty thouſand,
twenty four Conſular Men, eight
Praetors, ſixty <hi>Aediles,</hi> and almoſt
three hundred Senators.</p>

his Camp, cutting off forty thouſand
of the Enemy with the loſs onely of

<hi>Mithridates</hi> fled with his

when he tyranniz'd over his
people, in a mutiny of his Soldiers
raiſed by his own Son <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> he
was forc'd to poiſon himſelf. Thus
<hi>Mithridates</hi> died at <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> a Man
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98079:59"/>
of great induſtry and conduct, he
lived ſeventy, reigned ſixty, and
made War with the <hi>Romans</hi> forty
years.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Pompey</hi> made War againſt <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes,</hi>
who ſurrender'd himſelf, and
coming to him in his Camp, ſixteen
miles from <hi>Artaxata,</hi> fell at his feet,
and delivered up his Crown, which
<hi>Pompey</hi> reſtored again, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

<hi>Syria, Phaenicia, Sophone;</hi> beſides
fining him in ſix thouſand Talents of
Silver, to be paid to the <hi>Romans</hi> for

            <p>Afterwards <hi>Pompey</hi> brought War
on the <hi>Albani,</hi> and thrice overcame
<hi>Orodes</hi> their King, who at laſt obtain'd
a Peace by his Letters and Preſents
to <hi>Pompey.</hi> He alſo overcame in a

for aſſiſting him in the <hi>Mithridatic</hi>

               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:98079:59"/>
the King of the <hi>Colchi.</hi> Then
he ſubdued the <hi>Ituraei</hi> and the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi>
and coming into <hi>Syria</hi> made
<hi>Seleucia</hi> near <hi>Antioch</hi> a free City, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it had not aided King <hi>Tigranes.</hi>
He reſtor'd the people of <hi>Antioch</hi> their
Hoſtages, and added ſome grounds to
the <hi>Daphnenſes</hi> to enlarge their Groves,
being delighted with the pleaſantneſs
of the place, and its many Springs.
From thence he marched into <hi>Judaea,</hi>
and in the third month took <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
the chief City, and having ſlain
twelve thouſand <hi>Jews</hi> he receiv'd the

the Government of <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Illyricum</hi>
with ten Legions, firſt overcame the
<hi>Helvetii</hi> (who are now called the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quani.)</hi>
Then after his Victories in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great Battels, he marched a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
even to the Britiſh Ocean. He
was almoſt nine years in ſubduing all
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98079:60"/>
               <hi>Gaul,</hi> which lies between the <hi>Alps</hi> the
River <hi>Rhone,</hi> the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the Ocean,
in compaſs three thouſand and two
hundred miles. Then he brought War
upon the <hi>Britans,</hi> who never before
heard of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name, and having
overcome them, he took their Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and made them tributary to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and ordered <hi>Gaul</hi> to
pay an annual tribute of above three
hundred thouſand pounds. And then
paſſing the <hi>Rhine</hi> overcame the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
in very great Battels: he was
ſo fortunate, that he fought but thrice
unſucceſsfully: once in Perſon againſt
the <hi>Arverni,</hi> twice in his abſence in
<hi>Germany,</hi> where his two Lieutenants
<hi>Titurius</hi> and <hi>Arunculeius</hi> were ſlain
in an Ambuſh.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time in the year
of the City ſix hundred ninety ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>Marcus Licinius Craſſus Pompey</hi>'s
Collegue, made the ſecond time Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul,
was ſent againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi>
and when he fought at <hi>Carrae</hi> both
contrary to the Omens, and Praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Southſayers, he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98079:61"/>
by <hi>Surena</hi> one of <hi>Orodes</hi> his
Captains, and at laſt was ſlain, with
his Son a famous and valiant young
Man. The reſidue of his Army was
ſaved by <hi>Cnaeus Caſſius</hi> his Queſtor,
who with great reſolution and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
ſo repair'd the calamity, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
the <hi>Euphrates</hi> he overcame the
<hi>Perſians</hi> in many Battels.</p>
            <p>Now that lamentable and horrible
civil War came on, which, beſides
the calamities that happen'd in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
changed the condition of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Name. For <hi>Caeſar</hi> returning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
from <hi>Gaul,</hi> required another
Conſulſhip, and it being without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
carried on his ſide, he was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by <hi>Marcellus</hi> the Conſul, <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus,
Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
having diſmiſſed his Army
to return to <hi>Rome;</hi> for which Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
from <hi>Ariminum,</hi> where he mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered
his Soldiers, he march'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his native Country. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul
with <hi>Pompey,</hi> the whole Senate,
and all the Nobility fled out of the
City into <hi>Greece. Pompey</hi> being Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98079:61"/>
rais'd War againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirus,
Macedonia,</hi> and <hi>Achaia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> having entered the City for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken,
made himſelf Dictator. Thence
marching into <hi>Spain</hi> he routed <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s
brave and ſtout Armies, under
the three Generals, <hi>L. Afranius, M.
Petreius,</hi> and <hi>M. Varro.</hi> Then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
he marched into <hi>Greece;</hi>
where fighting againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> he
was in the firſt Battel overthrown,
and put to flight; but the Night
drawing on, he eſcaped, and upon
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s not purſuing him, he ſaid,
<hi>Pompey</hi> knew not how to conquer,
he being only that Day in his Power
to have been overcome. Afterwards
they fought in <hi>Theſſaly</hi> at <hi>Palaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharſalus</hi>
with great Armies on both
ſides. <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army conſiſted of
forty thouſand Foot and ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Horſe in the left Wing, with
five hundred in the right, beſides the
Auxiliary Forces of all the Eaſt, all
the Nobility, with a great number
of Senators, Praetors, and ſuch as had
been Conſuls, and the Conquerors of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98079:62"/>
ny Nations. <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to thirty thouſand Foot, with a
thouſand Horſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Forces were never
greater at one time, nor never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by more valiant Generals,
they might have overcome the whole
World, if they had fought againſt
their Enemies. But after a ſharp
fight, <hi>Pompey</hi> being overcome, and
his Camp plunder'd, fled to <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria,</hi>
that he might receive aids
from the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whoſe Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
he had been by order of Senate
in his minority; but he following
<hi>Pompeys</hi> fortune more than true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
ſlew him, and ſent his Head and
Ring to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> which he looking on,
is reported to have wept, beholding
the Head of ſo worthy a Man, and
once his Son-in-law.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Caeſar</hi> coming to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,
Ptolemy</hi> had Deſigns upon his
life, for which reaſon <hi>Caeſar</hi> made
War with him, and he being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
was drowned in the <hi>Nile,</hi> but
his body was afterwards found cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98079:62"/>
with a Gold Coat of Mail. <hi>Caeſar</hi>
having won <hi>Alexandria,</hi> gave that
Kingdom to <hi>Cleopatra Ptolemy</hi>'s Siſter,
with whom he had been diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
acquainted. <hi>Caeſar</hi> returning from
thence overcame in a Battel <hi>Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
great <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Son, who aided
<hi>Pompey</hi> in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and alſo rebelling
in <hi>Pontus,</hi> had ſeiz'd upon many of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Cities, upon which misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
he kill'd himſelf. Then <hi>Caeſar</hi>
upon his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the third time Conſul, with <hi>M.
Aemilius Lepidus,</hi> who was the year
before in his Dictatorſhip General of
the Horſe. From thence he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Africa,</hi> to the War, which very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Nobility, with <hi>Juba</hi> King
of <hi>Mauritania</hi> had raiſed againſt him.
The <hi>Roman</hi> Generals were <hi>P. Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Scipio</hi> (of the ancient Family of
<hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> he was Father-in-law
to <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great) <hi>M. Petreius,
Q. Varius,</hi> and <hi>M. Porcius Cato, L.
Cornelius Fauſtus</hi> (the Son of <hi>Sylla</hi>
the Dictator and <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Son-in-law.)
<hi>Caeſar</hi> in a pitch'd Battel, after many
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98079:63"/>
Skirmiſhes overcame them. <hi>Cato, Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,
Petreius,</hi> and <hi>Juba</hi> ſlew themſelves;
but <hi>Fauſtus</hi> was put to death.</p>
            <p>After a year <hi>Caeſar</hi> coming back
to <hi>Rome</hi> made himſelf Conſul the
fourth time, but ſoon went into <hi>Spain,</hi>
where <hi>Cnaeus</hi> and <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi>'s Sons
had levy'd a great War, they fought
many Battels, the laſt was at the City
<hi>Munda,</hi> in which <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſo near
overcome, that ſeeing his Soldiers
ſly, he would have ſlain himſelf, leſt
after ſo great Military Glory, and
fifty ſix years old, he ſhould fall into
the power of theſe young Men; at
laſt, having rallied his Forces, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame
them, and ſlew <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
eldeſt Son, and put to flight the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Now <hi>Caeſar</hi> having ended the
Civil Wars through all the World,
returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and began to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
too inſolently, and againſt the
cuſtoms of the <hi>Roman</hi> Liberties. He
would beſtow Honours at his own
pleaſure, which were before given
by the people: neither would he riſe
up to the Senate coming to ſalute
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98079:63"/>
him; he performed other things after
a regal tyrannick manner. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
above ſixty Senators and <hi>Roman</hi>
Knights conſpired againſt him. The
chief of the Conſpirators were the
two <hi>Bruti</hi> (of <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Family who
was the firſt that was made a <hi>Roman</hi>
Conſul, and had expell'd the Kings)
with <hi>Cnaeus Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Servilius Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>

the Civil Wars were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.
The Senate favouring the
murtherers of <hi>Caeſar, Antony</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul,

therefore diſturbed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,

he was judged an enemy by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
The two Conſuls, <hi>Panſa</hi> and
<hi>Hirtius</hi> were ſent to purſue him, with
<hi>Octavianus, Caeſar</hi>'s Nephew, a young
man, eighteen years old, whom he
made his Heir, and commanded to

overcame him: but it happened out
that theſe two Conſuls being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors

being put to ſlight, having loſt his

made peace with <hi>Antony;</hi> and as if he
would vindicate the death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by whom he was adopted in his
Will, he marched to <hi>Rome</hi> with his
Army, and by force procured the

and <hi>Antony;</hi> and ſo from the

ſix and fifty years. He died a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
death in the ſeventy ſixth
year of his age, in <hi>Atella,</hi> a City of
<hi>Campania.</hi> He was buried in the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
Martius</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> a man not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly
for the moſt part, reckon'd
a God. Nor was any one more happy
than him in his Wars, or more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in Peace. He lived with the

years he ruled alone, being moſt libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
towards all men, and very faithful
to his friends, who he had advanced
to ſo great honors, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
equal to himſelf. The Roman
affairs never flouriſhed more (before
his time) for beſides the Civil Wars in
which he was always conqueror, he
added <hi>Aegypt</hi> to the Roman Empire,
with <hi>Cantabria,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
overcome before, but entirely
ſubdued by him: alſo <hi>Pannonia, Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania,

and amongſt theſe the famous Cities
<hi>Boſphorus</hi> and <hi>Panticapaeon.</hi> He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the <hi>Daci</hi> in ſeveral Battels. He
cut off the great Forces of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and drove them beyond the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Allis,</hi> which is up the Country far
from the <hi>Rhine:</hi> but this War was
managed by his Son-in-law <hi>Druſus,</hi> as
the <hi>Pannonian</hi> War was by his other
Son-in-law <hi>Tiberius;</hi> in which War he
brought four hundred thouſand Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives
out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and planted
'em upon the Banks of the <hi>Rhine</hi> in
<hi>Gaul.</hi> He retook <hi>Armenia</hi> from the
<hi>Parthians,</hi> and the <hi>Perſians</hi> gave Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages
to him, (which they never did
before to any other.) Alſo they reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Roman Enſigns, which were
taken away from <hi>Craſſus,</hi> when he
was beaten. The <hi>Scythians,</hi> and
the <hi>Indians</hi> ſent preſents and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
to him, who before had
never heard of the Roman name. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia</hi>
in his time was made a Province,
being before a Kingdom; and <hi>M. Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
the Propraetor was the firſt that
governed it. The barbarous Nations
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98079:68"/>
ſo loved him, that Kings who were Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the Roman People, built Cities
to his honor which they would call
<hi>Caeſarea;</hi> as that built by King <hi>Juba</hi>
in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and that in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi>
which now is a very famous City. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Kings left their Kingdoms, to do
him ſervice, and being dreſſed in a
Roman Habit, ran by him in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
or on Horſeback, and dying he
was ſtiled a God: He left the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
to <hi>Tiberius</hi> in a moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
condition; who being his
Wives Son, was afterwards his Son-in-law
by the marriage of his Daughter,
and at laſt his Son by adoption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tiberius</hi> governed very lazily with
great cruelty, wicked avarice, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
luſt. He never fought in perſon,
but carried on his Wars by his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.
Some Kings whom he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
to him by his flatteries, he never
let return to their own Country; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom <hi>Archelaus</hi> King of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,</hi>
whoſe Kingdom alſo he
made a Province, and commanded
the chief City to be called after his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98079:68"/>
name, which now is called <hi>Caeſarea,</hi>
and before <hi>Mazaca.</hi> He reigned three
and twenty years, and died in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania</hi>
in the eighty third year of his age,
to the great joy of all men.</p>
            <p>After him rul'd <hi>Caius Caeſar,</hi> ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Caligula, Druſus</hi> the Son-in-law of

his great Uncle: he was very
wicked and horrible, one who might
excuſe the Vices of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
a War againſt the <hi>Germans;</hi>
and entering into <hi>Suevia,</hi> performed
no valiant action. He committed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt
with his Siſters, and had a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by one of 'em, when he had been
outragious towards all men in Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Avarice, and Luſt, he was kill'd
in his Palace in the nine and thirtieth
year of his age, and of his Reign the
third year, tenth month, and eighth

            <p>After him Reigned <hi>Claudius, Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi>'s

whoſe Nephew <hi>Caligula</hi> was: He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
indifferently well, managing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98079:69"/>
many things calmly and moderately,

and after the Conqueſt of it by the

and <hi>Aulus Plautius.</hi> He made a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
triumph: He added alſo to the
Roman Empire ſome Iſlands ſcituated
beyond <hi>Britany,</hi> in the Ocean call'd
<hi>Orcades:</hi> He ſtil'd his Son <hi>Britannicus,</hi>
and appeared ſo civil to ſome of his
Friends, that he accompanied <hi>Plautius</hi>
a Nobleman, who in the Britiſh expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
performed many brave actions,
in his triumph going to the Capitol,
and walked on his left hand: He li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſixty four years; and reign'd four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen:
He was Conſecrated after his
death, and ſtiled a God.</p>
            <p>After him came <hi>Nero,</hi> very like to
his Uncle <hi>Caligula:</hi> who both diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and diminiſhed the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
one of unuſual luxury and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence:
he followed the example of
<hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> and waſhed himſelf in
hot and cold Oyntments: he fiſhed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98079:69"/>
with golden Nets and purple ſtrings:
he kill'd a great many of the Senate,
and was an enemy to all good men: at
laſt he proſtituted himſelf ſo baſely,
that he danced and ſung upon a Stage
in a Fidlers habit: he committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parricides in the murther of his
Brother's Wife and Mother: he burnt
<hi>Rome,</hi> that it might repreſent to him,
how heretofore <hi>Troy</hi> was taken and
burnt: he performed no warlike acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and almoſt loſt <hi>Britanny;</hi> for there
in his time two noble Cities were took
and deſtroyed. The <hi>Parthians</hi> took
away <hi>Armenia,</hi> and made ſlaves of the
Roman Legions. Yet two Provinces
were gained in his time, <hi>Pontus,</hi> call'd
<hi>Polemoniacus,</hi> from the gift of King <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon;</hi>
the <hi>Alps,</hi> call'd <hi>Cotiae,</hi> from the
death of King <hi>Cocius.</hi> Hence he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
deteſtable to <hi>Rome,</hi> deſerted by
all men, and adjudged an enemy by
the Senate; When he was ſearched for
to be puniſhed, which was thus, that
he ſhould be lead along in publick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
with a Fork upon his neck, and
beaten with Rods to death, ſhould be
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98079:70"/>
flung head-long from off the Carpeian
Rock; he fled out of the Palace; near
the City in a Farm of one of his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
kill'd himſelf, between the <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
and <hi>Numentane</hi> way, four miles
from <hi>Rome:</hi> he built the hot Baths
call'd <hi>Neronianae,</hi> and now <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinae:</hi>
he died in the one and thirtieth
year of his age, and the fourteenth
year of his Reign. With him all <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>'s
Family was extinct.</p>
            <p>After him came <hi>Ser. Galba,</hi> a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of a very ancient Family, being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
three years, he was choſe Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> and
ſoon after was willingly received by
all the Armies: when he lived a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
life, he was eminent in Military
and Civil Affairs, often Conſul, often
Proconſul, and General in the greateſt
Wars: in his ſhort Reign he began
well, but at laſt ſeemed more inclined
to ſeverity: he was kill'd by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
of <hi>Otho</hi> in the ſeventh month of
his Reign, and had his throat cut in
the <hi>Forum</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and buried in his
Gardens, in the <hi>Aurelian</hi> way, not far
from the City.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:98079:70"/>
               <hi>Otho</hi> having kill'd <hi>Galba,</hi> got the
Empire; of a more noble race by his
Mother, than by his Father; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was mean: he was effeminate in
his private life, and could not ſhew
any experiment of himſelf in his Reign;
for at that time when <hi>Otho</hi> kill'd <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,
Vitellius</hi> was made Emperor by the
German Armies, and rais'd War againſt
him, when he was beat in a Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
at <hi>Bebriacum</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> tho he had
great forces remaining: He kill'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of his own accord, and anſwered
his Soldiers, deſiring him not ſo ſoon
to deſpair of the ſucceſs of the war,
that he was not of ſo great value, to
be the occaſion of a Civil War: he
died a voluntary death, in the 38th.
year of his age, and the 95th. day of
his reign.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Vitellius</hi> obtained the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
of a Family more advanced by
preferment, than noble: his Father
was not very honorably born, yet
bore three regular Conſulſhips; he ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
very ſcandalouſly, notorious for
great cruelty, eſpecially for Gluttony;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98079:71"/>
oftentimes keeping a Feaſt every 4th.
or 5th. day: one Supper was very
remarkable, which his Brother <hi>Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
gave him; in which entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
beſides other expences, there
were laid upon the Table two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Fiſh, and ſeven thouſand Birds:
he affected to be like <hi>Nero,</hi> and ſo far
pretended it, that he honored him
with Funeral Rites who had been ſo
meanly buried: he was killed by the
Generals of <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> having firſt
ſlain <hi>Sabinus</hi> the Emperor, <hi>Veſpatian</hi>'s
Brother, whom he burnt with the
Capitol: he was drawn naked pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
and ignominiouſly through
<hi>Rome,</hi> having a Sword under his chin,
and Dung flung at his face and body
by all that met him; at laſt with his
throat cut, he was flung into the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
and wanted common Burial: he
died in the 57th. year of his age, and
in the eighth month, and firſt day of
his Reign.</p>
            <p>After him reigned <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> made
Emperor at <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> a Prince of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
Parentage, but to be compared
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98079:71"/>
with the beſt; ſo illuſtrious before he
was Emperor, that being ſent into
<hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Claudius,</hi> and then into
<hi>Britanny:</hi> he encountered two and
thirty times with the Enemy. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
two valiant Nations, took
twenty Towns, and added the Iſland
<hi>Vecta,</hi> lying juſt by <hi>Britanny</hi> to the
Roman Empire. He carried himſelf at
<hi>Rome</hi> very moderate in his Reign, tho
ſomewhat too covetous of mony; yet
he took it from none wrongfully, and
gave with great care that eſpecially to
the Poor which he had gathered with
all frugality. Scarce any Prince before
him was more liberal ot juſt: he was
of ſo good a nature, that he hardly
puniſhed any one guilty of Treaſon
otherwiſe than by Baniſhment. In his
time he added <hi>Judaea</hi> to the Roman
Empire, with <hi>Hieroſoluma,</hi> the moſt
eminent City of <hi>Palaeſtine,</hi> and made
Provinces of <hi>Achaia, Lycia, Rhodes,
Byzantium, Samos,</hi> which enjoyed
their freedom before his time; alſo
<hi>Thrace, Cilicia, Trachea, Commagene</hi>
governed by Confederate Kings; he
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98079:72"/>
remembred neither offences nor quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
and patiently bore the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
that Lawyers and Philoſophers
ſpoke againſt him; yet a diligent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actor
of Military Diſcipline: he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
for the conqueſt of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
with his Son <hi>Titus.</hi> For theſe things
when he was beloved and dear to the
Senate, the People, and to all, he died
of the Flux in one of his own Mannors
near the Country of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> in
the ſixty ninth year of his age, the
ninth year, and ſeventh day of
his Reign, and was numbred amongſt
the Gods: He knew the Nativities of
his Sons ſo well, that when many Plots
were made againſt him, which being
diſcovered, he deſpiſed with diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſaying to the Senate, that his
Sons ſhould ſuccced him or none.</p>
            <p>After him came <hi>Titus,</hi> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
called <hi>Veſpatian;</hi> a Man adorned
with all ſorts of Virtue, ſtiled the love
and the delight of mankind, very elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
warlike, and temperate: he
pleaded Cauſes in Latin, and made
Greek Poems and Tragedies: At the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98079:72"/>
Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> fighting under his
Father, he kill'd twelve men upon the
Walls, with twelve ſtrokes of his
Darts: he was ſo civil in his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Rome,</hi> that none ever was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed:
he pardoned thoſe to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
convicted of Conſpiracies againſt
him, that he treated them with the
ſame freedom as before: he was one of
ſo great eaſineſs and liberality, that he
could deny nothing to any man; and
when he was reprehended by his
friends, he anſwered, that no man
ought to depart with a ſad counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
from the Emperor: wherefore
once at Supper remembring he had
given nothing that day to any one, he
ſaid, <hi>O my friends, I have loſt this day:</hi>
he built the Amphitheater at <hi>Rome,</hi>
and kill'd five thonſand Wild Beaſts
at its dedication. Hence being beloved
with unuſual kindneſs, he died in the
ſame houſe his Father did, after he had
reigned two years, eight months, and
twenty days, in the one and fortieth
year of his age. When he was dead
the publick mourning was ſo great,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98079:73"/>
that all grieved as if they had been
fatherleſs. The Senate having heard
of his death in the evening, aſſembled
with all haſt in the Senate-Houſe the
ſame night, and render'd him being
dead ſo many thanks and praiſes, as
never to any Emperor in his preſence,
or in his life time, conſecrating him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Gods.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Domitian</hi> reigned, his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Brother, more like <hi>Nero, Caligula,</hi>
or <hi>Tiberius</hi> than his Father, or Brother;
yet he governed ſoberly for his firſt
years: ſoon after falling into the great
vices of Luſt, Anger, Cruelty, and
Covetouſneſs, he made himſelf ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that he aboliſhed the merits of his
Father, and Brother: he killed the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
of the Senate, and commanded
himſelf to be ſtiled Lord and God: he
would ſuffer no Statue to be erected in
the Capitol for him, but of Silver and
Gold: he kill'd his Kinſmen, and his
pride was execrable: he made four Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions,
one in <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Catti,</hi> and two againſt the
<hi>Daci:</hi> he triumphed twice over the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98079:73"/>
               <hi>Daci,</hi> and the <hi>Catti,</hi> and wore a Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
for the <hi>Sarmatians:</hi> he ſuffered
many loſſes in theſe Wars, for his Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were kill'd in <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> with their
General, and the <hi>Daci</hi> cut off <hi>Appius
Sabinus</hi> a Conſular man, and <hi>C. Fuſcus</hi>
Captain of the Guards with their
great Armies: he built many places at
<hi>Rome,</hi> as the <hi>Capitol,</hi> the <hi>Forum,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Tranſitorium,</hi> the Muſick Room,
the Portico's of <hi>Iſis</hi> and <hi>Serapis,</hi> and
the <hi>Stadium:</hi> but when he began to
be hated by all for his wickedneſs, he
was ſlain in the Palace, by a conſpiracy
of his Servants, in the five and fortieth
year of his age, and fifteenth of his
Reign. His Corps were carried out by
the Bearers with great diſgrace, and
buried ſcandalouſly.</p>

made Emperour at <hi>Agrippina,</hi> a City
of <hi>Gaul,</hi> govern'd the Commonwealth
ſo well that he was deſervedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
before all other Princes; he
was of extraordinary civility and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and extended the bounds of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98079:75"/>
               <hi>Roman</hi> Empire both far and wide,
which after the time of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was
rather defended than honourably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd:
he repair'd many Cities in
<hi>Germany</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi>
and having overcome <hi>Decibalus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
<hi>Dacia,</hi> making that part a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
beyond the <hi>Danube,</hi> which now
belongs to the <hi>Taiphali, Victophali,</hi>
and the <hi>Thervingi,</hi> about one thouſand

which the <hi>Parthians</hi> had ſeiz'd,
having kill'd <hi>Pharnaces</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi>
who govern'd it. He gave a King to

the Kings of the <hi>Iberi,</hi> the
<hi>Sauromatae,</hi> the <hi>Boſphorani,</hi> the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi>

with a great Country of <hi>Perſia,</hi>
call'd <hi>Anthemiſius;</hi> he took the City
<hi>Seleucia, Cteſiphon, Babylon</hi> and <hi>Edeſſa,</hi>
and conquer'd even unto <hi>India;</hi> at

               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:98079:76"/>
reducing <hi>Arabia</hi> to the ſame form of

Yet he ſurpaſs'd his Military Fame
with civility and moderation, equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
himſelf to all at <hi>Rome</hi> and
through the Provinces. He often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
went to viſit his Friends, either
when they were ſick or upon feſtival
Days; and without any diſtinction
kept mutual Feaſts among them, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad with them in their Litters:
he never injur'd any of the Senators,
nor did any unjuſt thing to encreaſe
his Exchequer; he was liberal to all
Men, and both publickly and private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enrich'd with Money and Honours,
even them, with whom he was but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
acquainted: he built many
places all over the World, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
great priviledges to Cities: he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all things ſo peaceably and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that all the time he reign'd, but
one Senator was condemn'd, and he
by an Order of the Senate, unknown
to <hi>Trajan.</hi> For this reaſon moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
a God both alive and dead,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98079:76"/>
he deſerv'd to be worſhip'd all over the
World. Among other ſayings of his,
this is much eſteem'd, when his friends
blam'd him, that he was too kind to
all Men; he anſwered, he did to them,
as he ſhould wiſh Emperours to do
to him, if he himſelf was a Subject.
After he had obtain'd great honour
both at home and abroad, as he was
returning from <hi>Perſia</hi> he dy'd of the
Flux at <hi>Seleucia,</hi> a City of <hi>Iſauria,</hi> in
the ſixty ſecond year, ninth month, and
fourth day of his age, and of his Reign,
the nineteenth year, ſixth month and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
day: he was made a God, and of
all other Emperours was buried within
the City, his bones were put in a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Urn, and placed under a Pillar in
the <hi>Forum,</hi> which he himſelf had made,
which Pillar was one hundred forty
four feet high. So great reſpect is
paid to this Princes memory, that
even unto my time the Senators with
no other phraſe honour'd their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
than be thou happier than
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and better than <hi>Trajan.</hi> So
much hath the glory of goodneſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98079:77"/>
from him, that it gives an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of a great Example either to
Flatterers, or true Praiſers.</p>
            <p>After the deceaſe of <hi>Trajan, Aelius
Adrianus</hi> was made Emperour, indeed
not with <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Will, but by the
help of his Wife <hi>Plotina,</hi> for he, as
long as he liv'd, although he was his
kinſman, would not adopt him; he
was born at <hi>Italica</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
the glory of his Predeceſſour,
preſently forſook thoſe three Provinces
which <hi>Trajan</hi> had added to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire; and recall'd his Forces
out of <hi>Aſſyria, Meſopotamia,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
and made <hi>Euphrates</hi> the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
bound of the Empire; his Friends
deter'd him endeavouring to do the
ſame thing in <hi>Dacia,</hi> leſt many of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Citizens ſhould be expos'd to
the <hi>Barbarians:</hi> for when <hi>Trajan</hi> had
conquer'd that Countrey, he brought
a great Colony out of the whole <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire to plant and build Cities
there, <hi>Dacia</hi> being depopulated in the
long War with <hi>Decibalus: Aelius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianus</hi>
enjoy'd peace all the time of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98079:77"/>
his Reign, having made only one War,
and that by the Governour of the
Province, he travel'd all over the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire and built in many places.
He was a very good Scholar both in
<hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek;</hi> not eſteem'd very
merciful, yet he took great care of
his Revenue, and the Diſcipline of
his Soldiers. He died in <hi>Campania,</hi>
above ſixty years old, and in the
twenty firſt year, tenth month,
and twenty ninth day of his Reign.
The Senate would not have made
him a God, onely <hi>Titus Aurelius Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius
Antoninus,</hi> that ſucceeded him,
by long intreaty, when all the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
reſiſted him openly, at length
obtain'd it.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Titus Antoninus Fulvius Bojo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
was made Emperour after <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
he was alſo call'd <hi>Pius,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
was Noble, but not very ancient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet he himſelf was ſo famous a Man,
that he might as deſervedly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> as <hi>Trajan</hi>
to <hi>Romulus.</hi> When he was a private
Man he was very honeſt, but when
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98079:78"/>
Emperour, much more. He was rough
to none, but kind to all: indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honour'd for his Military Actions,
affecting more to defend the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
than to increaſe them, he made
it his buſineſs to ſeek for men that
were able to govern the Common-wealth,
always conferring great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
upon good Men, and deteſting
the bad without ſeverity; he was no
leſs venerable to his Confederate
Kings than awful; inſomuch that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Nations of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> laid
down their Arms, and ſubmitted
themſelves to his Opinion in their
Controverſies and Quarrels: he was
very rich before he was Emperour,
but waſted it in his Soldiers pay,
and gifts beſtowed upon his Friends;
yet he left a rich Treaſury behind
him. He was call'd <hi>Pius</hi> for his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
and dy'd at <hi>Lorium,</hi> his
Country Palace about twelve miles
from <hi>Rome,</hi> in the ſeventy third year
of his age, and twenty third of his
Reign, and was deſervedly made a
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:98079:78"/>
After him reign'd <hi>M. Antoninus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
who was without doubt a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Prince: for his Father deſcended from
<hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> and his Mother from
King <hi>Salentinus;</hi> with him reign'd <hi>L.
Annius Antoninus Verus,</hi> for then the
<hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth firſt ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the equal authority of two
Princes, being govern'd before but by
one Emperour. Theſe were ally'd by
Kindred and Marriage: for <hi>Verus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
Antoninus</hi> married the Daughter
of <hi>M. Antoninus,</hi> but <hi>M. Antoninus</hi> was
Son-in-law to <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> by his
Wife <hi>Galeria Fauſtina</hi> the younger, who
was his Couſin-german. They made
War with the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who after the
Victory of <hi>Trajan,</hi> then made their firſt
Rebellion. <hi>V. Antoninus</hi> march'd to
this War, and living at <hi>Antioch</hi> near
<hi>Armenia,</hi> did great actions by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of his Captains; he took <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucia</hi>
a very famous City in <hi>Aſſyria</hi>
with five hundred thouſand Men:
and conquering the <hi>Parthians,</hi> made
a Triumph with his Brother and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law.
He dy'd in <hi>Venetia</hi> of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98079:79"/>
the Diſeaſe, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> call
the <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> being kill'd by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
eruption of blood in his brain,
in his Litter with his Brother, as he
was coming from <hi>Concordia</hi> to <hi>Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
He was a rough Man, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did any ill thing in reverence to
his Brother; he dy'd in the eleventh
year of his Reign, and was made a
God.</p>
            <p>After him only <hi>M. Antoninus</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
the Commonwealth; a man
more to be admir'd than prais'd: he
was very peaceable from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his life; inſomuch that neither
joy nor grief could alter his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
he mightily lov'd the Stoick
Philoſophy, and was Maſter of it as
well by Learning, as by the morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his life. Even when he was a
youth he merited ſo great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>Adrianus</hi> deſign'd to make
him his <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but having adopted
<hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> he made him therefore
his Son-in-law, that he might come that
way to the Government; he learn'd
Philoſophy of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian,</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:98079:79"/>
and <hi>Greek</hi> of <hi>Sextus Chaero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis,
Plutarch</hi>'s Nephew, and <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
that moſt excellent Orator taught
him <hi>Latin;</hi> he carry'd himſelf very
juſtly to all the <hi>Romans,</hi> and was no
way puff'd up according to the
haughtineſs of Emperours: he was
very liberal, and govern'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
with great moderation. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
while he reign'd were carry'd
on ſucceſsfully againſt the <hi>Germans,</hi> in
his own Perſon, he made one War
with the <hi>Marcomanni,</hi> as conſiderable
as any in Story, even to be compar'd
with the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Wars, and
from the loſs of whole Armies to be
eſteem'd worſe. In his time there
happen'd ſo great a Peſtilence, that
after his Victory over the <hi>Perſians,</hi>
a great number of Men and almoſt
all his Soldiers dy'd through <hi>Italy</hi>
and the Provinces. Wherefore after
he had perſever'd with great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and patience full three years at
<hi>Carnuntum,</hi> he ended that War with
the <hi>Marcomanni,</hi> which had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
on by the confederacy of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98079:80"/>
               <hi>Quadi,</hi> the <hi>Vandali,</hi> the <hi>Sarmatae,</hi>
the <hi>Suevi</hi> and all the neighbouring
<hi>Barbarians;</hi> he ſlew a great many
thouſand of them, and having freed
the <hi>Pannonii</hi> from their ſervitude, he
made another Triumph at <hi>Rome</hi> with
his Son <hi>Com. Antoninus,</hi> whom he
had made his <hi>Caeſar.</hi> When his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
was all exhauſted in this
War, and he had no aſſiſtance by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
being unwilling to lay any thing
upon the Provinces or the Senate, he
made an Inventory of the furniture
of his Palace, and in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s <hi>Forum</hi>
for two months expos'd to ſale his
golden Veſſels, his Chryſtal and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Cups, his Wifes and his own
Wardrobe, and a great many Jewels,
from which he rais'd a good Sum of
God, and after the Victory bought
his Houſhold-ſtuff again of them that
were willing to ſell, being offended
with none that refus'd it. He alſo
granted that Noblemen might make
Feaſts with the ſame Grandeur and
Retinue as himſelf. After this Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he was ſo noble in his Sports and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98079:80"/>
publick Shews, that he is reported to
have expos'd in the <hi>Amphitheater</hi> an
hundred Lions at once. Thus after he
had reſtor'd the Commonwealth to a
proſperous condition, he dy'd in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
firſt year of his age, having Reign'd
about eighteen years, and was made
a God according to the earneſt deſires
of all Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucius Antoninus Commodus</hi> ſucceeded
him, a Man not at all like his Father,
yet conſiderable for a War, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
ſucceſsfully againſt the <hi>Germans;</hi>
he endeavour'd to have the month
<hi>September</hi> call'd <hi>Commodus</hi> from his
own name; being deprav'd by his
luxury and luſts, he oftentimes
fought as a Gladiator in their Fencing
Schools, and in the <hi>Amphitheater</hi> with
ſuch ſort of Men. He dy'd ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and 'twas thought he was ſtrangl'd
or poiſon'd, when he had Reign'd
twelve years and eight months from
the death of his Father, ſo deteſted by
every body, that he was reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as an Enemy to mankind, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was dead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:98079:81"/>
               <hi>Pertinax</hi> ſucceeded him, an old
Man, who being above ſeventy years
old, and Governour of <hi>Rome,</hi> was
made Emperour by an Order of the
Senate; he was ſlain in the eighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
day of his Reign, by a mutiny of
the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers, and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
of <hi>Julian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After him <hi>Salvius Julianus</hi> took
the government, he was a noble Man
and skilful in the Laws, Nephew to
<hi>Salvius Julianus,</hi> who in the time of
<hi>Adrianus</hi> drew up the perpetual Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.
He was conquered by <hi>Severus</hi>
at the <hi>Milvian</hi> Bridg, and was ſlain
in the Palace, having reigned ſeven
months.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> ſucceeded him,
he was born in <hi>Africa,</hi> at <hi>Leptis,</hi> a
Town of the Province of <hi>Tripolis.</hi>
He was the firſt and laſt Emperour in
the memory of Man that ever came
out of <hi>Africa,</hi> he was firſt an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in the Treaſury, afterwards
a Tribune of the Soldiers, and ſo
by various employments he came
to the government of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98079:81"/>
He call'd himſelf <hi>Pertinax</hi>
in honour of that <hi>Pertinax</hi> ſlain by
<hi>Julian;</hi> he was very parſimonious,
and by nature cruel. He fought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Wars, and came off ſucceſsfully:
he ſlew <hi>Peſcennius Niger</hi> at the City
<hi>Cyzicus,</hi> who had made a Rebellion in
<hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria:</hi> he overcame the
<hi>Parthians</hi> and the <hi>Arabians</hi> to ſuch a
degree, that if he pleas'd he might have
made their Countrey a Province;
wherefore he was call'd <hi>Parthicus</hi> and
<hi>Arabicus:</hi> he built many Cities all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Roman Empire. In his Reign
<hi>Clodius Albinus,</hi> that conſpir'd with
<hi>Julian</hi> to kill <hi>Pertinax,</hi> made himſelf
<hi>Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> but was overcome and
ſlain at <hi>Lugdunum. Severus,</hi> beſides the
honor he obtained in Military Actions,
was much renowned for Politicks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a very good Scholar, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Philoſopher: his laſt War was in
<hi>Britanny,</hi> where he fortified the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
he had recover'd, with a great
wall two &amp; thirty miles long, from the
<hi>German</hi> Ocean to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea: he died
at <hi>Eboracum</hi> when he was a very old
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98079:82"/>
man, in the eighteenth year, and fourth
month of his Reign, and was conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a God: he left his two Sons <hi>Baſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi>
and <hi>Geta</hi> to ſucceed him, and by
order of Senate would have <hi>Baſſianus,</hi>
call'd <hi>Antoninus;</hi> wherefore he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
the name of <hi>M. Aurelius Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Baſſianus,</hi> and ſucceeded his Father;
for his Brother <hi>Geta</hi> being look'd upon
as a publick enemy, was forthwith ſlain.
<hi>M. Aurelius Antoninus Baſſianus,</hi> call'd
alſo <hi>Caracalla,</hi> was much of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
diſpoſition, yet ſomewhat more
rough and ill natur'd: he made a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Bath at <hi>Rome,</hi> call'd <hi>Antonini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anae;</hi>
the only remarkable thing of his
life: he was one ſo ungovernable in
his Luſt, that he married his Mother-in-law
<hi>Julia:</hi> he ended his days at <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roenes,</hi>
a City not far from <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> in
his deſign againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> in
the ſixth year of his Reign, and ſecond
month, ſcarce three and forty years
old, and was buried at the publick coſt
of the people.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Opilius Macrinus</hi> the Captain
of the Guards was made Emperor
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98079:82"/>
with his Son <hi>Diadumenus,</hi> they did
nothing worth memory, for they
reign'd but fourteen months, and
were both ſlain by a tumult of the
Soldiers. After theſe two <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius
Antoninus</hi> was made Emperor;
he was thought to be the Son of <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus
Caracalla,</hi> but indeed he was a
Prieſt of the Temple of <hi>Heliogabalus:</hi>
he, when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> with the
great expectation both of Soldiers and
Senators, disgrac'd himſelf with all
ſorts of Scandal, and liv'd moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and lewdly; ſo after two years
and eight months his Soldiers ſlew
him and his Mother <hi>Semia,</hi> the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to him reign'd <hi>Aurelius Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>

Maximinus</hi> was the

that obtained the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Empire, choſe only by
the Soldiers, without the Authority
of the Senate, himſelf being no Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98079:84"/>
having manag'd the War ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
againſt the <hi>Germans:</hi> when he
war ſaluted Imperator by his Soldiers:
upon their revolt, <hi>Pupienus</hi> kill'd him
and his young Son at <hi>Aquileia,</hi> with
whom he had reigned three years and a
few days.</p>
            <p>Afterwards there were three Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
at once, <hi>Pupienus, Balbinus,</hi> and
<hi>Gordianus:</hi> the two firſt were of a very
mean Family; <hi>Gordianus</hi> was a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
for his Father being Pro-conſul
of <hi>Africa,</hi> was choſen Emperor by the
conſent of the Soldiers, when <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi>
reigned; but when they came
to <hi>Rome, Balbinus</hi> and <hi>Pupienus</hi> were
kill'd in the Palace, and <hi>Gordianus</hi> was
Emperor alone; who being but a
young man, having married <hi>Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſet open the Temple of
double-fac'd <hi>Janus:</hi> and marching to
the Eaſt, made War with the <hi>Parthians,</hi>
who now endeavoured to invade the
Empire; which War he managed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, and beat the <hi>Perſians</hi> in great
Battels. Returning home, he was kill'd
by the treachery of <hi>Philip,</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98079:84"/>
him. His Soldiers built for him
a Monument near the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
twenty miles from <hi>Circeſſus</hi> a Caſtle of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> and carrying his Body to
<hi>Rome,</hi> ſtiled him a God.</p>
            <p>The two <hi>Philips,</hi> the Father, and
the Son, when <hi>Gordianus</hi> was dead,
got the Empire; and having brought
back the Army ſafe, they march'd
from <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Italy.</hi> When they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd,
in the thouſandth year of the
City, there was a great Feſtival cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
with all manner of ſports. They
afterwards were both kill'd by their
Soldiers, the eldeſt at <hi>Verona,</hi> the
younger at <hi>Rome;</hi> having reign'd five
years. Nevertheleſs they were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
amongſt the Gods.</p>
            <p>After theſe, <hi>Decius</hi> who came from
the lower <hi>Pannonia,</hi> born at <hi>Bubalia,</hi>
took upon him the Empire: he ended
the Civil War that was in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and
made his Son his <hi>Caeſar:</hi> he built a
Bath at <hi>Rome.</hi> When he and his Son
had rul'd two years, they were ſlain
fighting far from <hi>Rome</hi> with the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,

            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:98079:85"/>
Then <hi>Gallus Hoſtilianus,</hi> and <hi>Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus</hi>
his Son were made Emperors;
under their Government <hi>Aemilianus</hi>
endeavoured an Inſurrection in <hi>Maeſia:</hi>
to ſuppreſs whom, in their march, they
were killed at <hi>Interamna</hi> before two
years end: they did no great action all
their Reign, it being only remarkable
for the Plague, and other diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aemilianus</hi> born of very obſcure Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
govern'd more obſcurely, and
died in the third month of his Reign.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Licinius Valerianus</hi> being Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
in <hi>Rhaetia</hi> and <hi>Noricum,</hi> was ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>luted
firſt Imperator by his Army, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<hi>Auguſtus. Gallienus</hi> likewiſe
was made Emperor by the Senate:
Their Government was pernicious, and
almoſt deſtructive to the Roman name,
either by the ill fortune, or idleneſs of
theſe Princes. The <hi>Germans</hi> came up to
<hi>Ravenna. Valerianus</hi> waging War in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia,</hi>
was overcome by <hi>Sapores</hi>
King of the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and being made

               <hi>Gallienus</hi> when he was a young man,
was made Emperor; at firſt he man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
the Empire happily, then indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently,
at laſt very ill; for in his
youth he acted valiantly in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and
<hi>Illyricum,</hi> having kill'd <hi>Ingenuus</hi> at
<hi>Murſia</hi> who uſurp'd the Empire, and
<hi>Trebellianus:</hi> a long while he was quiet
and peaceable; afterward falling into
all vice: he neglected the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
through idleneſs and deſpair;
the <hi>Almans</hi> having waſted all <hi>Gaul,</hi>
broke into <hi>Italy:</hi> he loſt <hi>Dacia,</hi> which
lying beyond the <hi>Danube,</hi> was brought
under ſubjection by <hi>Trajan: Greece,
Macedonia, Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
by the <hi>Goths: Pannonia</hi> was ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> and the <hi>Quadi:</hi>
the <hi>Germans</hi> came even to <hi>Spain,</hi> and
beſieged the noble City <hi>Tarraco:</hi> the
<hi>Parthians</hi> having overcome <hi>Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
began to claim a title to <hi>Syria.</hi>
Now things being in deſpair, and the
Roman Empire almoſt overthrown,
<hi>Poſthumus</hi> born of a very mean Race,
made himſelf Emperor in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and
manag'd his affairs ſo for ten years
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98079:86"/>
ſpace, that he almoſt won all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
that were loſt) with great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and moderation: he was kill'd in
a tumult of his Soldiers, becauſe he
would not deliver up the City <hi>Mogun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiacum,</hi>
which had rebelled againſt
him in an Inſurrection of <hi>Lollianus,</hi> to
be plundered by his Soldiers. After
him <hi>Marius</hi> a moſt uſeful man made
himſelf Emperor, and was kill'd the
ſecond day of his Reign. <hi>Victorinus</hi>
a very valiant man took upon him the
Government of <hi>Gaul,</hi> but being very
laſcivious, and a defiler of other mens
Beds, he was killed at <hi>Agrippina,</hi> by
the Plot of one <hi>Acturius</hi> in the ſecond
year of his Reign. <hi>Tetricus</hi> a Senator
ſucceeded him, who was Governor of
<hi>Aquitania,</hi> and was choſen Emperor by
his Soldiers in his abſence; he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him the Government at <hi>Burdegala,</hi>
and patiently bore many Mutinies in
the Army. But whilſt theſe things were
done in <hi>Gaul,</hi> in the Eaſt the <hi>Perſians</hi>
were overcome by <hi>Odenatus,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſending
<hi>Syria,</hi> and regaining <hi>Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98079:86"/>
               <hi>Gallienus</hi> not minding the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
the Roman Empire was kept
up in the Weſt by <hi>Poſthumus,</hi> in the
Eaſt by <hi>Odenatus;</hi> in the mean time
<hi>Gallienus,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Valerianus</hi>
were kill'd at <hi>Mediolanum</hi> in the ninth
year of their Reign: and <hi>Claudius</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
him, choſen by his Soldiers,
and declar'd Emperor by the Senate.
In a great Battel he overcame the
<hi>Goths</hi> ſpoiling and depopulating <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
and <hi>Macedonia:</hi> he was a frugal
modeſt man, a lover of Juſtice, and fit
to govern the Commonwealth; who
nevertheleſs died of a natural death,
before he had reigned two years, and
was ſtiled a God. The Senate honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him mightily, that he ſhould have
a Golden Shield ſet up for him in the
Senate-houſe, with a Golden Statue in
the <hi>Capitol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After him <hi>Quintilius</hi> the Brother of
<hi>Claudius</hi> was choſen Emperor by the
conſent of his Soldiers; a man from
his extraordinary moderation, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
either to be equall'd or prefer'd
before his Brother: the Senate agreed
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98079:87"/>
that he ſhould be call'd <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> He
was kill'd when he had been Emperor
ſixteen days.</p>
            <p>After him <hi>Aurelian</hi> took upon him
the Empire, born in <hi>Dacia Ripenſis;</hi> he
was a man powerful in War, but of an
unruly nature, and prone to cruelty:
he very valiantly beat the <hi>Goths,</hi> and
reſtored the Roman Empire by various
ſucceſſes of War to its ancient bounds:
he overcame <hi>Tetricus</hi> in <hi>Gaul</hi> amongſt
the <hi>Catalauni: Tetricus</hi> delivering up
his Army whoſe continual Seditions
he could not bear; for by ſecret Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
he ſo preſs'd <hi>Aurelian,</hi> that among
other arguments he us'd this Verſe of
<hi>Virgil, Eripe me his invicte malis,</hi> that
is, <hi>Deliver me thou great Conqueror,
from theſe misfortunes.</hi> He alſo in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great Battel took <hi>Zenobia,</hi> not far
from <hi>Antioch,</hi> when her Husband
<hi>Odenatus</hi> who commanded thoſe parts
of the Eaſt was kill'd, and entering
<hi>Rome,</hi> he triumphed very nobly, as if
he had been Conqueror of the Eaſt,
and Weſt; <hi>Tetricus</hi> and <hi>Zenobia</hi> going
before his Chariot. <hi>Tetricus</hi> afterward
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98079:87"/>
was Governor of <hi>Lucania,</hi> but <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi>
left her poſterity at <hi>Rome,</hi> which
remain there to theſe days. In his
Reign thoſe that belonged to the
Mint having coined falſe mony, and
kill'd <hi>Feliciſſimus,</hi> the Maſter of the
Mint, made a Rebellion in <hi>Rome,</hi>
whom he ſubdued and quelled with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
cruelty: he put to death many
Noblemen, being ſevere and bloody,
and in ſome things rather neceſſary
than to be beloved: he was harſh all
his life time, and killed his Siſters Son;
yet a great keeper up of Military Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline,
and a ſtrict corrector of his
Soldiers diſſolute manners: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
and fortifi'd the Walls about
<hi>Rome,</hi> and erected a Temple to the
Sun, inriching it with much Gold and
Jewels: he deſerted the Province of
<hi>Dacia,</hi> which <hi>Trajan</hi> had extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the <hi>Danube:</hi> he waſted all <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricum</hi>
and <hi>[Maeſia;</hi> deſpairing that it
could be kept, having drawn the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
out of the Cities of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Dacia:]</hi> he placed them in the
middle of <hi>Maeſia,</hi> lying on the right
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98079:88"/>
ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> as it flows into the
<hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, when before it was on
the left ſide. He was kill'd by the
treachery of a Servant, who brought
ſome names remark'd upon to ſome
Soldiers, his Friends, forging the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
Hand as if he had intended to
kill them; ſo that he might be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he was killed upon a Journey in
the middle of the old way, between
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Heraclea:</hi> the place
is called <hi>Caenophrurium;</hi> but his death
was reveng'd, and he was made a
God, having reign'd five years and ſix
months.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Tacitus</hi> took upon him the
Empire; a man well bred and fit to
govern the Commonwealth; but he
could not do any famous action, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before he had been Emperor ſix
months. <hi>Florianus,</hi> who ſucceeded
<hi>Tacitus</hi> reign'd but two months, and
twenty days; neither did he any act
worth memory.</p>
            <p>After him <hi>Probus,</hi> a man famous in
Military affairs, got the Rule of the
Commonwealth; he reſtor'd <hi>Gaul</hi> with
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98079:88"/>
great ſucceſs, which the <hi>Barbarians</hi>
poſſeſſed: he happily ſuppreſſed ſome
endeavouring to uſurp the Empire, <hi>viz.
Saturninus</hi> in the Eaſt, <hi>Proculus,</hi> and
<hi>Bonoſus</hi> at <hi>Agrippina:</hi> he ſuffer'd the
<hi>Gauls,</hi> and <hi>Pannonians</hi> to have Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards;
and his Soldiers having planted
Vines on the Mountain <hi>Almus</hi> near
<hi>Sirmium,</hi> and on the Mountain <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus</hi>
in the upper <hi>Maeſia,</hi> he charg'd
the Inhabitants to look after them;
he, when he had waged a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Wars having obtain'd peace, ſaid,
that within a little time there would
be no need of Soldiers: he was a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
and juſt man, equalling <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
in Military glory, but excelling
him in civility: and was kill'd in the
Iron Tower at <hi>Sirmium,</hi> in a Mutiny
of his Soldiers, having reign'd ſix
months and four days.</p>
            <p>After him <hi>Carus</hi> being Emperor,
born at <hi>Narbona</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> made <hi>Carinus</hi>
and <hi>Numerianus</hi> his Sons, his <hi>Caeſars;</hi>
with whom he rul'd two years; but
whilſt he waged War with the <hi>Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:98079:89"/>
having heard of the Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in <hi>Perſia,</hi> marching to the
Eaſt he performed noble actions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, and overthrew them in
a Battel: he took <hi>Seleucia</hi> and <hi>Cteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
very eminent Cities, and when
he had pitch'd his Camp by the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris,</hi>
was kill'd by a Thunder-bolt.
<hi>Numerianus</hi> his Son, whom he had
brought along with him into <hi>Perſia,</hi> a
young man of very great hopes, being
carried by reaſon of a pain in his eyes
in his Litter, was treacherouſly kill'd
through the incitement of <hi>Aper</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law,
and when he had cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hid him [till he could get the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
for himſelf] his murder was found
out by the ſtench of his body; the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of his Guard being diſturb'd with
the ſmell, having taken off the cloaths
of the Bed, after a few days diſcover'd
his death. In the mean time <hi>Carinus,</hi>
whom <hi>Carus,</hi> when he made his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> had
left in <hi>Illyricum, Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> defil'd
himſelf in all manner of Vice: he put
many to death with the accuſation of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98079:89"/>
forg'd crimes: he abus'd many Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,
and was alſo miſchievous to
his fellow Students, who had been
ſomewhat ſmart upon him in their
Schools; for which being hated by all
men, he a little after was puniſh'd.
The Army returning home after the
conqueſt of <hi>Perſia,</hi> when <hi>Carus</hi> and
<hi>Numerianus</hi> their Emperors were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
one by a Thunder-bolt, the other
by treachery, made <hi>Diocleſian</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
born in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> of obſcure Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
being generally reported to be
the Son of a Scrivener, but by ſome
the Son of a Freeman to <hi>Anulinus</hi> a
Senator: he in the firſt Aſſembly of
the Soldiers ſwore that he had no hand
in killing <hi>Numerianus,</hi> and when <hi>Aper</hi>
who murder'd <hi>Numerianus,</hi> ſtood next
to him, he run him through with his
own hand in the ſight of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
afterward he overcame <hi>Carinus</hi>
in a great Battel at <hi>Murgum,</hi> who liv'd
hated and deteſted of all men: he
was deliver'd up by his own Army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtronger than the Enemy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
between the Mountain <hi>Vimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:98079:90"/>
and <hi>Aureus.</hi> Thus <hi>Diocleſian</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the Roman Empire, and the
Country people in <hi>Gaul</hi> making an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
and calling their Rebellion
by the name of the <hi>Bagaude,</hi> under
their Captains <hi>Amandus,</hi> and <hi>Aelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi>
he ſent <hi>Maximianus Herculius</hi> his
<hi>Caeſar</hi> to ſuppreſs them, who in ſmall
Skirmiſhes overcame them, and ſettled
that part of <hi>Gaul.</hi> Then alſo <hi>Carauſius,</hi>
who born of a very mean Family, had
got great honor by his good ſervice in
the War; when at <hi>Dononia</hi> all along
the Coaſt of <hi>Belgick Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
he had undertook to ſecure the
Seas which the <hi>Franks,</hi> and the <hi>Saxons</hi>
infeſted; having often taken many
<hi>Barbarians,</hi> and not reſtoring the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
ſpoil, neither to the Inhabitants of
the Province, nor preſenting it to the
Emperors; when there began to be a
ſuſpicion, that he had let in the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi>
on purpoſe, that he might meet
them in their paſſage, and ſo enrich
himſelf with the ſpoils: being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Maximianus</hi> to be kill'd,
made himſelf Emperor, and ſeiz'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98079:90"/>
on <hi>Britanny.</hi> So when all over the
world things were in confuſion, <hi>Carau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
rebell'd in <hi>Britanny, Achilleus</hi> in
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> the <hi>Quinquegentiani</hi> mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
<hi>Africa, Narſeus</hi> made War in the
Eaſt, <hi>Diocletian</hi> advanc'd <hi>Maximianus
Herculius</hi> from <hi>Caeſar</hi> to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and
made <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and <hi>Maximianus
Caeſars;</hi> of whom <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was
<hi>Claudius</hi>'s Grand-Son by his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Maximianus Galerius</hi> was born
in <hi>Dacia,</hi> not far from <hi>Sardica,</hi> and
that he might alſo ally them by affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>Conſtantius</hi> married <hi>Theodora,</hi>
the Daughter-in-law of <hi>Herculius,</hi> of
whom he had ſix Children, the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of <hi>Conſtantine. Galerius</hi> married
<hi>Valeria</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi>
both of them being forc'd to divorce
their former Wives. At laſt he made
peace with <hi>Carauſius,</hi> when he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
a War in vain againſt him,
being very skilful in Military Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
<hi>Allectus</hi> his Colleague kill'd
him ſeven years after, and kept <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny</hi>
three years after his death, who
alſo was kill'd by <hi>Aſclepiodotus</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98079:91"/>
of the Guards, ſo <hi>Britanny</hi> in
the tenth year was reduced to the
the Roman Power. About the ſame
time a Battel was fought by <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
in <hi>Gaul</hi> near the <hi>Lingones;</hi> in one
day he had experience of good and
bad fortune; for on a ſuddain the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi>
ruſhing upon him, he was
forc'd to retreat into the City, they
were in ſuch diſorder, that having ſhut
up the Gates, they drew him up the
Walls by Ropes. Within leſs than five
hours after, a freſh Army coming up,
he deſtroy'd almoſt ſixty thouſand
<hi>Almans;</hi> alſo <hi>Maximianus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
finiſh'd the War in <hi>Africa,</hi> having
overcome the <hi>Quinquegentiani,</hi> and
forc'd them to make a Peace. <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>
within the ſpace of eight months
overcame <hi>Achilleus</hi> beſieg'd in <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
and kill'd him; he exercis'd
his Victory with cruelty, and defil'd
all <hi>Aegypt</hi> with ſevere proſcriptions,
and ſlaughters; but on that occaſion
he manag'd and did many things wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which remain to this time. <hi>Galeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Maximianus</hi> fought between <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:98079:91"/>
and <hi>Carrae</hi> at firſt unhappily, but
at laſt ſucceſsfully; yet rather through
indiſcretion than cowardiſe, joyning
Battel with a very few men againſt a
very powerful Enemy; wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beat, he went to <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> who
meeting him in the way, was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to have received him with ſuch
great pride, that <hi>Galerius</hi> ran by his
Litter ſome miles together; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
having raiſed Forces in <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
and <hi>Maeſia,</hi> he fought again ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſucceſsfully with equal conduct, and
valour, in <hi>Armenia</hi> the Great, againſt
<hi>Narſeus</hi> the Grand-father of <hi>Ormiſda,</hi>
and <hi>Sapores;</hi> having been himſelf a
Scout, with one or two Horſemen.
<hi>Narſeus</hi> being overthrown, he plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
his Camp, took his Wives, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and Children, a great many <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>
Noblemen, with a very rich Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and forc'd him to fly to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt
receſſes of the Kingdom.
Wherefore upon his return this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
was received with great honor
by <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> ſtaying in <hi>Meſopotamia</hi>
with a reſerve. Then they wag'd War
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98079:92"/>
ſometimes together, ſometimes ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
having overcome the <hi>Carpi,</hi> the
<hi>Baſternae,</hi> and the <hi>Sarmatians.</hi> They
plac'd a great many Captives of theſe
Nations upon the Roman Frontiers.
<hi>Diocleſian</hi> was cunning, witty, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til,
ſo managing himſelf in his ſeverity,
that other men might bear the hatred.
Nevertheleſs he was a very careful and
prudent Prince, and was the firſt that
rather obſerv'd the form of Regal Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
than of Roman Liberty: and
when before his time Emperors were
only ſaluted, he commanded the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to worſhip him as a God: he wore
Jewels upon his Cloaths and Shooes;
whereas before the Badg of Royalty
conſiſted in a Purple Coat, the other
dreſs was in common: but <hi>Herculius</hi>
in outward appearance fierce, and of a
rude diſpoſition, diſcover'd his rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the horror of his countenance;
but ſmoothing his own nature, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd
<hi>Diocleſian</hi> in his more ſevere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.
<hi>Diocleſian,</hi> when he grew old,
finding himſelf unfit to govern the
Empire, mov'd <hi>Herculius</hi> to live a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98079:92"/>
private life, and give up the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
to brisker and younger men;
to which his Collegue unwillingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented;
yet both of them upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
day chang'd the Royal Robe for a
Private Habit; <hi>Diocleſian</hi> at <hi>Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,
Herculius</hi> at <hi>Mediolanum,</hi> after
they had gloriouſly triumph'd at <hi>Rome</hi>
over a great many Nations, with a
magnificent ſhew of Pageants, in which
the Wives, Siſters, and Children of
<hi>Narſeus</hi> went before their Chariot;
one of them retir'd to <hi>Salonae,</hi> the other
to <hi>Lucania. Diocleſian</hi> as a private man
ſpun out an honorable old age at a
place near <hi>Salonae,</hi> exerciſing himſelf
in Virtue unuſual to him before. He
was the only man after the foundation
of the Roman Empire, that of his own
accord deſcended from ſo high a pitch
to a private condition; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
this hapned to him which never did
to any other, that tho dying a private
man, he ſhould be conſecrated a God..</p>

<hi>Pannonia,</hi> and then as he was gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together great Forces at the City
<hi>Cibalae,</hi> and having gained all <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
Moeſia</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
himſelf of a great many Provinces.
Afterwards there aroſe ſeveral Wars
between them, and the Peace which
was made, broken in the end, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius</hi>
conquer'd in a Sea-fight, and
at Land at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> yielded up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and was killed a private Man at
the City <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> contrary to the
ſincerity of a ſolemn Oath. Then
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was under one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
and three <hi>Caeſars</hi> (never ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Sons governing <hi>Gaul,</hi>
the Eaſtern parts and <hi>Italy:</hi> but this
wonderful ſucceſs ſomewhat alter'd
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> from his tractable and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98079:96"/>
temper. So that firſt perſecuting
his neareſt Friends, he killed his Siſters
Son an excellent young Man, and of a
very good diſpoſition; and after the
ſlaughter of very many of his Friends
he put his Wife to death: He was a
Man in the beginning of his Reign to
be compared with the beſt of Princes,
but at laſt to be ranked with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
adorned with a great many
Virtues both of Mind and Body, very
ambitious of Military honour, Fortune
was ſucceſsful to him in War, but his
induſtry was as great as his Fortune.
For after the Civil War he often beat
the <hi>Goths:</hi> and at laſt having granted
them peace, he left even amongſt thoſe
<hi>Barbarians</hi> a great remembrance of his
favour. He was addicted to civil Arts
and generous Exerciſes, an affector of
true Friendſhip, which he altogether
ſought to procure by his liberality
and eaſineſs; as he was ſevere to
ſome of his Friends, ſo he was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
kind to the reſt, letting no
opportunity ſlip to make them rich
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98079:97"/>
and eminent. He made a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Laws, ſome good and juſt, very
many ſuperfluous, and ſome ſevere.
He firſt attempted to advance the
City <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> called after his own
name to ſo great a pitch as to make
it equal with <hi>Rome:</hi> in his Deſign to
make War againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who
had haraſſed <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> he died in
a publick Vill of the City <hi>Nicomedia,</hi>
in the one and thirtieth year of his
Reign, and the ſixty ſixth of his age.
His Death was foretold by a blazing
Star, (called by the <hi>Greeks</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
which of an unuſual bigneſs appeared
for ſome time; and he was deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made a God.</p>
            <p>He left three of his own Sons and
one of his Brothers to ſucceed him:
but <hi>Dalmatius Caeſar</hi> a moſt hopeful
Man not unlike his Uncle was ſlain
a while after by a Military Faction
with the conſent rather than by the
command of his Couſin <hi>Conſtantius.</hi>
Moreover <hi>Conſtans</hi> his Captains ſlew
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> making War againſt his
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98079:97"/>
Brother and unadviſedly fighting at
the City <hi>Aquileia.</hi> Thus the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
was reduced to two Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours.
<hi>Conſtans</hi> his Reign for ſome
time was great and juſt, afterwards
through ſickneſs and the perſuaſions
of ſome of his worſt Friends, being
grown vicious and intolerable to the
Subjects of the Provinces, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to his Soldiers, he was ſlain
by the Faction of <hi>Maxentius,</hi> not
far from <hi>Spain</hi> in a Caſtle called
<hi>Helena</hi> in the eighteenth year of his
Reign, and the thirteenth of his age.
He performed a great many valiant
actions in War, and was terrible to
his Army all his life-time without
much cruelty. <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
was various, for he ſuffer'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many injuries from the <hi>Perſians,</hi>
who had oftentimes ſacked his Towns,
beſieged his Cities, and beaten his
Armies: never had he any ſucceſs in
Battel againſt King <hi>Sapores</hi> unleſs at
<hi>Singara,</hi> where the eagerneſs of his
Soldiers, loſt in probability a certain
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98079:98"/>
Victory, who tumultuouſly and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly
againſt the reaſon of War de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to fight, the day being far
ſpent. After the death of <hi>Conſtans
Magnentius</hi> having got <hi>Italy, Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
and <hi>Gaul,</hi> there aroſe an inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in <hi>Illyricum. Veteranio</hi> being
made Emperour by the conſent of
the Soldiers, and now a very old
Man and beloved by all by reaſon
of his long continuance and ſucceſs in
War, was choſen Prince and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Illyricum.</hi> He was a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Man obſerving the ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
manners and of obliging civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but ignorant of all liberal Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
ſo that he did not learn even
the rudiments of Learning, till he
was old and made Emperour; but
<hi>Conſtantius,</hi> who to revenge his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Death had raiſed a Civil War,
put an end to the Reign of <hi>Vetera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi>
who after a new and unuſual
manner by the agreement of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
was forced to lay down the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Power. There aroſe alſo a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98079:98"/>
at <hi>Rome</hi> by the means of <hi>Nepotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Conſtantine</hi>'s Siſters Son, who ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
upon the Empire with a party
of <hi>Gladiators,</hi> met with a Death wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of his cruel beginnings, being ſlain
on the eight and twentieth day by
<hi>Magnentius</hi> his Captains, and his head
carried all about the City upon a Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velin.
There were great Proſcriptions
and much ſlaughter of the Nobility at
that time.</p>
            <p>Not long after <hi>Magnentius</hi> was put
to flight, and very near taken in the
Battel at <hi>Murſa:</hi> the great ſtrength of
the <hi>Romans</hi> in that fight was much
weaken'd, even Soldiers that were fit
to manage any forein Wars, and might
have procured ſecurity and many Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
to the Commonwealth. Soon
after <hi>Conſtantius</hi> ſent <hi>Gallus</hi> his Uncles
Son as <hi>Caeſar</hi> to the Eaſt: and <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentius</hi>
beaten in ſeveral Battels in the
third year and the ſeventh month of
his Reign, killed himſelf at <hi>Lugdunum:</hi>
as his Brother <hi>Decentius,</hi> whom he
had ſent with an Imperial Authority
to govern <hi>Gaul,</hi> did alſo among the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:98079:99"/>
At this time <hi>Conſtantius</hi> alſo having
committed a great many out-rages,
killed <hi>Gallus Caeſar,</hi> a man fierce by
nature, and prone to tyranny if he had
been abſolute. <hi>Sylvanus</hi> alſo attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Inſurrection in <hi>Gaul,</hi> died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the thirtieth day: (then <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
was the only Prince and <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
of the Roman Empire.) Soon after he
ſent <hi>Julian Caeſar</hi> to <hi>Gaul,</hi> who was
his Couſin, and the Brother of <hi>Gallus,</hi>
having given him his Siſter in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
At that time the <hi>Barbarians</hi>
ſacked a great many Towns, beſieged
others, and had horribly waſted all
places. The Roman Empire by theſe
misfortunes was in a tottering conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by whom with indifferent Forces
the great Army of the <hi>Alamanni</hi> was
ſuppreſſed at <hi>Argentoratum,</hi> a City of
<hi>Gaul,</hi> their moſt conſiderable King was
taken, and <hi>Gaul</hi> was regained to the
Empire. This <hi>Julian</hi> afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
a great many valiant actions
againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and drove the
<hi>Germans</hi> beyond the River <hi>Rhine,</hi> and
reſtored the Roman Empire to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98079:99"/>
Confines. Not long after when
the <hi>German</hi> Army was removed from
their Garriſon in <hi>Gaul, Julian</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
Emperor by the Soldiers, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a years ſpace he marched to gain
<hi>Illyricum,</hi> whilſt <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was buſie
in managing the <hi>Parthian</hi> Wars, who
died in his march between <hi>Cilicia</hi> and
<hi>Cappadocia,</hi> in the eight and thirtieth
year of his Reign, and the five and
fortieth of his age, and deſerved to be
numbred amongſt the Gods: he was
a man of an exceeding calm temper,
eaſie, and giving too much credit to
his friends and familiars: he was alſo
too uxorious, but in the firſt years of
his Reign he behaved himſelf with
great modeſty: he alſo enriched his
friends, nor did let any of them want
honor, whoſe induſtrious ſervices he
had made uſe of: yet inclinable to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverity,
if he grew jealous of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
upon his Empire, but otherwiſe
mild, whoſe ſucceſs was greater in the
Civil, than in Forein Wars.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Julian</hi> gained the Empire,
and with great preparation made War
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98079:100"/>
with the <hi>Parthiuns,</hi> in which Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I my ſelf was preſent: he made
ſome Towns and Caſtles of the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
to ſurrender, or elſe took them by
force; and having depopulated <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
he encamp'd for ſome time at the
Town <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> and returning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
was ſlain by the Enemy, whilſt
he too raſhly preſſed on in the Battel,
on the ſixth of the Kalends of <hi>July,</hi> in
the ſeventh year of his Reign, and the
one and thirtieth of his age, and was
tranſlated amongſt the Gods; an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
man, deſigning admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
to govern the Commonwealth,
if he had lived: he was very skilful
in Liberal Sciences, and much more
learned in Greek than in Latin: he
was very eloquent, and had a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
moſt ready and tenacious, and
in ſome things more reſembling a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher:
he was liberal towards his
friends, but not ſo careful as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſo great a Prince; for there were
ſome who would wound his honor:
he was very juſt to the Natives of the
Provinces, and eaſed them from Taxes
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98079:100"/>
as much as could be: he was courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to all men, but took little care of
his Exchequer, very ambitious of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which oftentimes tranſported his
mind: he was too great a Perſecutor
of the Chriſtians; yet ſo as he abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from putting any to death: he was
not unlike <hi>M. Antoninus,</hi> whom he
endeavoured to imitate. After <hi>Julian,
Jovian,</hi> who at that time was one of
the Guard, was elected Emperor by
the Soldiers, more eminent by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
commendation than by his own;
who through the diſorder of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and the want of proviſion in the
Army, when he was overcome in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Battels by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> made a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
tho an ignoble peace with
King <hi>Sapores,</hi> being forced to diminiſh
the Confines, and to part with ſome of
the Roman Empire, which in eleven
hundred and eighteen years from the
building of <hi>Rome,</hi> never hapned till
his time. I confeſs our Legions were
made ſlaves at the Town <hi>Caudium</hi> by
<hi>Pontius Teleſinus,</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> alſo at <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantia</hi>
and in <hi>Numidia;</hi> yet no part
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98079:101"/>
of the Empire was ſurrendred. This
condition of Peace ought not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have been blamed, if <hi>Jovian</hi>
would have broke the neceſſity of his
League, when it was freſh and in force,
as the <hi>Romans</hi> have done in all theſe
Wars, that I have given an account of;
for War was forthwith brought upon
the <hi>Samnites,</hi> the <hi>Numantians,</hi> and the
<hi>Numidians;</hi> neither was there any
Peace ratified. But he ſtaying in the
Eaſt, and fearing one that would rival
him in his Empire, little conſulted his
own honor: wherefore in his march to
<hi>Illyricum</hi> he ſuddenly died in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of <hi>Galatia:</hi> he was a man nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unactive nor imprudent. Many
ſnppoſe he died of a Surfeit, for he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to indulge Feaſting at Supper,
others of the ſmall of his Bed-chamber,
which coming from the freſh plaiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Wall, was dangerous to
ſuch that lie there: ſome think he died
by the fume of too many coals, which
he commanded to be burnt, it being
very cold. He died in the ſeventh
month of his Reign, on the fourteenth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98079:101"/>
of the Kalends of <hi>March;</hi> and as they
who ſpeak moſt probably in the three
and thirtieth year of his age, and by
the kindneſs of his Succeſſors was dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
for he was inclined to civility,
and very liberal in his nature. This
was the ſtate of the Roman Empire,
when this <hi>Jovian</hi> and <hi>Varronianus</hi> were
<hi>Conſuls</hi> in the eleven hundred and
19th. year, after the building of <hi>Rome.</hi>
But ſince I am come to famous and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Princes, I will put an end to
my work; for I muſt ſpeak of what
remains in a more lofty ſtile, which I
do not at this time ſo much omit, as
reſerve to be written more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately.</p>
