            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IT may pleaſe this Honorable Court, I will begin this action with an other maner of proteſtation, then our aduerſe parties haue vſed: for whereas they gaue out yeſterday to the world, that the doores ſhould be ſhut whileſt this matter was in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by reaſon of the threates which they had caſt out of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king againſt many, which had now ſubmitted themſelues to the Kings obedience, and were content and forward to hazard their liues daily in the warres for his ſeruice: I proteſt on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, to offend no man neither in worde nor thought, but ſuch as ſtand and remaine metamorphoſed <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of the diuerſitie of theſe two proteſtations is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant inough. The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> can not do a greater péece of ſeruice to the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> their Maſter, then in this place to ſlaunder
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:26399:3"/>
ſuch men, as haue, in ſorte as the world ſeeth, ſharpened his edge, by putting ſo ſtrong and important townes into the handes of his greateſt and moſt daungerous enemy.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> (the Kinges el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt daughter, for whome I ſpeake,) can not doe his Maieſtie a greater ſeruice, then to kéepe inuiolably the <hi>Law of Forgetting</hi>; which is the originall and fountaine of the peace which we now enioy, and that we are and hope to enioy from hence forward.</p>
               <p>I remember that I haue read, that at what time the battaile of <hi>Pharſale</hi> was agréed on by the Generals &amp; Leaders on both ſides, and the Trompetters were commaunded to ſound their Trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, certaine of the beſt of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> and ſome <hi>Grecians</hi> (that were then preſent in the field, but not within the battaile) ſéeing the ſtate of both thoſe huge and mighty armies ſo néere to danger, began to conſider with themſelues to what point the forces of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire were brought. For their armour was all one, the ſetting and ordering of their battailes was all alike, their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes were without difference, reſembling the one the other in all points, the verie flower of all the valiant men of one ſelfe ſame Citie, and a mightie ſtrength now vpon the inſtant to ruinate it ſelfe: giuing a notable example how blinde, raging and furious the nature of man is, when it giueth it ſelfe ouer to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with any violent paſſion. For if they would haue ruled and gouerned that which they had wholly conquered, the greateſt and beſt part of the world both by land and ſea, had bin in their ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and vnder their obedience.</p>
               <p>In like ſort, whoſoeuer that knoweth our ſtate well, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider to what point of greatnes, of happines, of honors, of riches, and mightines, the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> had now attained vnto, had it not bin for our warres more then ciuill, and that the flower of ſo many valiant men (which might now haue bin aliue, had not our ciuill diffentions bin) had but more then ſufficient to haue gone and aſſailed our old enemie euen within <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">

               <p>That theſe inſtruments and firebrandes of the world are the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi> there is no man that doubteth, but onely two ſortes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: the one, which are of nature ſo feareful, that they thinke they are ſtil within the clutches of the <hi>Sixteene Murderers,</hi> and the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> their counſaile: and the other which are of their brotherhood and congregation, and haue ſecretly executed the moſt dangerous point of their vowes, as a whole towne may be <hi>Ieſuiticall.</hi>

               <p>The compaſſing of the greateſt part of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was but a trifle to them, by meanes of their great penſions, and of the rich benefices of <hi>Millan, Naples, Sicile,</hi> beſide the liuings of <hi>Spain,</hi> which were wonderfull riche.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the charge that is in this great Citie is heauie, and burdenſome, they wanted light and ſtirring fellowes to be placed in all quarters, to execute whatſoeuer might tend to the good and aduancement of the affairs of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> which are ſcattered abroad in huge and mightie ſwarmes: for there are betwéene nine and ten thouſand of them, and haue already foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded two hundred and four ſcore <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colonies, they poſſeſſe in reuenues aboue two thouſand millions of gold, they are Lords of Erledomes and great Baronies in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in <hi>Italy,</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained already to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dignitie of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> readie to be made <hi>Popes</hi>: and in caſe they ſhould haue continuance but thirtie yeares more in all the places where they haue neſtled themſelues already, it would be without doubt the richeſt and mightieſt companie in Chriſtendome, and would wage Armies, as already they begin to contribute.</p>
               <p>Their principal bow is to obey their Generall and Superiour (who is alwaies a Spaniard, and choſen by the King of <hi>Spaine) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie way and in all things.</hi> This appeareth true moſt manifeſtly by experience. <hi>Layola</hi> their firſt General was a Spaniard. <hi>Laynes</hi> the ſecond a Spaniard alſo.

Marke, theſe are the words written in the page <hi>146.</hi> of that Booke. <hi>For this Society, not yet borne in their Author Ignatius, was firſt allowed of in Spaine, &amp; after that it was borne, was mightily reſiſted in Italye and France.</hi> Moreouer they are not bound ſo ſtrictly to any thing, as to pray day and night for the proſperity of the warres, and for the victories and triumphs of the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Behold the words of the page <hi>169. We are bound day and night to appeace and wearie God with our prayers, to protect and defend Philip the Catholique King in al ſafety and happineſſe, who of his auncient and exceeding pietie, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler wiſedome, and wonderful watchfulnes, of the mightieſt power of al Princes that euer were, ſetteth himſelfe as a Walle for the houſe of God, and defendeth the Chatholique faith. A matter which hee doth not onely with his inuincible power, but with thoſe ſcout-watches of the holy Fathers, which haue the rule and gouernment of the Senate of the Catholike faith.</hi> So that we may not find it ſtrange, that ſo many honorable perſonages do aſſure vs that they haue heard them pray <hi>for Philip our King.</hi> For there is not a <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite</hi> in the world, that doth not once in the day pray this praier: and as the affaires of <hi>Spaine</hi> require, whereſoeuer they become, they make their vowes for him eyther publikelie or ſecretly.</p>
               <p>And on the contrary ſide, it is wel knowen to all men, that they neuer pray in any ſort for our King, to whom alſo they haue no oath of obedience, as whereof they are not otherwiſe capable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their corporation is not allowed in <hi>France,</hi> and being liege

vaſſals, &amp; wholly bound as wel to their Generall as to the Pope: which point doth manifeſtly diſcouer their conſpiracie, &amp; ſheweth euidently, that their vow tendeth to the ſubuerſion of the ſtate. For within the compaſſe of almoſt ſixtéene hundred yeres (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Chriſtian Religion was watered with the blood of Chriſt, &amp; his Martyrs) there hath not a Sect bin heard of, that hath had ſuch ſtrange vowes as this ſect hath.</p>
               <p>So farre of is it, that the Clergie of <hi>France</hi> hath euer bin ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the like, that on the contrary ſide, whenſoeuer the Popes combined themſelues without cauſe with the Enemies of this Crown, and would haue imploied the authority and power which they haue from God to edify withal, would haue imploied it, I ſay, to the diſtruction of the moſt floriſhing ſtate of Chriſtendome, and whom they may thanke for their temporalties, they haue found great and holy Parſonages, who with a common conſent of the whole Church of <hi>Fraunce</hi> haue manfully reſyſted ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes.</p>
               <p>But in this later age, one part of the Clergie is found to haue ſucked of this poiſoned milke, and this doctrine of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> that whoſoeuer had bin choſen Pope, (notwithſtanding that from time to time it had bin well knowen that he was a Pentioner &amp; Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and a ſworne enemie to <hi>France,)</hi> yet might he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding make the whole Kingdome a pray, and diſcharge the Subiectes from their obedience which they owe to their Prince.</p>
               <p>This ſchiſmatical and damnable propoſition, directly contrary to the word of God, which hath wholly ſeperated and put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwéene the Spirituall and Temporal powers.

Though the might of all nations were conſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, though al the world were in an vprore about vs, though the Seas were full of Nauies, though monſtruous and ſtrange beaſtes were brought in vppon vs, yet wouldeſt thou kéepe vs vnconquered, O moſt vnconquerable Soueraigne: but who can promiſe that this Piller and Starre of <hi>Fraunce</hi> ſhall continue for euer, in caſe that theſe wretched caitifes that do nothing but prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe daily againſt his life, if they that receiue theſe murderers ſent from <hi>Lyons</hi> whileſt it rebelled, and now from <hi>Spaine</hi>: if they, I ſay, that make the heartes of the religious deſperate, that daily ſharpen the edge of the peoples hearts againſt his Maieſtie, be mainteined and preſerued in this ſtate.</p>
               <p>But they inſtruct the youth, what to doe? to deſire and wiſh for the death of their Kings. Farre be it from vs to mollify and ſwée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the puniſhment due to the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> for their hainous crimes, becauſe they inſtruct ſome youth: Nay rather, this ought to be a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:26399:14"/>
motiue to induce vs to aggrauat and augment it an hundred fold. For it is this goodly inſtruction of your youth, it is theſe curſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which they ſtill into their tender minds, vnder a prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of teaching of them learning, (as poiſons are not giuen, but ſwéet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſuger, and vices deceiue not but vnder the ſhew and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of vertues) it is theſe bold confeſſions, (where, without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes they paint not the faces but the hearts of their ſcholers with the tincture &amp; painting of rebellion againſt their Prince and Magiſtrates) that hath filled ſo many places, and ſo many digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with Spaniſh hearts, enemies to the King and his ſtate.</p>
               <q>The tender age of Children drinketh vp error with the firſt milke.</q>
               <p>Some of their ſcholers haue reiected their perſwaſions, &amp; they do hate them a thouſand fold more, then ſuch as neuer knew them: but where one hath reſiſted them, a thouſand haue bin marred.</p>
               <p>We reade in the <hi>52.</hi> of <hi>Dion,</hi> that <hi>Maecenas</hi> ſhewed <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that there was none ſo good a way to eſtabliſh a peacefull ſtate to himſelfe and people, as to cauſe the nobilitie of <hi>Rome</hi> to be taught and inſtructed by ſuch Scholemaſters, as loued the ſtate of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie. For the world altereth and changeth in ſhort time, and this youth ſhall forthwith be aduanced to great offices. In like ſort, nothing can be more daungerous, then to haue our youth taught by theſe Spaniſh ſpialles; who aboue all things hate the French Monarchie.</p>
               <p>It is a very eaſie matter to imprint ſuch an affection as a man will, in theſe weake mindes: and nothing harder then to diſroote them. <hi>For the preceptes that are learned in our tender yeares, take deepe roote.</hi> It was not the riuer of <hi>Eurotas</hi> that made men war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but the good inſtitution of <hi>Licurgus.</hi> It is not the riuer of <hi>Seine,</hi> or the riuer of <hi>Garonne</hi> that hath made ſo many wicked Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but the colledges of the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> at <hi>Paris, Tholouſe,</hi> and <hi>Burdeaux.</hi> Since ſuch Scholers came to charges, the manors of our aunceſters fell not away by litle and litle: but ran down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long like to violent floods, and raging ſtreames.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian religion hath all the marks of true Iuſtice and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,

but none ſo apparant as the exact and preciſe charge of due o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Magiſtrates and preſeruation of gouernement: and theſe people, which terme themſelues the fellowſhip of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> haue no other matter they ſhoote at, but to turne all lawfull magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vpſide downe, to eſtabliſh the tirannie of <hi>Spaine</hi> in all places: and to this end doe they frame and faſhion the mindes of youth, committed vnto them to be inſtructed in good literature, religion, and piety.</p>

                  <q>Oh Lord, what nightiſh darkeneſſe poſſeſſeth the hearts of men euen for the verie bent to wickednes. Tereus is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be godly, and reapeth praiſe by lewdnes.</q>

               <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſacrificed their children to <hi>Saturne,</hi> their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers being conſtrained to be preſent and aſſiſting to the ſacrifice, with cherefull countenaunce. It is a ſtrange thing that we haue ſéene the time, when a man was not accompted a Catholique, vnleſſe he put his children to ſchole to a <hi>Ieſuite</hi>: and ſuch as ben brought vp in this Colledge, had their paſports to goe whither they would, no man was to make inquirie what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life they were of. So that Parents framing themſelues to the time, were conſtrained to loſe their Children, which were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charmed, or very often vtterly murdered, as it were, if they found them to their vent. There are too manie miſerable examples hereof, knowen wel inough to euerie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; publik complaints left to poſterity for this wickednes, againſt theſe cruell manſtealers that bereaue Parents of their Children, and oftentimes ſpoile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſupporters and pillers of their houſes, as it befell to <hi>Airault</hi> the Sherife of <hi>Angers,</hi> who hauing eight ſmall Children in his old age, was by the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> robbed of his eldeſt Sonne, who might by this time haue ſuccéeded his Father in his rome, and become a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his yonger Brethren and Siſters. They ſtale him from him when he was about foretéene yeares of age, and kept him in <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſo that he could neuer heare newes of him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all admonitions, and eccleſiaſticall cenſures that hée could procure againſt them, which they make but a mocke of, contenting themſelues with an abſolution ſent them from
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:26399:15"/>
their Spaniſh generall.</p>
               <p>In the meane while, when <hi>Airault</hi> ſhall come to die, the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> will put in foote for the right of the eldeſt ſonne in his goods and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: for they neuer bring any of their nouices to the vowe of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, vntill they haue no hope of any ſucceſſion: and before they become profeſſed, they giue all their goods to the Colledge. So nothing goeth out of their clouches, all commeth in: both by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtates and by wils which they hunt after euery day, on the one ſide fearing the weake mindes of ſuch as are at deaths doore with the terrors of Hell, &amp; on the other ſide, promiſing them open Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe if they giue any thing to the Felowſhip of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> As <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donat</hi> did to <hi>S. Andre</hi> preſident of <hi>Montbrun,</hi> drawing from him by a confeſſion full of couetouſnes and maſked iugling, all the moueables and gaines he had gotten by his many yéeres trauaile and ſeruice, of which monſtruous abuſe and treacherous fraude Monſieur <hi>Pibrac</hi> complained of in full Court. The world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what a maner of Teſtament and Will they cauſed <hi>Gondran</hi> the preſident of <hi>Dijon</hi> to make, by which Will and Teſtament he gaue halfe a Crowne to his ſiſter his onely heire, &amp; ſeuen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Franckes in land a yéere to the <hi>Ieſuites.</hi> It is well knowen how they robbed the houſe of <hi>Bollons,</hi> one of the richeſt houſes in all <hi>Bordeaux.</hi> And of late, how they receiued for the right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the houſe of <hi>Monſieur de Largebaſton</hi> preſident, the lande of <hi>Faiolles,</hi> which they ſolde for twelue thouſand Crownes, and ſent the money into <hi>Spaine,</hi> to be put into their Treaſorie there: for they kéepe nothing in <hi>France,</hi> but onely the immoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables which are bequeathed them without power of alienation.</p>
               <p>It is alſo notoriouſly knowen, how they ſtole away the onely brother of the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Canillac,</hi> a Gentleman at this day of eight thouſand Francks of reuenue, and heire apparant to aboue fiue and fortie thouſand, whome they kéepe with good aduiſe from entring into the vowe of pouertie, becauſe they ſtand in good hope to become Lords and Maiſters of the ſucceſſion of his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is vnmarried, and one that daily hazardeth his life in the Kings warres for his ſeruice, and is his Liuetenant in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergne.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:26399:16"/>
And without doubt, if that noble man faile, if they haue no worſe ſucceſſe in their iudgements then they haue had hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, they will become <hi>Marquiſes</hi> of <hi>Canillac,</hi> and ſo pull downe this houſe, which is at this day one of the greateſt, and mightieſt, and of greateſt honour in all <hi>Britanie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our nation hath bin alwaies charged with want of wiſedome. As for iuſtice, liberalitie, valour and courage, wée haue inough; yea too much: but too too litle wiſedome. What a careleſſe ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie is this, that ſuch Caterpillers as theſe are, vnder a colour of diſdaine to take a couple of ſous, and other vſuall auailes that are giuen to Scholemaiſters for inſtructing mens children, haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten within theſe thirtie yéeres two hundred thouſand Francks of reuenue.</p>
               <p>In our Vniuerſitie, there was neuer any thing taken of the poorer ſort: but if a Gentlemans ſonne giue foure or fiue crownes to his Reader, for his yéeres trauaile, is this any great matter? Is it not reaſon, for him that hath ſpent his yéeres in learning to haue ſome little maintenaunce to buy him an handſome gowne withall: To denie this, were not onely not to recieue a poore ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but vtterly to ſinke him. Heretofore poore yong men found the meanes to be entertained of the richer ſort till twenty or two and twenty yéeres, and ſo began to get ſomething: which cauſed euery yéere a thouſand more to giue themſelues to ſtudie, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would haue done. But ſince the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> haue drawen all ſcholers to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, men are become out of heart: for take away rewarde of ſtudies, and learning faileth.</p>
               <p>All the greateſt and moſt excellent perſonages of ancient time were of opinion that it was reaſon, that ſuch as tooke paines in bringing vp their youth in learning ſhould be recompenſed: and beſides reaſon, they thought it very requiſite and neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>And yet notwithſtanding theſe fellowes following the ſteppes and practiſe of cunning impoiſoners, (which alwaies mixe their drammes of poiſon finely and ſubtilly with ſome ſwéete and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate ingredient) haue deuiſed none ſo fit a way to draw away al ſcholers vnto themſelues, as the refuſing of theſe ſimple and ſmall
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:26399:16"/>
contributions or allowances. For licencious youthes had rather ſpend the money their parentes ſende them in diſhoneſt houſes, then giue it to their Tutors, that all the yéere long trauaile for them.</p>
               <p>Yet this were nothing, were it not for the inchantements and ſorceries wherewith they bewitch youths. But as the <hi>Romaines</hi> were very carefull to bring vp the nobilitie of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Authun,</hi> where they trained them vp to the loue of the Empire, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the auncient libertie of <hi>France:</hi> euen ſo the tyrant of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath his <hi>Ieſuits</hi> diſperſed in <hi>France,</hi> to imprint the loue of his name and of his gouernement in the tender mindes of our children. <hi>God hath planted heauenly ſeedes in the bodies of men, which if a good husband haue the cultifying of, the fruite falleth out anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſeede: but if an euill husband haue them in hand, he ded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, as barren and mariſh grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d doth; and ſo for good corne reapeth nothing but weedes.</hi> And take we what paines we can to wéede out ſuch opinions, our labour is but caſt away, and our time loſt. For the ſtomacke being once diſtempered by a diſeaſe, it altereth the nature of all the meates it receaueth. So that we haue no other remedie but the feare of Lawes, and enforcements, as great hatreds muſt be bridled with great dreads: but that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is alwaies more loyall and more acceptable, that procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from loue, then that that is grounded vpon feare. They that are ſtong with the Serpent <hi>Dipſas,</hi> haue a continuall drouth, through the force of the poiſon ſcattered through all the vaines and drying vp the ſtore of blood, in ſo much as the ſicke man doth nothing but drinke, and yet his thirſt can neuer be quenched: In like ſorte they that haue once taſted of this venemous and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenciall inſtruction of the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> thirſt continually after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting of the repoſe and quiet ſtate of their Countries, and the aduancement of the gouernement of <hi>Spaine.</hi>

               <p>The hiſtorie of <hi>Portugal</hi> is well knowen: K. <hi>Philip</hi> had an eye vpon that his neighbour kingdome a long time: but bring it to his ſubiection he could not vnleſſe he procured the Kings death, &amp; the death of the greateſt part of the Nobilitie. In this ſeruice he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied
<pb facs="tcp:26399:17"/>
the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> which were about King <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> who call themſelues in that Countrie, <hi>Apoſtles</hi>: theſe fellowes hauing by their ſlie and ſubtile practiſes bereſt him of all his old ſeruaunts, eſpecially of <hi>Peter of Alcaſſonne</hi> his Secretarie, and perſwading him to goe ouer into <hi>Afrike</hi> againſt his enemies, ten thouſand times ſtronger then all the power he had or was able to make, cauſed him to vndertake the voyage, where he loſt his life, and the liues of all the Nobilitie almoſt of <hi>Portingal.</hi> During the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> which was not long, the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> beſtirre themſelues ſo well with their practiſes, that incontinently after the <hi>Cardinals</hi> death, and <hi>Antonie</hi> receiued &amp; acknowledged King by all the ſtates of the Countrie, he was forced to ſlie the lande, (all his Maritime and port townes being fallen from him in one day), and ſaue his life by trauaile on foote more then foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles. The Iſles of <hi>Tercere</hi> held out yet for King <hi>Antonie,</hi> which was a good footing &amp; ſtopped al the trafficque of the <hi>Indies,</hi> the Frenchmen tooke part with them, vnder the conduct of the <hi>Commander</hi> of <hi>Chattes.</hi> All the inhabitants of the Iſlands, al the Monkes, and Friers, and the reſt ſhewed themſelues moſt loyall and affectionate to their King, and ſworne enemies to the <hi>Caſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi> But on the contrarie ſide the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> which had bin the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes of the reuolt of the kingdome, began to thunder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the French, and exalt King <hi>Philip.</hi> What did they then? In lieu of caſting them into the ſea, or at the leaſt, of driuing them out of the land, they were conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tonely to ſhut them vp w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in their cloiſter. All this is largely diſcourſed in the Hiſtorie imprinted at <hi>Gennua,</hi> by the commandement of the K. of <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; is wholly to his aduantage. Moreouer all that is there ſet downe touching the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> is ſet downe for their reputation &amp; honour, as men that had bin the principall inſtrumentes of the vnion of <hi>Portingal</hi> to <hi>Caſtile</hi>: as their trauaile at this day is to no other ende and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to vnite the kingdome of <hi>France</hi> to the crowne of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What did the <hi>Ieſuites</hi>? when they ſawe their time, in a night they brake downe the wall that rampired vp their gates, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the ſacrament of the Altar before them, making but a ſcorne
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:26399:17"/>
of God in abuſing his myſteries to raiſe ſeditions withal: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to coniure the people ſo well, that they appalled and cooled their courages, ſo that the French conducted thither by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall <hi>Stroſſy</hi> could haue no ayde nor aſſiſtance from them, which was the cauſe of his diſcomu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture. And here you are to marke how the Hiſtorie reporteth that foure ſcore Noble men, and two and fiftie French Gentlemen were boucherly put to death by a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh decrée in one day, vpon one ſcaffolde in <hi>Ville franche,</hi> and a number of Souldiers hanged. The ſame hiſtorie reporteth, how that during this warre, fiue hundred Friers, or other Religious perſons which had preached or ſpoken for King <hi>Antonie,</hi> had bin put to death. Behold the precepts of the <hi>Ieſuites. Kill, murder, hange, play the Bouchers:</hi> We ſée alſo in <hi>France,</hi> that they that goe to their confeſſions, and be norſed at their breaſts, are ſo cruell, that they kill one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcelin</hi> in his <hi>27.</hi> ſaieth, that about the Riuer <hi>Euxinus</hi> there was a people called <hi>Odriſae, which were ſo accuſtomed to ſhed the blood of man, that if they had no ſtore of enemies, they would in their feaſts and bankets launce their owne fleſh.</hi> Theſe felowes murder one an other, though they haue enemies inough in the field.</p>
               <p>Goe too then my Lordes of the Nobilitie, follow theſe diſciples of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> to the ende they may recompence your ſeruices at their beſt leaſure and pleaſure with ſtabbes of daggers: and for your beſt auaile make ſome corner of <hi>France</hi> a prouince of the <hi>Moores,</hi> and from <hi>Baetica</hi> receiue your lawes. How much more honorable were it for you, with your common loyaltie and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al aſſiſtance to ſaue and recouer this kingdome.</p>
               <p>Therefore take hearts vnto you and be of good courage, you braue and vndoubtable Nobilitie of <hi>France,</hi> holde on to conioyne your ſelues in one armie.

               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaid that <hi>Antipater</hi> was outwardly clad with white, but inwardly was altogither redde: So there are a number that in vtter apparance are the Kings ſeruants, and are ſkilful inough to make their profite of his good fortune: but within, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither blood redde, wholly Spaniſh. Theſe men that can not but vſe the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> to execute their miſchieuous enterpriſes, dare not ſay openly that it were good to let them continue in <hi>France,</hi> (for to vſe any ſuch ſpeach, and to weare a redde croſſe is all one) but they can ſay, it is no time now to rid them from out amongſt vs, and allege reſpects wherefore, which I meane to anſwere. But firſt of all it is expedient to beate downe their chiefeſt bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke, which ſtandeth in the referment to counſaile ſet downe in the yéere <hi>64.</hi> To which I will bring fiue anſweres, the leaſt whereof is more then ſufficient.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that this inſtance of <hi>64.</hi> is failed, not onely thrée, but thirtie yéeres agoe. And whereas they ſay, that the failing of the inſtance, hath no place in Parliement, that is not ſo, but when the proceſſe is not diſcontinued. And as for this matter which is now in queſtion, ſo farre is it from hauing bin vſed, that on the contrarie ſide, the copie of the pleas and bils haue not bin ſo much as taken out, which is the firſt act whereby the partie, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Counſaile, receiueth his firſt inſtruction.</p>
               <p>The ſecond anſwere is, that the inſtance of <hi>64.</hi> differeth wholly from that that is tendred at this preſent: firſt the qualities are diuers: for the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> were then plaintifes, and be now defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. Secondly, the queſtion was, whether they ſhould enioy the priuileges of the Vniuerſitie or no. And now the queſtion is, whether they are to be caſt out of <hi>France</hi> or no. At that time, to appoint them to counſaile, was to denie them their demaunde. Now it were as much as to put to Counſaile whether the King ſhould liue or no, if in the meane while, we muſt entertaine theſe murderers amongſt vs, that deſire nothing more earneſtly then his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:26399:18"/>Thirdly, there is great difference betwéene the yéere <hi>64.</hi> and the yéere <hi>94.</hi> In <hi>64.</hi> that miſchiefe was feared, which is fallen out and many would not be perſwaded to conceiue it, being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the ſugred and honied wordes of theſe hipocrites. Who would haue thought at that time, to haue ſeene Spaniſh dead paies in <hi>Paris,</hi> the Spaniardes march vp and downe in thoſe faire and large ſtréetes, their armes a kenbow, their ſtaring eies, their frowning foreheads, their maieſticall and ſolemne march as ſofte as foote can fall.</p>
               <p>In the yéere <hi>64. Barnard</hi> and <hi>Comolet</hi> were not heard to call the King, <hi>Holofernes, Moab,</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> mainteining that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>France</hi> was electiue and that it belonged to the people to eſtabliſh the Kings, and alledging this text of the old Teſtament, <hi>Thou ſhalt chouſe thy brother for King, thy brother,</hi> ſay they, that is not to ſay, of the ſelfe ſame linage, or of the ſelfe ſame nation: but of the ſame religion, as this great Catholike king, this great king of <hi>Spaine. Comelet</hi> was ſo impudent and bold as to ſay, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie blaſphemouſlie, that vnder theſe wordes, <hi>Deliuer me O Lord out of the myre, that I may not ſticke in it, Dauid</hi> vnderſtood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically the rooting out of the houſe of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> During theſe warres they would haue erected a Colledge of <hi>Ieſuits</hi> at <hi>Poitiers,</hi> ſaying that a riche and religious Lord would giue eight hundred crownes of reuenue for the foundation. And when they had bin inſtantly preſſed a great while, to diſcouer who this great Lord was, being not able to name any other, they were conſtrained maugre their beardes to confeſſe that it was the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who will neuer thinke it much to be at ſuch a charge to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuch a pernicious and dangerous vermine amongſt vs as theſe <hi>Ieſuites</hi> are. And this was witneſſed by all the deputies of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> which put to their helping handes to reduce that towne to the obedience of the King.</p>
               <p>In <hi>64.</hi> the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> had not as yet the Booke of life amongſt them, wherein they haue ſithence kept a record of all that, that they learne by their ſecrete ſhriftes of all houſes and families, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming themſelues by children and ſeruaunts, not what their

conſciences are, but what ſpeach and talke their parents and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue commonly in their houſes, whereby they may know what diſpoſition they are of. <hi>Comolet</hi> preaching at the <hi>Baſtile</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gentlemen that were then priſoners in the beginning of the yéere <hi>89.</hi> ſaid vnto them after a thouſand impudent blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that he that had bin their King was not their King, plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from thence the murder which they executed afterwardes. When <hi>Trouue,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Aubrey</hi> were impriſoned in the <hi>Baſtile</hi> by <hi>Buſſy</hi> the <hi>Clerc,</hi> the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile of the fortie, could not get them out: but onely <hi>Comolet,</hi> as an <hi>Orpheus</hi> of his owne authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſet them at libertie, ſuch was the dependencie of the <hi>ſixteene Murderers</hi> vpon the <hi>Ieſuites.</hi> At what time there came newes of the Popes election that is now, <hi>Comolet</hi> being come out of the pulpet, went vp againe, and began to crie out, <hi>Heare thou Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, I will tell thee newes, we haue a Pope, what maner of Pope? one that is a good Catholique? What more? one that is a good Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard. Goe and hange thy ſelfe thou Politician.</hi> The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> vſed no ſuch language in the yéere <hi>64.</hi> an auncient writer ſaieth, <hi>Yong Serpents deceiue: when one hath paſſed his naturall bigneſſe and is growen to a monſter, when it hath infected the fountaines, and by breathing burneth which way ſoeuer it goe, men ſeeke to deſtroy it with ſome ſhot or other: euils ſpringing may eſcape, but great are mette withall. Titus Liuius</hi> ſaieth elegantly, <hi>It can not be, but the diſeaſes muſt be knowen, before their remedies can be found out: ſo did euill motions breake out in men, before lawes were made to bridle them.

               </p>
               <p>Speake to the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Piſany,</hi> he will tell you that ſince the yéere of <hi>64.</hi> when he was in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> as Ambaſſadour
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26399:19"/>
about the affaires of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> hee found no matter of weight, wherein a <hi>Ieſuite</hi> had not an oare. Speake to them that had the decifering of al the letters of importance, which were intercepted during theſe warres, they will tell you, that they neuer read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pernicious point, where a <hi>Ieſuits</hi> finger was not. And euen latelie at <hi>Lions,</hi> ſince the Towne yéelded to the King, a <hi>Ieſuite</hi> that had begun to ſay his Maſſe, perceiuing a Gentleman in the church w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a white ſcarfe, ran out of the Church being ful of people of a purpoſe to raiſe a ſedition: a matter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they attempted ſince, and will no doubt be the loſſe of that Towne being of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, if they be not ſpéedelie baniſhed out of the Countrey by your order and decrée.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, who ſo breaketh the modifications and conditions whereupon a graunt is made vnto him; is worthie to looſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite that he might receiue by the graunt. Now ſince the yere <hi>64.</hi> the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> haue directly broken the conditions of their aduiſe of <hi>Poiſſy,</hi> which is the onely allowance they haue had in <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Firſt they haue broken them herein, that they haue reteined their name of <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> which they were expreſly charged not to doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this glorious name is particulerly reſerued to the onely Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of the world: and there was neuer any amongeſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to this day found ſo tranſported with pride, as to dare to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute this name either to himſelfe in particuler, or to other and himſelfe in common. They alone haue bin ſo impudent, as to take this name in their propoſitions, by which (through their houſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing &amp; ſugred ſpeach, carying one thing ſecreated in their hearts, and another ready at their Tongues endes) their meaning was within thrée moneths to flatter them, whom they would with all their hearts ſée inſtantly plu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged in the depth of the Inquiſition of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Secondly, they haue broken the aduiſe of <hi>Poiſy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Colledge was receiued, and their profeſſion reiected. For they haue bin ſo bold as to plant it in way of triumph in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of Saint <hi>Antonies</hi> ſtréete, where they are at this day ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, as to haue in their cappes the full armes of <hi>France,</hi> with a Cardinals hat aboue, to let vs vnderſtand that in deſpite of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King
<pb facs="tcp:26399:20"/>
to whom they are not bound by oath of fidelitie, and whom they ſought and will ſéeke daily to murder: they acknowledged one <hi>Charles</hi> the tenth to haue bin King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> vnder whom they hopes to haue wrought with this Kingdome, as they wrought with the Kingdome of <hi>Portingal</hi> vnder another Cardinal. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their aduiſe of <hi>Poiſy</hi> purporteth expreſly, that they may not procure any Bulles contrary to theſe reſtraints ſet downe by this act: and in caſe they doe procure any, they ſhal ſtand as none, and of none effect nor value, which is verifyed vppon this verie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But now they haue procured Bulles ſo contrarie to this aduiſe of <hi>Poiſy,</hi> that whoſoeuer make any limitations or reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt their priuileges and inſtitutions, are by vertue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of excommunicate with the greateſt excommunication, yea who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhall dare to diſpute or reaſon the matter, though it be but onely to ſéeke out the truth. Heare the verie words of their bull of <hi>84. And obey their Gouerners in al thinges and euerie way, and be immediatly ſubiect to this Sea, and clerely exempt from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of all ordinaries and delegates whatſoeuer, or of any other Iudges, as by the vertue of theſe preſents we do alſo exempt them.</hi> A point directly contrary to this clauſe of the aduyſe of <hi>Poiſſy. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon condition, that the Byſhop Dioceſan ſhall haue all ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancie, iuriſdiction, and correction ouer the ſaid Societie and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</hi> And conſequently their aduiſe of <hi>Poiſly</hi> is become voide, as well by the courſe of law before alledged, as by the clauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely ſet downe to make it voide by the ſaid aſſembly. <hi>They ſhal renounce expreſſely and in plain termes all priuiledges giuen by their Bulles, which are contrarie to the points and articles aforeſaid. Otherwiſe and in want hereof, or in caſe they doe hereafter obteine any other, they ſhalbe as none, and of none effect nor value.</hi> But ſée yet a more ſtrange clauſe ſet down in their Bul of <hi>84.</hi> by which, both we that ſpeake againſt them, and you my Lords that are the Iudges, and they of <hi>Poiſſy</hi> alſo, which made the aduiſe, are al ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate. <hi>We commaund therefore (vpon their holie obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and vnder paine of excommunication of the ſentence giuen, &amp; of diſabling, to all ſeculer offices and benefices, and reguler of al or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

whatſoeuer, forthwith to be incurred without further declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reſeruing to our ſelues and to our ſucceſſors onelie, the abſolution from the ſame,) that no man of any ſtate, degree, or preheminence whatſoeuer, be ſo hardie and bold as either directlie or indirectly to impugne or gainſay any inſtitutions, conſtitutions, or theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents touching the ſaid ſocietie, or any of them, or of al the foreſaid Articles, or any other matter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſame, though it be done in way of diſputation onely, or to ſeeke out the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, and laſtly, and to ſpeake plainly without flattery in a matter of ſuch weight, and a ſpéedie iſſue whereof all honeſt men doe earneſtly deſire, who knoweth not, how that in <hi>Anno 64.</hi> there was not a man within this place ſo hardy as durſt ſpeak fréely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the conſpiracie of <hi>Spaine</hi>? All good men were afraide, and ſpeachleſſe: when as it was a miſerable caſe to ſpeak what a man would not; and full of danger to ſpeake what he would willingly ſpeake. The whéeles, the gallowſes would not haue bin ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent puniſhments for them that durſt to haue bin ſo hardie: What think you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you Spaniſh ſpials you may alledge for your ſelues at this day to maintaine your ſelues? Will you ſay, becauſe you haue bin ſuffered heretofore, nay that is reaſon ſufficient to baniſh you out of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> to wit, your force, your violence, your tiranny, &amp; the tiranny of your ſupporters, of your Spaniards, which haue bound our hands, which haue ſtopt our mouthes, which haue made you ſo couragious, which haue made you ſpeake ſo proudly, which haue ſet you ſo hie: you I ſay, moſt wicked varlets with your bloody handes, moſt peſtilent and proud through your inſatiable couetouſnes, you that haue no regard of loyaltie, you that are void of God and all honeſtie, to be ſhort, you that make your gaine of all thinges be they honeſt or diſhoneſt.</p>
               <p>But they be not wicked varlets alone, there is a point that makes them worſe: for if they onely had bin wicked themſelues, our miſerie had bin the leſſe. The great number of Frenchmen whom they haue marde, hath bin the cauſe of our miſeries. And yet now they ſéeke to throng themſelues amongeſt this preſſe of people, and hide their heads, thinking to leſſen their fault through
<pb facs="tcp:26399:21"/>
the fellowſhip of many offenders, as though in this their wicked lewdnes they did but kéepe the Kinges high way, doing as other men doe. But it fareth farre otherwiſe; for the greater the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is of lewd and euil affected ſubiectes, the greater is the harueſt of the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> for theſe are their fruits; And why is not this whole ſinke of Sixtéene and their adherentes, vpon their way to <hi>Spaine</hi>? Why are they not baniſhed for euer out of the aire of <hi>France,</hi> which they haue poiſoned this long while? What do theſe <hi>Ieſuites</hi> here ſtill? what doe they? Sée we not well inough what they doe? What vndermininges, what violences, what corruptions, what ſeditions haue they not already committed and done? Beléeue me my Lords, they loſe no time; ſuch buſie heads, moſt ſharpe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing, moſt impudent in attempting, moſt vigilant in effecting, are not vnprofitable: they receiue packets daily from <hi>Spaine,</hi> and from all corners of <hi>France,</hi> and deliuer them at <hi>Soiſſons:</hi> they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie their Packets out of the towne themſelues, (for to rifle and ſearch a <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> were to commit high treaſon againſt God himſelf, neither was there euer any Captaine that durſt to this day at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſuch an act,) they receiue into their chamber of counſell al that wil deuiſe or contriue any thing againſt the ſtate of the town; if onely they will but make a ſhew to reſort to their Churches, or confeſſe to their <hi>Ieſuites</hi> what practiſe is intended by anie man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any of the <hi>Sixteene,</hi> which doe nothing but practiſe our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction? Shall we ſtill ſuffer our ſelues to be abuſed by theſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites? Shall we be ſtill like to the Barbarians, that made but a ſcoffe of the fortifications which the enemies made againſt their walles, vntill they found their walles beaten downe about their eares, and their Towne fooliſhlie loſt? Shall we ſuffer our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to gather together the pieces of their ſhipwrecke? Shall wée ſuffer the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> to faſten the knots againe of their practiſes, and frame a new their faction in the conſciences of the people, which are alwaies the greateſt number?</p>
               <p>In all this action, this is the ſtrangeſt point to behold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what delaies, what formalities of Iuſtice haue bin vſed, and how vppon the ſodaine, and euen at a verie inſtant, taking not ſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:26399:21"/>
much leaſure as to breath themſelues, they could defend by bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and corruption, what they committed by miſchieuous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. We haue not baniſhed them as they did at <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> which was the braueſt and moſt honorable act that the Mareſhal of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignon</hi> euer did, though he ſtand renowmed and highly thought of, and ſo wil in the memorie of al poſteritie for many noble victories atchieued by his handes. But this blow of reſolution which hée gaue, was a meanes of the preſeruation of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had bin loſt, and would haue drawen after it euen at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, the loſſe of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>O braue and noble <hi>Mareſhall,</hi> thou fearedſt not the reproches, the wicked tongues, the ſtinking vomits of theſe amongſt vs, that falſly terming themſelues the Kinges ſeruantes, doe foſter, doe mainteine, doe ſupport, and fauor his moſt cruel, moſt deteſtable, moſt coniured enemies: Howbeit in the end they ſhal all come to naught, and that moſt ſhamefully togither with their <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> notwithſtanding their goodly and colourable pretences, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt whereof is this.</p>
               <p>What wil they ſay at <hi>Rome?</hi> Oh, what doe they ſpeak of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Marſhall of <hi>Matignon</hi>? wil you know what they ſay at <hi>Rome</hi>: Let vs diſtinguiſh the ſpeakers: The <hi>Spaniardes</hi> will ſay, that they which baniſhed the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> are all of them Heretikes. Haue they any other talke in their mouthes? I will not ſpeake onely of our ſelues that haue followed the King and his fortune, but alſo of them that tarried here in the Towne, and yet couragiouſlie, and with euident peril of their liues, oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the aboliſhing of the <hi>Salique</hi> law. Did not the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> ſay, that they were all Lutherans and Heretikes?</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, they that are at <hi>Rome</hi> and in <hi>Italie,</hi> and are not <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> they I ſay, wil ſay, that this is the time wherein the French men will ſhew themſelues to be French men in déed, franke and frée, and ſworne enemies to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> This is the time wherein they manifeſt to the world, that they are quicke of ſight, &amp; looke into their ſtate aright, by driuing out from amongeſt them theſe ſpialles of their enemies: to be ſhort, this is the time
<pb facs="tcp:26399:22"/>
wherein they meane to liue in ſtrengthfull and aſſured health, now that they purge theſe melancholike and ouerburnt, and moſt malicious humors out of the bodie of their common wealth. But though the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> be daungerous to <hi>Fraunce,</hi> yet at the leaſt they haue wrought mightie wonders amongſt the Indian people. True it is, and ſuch wonders indéed, as we haue good cauſe to take knowledge of: for they haue cauſed twenty millions of thoſe poore ſoules, as their own hiſtorie reporteth, and termeth them lambes, to be conſumed by fire and ſword of the <hi>Caſtilians.</hi> They haue wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out the paganiſm, not by conuerting the Pagans, but by play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bloudy bouchers with them. Their maner of diſpeopling of the Iſland called <hi>Spaniola,</hi> is much to be marked. They put all the men a part to worke in their mines, and the women they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to cultify the earth: ſo that kéeping them from generation, &amp; vſing al the crueltie they could againſt the liuing, in leſſe then <hi>12.</hi> yeares they inhabited the whole Iſland which is not ſmall, with <hi>Caſtilians.</hi> In <hi>Peru</hi> they haue publike places of torture within the marches, wherein they may put a thouſand at once, and there the Souldiers and the Lackies torment theſe poore people, thereby to make them confeſſe where their treaſure is. And if any of them eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape out, they goe and hange themſelues in the mountaines and their wiues by them, and their poore children at their féet. Theſe monſters of tirannie, doe as ordinarilie hunt after men, as we doe after the Bucke and Stagge, cauſing their dogges to deuoure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and their Tigers, when they ſend them to ſeeke honie and waxe, and alſo by their <hi>Tuberons</hi> when they cauſe them to goe a fiſhing for perles in the moſt daungerous parts of the ſea. If they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie out anie of theſe poore people to warre with them, they giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing to liue on, but conſtraine them to eate their enemies, ſo that the Spaniſh armies are verie boucheries of the fleſh of man. And yet we maruail at the cruelties which they vſe in theſe parts of the world, which are but fleabitinges, or honie ſoppes rather in compariſon of that that they can doe. Their couetouſnes was ſo extreme, that they laded their ſhippes with thriſe as many moe of theſe poore ſilliones then their ſhips could bear, or they had victuall
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:26399:22"/>
for, in ſo much, that they caſt ſo many of them ouer board, that to paſſe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſle of <hi>Lucaies</hi> vnto <hi>Spaniola,</hi> which is a good diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, a man néeded not anie compaſſe, but onelie the trace of theſe poore <hi>Indians</hi> dead floting vpon the ſea, where they had caſt them.</p>
               <p>O yee Frenchmen behold, againe and againe, behold I ſay; the great fauour of God towards vs in drawing vs out of the ſlauerie of this monſtrous &amp; prodigious nation: Chaines and Irons ſhould haue bin your beſt intertainment, full <hi>Argoſes</hi> of you ſhould haue bin carried to the <hi>Indies</hi> to worke in their mines, whileſt they had placed Colonies in your Townes, and giuen your houſes in the countrey for a reward: And yet notwithſtanding, this murdering and caſting in chaines and Irons, al the true Catholiks, &amp; to leaue none in <hi>Fraunce</hi> but Atheiſts, robbers, murderers, inceſts, &amp; pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould haue bin termed nothing but the planting of the Catholike Religion.</p>
               <p>But if the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> be ſo wicked, why is there not an inditement framed againſt them? I anſwere you, that Monſieur the Kinges Atturney generall knoweth how to proſecute that which he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth beſt, but the matter which the vniuerſitie, (the Kings eldeſt daughter, who can not hold her tongue from crying out againſt them that would murder her father) calleth vppon, is, that all the reſt may be baniſhed out of the realme, whileſt the other be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rained that are in hold: the danger that we are in, wil not wel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide ſlow working medecines and lingring Phiſitions. The hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of the humble Friers, and of the Cardinall <hi>Bouromee</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie notorious and freſh in memorie: one of theſe Friers would haue murdered the Cardinal.

<pb facs="tcp:26399:23"/>
eldeſt ſonne and protector of the Church.</p>
               <p>By the ciuil law, all the iſſue of that man that practiſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of the Prince, euen to the verie childe that ſucketh the mothers breaſts, are diſhenherited and brought to miſerie: ſo fearefull is the example of treaſon, and ſhall we preſerue the companions of <hi>Varade,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> haue vowed the ſelf ſame vow that he did, that haue the ſame deſire &amp; purpoſe that he had, that holy him away. Whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer one <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> ſhall attempt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murder of one of our Kings, ſhal he onely be baniſhed? This is a good propoſition, and well worthy to be mainteined, <hi>that it is better that twentie Kinges of France be murdered, then all the Ieſuites ſhould be baniſhed France.</hi> They that are of this opinion, care not how many Kinges we change.</p>
               <p>If they were to be executed as the <hi>Templers,</hi> their inditements would be framed. But what ſay the <hi>Ieſuites</hi>? That they came into <hi>Fraunce</hi> for our good: yea but experience hath ſhewed vs, that they haue cauſed our ruine. What néedeth further inditement? ſéeing they aduaunce our enemies ſo greatlie. There is an excellent ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Tacitus</hi> to this purpoſe. <hi>O noble Counſellers, if we looke no further, but conſider with what vile language they haue abuſed mens eares, priſons and gallowſes are too good for them. It is time you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to iudgement, that neither they may ſcape ſcotfree, nor you repent your ſelues of your ſeueritie mixt with clemencie: let them be diſpatched with fire and water.</hi> Behold a good iudgement for the <hi>Ieſuits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, happily before the yeare <hi>85.</hi> this formaliſing might haue bin tollerated, for vntill that day their lewdneſſe and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie was ſhadowed with a goodly maſke, but now they goe ſo open faced, that we néede neither letters nor witneſſes. <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaith finelie. <hi>There be ſome crimes of treaſon againſt the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which may be ſufficiently condemned by the view of the eie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Seneca</hi> to this purpoſe in the tenth booke of his contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies ſaith, <hi>whether the common wealth be hurt or no, it is not to be proued by arguments, the hurt of the common-wealth appeareth forthwith.</hi> He that ſhould haue laied hands on <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> had there bin any néed of confro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting of witneſſes to prooue that he had

paſſed the <hi>Rubicon,</hi> that he had entred into <hi>Italie</hi> with an armie, and taken the treaſure of the commonwealth? The painters and Poetes giue a naked ſworde to Iuſtice, to giue vs to vnderſtand that we may not alwaies ſtand vpon doubtes and tract of time: neither play the part of euill Chirurgians, who for want of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſore in due time, protract the cure ſo long, till the ſtrength of the patient be vtterly caſt downe &amp; not poſſible to be reſtored.</p>
               <p>But what call we notorious? All our Doctors define it in one worde, to be that, that is done before the people. And I would to God that the crimes of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> were not ſo great, ſo certaine, and notorious as they are, then ſhould we not haue ſuffered ſo much miſerie as we haue.</p>
               <q>

               <p>But they haue left nothing to the Counſeler for him to breake his head withall: for, to denie matters, that are as cleare as the Sunne, increaſeth the fault, and confuteth it not. <hi>Philo</hi> the Iew, writing vpon the ten commaundements, ſpeaking of the voice of God, giueth a good reaſon why we are ſaid to ſee the worde. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſaieth he, that that which God ſpeaketh is not onely a bare worde, but a worke. It is an vſuall and common Prouerbe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, <hi>the voice of the people is the voice of God,</hi> whereby is meant the voice of the beſt ſort and not of the multitude. Becauſe they ſpeake of ſuch thinges as they know, of thinges which haue bin ſéene, and wherein they can not lie.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay that the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> are not all ſtraungers: as though the Spaniards by adoption, and by othe, had not done vs more harme then the naturall Spaniards. I will rather take them for Citiſens, which are borne in the remoteſt place of all <hi>Scythia,</hi> and yet thinke well of <hi>France,</hi> then they that are borne of <hi>Paris</hi> and brought vp there, and employ themſelues moſt vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and wickedly, to deſtroy the place, libertie, and honour of their countrie wherein they were borne. <hi>Comolet, Bernard,</hi> and ſuch like, are they not Frenchmen borne, and yet are there any of any nation that haue ſo impudently vomited out all ſortes of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
<pb facs="tcp:26399:24"/>
ſpeaches againſt his Maieſtie, and the memorie of the King that dead is, as they haue done? Are there any men in the world that haue trauailed ſo much as they haue done to turne the ſtate vpſide downe? for if a man make a ſhew of religion, he may doe what he will vnder that pretext, <hi>his penny is good ſiluer:</hi> to murder or cauſe Princes to be murdered, which are excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by the Pope, is the chiefeſt part of their ſending. <hi>Varade</hi> himſelfe, the encourager, and puſher on forward of that Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of <hi>Melun</hi> was he not a <hi>Pariſien?</hi> Oh ſir, the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> would haue bin baniſhed out of <hi>France</hi> long agoe, had there bin no other Spaniards amongſt vs but ſuch as are natifes and borne beyond the mountaines of <hi>Pirene.</hi> The pleaſures and excéeding great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoures, which King <hi>Philip</hi> beſtoweth vpon the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> maketh it notorious inough, how that he maketh accompt of them as of his good ſubiects, and inſtruments of his ſoueraintie. The great <hi>Ieſuiticall Argoſee,</hi> which fetcheth their gold and Marchandiſes from the <hi>Indies,</hi> (for they draw from all parts of the world, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their treaſure in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> withall) this great veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, I ſay, payeth no fifth to King <hi>Philip.</hi> A matter of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to them, then two hundred thouſand crownes a yéere. For their part of the conqueſt of <hi>Portingal,</hi> he gaue them the preſent which the kings of the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> payed from thrée yéeres to thrée yéeres to the King of <hi>Portingal,</hi> which is worth in Gold, and Pearles, &amp; Spicerie, more then foure hundred thouſand crownes. In recompence of which bountie, they ſpeake of him, as of the greateſt Prince that euer was in the world, farre ſurmounting the force of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> and hauing more countries vnder him then all the Kings of the world.</p>
               <p>Goe on yée Spaniſh ſoules to praiſe and magnifie the forces of the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> he will make you all Cardinals, as well as <hi>Tolledo</hi> the Spaniſh <hi>Ieſuite.</hi> They will no ſmall benefices, (&amp; yet for the better maintenance of their table, they vnite &amp; knit many Priories and Abbies togither) but they wilbe Cardinals; to the ende they may be Popes, this is good fiſh for their nets. Who was it that brought that bold and proude meſſage to <hi>Monſieur of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:26399:24"/>
but this Ieſuiticall Spaniſh Cardinal? Who was not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſay to him in Ianuarie laſt, that the thrée Prelates, which were preſent at his Maieſties conuerſion, ſhould be made to come before the Cardinall of <hi>S. Seuerin</hi> chiefe of the Inquiſition, for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for that fact. What a ſhame, what blaſphemie againſt God and his religion, to demaunde abſolution, for the beſt worke, the holieſt worke, the profitableſt worke, &amp; moſt neceſſarie worke that could be done in Chriſtendome? But becauſe it was diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, damageable and hurtfull to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> will euer condemne it, and iudge it worthie penaunce and abſolution. Hereupon it came, that at the firſt bruite of his holy conuerſion, they ſent <hi>Du Puy</hi> from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> at this day their <hi>Prouincial,</hi> to perſwade the <hi>Pope</hi> that it was but a fained matter.</p>
               <q>But now it irketh them that time is ſo farre ſpent and ſo many dartes plucked out.</q>
               <p>How can we doubt to baniſh theſe Murderers, ſeing that ſince the yéere <hi>1550.</hi> (as <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Counſeler of <hi>Meſnil</hi> hath well obſerued it in his plea) when the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> preſented their letters, ſigned in the preſence of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and grounded vpon their admiſſion in <hi>Spaine,</hi> (a goodly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration ſurely) theſe letters were ſimply and abſolutely refuſed by the Court, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the two halfe yéeres. And foure yéeres after, vpon a ſecond inſtancie by the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> the Court would know the opinion of the <hi>Sorbone,</hi> which being aſſembled by foure daies ſpace togither (the holy Ghoſt no doubt being their director and preſident) moued as it may ſéeme by an inſtinct from aboue, reiected them, counting them a moſt daungerous and moſt pernicious companie, for the ſtate of the Kingdome and for Religion, and ſuch as would cauſe many quarels, diuiſions and diſſentions amongſt the French na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And becauſe it may be apparant, that we adde nothing of our owne heads, behold the very wordes of the decrée of <hi>Sorbone,</hi> which in few words, ſetteth downe the miſerie that we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by this new and dangerous ſect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This new felowſhip, challenging vnto it ſelfe the vnwoonted name of Ieſus, ſo loſely and vnaduiſedly without any diſcreete choiſe
<pb facs="tcp:26399:25"/>
receiuing into their fellowſhip tag rag, be they neuer ſo lewde, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and infamous, carying no difference from ſeculer prieſts in their outward habite, in ſhauing of their crownes, in ſaying their canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call houres priuately, or ſinging them openly in the Church, in cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and ſilence, in difference of meates and daies in faſtinges, and diuers other rites and ceremonies, (whereby ſtates of religion are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered one from the other and mainteyned) endowed with ſo many and ſundrie priuileges, licences and freedomes, eſpecially in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrament of penaunce and Euchariſt, and that without difference of places, or parſons, alſo in the office of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading &amp; teaching, in preiudice of Ordinaries, yea of Princes &amp; te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall Lords, againſt the priuileges of Vniuerſities, to the great burden of the people, ſeemeth to be againſt the honeſtie of monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal religion, it weakeneth the ſtudious, godly, &amp; neceſſarie exerciſe of vertues, abſtinencies, cerimonies, and auſteritie of life, yea that more is, it openeth a gappe, to a general Apoſtaſie from other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions: it withdraweth from Ordinaries that ſubiection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is due vnto them, it ſpoileth as well the Lords temporall as the Spirituall of their rights and Iuriſdictions, it bringeth in a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into both pollicies, many quarels amongſt the people, many ſtrifes, diſcordes, contentions, emulations, rebellions, and ſundry ſchiſmes. Theſe thinges therefore diligently weighed and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, this felowſhip ſeemeth to be a daungerous thing for the matter of faith, like to be a worker of the diſturbance of the peace of the Church, &amp; an vtter ouerthrow of monaſticall life &amp; tending rather to the pulling downe then to the building vp of the Chriſtian faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before the effects of their conſpiracies were knowen, we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed much in our Vniuerſitie, ſaying what maner of people are theſe? Are they regulers or ſeculers? for we haue no thirde ſort. They are not ſeculers, becauſe they liue in common, haue a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and to be ſhort, make a vowe of pouertie, and yet haue the whole managing of the goods of their Colledges. Againe, they be not regulers: for they haue no rule, nor faſting, nor diſtinction of meate, neither are bound to any certaine ſeruices, and may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede, though they can not rid themſelues of their oth. They haue
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:26399:25"/>
foure or fiue ſortes of vowes, <hi>Simple, Compounded, Solemne, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete, Publike.</hi> To be ſhort, they make a hurly burly and turne all things vpſide downe, and if you aſke them what they are, they anſwere you, As you ſée.</p>
               <p>We marueiled greatly, I ſay at that time, but now we leaue. And why ſo? Becauſe in a word, they be nether ſecular nor regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. What than? Nothing but verie ſpials of <hi>Spaine,</hi> you may terme them as you pleaſe, they wil not reade, if you will not haue them; they will take what othes you will, onely with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſo, that you will let them alone, to betray at their pleaſure, to play the ſpials, to raiſe falſe bruites amongſt the people, and now for the aduantage of the Spaniard, kindle and blow the fire of our diſſenſions. This is all they demaund, this is their vowe, their profeſſion, their rule, their plottings, their greateſt happe that can befall them.</p>
               <p>It is not the <hi>Sorbone</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> onely that hath condemned them; but in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, the honeſter ſorte perceiuing the plotting of <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Spaniard, oppoſed themſelues againſt this ſect. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what they themſelues doe write of this matter in the life of their <hi>Ignatius,</hi> pag. <hi>149. And afterwardes, vpon the requeſt of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, that his inſtitution might receiue confirmation, the matter was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by the Pope to three Cardinals: who laboured great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it might not be receiued, eſpecial the Cardinal Bartholomaeus Guidicionus, a godly and learned man, and one that did not like that there ſhould be ſuch a multitude of religions in the Church of God, as there be now a daies, mooued thereunto perhaps by the decrees of the Laterane and Lion Counſels: which two Counſels do reſtraine and prohibite the multiplying of new religions, or peraduenture by reaſon of the decay of diſcipline which was much altered and worne out in ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he thought were more fit to redreſſe, then to deuiſe and make new. And thereupon it is reported that he wrote a booke. So that he being of this opinion, ſharpely withſtood ours, and of all men, was the greateſt aduerſarie, that our Societie had, ſome few other ioyned their endeuors to his. How than came it to paſſe that it was receiued, all theſe impediments notwithſtanding? The
<pb facs="tcp:26399:26"/>
promiſe of the fourth vow of expreſſe obedience to the Pope aboue all the Princes of the earth.</hi> Sée what they themſelues write of this matter in the ſelfe ſame Page <hi>144. Whoſe religion, ſhould be the religion of the reguler clerkes, but their purpoſe is to be at the Popes commaundement, and to frame their liues wholly according to that rule, which he had long before deuiſed &amp; ſet downe. Which thing the Pope did willingly giue eare vnto. the 3. of Sept. at Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bure. Anno 1539.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, they were reiected both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italie</hi> by all the greateſt Catholikes which were no Spaniards: vnleſſe peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they &amp; their adherents be ſo impudent as to ſay, that the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> was an heretike in the yéere <hi>54.</hi> when they made that decrée againſt them. As they are ſo impudent to publiſh amongeſt the women of their congregation, that all they which purſue this cauſe, are heretikes that come from <hi>Geneua</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> And were it not, that I, that, now ſpeake had not bin knowen from my childhood, brought vp in the kings Colledge of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and my profeſſion ſo notorious, and my preferment to publike and Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable charges euer the ſince the yéere <hi>80.</hi> and <hi>85.</hi> did not exempt mée too too manifeſtly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their illuſions they would happely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that I was ſent from ſome one of thoſe places of purpoſe to plead againſt them. But who ſhalbe counted a good Catholicke, that ſpeaketh againſt the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> ſéeing they haus cauſed the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> to be pronounced Heretickes by the Inquiſition of <hi>Spaine.</hi> We learne this of themſelues who make their vaunts, that when they ſaw this decrée of <hi>Sorbone</hi> againſt them, they betooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the Inquiſition of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> to cauſe the <hi>Sorbone</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> and their Decrée to be condemned. Sée, (my good Lordes) who ſhould be able to eſcape out of the handes of this brutiſh, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spaniſh Inquiſition, the ſnare laid for all men that oppoſe themſelues againſt the greatnes of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the bloudie ſhoppe of all crueltie, the ſcaffold of all the moſt tragicall, hideous, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſlaughters that can be deuiſed in the worlde: who, I ſay, ſhould be able to eſcape out of the hands of this Inquiſition, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Sorbone</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> is condemned amongſt them? But where
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:26399:26"/>
is this condemnacion? Behold here it is reported in the life of their <hi>Ignatius</hi> pag. <hi>403. Furthermore, becauſe the Decree of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone was againſt the authoritie of the Sea Apoſtolike which hath allowed and confirmed our religion, the Inquiſitors of the faith haue by their Decree forbidden it to be read in Spaine, as a thing that is falſe, and offenſiue to godly eares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may not maruell that the Inquiſition is ſo carefull for the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> for theſe two foundations haue no other marke they ſhoote at, but to eſtabliſh the tyrannie of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> ouer all <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſhall we ſtill continue colde in baniſhing them, that make prouiſions in <hi>Spaine,</hi> againſt all that we can do in <hi>France</hi>? To ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them that giue all the aduiſe they can to our enemie, that kindle all treaſons, corrupt the mindes of all youth, and haue no deſire in the world, but to murder the King? what will you looke for more? weighty enterpriſes, muſt haue ſpéedie diſpatches, no delaies muſt be vſed. Euery man is iuſtly prouoked againſt them, the wound of the miſeries which they haue wrought vs, is yet freſh before our eies. Either this Audience ſhall frée <hi>France</hi> of theſe new Monſters engendred to diſmember it, or if their ſubtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their craftes, the bruites which they caſt abroad, doe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them, I tell you plainly and as lowde as I can, though they haue found ſo much fauour as to haue the doores ſhutte, yet my voice ſhal pearce through to the foure corners of the Realme, and I will yet conſecrate it to the poſteritie that will iudge without feare, and without paſſion, who are beſt Frenchmen, and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to leaue it ſuch a liberty, as we haue receiued from our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I tell you plaine, (and I wil ſtretch out my voice, as lowde as I can) they will doe vs yet more harme, then euer they did. And I know not what will become of our ſtrength, whether it wilbe diſmembred or no, I know not whether our goods and our liues ſhalbe ranſacked once againe or no.</p>
               <q>I conceaue nothing in my breſt but heauie newes.</q>
               <p>The affaires of the world paſſe, and runne away in a moment, the idle Mariners tarie a ſhoare, while the weather is faire. <hi>That Iudgement is the beſt, that vſeth no delaies.</hi> And to what purpoſe
<pb facs="tcp:26399:27"/>
are theſe delaies? To giue them leaſure to come to the marke they ſhoote at, full of alarames, yea full of the blood of the beſt ſort. Tigres and Lions neuer leaue of their cruelty, ſometime they will lie ſtill, and when thou lookeſt not for it, their mitigate fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe becommeth worſe. O that we might be ſo happie all togither, as to enioy our Countrey freed from all theſe miſeries, with no leſſe feruent affections and zelous pietie, then I am mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be earneſt in this cauſe without hatred to any man. My minde can neuer be of from this murderer of <hi>Melun,</hi> and my hart will neuer be at reſt as long as I ſee theſe ſhréeuing <hi>Ieſuites</hi> and eggers on of ſuch murderers remaining in <hi>France.</hi> If they might once be baniſhed, then ſhould I be aſſured, then ſhould I ſée all the miſchieuous practiſes of <hi>Spaine,</hi> broken a ſunder in <hi>France.</hi> All the Brotherhoodes of the name of <hi>Iheſus,</hi> of <hi>Cordon, de la Vierge, de la Cappe, du Capelet,</hi> of the <hi>little Collet,</hi> and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand others would be put out. Then could not the Traitors, that practiſe againſt the State, know to whome they might addreſſe themſelues. For, to goe to the Embaſſadour of <hi>Spaine</hi> there is none amongſt vs: to goe to a ſuſpect perſon, that would quickly be diſcouered; and beſides, the papers and writinges of priuate perſons, fall after there death into the handes of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, but this Society dieth not: and moreouer, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of deuotion, the aſſemblie of this Councell is alwaies co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert. To be ſhort, of an hundred, that ſhall repoſe any confidence in them, you ſhall not finde two amongſt them, that will diſcouer themſelues one to another:</p>
               <q>No man ſhall know this but thou that onely art priuie to my vowes.</q>
               <p>Euen as therfore the Phiſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s leaue nothing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſicke bodies, that may be hurtfull, ſo it behooueth vs to cut of all whatſoeuer it may be that may be an impediment to our libertie. And let vs not be like to them that are ſicke of choler, that will in no wiſe take a medicine to ridde them at once of that humour, and to make them whole: but content themſelues to take away onely ſome part of the humour, that doth diſtaſt them, and in concluſion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:26399:27"/>
pay for it with vſurie of extreame griefe and anguiſhes that cut déep into them. As there are certaine ſauors which cauſe them that haue the falling ſicknes come quickly to themſelues againe, but yet heale them not, they are good for a while, and are no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for the griefe but impediments. No more can the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> be taken to be within the compaſſe of the Kinges declaration, which hath this exception in proper termes? <hi>Forpriſe and excepted the attempt and fellonie committed vpon the perſon of the King, our moſt honourable Soueraigne and brother, and the enterpriſe againſt our owne perſon</hi>: which can in no wiſe be referred to any other but to the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> which ſent the murderer firſt from <hi>Lyons,</hi> and then from <hi>Paris.</hi> Moreouer the ſelfe ſame Edict of the <hi>4.</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill in Anno <hi>1594.</hi> pardoneth none but ſuch as renounce all leagues and aſſociations as well within the Realme as without. Now the principall vow of the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> being to obey their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, who is a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> in all thinges, and the <hi>Pope,</hi> they can by no meanes renounce this aſſociation which is the ſtricteſt in the world, vnleſſe they renounce their ſocietie. To be ſhort, they can not be <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> and receiue benefit by the Kinges edict, which ſaith in an other place, <hi>that ſuch renouncinges and oath of fidelitie muſt be done within a moneth.</hi> Which the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> haue not accompliſhed vnto this day, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhew any act, to ſerue for an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for vs to thinke, that they had any ſuch purpoſe: as in verie déed they be not capable of it, for no man can be liege vaſſal to two Lords.</p>
               <p>There is an old writer ſaith verie elegantly, <hi>What auaileth it to be valiant in the field, and to liue lewdly at home?</hi> Whiles the King is on horſebacke to ruinate, defeat, and put to flight his enemies, and to force townes that hold out headdily againſt him, whileſt he endureth the heate of the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, the could of the Winter, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangereth himſelfe daily in the Warres for our libertie, ſhall wée ſuffer the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> in all his principall Townes, which do nothing daily with their confeſſions but ſtirre vp a thouſands of new ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and hold ſecret counſels of rebellion, and all ſortes of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? As it auaileth not againſt the plague, to be careful of a mans
<pb facs="tcp:26399:28"/>
health, for it ſeizeth one as well as another: So is it to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for Magiſtrates to be carefull to torment themſelues, to trot vp and downe euerie way, as long as the plague continueth in the middeſt of the Town and Vniuerſitie, we ſhal looſe our people by thouſands on a plunge.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> had neuer a fairer day in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> then they had in theſe laſt warres, which they could willingly call the golden world, as <hi>Commodus</hi> did: for they ſaw all other Colledges be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered with their ſtrange garriſon, and ſpoiled euerie day by them, they ſaw all the Scholers with them, and the whole Vniuerſitie brought to the onely Colledge of <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> as it is almoſt at this day. A man would not beleeue what ſlaughters they made in the mindes of theſe yong youths, ſpeaking of nothing in all their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and in all their Themes, but of reaſons why it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to murder the King. And yet the miſchiefe that they haue done in <hi>Paris,</hi> is nothing in compariſon of that, that they haue cauſed to be wrought in other townes.</p>
               <p>To thinke that the intereſt of the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris</hi> is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the encloſure of their walles, that were to ſhoote at a wrong marke, and not to conſider the truth of things as they are: For if you ſtop the ſprings, which make great riuers when they be once ioined together and come into one, they muſt néedes drie vp. Suffer the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> in all the Prouinces, what will become of your Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris</hi> thinke you? And in déed if we compare the high degrée of reputation, which you my Lords, haue ſéene our Vniuerſitie in, with the continuall decay thereof ſince the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> came into <hi>France,</hi> &amp; ſetled themſelues in all Townes from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce Scholers came, and the extreme pouertie, miſerie, and want that it is now brought vnto, readie to yéeld vp the Ghoſt, if by you, my Lords, her Children, ſhe be not ſuccoured in this extremitie: is it not apparant, what iuſt cauſe ſhe hath to complaine, &amp; with what regard you ought to heare her in the requeſt, ſhe now preſenteth to you?</p>
               <p>If the day of our preſeruation be as well welcome to euerie one of vs, as the day of our birth is to our pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſurely the day wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> ſhalbe baniſhed out of <hi>France,</hi> wilbe as faire and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a day as euer was the day of the foundation of our vniuerſitie.

               </p>
               <p>And you, my Lords, that haue this good happe, this rare and wiſhfull bliſſe, to be iudges of this great and important cauſe, lift vp your cogitations, I beſéech you, ſtretch them out euen to the world to come, your name, your memorie ſhall be for euer engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in Letters of Gold, not onely in our Vniuerſitie, but in the heartes of all honeſt men, and in the heartes of all true French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou golden Clio, thou ſuffereſt nothing to periſh, thou ſuffereſt no famous thing to die, reſeruing the monument of old ages, to be laid vp in future Bookes.

               </p>
               <p>Therefore, ſéeing this occaſion is offred you, hold it: and beare in mind, that you are Princes of the moſt honourable councell in the world. Doubt you not but your decrée ſhalbe ſpéedily executed euerie where. The report thereof ſhall no ſooner come to other townes, but they wil vpon the verie inſtant, baniſh from amongſt them all theſe Spials of <hi>Spaine.</hi> They that ſay, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can not make them to depart further then out of the limits of their iuriſdiction, they know not how far the iuriſdiction of this

Court ſtretcheth in ſuch caſes. It hath no other boundes nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, but euen as farre as the point of the Kinges moſt victorious ſword, who will cauſe your decrées of councell to be executed eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the middeſt of <hi>Piedmount,</hi> where his good fortune hath alreadie planted the <hi>Flower de Lys,</hi> ſo farre forth as all the Canons of <hi>Spaine</hi> can not ſhake it.</p>
               <p>The King doth greatly deſire it: can you thinke that he loueth them that ceaſe not daily to make attempts againſt his life? and that haue bin the cauſers of all the miſeries, which his poore people endureth? If you had once ſet downe your decrée, an hundred thouſand men would not be able to empeach thexecution of it: his Maieſtie will haue you pertakers in ſome ſort of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes.</p>
               <q>And following the examples of his Anceſtors, diſgeſteth the factes of the Empire by the handes of his Counſellors and Iudges.</q>
               <p>He hath chaſed the armed and open garriſon of <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of <hi>Paris</hi>: chaſe you, my Lordes, the couert and ſecret garriſon, chaſe that which brought in the other, that cauſed it to ſtay ſo long, and would haue doubled it, if they could haue had but one paſſage vpon the <hi>Oyſe,</hi> at what time they came as farre as <hi>Beuuais.</hi> The time is come though it be latter than is for the honor of the reputation of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> but yet it is ſo ſeaſonable, as it may not be differred.</p>
               <p>Conſider if it pleaſe you, my Lordes, how farre you are come, you haue pronounced the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> giltie of treaſon, and the tyrant of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and his mainteiners which ioine armes with him, common enemies to Chriſtendome. It is well done, play the men, and ſee how farre you are gone: you haue taken the towne of <hi>Paris</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, which they thought to haue ſubiected to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraintie for euer. Nothing in the world gréeueth them ſo much, as that they tooke not away all your liues. Now they make litle account of all of you: if you fall into their handes againe, the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> ſhall not be your priſon, but your graue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet I cannot tel, whether they will vouchſafe you ſo much fauor. God hath this day put power into your handes to make a clere diſpatch, and to break
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:26399:29"/>
in ſunder for euer all their practiſes, and all their intelligences: It will be as good as the loſſe of two battails vnto them, when they ſhall vnderſtand that all <hi>Ieſuites</hi> are baniſhed out of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> O my Lords, let not ſlip this faire, this readie occaſion of deliuering your ſelues from them, which make no other vſe of their learning, then as <hi>Caracalla</hi> did, to be a fit inſtrument to doe miſchiefe. Chaſe away this kinde of people, which haue no fellowes in all ſortes of wickednes: ſo ſharpe witted, ſo readie, ſo bold, ſo craftie, ſo watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in miſchiefe, ſo diligent in wickednes. Againſt whom when you ſhall ariſe, my Lords, to giue iudgement, remember I beſéech you, how eaſie a puniſhment baniſhment is to them that haue ſo great riches in <hi>Spaine,</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> and in the <hi>Indies</hi>: whereas in the yeare <hi>1530.</hi> they had but a ſmall penſion ſent them out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as they themſelues confeſſe. Remember alſo, if it pleaſe you, the loſſe of your parentes, of your friendes and of your goods: of the deſolation of ſo great a Countrey, of the loſſe of ſo many great Captaines, of ſo much braue Nobilitie, of ſo many braue Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers carried away with the furie of our warres, which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies blowed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coles of, as they do yet at this day. And doubt not a whit, but if you ridde <hi>Fraunce</hi> of this poiſon, it will fare with it, as it doth with bodies, which become more healthfull by long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which giue them a more perfect and clere health, then they tooke from them. And in caſe their Counſell commend vnto you the magnanimitie and clemencie of the King, remember you, my Lordes, that it is this King, whoſe bloud they haue euery day in their vowes, his death in their prayers, his murdering in their deteſtable and execrable Counſels. Remember yée, that it is this King from whom they haue laboured euen from their verie foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Ignacius,</hi> to take away part of the Crowne of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and now labour after nothing els, then by might and maine to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> which their deſire is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and vnite to <hi>Spaine,</hi> as they haue done <hi>Portingall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sire, you haue borne too long: you haue too much endured theſe traitors, theſe murderers in the middeſt of your Kingdome. For your owne part, your fame and glorie is gone to the vttermoſt
<pb facs="tcp:26399:30"/>
Empires of all the world: there is no talke nor ſpeach, but of your victories, and of your conqueſtes: and you haue gotten the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of Great for euer, and ſo ſhall it be eternized: your wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful feats of armes, haue filled your handes with palmes, treading vnder the foot of your authoritie, the raſhnes, the diſloyaltie, &amp; the ſpoiles of all your enemies. But, Sire, you are not in the world for your ſelfe alone, conſider, if it pleaſe you, how greatlie the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of your name would be weakened, if it ſhould be found read in Hiſtories, that want of ſmothering theſe Serpents, or at leaſt, driuing them out of your Kingdom, turned in the end to your loſſe, and to the loſſe of all your poore ſubiects after you. Sire, you haue to doe with a patient and froward enemie, who will neuer leaue of his hope and plottinges againſt your ſtate, but when his life muſt end. All the reſt of his ſleights haue failed him, &amp; are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to weak. The laſt remedie that he hath, is to cauſe you to be murdered by theſe <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> ſéeing he can not otherwiſe ſtop the ſtreame of your good fortune. He will haue patience, he wil diſſemble, but ſtill his eie ſhalbe vpon his marke, &amp; as long as his colonies of <hi>Ieſuites</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in <hi>France,</hi> or his aduoiſes, and his packets may be receiued, or his murderers exhorted, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed, houſeled, encouraged, nothing wilbe too hard for him. Sire, if your princely courage wil not ſuffer you to be afraid for your owne perſon, at the leaſt wiſe, take ſome apprehenſion of it for your poore ſeruants. They haue left their wiues, children, goods, houſes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, to follow your fortune: the reſt that remained in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great towns, haue expoſed themſelues to be bouchered by the <hi>Sixteene,</hi> to the end they might open the gates vnto you: And now, Sire, wil you haue no care of your life, to preſerue theirs that is inſeperably ioined to yours? wil you haue no pitie of ſo manie women, ſo manie poore children, which ſhould become ſlaues for euer to the Spaniſh pride and cruelty? Sire, you haue open enemies inough to fight withal in <hi>France, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> defend your ſides from theſe domeſtical murderers: ſo that you remoue them far inough of, we feare not all the reſt. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> can not make vs ſlaues, but by marching through your bloud: the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> his creatures, wil neuer be at reſt in <hi>Fraunce,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:26399:30"/>
vntill they haue ſhed it. Hitherunto the care of your faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants hath ſtopped the courſe of their parricides. But, Sire, if they be let alone amongeſt vs, they may alwaies ſend you murderers, which theſe fellowes ſhall confeſſe and houſell as they did <hi>Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere,</hi> and we, Sire, cannot watch alwaies. It cannot be, but they that ſhoot ſo long at one marke, wil hit it at the length: their blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die mindes, all to be ſmeared yet with the bloud of the death of the late murdered King, whoſe murdering was plotted and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vpon in their Colledge, and their thirſting after the atchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of their attempt vpon your life, giueth them no reſt neither day nor night: but they goe alwaies muſing, alwaies turning, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies trauailing to come to this laſt point, which is the full cup of their deſires, and of the deſires of all the <hi>Ieſuites.</hi> Sire, the conſiderations which they that haue no apprehenſion of féeling of your death, repreſent vnto you on the contrarie ſide, are ſo many euident and manifeſt treaſons. When you haue aſſured your own life, when you haue aſſured the ſtate of ſo many great &amp; mighty Cities by baniſhing the publike counſaile which your enemies haue yet within them, by meanes of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> then ſhall you bee feared on the other ſide the Mountaines: And then, Sire, ſhall you haue that Honour and reſpect done to you, that is due to the greateſt King in all Europe: to the Kinge that hath vppon his head the Crowne of glorie and libertie to be the greateſt King of all Chriſtian people. But as long as ſome haue hope to diſpatch you and all true Frenchmen, through the practiſes, ſleights, &amp; confeſſions of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> you ſhall haue thoſe indignities done to you, that neuer any King of <hi>France</hi> did yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. Sire, you are the eldeſt ſonne of the nobleſt, of the worthieſt, the auncienteſt houſe that is vpon the face of all the earth, all the courſe of your life is nothing but pillers of victorie, but triumphs, but bay trées, but victories which you haue gotten of all them that durſt lift vp an hand againſt you: All prophecies call you to the ſeigniorie of the world, and now what are theſe people, who are theſe traitors, who are theſe baſtards of <hi>France,</hi> that goe about to put into your head fears to offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a ſtranger, to the end you ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:26399:31"/>
retein theſe murderers, that ceaſe not to practiſe againſt your life. Sire, the Kinges of <hi>Fraunce</hi> haue bin accuſtomed to giue lawes to others, and not to take any. The great God of battailes, that hath led you by the hand hitherunto, preſerue you to farre greater thinges then theſe are: But Sire, diſpiſe not the good aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he giueth you, and baniſh with theſe murdering <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,</hi> all thoſe, that building their fortune vppon your Tombe, will labor by all the meanes they can to kéepe them ſtill within your Kingdome.</p>
               <p>I conclude, that it would pleaſe the Court, to cauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Vniuerſitie to be recorded, and to Decrée that all the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> of <hi>France</hi> voide and departe the realme, territories, and Countries vnder the obedience of his Maieſtie within fiftéene dayes after notice giuen, which ſhalbe done in euery one of their Colledges or houſes by ſpeach to one of them for all the reſt. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and in default of ſo doing, and in caſe any of them be found in <hi>France</hi> after the ſaid time, that forth with, and without any formalitie of proceſſe, they ſhalbe condemned as guiltie of Treaſon to the higheſt head, and hauing enterpriſed againſt the life of the King.
