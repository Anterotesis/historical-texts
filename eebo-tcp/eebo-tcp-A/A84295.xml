            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT The ſaid <hi>Iohn Pine</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1642. upon the intreaty of divers honeſt faithfull <hi>Parliamentiers,</hi> tooke charge of above five <hi>hundred Horſe and Foote,</hi> well armed, and defirous to oppoſe the <hi>Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Array</hi> then at <hi>Wells;</hi> in their way thither near <hi>Marſhalls Elme,</hi> appeared ſixty of the enemies horſe, with whom the ſaid <hi>Mr. Pine</hi> deſired to parley for his paſſage, and did above one hower parley with two or three of them, and withdrawing from them, the ſaid <hi>Pine</hi> ſpurres up and fled firſt of all: whereupon the reſt followed; which the Enemy perceiving, ſome 12. of them came down the hill, killed one Man, wounded many, and tooke divers Priſoners; whereby the <hi>Parliament</hi> was exceedingly diſhonoured, their partie extreamly diſhartned, to the great prejudice and dammage of the Kingdome. To which wee could add, his baſe running from <hi>Sherborne Hill,</hi> his trembling fear of <hi>Hartfords</hi> forces in their way to <hi>Mynhead,</hi> keeping two troops of horſe for the guard of his own perſon in the Towne of <hi>Taunton,</hi> ſuffering the Enemy to paſſe by, which if he had but followed, the Warrs in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> had by all probability been ſoon ended, which after, through his <hi>cowardiſe,</hi> and <hi>treachery</hi> coſt ſo much Blood and Ruine.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Aprill</hi> 1643. The ſaid <hi>Iohn Pine</hi> taking to him ſome of his freinds of the <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> did promiſe and undertake to defend the <hi>Weſterne</hi> parts of that <hi>County:</hi> and thereupon, he and they did draw together, Liſt and Arme neare <hi>ſix thouſand men,</hi> moſt Horſe, well-affected and ſtout men, and raiſed great ſumms of mony (fourteene thouſand pound on one accompt;) fortifyed <hi>Taunton,</hi> and <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> and had Armes, Ordnance, and Amunition ſufficient: That contrary to the deſires of the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> the earneſt requeſt of the ſaid Towns of <hi>Taunton,</hi> and <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> his own former promiſes, and the truſt the Country had repoſed in him, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Pine</hi> run away with the Countries mony before the Enemy (not halfe ſo many) came within twenty miles of him, deſerting both thoſe <hi>Garriſons,</hi> and all thoſe Well-affected perſons, that had ingaged in armes, left the whole Country to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Plunder of the Enemy, to the exceeding dammage of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and above five hundred thouſand pounds to that particuler County, notwithſtanding he had under his command a very conſiderable ſtrength, and good aſſurance of ſpeedy releif, in caſe the Enemy ſhould come that way, which they never intended, till they heard the ſaid <hi>John Pine</hi> had baſely deſerted <hi>Taunton,</hi> and after that <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> both which he cowardly left and betrayed to the Enemy.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That the ſaid <hi>John Pine</hi> was the firſt <hi>Incendiary</hi> (that ever we heard of) between the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as by his <hi>Speeches, Reports,</hi> and <hi>Letters,</hi> ſent from <hi>London</hi> 1644. and diſpearſt amongſt us, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: and therefore ought by our <hi>Covenant,</hi> to be <hi>brought to condigne puniſhment:</hi> as alſo for making factions and parties among the people in the <hi>County,</hi> and elſewhere</p>
            <p n="4">4 That the ſaid <hi>Iohn Pine</hi> with ſome of his confederates of the <hi>Committee of Somerſet,</hi> to wit Colonell <hi>Ceely, Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, Cliffe, Morgan, Engliſh, Trevilion,</hi> and two or three more of meane quality; have acted in an arbitrary and opreſſing way, by <hi>impoſing Taxes, Leavying Monie; rayſing and Quartering Souldiers, fining many well-affected perſons,</hi> by his and their own power and will, without <hi>Ordinance</hi> or <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> taking Sequeſtrations off at his pleaſure, from the greateſt <hi>Malignants,</hi> and ſequeſtring and impriſoning divers faithfull men to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> without cauſe, to the great diſhonour, and diſſervice of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ſequeſtred others without <hi>Articles,</hi> or admitting them to make their juſt defence, or convicting them by <hi>legall</hi> proofs, according to the <hi>Ordinance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 That the ſaid <hi>Iohn Pine</hi> hath ordinarily forced men to an Oath <hi>Ex oficio,</hi> and <hi>ſworne</hi> them not to diſcover to any whatſoever Queſtion ſhall be asked them; and many times in concernments of <hi>meum &amp; tuum:</hi> and uſually at the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,</hi> ſitts alone, as a <hi>Committee</hi> himſelf, in his Chamber, and there makes <hi>Orders,</hi> and then ſends then to his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Committee to ſigne.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That the ſaid <hi>Iohn Pine</hi> hath in an arbitrary way, out of meere ſpleene and malice, undone many religious and well-affected perſons of that <hi>County,</hi> inriched many wicked and Malignant perſons imployed under him, mutinouſly and ſeditiouſly by power carried and indeavoured to carry <hi>Elections of Parliament men</hi> for his favourites, and wilfully diſobayed many <hi>Orders, and Ordinances of Parliament,</hi> to the loſſe of the lives, and ruine of divers perſons: and when we hoped for peace by the late Treaty, whilſt it laſted, he declared in the Country, <hi>that the Parliament ſhould make no peace with the King, but that the Kings life ſhould be taken from him:</hi> And for that purpoſe, he and his confederates have liſted and raiſed divers new forces without the authority of <hi>Pá<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">7 That the ſaid <hi>Iohn Pine</hi> and his <hi>confederates</hi> of the ſtanding <hi>Committee,</hi> have <hi>Monopoliſed</hi> the power of the <hi>Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee</hi> into their own hands, refuſing to ſit, and adjourning the Committee, when others of the Committee have come to ſit with them: rented Sequeſtrations in their owne, and others names, and bought ſequeſtred goods, at undervalues, to the great defrauding of the ſtate: diſpoſed of the ſtates monies and goods to one another, and their agents, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Ordinances of Parliament, to the great prejudice and loſſe of the ſtate; refuſed to give accompt of the monies Land and Goods ſequeſtered and received by them, according to the <hi>Ordinances and Orders of Parliament,</hi> and by indirect means and underhand practices, cauſed divers <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>County,</hi> to be unduly put out of the <hi>Commiſſion of the peace,</hi> and others of his owne confederates (leſſe able and inſufficient for ſuch a truſt) to be put into their places; And the ſaid <hi>Iohn Pine</hi> hath likewiſe contrived and fomented divers ſcandalous and <hi>ſeditions Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Country,</hi> and ſent them up in the Counties name, to the Commons houſe, to promote his own, and his <hi>confederates deſignes,</hi> to murther the King, diſinherit the Prince, alter the government and lawes, when as the <hi>Countie</hi> diſclaimed, and proteſted againſt them as <hi>impoſtures and forgeries. For all which</hi> Treaſons, <hi>and high miſdemeanours wee humbly pray, that the ſaid</hi> Iohn Pine <hi>and his Confederates of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, may be forthwith apprehended and brought to ſpeedy juſtice, and execution, by all true patriots to their Country and this Kingdome.</hi>
