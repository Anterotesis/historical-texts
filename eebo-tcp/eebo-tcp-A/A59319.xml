            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Ought to implore Pardon for daring to throw my ſelf at Your GRACES Feet, did not the Occaſion warrant the Ambition, and the Glory of the Subject conſecrate the Poëm I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent You. Thus whilſt I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to pourtraict the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Earl of <hi>OSSORY,</hi> how faintly ſoever I have perform'd it, yet I have this Security on my ſide, that this Worthleſs Mirrour will receive that Luſtre from the Bright Image that fills it, that methinks with that Name for my Authority, I make my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the Great Duke of <hi>ORMOND,</hi> as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Romans</hi> made their Entrance to the Temple of Honour, which was through that of Vertue. But in the Commemoration of his tranſcendant Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, I am got ſo far into ſo ample a Field, that 'tis impoſſible for me to take a Proſpect of his ſplendid Gallantries, without ſurveying their ſacred Source, Your GRACES Elder Glories.</p>
            <p>'Twas in our late Civil Wars, an Age which I may call the Libertines Carnival; when Treaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion play'd the Frantick Revellers: 'twas then
<pb facs="tcp:50756:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the famous Duke of <hi>ORMOND</hi> laid his firſt Foundation for Immortality, reſolved to drein at once his Veins and Fortunes, in a Cauſe Divinely Glorious. But in vain your GRACES infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted Treaſures; with your own perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in Arms, bent their whole force to oppoſe that Torrent, which Providence had ordain'd ſhould meet to ſtop. Heaven had decreed the <hi>State-Hydra</hi> ſhould be Invincible, and even an <hi>Herculean Labour</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.</p>
            <p>'Twas then, 'twas then, that <hi>England</hi>'s Royal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr fell, and by a Stroke ſo univerſally deplor'd, that all the Buſineſs of ſuch ſurviving Loyalty as the Duke of <hi>ORMOND</hi>'s, was either to Revenge his Murder'd Maſter, or ſet in Bloud, and make a Ruby in his Crown of Martyrdome. But as the firſt was predeſtin'd to be Impoſſible, ſo Heav'n would not permit the laſt, but gave Your GRACE this Recompence for all your Indefatigable Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in the Loyal Cauſe, that you ſurvived to ſee the Reſtoration of our bleſſed Soveraign; and by a Turn ſo Miraculous, that what was an Age in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying, was recover'd in a Day; whilſt Heaven appeaſed our troubled World with as much Eaſe as it ſpoke the Creating Word that form'd it: And Rebellion that had ſo long miſled our Sun, like <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eton,</hi> was by the <hi>Thunderer</hi> daſht from its Seat, whilſt our Returning CHARLES ſtept in, and in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reaſſum'd his Light and Throne. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie day Your GRACE juſtly lived to ſee, and acted ſo great a Part in the Univerſal Triumph, that after Your Honourable Exile, and the long Sequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo prodigious an Eſtate, You attended his Majeſties Coronation with Your Shatter'd For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, like ragged Enſignes, at once both Ruinous and Glorious too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50756:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nor muſt Your GRACE'S unwearied Services to Your King and Country finiſh here: for after the unexampled Honour of four ſeveral Commiſſions for the Government of the hard-neckt Stubborn <hi>Ireland,</hi> Your GRACE has render'd Your ſelf rather the Founder than the Viceroy of a Kingdom, whilſt by Your unfadom'd Depths, and incomparable Conduct, You have made that a Jewel in a Crown, which was formerly a Rent-Charge to the Engliſh Diadem; and diſcloſed the profitable Royal Mine without the leaſt Murmur of the People, or even the ſhadow of an Oppreſſion; whilſt holding out Your Powerful Scepter in this bold Enterpriſe, like the old <hi>Moſaick Rod,</hi> You have ſtemm'd all Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and paſt through that Great but hazardous Office on ſafe and ſolid Ground, where all Your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening Competitors have been overwhelm'd or loſt.</p>
            <p>Thus whilſt my elevated Thoughts have often rais'd me to the Contemplation of the Glorious Duke of <hi>ORMOND,</hi> and the no leſs Glorious Earl of <hi>OSSORY,</hi> two ſuch Worthies in one Age, and in one Family, I cannot but think their Noble and Heroick Mindes could not have a leſs Original than the Tranſmigrated Spirits of a <hi>Philip</hi> and an <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> That reſtleſs and daring Courage ſhone in the Son, and that ſolid Prudence and Judgment in the Father; that one had a Soul fit to Conquer a World, and the other to Govern it.</p>
            <p>But now, my Lord, with how great and how juſt an Adoration ſoever I have offered this pious Duty to the Immortal Memory of the Valiant and Loyal <hi>OSSORY,</hi> never was ſo unhappie an Altar rais'd, or ſo unwilling an Oblation paid. For had the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited tendereſt Wiſhes of all Mankinde prevail'd, <hi>England</hi> had ſtill enjoy'd her <hi>Champion,</hi> and <hi>ORMOND</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50756:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his <hi>OSSORY.</hi> This Pious Theme ſhould then have been the work of later Hiſtorians, and enricht the Chronicles of Remoter Ages. Then how nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous had his great Atchievements been, and how much more Voluminous had his Recorded Glories ſwell'd, had Providence thought fit to have leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd out his Life to the Performance of thoſe Wonders which the World ſo juſtly expected from ſo promiſing a Greatneſs. But now, alas, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Early Setting, his too untimely Fate, he that writes his ſhining Character, as dazling as it is, yet comes ſo ſhort of what Nature, by his daily riſing Growth, deſign'd it; that we regiſter his Memorials but as the Famous <hi>Sibyl</hi> publiſht her Prophecies; when of her Nine ſacred Folio's ſhe left but Three. Her malicious hand that committed the other Six to the Fire, was leſs ſpightful to the World than that Fatal Deſtiny that brought an <hi>OSSORY</hi> to his Grave. His Race of Honour was ſo ſhortned, that his Miracles come forth no leſs curtaliz'd than her Oracles.</p>
            <p>And now, my Lord, if ſo weak a Pen as mine, has ſo unworthily preſumed on ſo ſublime a Treatiſe, I beg Your Grace would be pleaſed to impute it to an Impulſe that was wholly Irreſiſtible. His Match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Vertues were ſuch, that, in ſpight of Nature it ſelf, have made an Enthuſiaſt. And if the Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too humble for the Divinity it celebrates, let my Zeal expiate for my Boldneſs; and my Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for that Great Man, make ſome part of an Atonement for,</p>
