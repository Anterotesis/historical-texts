         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Here humbly offer into your Royal Hands a Meſſage ſent from Heaven for your Majeſties acceptance. Written it is in the myſtical Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Two Diſeaſes, and partly upon your Royall Hands, which now heal one of theſe Diſeaſes, and ſhall do the other. The ſignification whereof in ſumme is to ſhew, How miſerable your Kingdomes have been through want of your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Father firſt, and ſince of your Majeſty; How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py theſe your Dominions ſhall moſt certainly be
<pb facs="tcp:55875:3"/>
made by your Religious, Juſt, and Merciful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and laſtly, what ſhall be done by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for you here upon the earth, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of your Royall Fathers our Late Soveraigns precious blood, your Majeſties Wrongs and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, your Conſtancy in the true Religion againſt ſo many Temptations, your Maintaining of the Honor of God in your religious care of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and your Compaſſion and Love toward your Majeſties poor oppreſſed Subjects. Nor let it ſeem more ſtrange unto your Majeſty, that Diſeaſes ſhould portend ſuch great matters, than a Star, that Star, which with the next riſing Sun after your joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Nativity, ſhining with the glorious Sun as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in his aſcenſion, and even at mid-day, ſhould deſigne your Majeſties Perſon, and future Glory, which undoubtedly it did. For there is a ſimilitude and proportion betwixt ſins and calamities on the one ſide, and bodily Diſeaſes on the other; for both diſquiet and diſeaſe us; as likewiſe therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the healer of the one, and the taker away of the other.</p>
            <p>Far be it from me, Gracious Soveraign, to require from your Majeſty credit to what I ſhall affirm (nor is it juſt I ſhould) upon my bare aſſertion. Let your Majeſties Reaſon and Royall Wiſedome
<pb facs="tcp:55875:3"/>
judge, whether that I deliver be probable or not. For ſuch Reaſon as is groſſe and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or meerly Naturall, cannot pierce into thoſe deep matters, but ſuch which is fine, and yet helpt and directed by rule of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For Ignorance, Prejudice, and Raſhneſs cannot, and Intereſt will not diſcern theſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</p>
            <p>Let not the meanneſs of the diſcoverer diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the truth of theſe things to your Majeſty, which may call to minde, that the glad tidings of our Saviours Nativity was by the Angels firſt made known to Shepherds.</p>
            <p>If I ſhall ſpeak (Royal Soveraign) in ſome places very freely, or peradventure too boldly, give me leave, or pardon me, Merciful Prince, who being a great King, cannot but be very ſenſible what a crime it ſhould be for a credited Meſſenger to temper the Meſſage of the King of Kings.</p>
            <p>It now remains, that theſe things which are to come be beleeved, that Almighty God be entreated, and have the Glory of all; on your Majeſties part, that you prepare your ſelf for the embracing ſo great Hopes; on your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that we all repent, and with humble thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for ſo great mercies toward us, our Love
<pb facs="tcp:55875:4"/>
and Reverence toward ſo bleſſed a Prince our Soveraign be encreaſed. And that all this may be done, is and ſhall be the continual prayer and earneſt endeavour of,</p>

            <p>IT is now twenty years ago ſince when this formerly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Kingdom divided into parties, that I alſo clave in my opinion to one (for who could do otherwiſe?) even to that ſide, which ſo much pretended to the love of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Juſtice, that theſe and not ſelf-love was their end. What I did was altogether from the firſt to the laſt peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which notwithſtanding, the diſtinction ſpoiled my aged Father for the ſame cauſe and myſelf of our goods and quiet habitation. We bare it patiently. But this Virgin Aſſembly quickly forgat the guide of her youth (although ſhe ſtill <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped her mouth,</hi> and ſaid; She had <hi>committed no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil)</hi> to the <hi>neglect</hi> and <hi>perverting</hi> of all <hi>Juſtice.</hi> And here I left them.

            <p>LEſt I ſhould incur your blame for not preſently falling upon the main work, in ſhewing you inſtantly, how the <hi>REKETS</hi> and <hi>KINGS-EVIL</hi> foreſhew and declare the promiſed things, and that I may not juſtly deſerve worſe, in telling you ſo great a Paradox, having not firſt made known unto you, how ſuch a matter may be done; I judge it here fit to let you know that I have prepared this other as a better way, which may by Gods aſſiſtance bring you to a fuller and clearer view of whatſoever is pretended in the Title, if you enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and go along orderly, as it here lies before you.</p>
            <p>IN old time when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and afterward when <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> dwelt in their own land, and when the Jews were carried into <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Almighty Lord was wont to ſend them Prophets in evil and ſinful times, Prophets ſo inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his Spirit, that they knew infallibly, and did ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that people moſt certainly, what things, both good and bad, and how they ſhould befal them; that their oppreſſors and the wicked might not live ſecure, nor the oppreſſed and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous be diſcouraged. But in a ſhort time after our Saviours Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, ſuch Prophets which were thus miraculouſly inſtructed ceaſed to be among men. By which difference of the times, thoſe from theſe, it might at firſt ſeem, either that God loves not the Chriſtians ſo tenderly as formerly he did the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> or (at leaſt) that the Chriſtians now adays have no need of ſuch forewarnings as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were wont to have. Divine and miraculous premonitions were ſo uſuall to them, that they accounted it, and complained of it as an affliction, when they wanted them. This appeareth true from the words of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55875:6"/>
               <hi>Aſaph,</hi> a man left in <hi>Judea,</hi> when the reſt were carried into <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> complaining of the want of a Prophet, and Signes (which they were formerly accuſtomed unto) to declare and foretell how long their captivity after the preſent deſtruction of the City and Temple was yet to laſt. For thus he ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſa. 74. 9. We ſee not our Signes,</hi> there is <hi>no more any Prophet, neither</hi> is there <hi>among us any that knoweth how long.</hi> Albeit <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet had formerly propheſied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them of 70 years captivity, and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> were both now in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and did propheſie. Whereby it appeareth, as I ſaid, that <hi>Aſaph</hi> was left in the land, and that he ſpeaketh of the remainder of the Jews which were left in the ſame place with him, and laſtly, that this Pſalm was written after the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Concerning the difference of thoſe old times before our Saviours coming from theſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſhould grant it true, and we muſt grant it to be ſo in ſome kind, touching Prophets, yet is the Aſſumption falſe to conclude from thence; That God loves not the Chriſtians ſo tenderly as formerly he did the children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for how little ſoever the Lord loveth any of his children, he account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and nameth them his Jewels, and is as tender of them as of the apple of his eye, who ſpared not his onely and beloved Son, but gave him to dye for the leaſt of them all. But this is an ineſtimably greater favour then to premoniſh and forewarn them of that which is to come; a thing which he hath done even to his greateſt enemy the devil (though for a different end from that for which he forewarns his children) letting him know his ſecret counſel touching <hi>Saul</hi> and his Sons. For did not the Lord reveal unto Satan, that <hi>Saul</hi> and his three ſons ſhould be ſlain (even as it came to paſs, and the Spirit told <hi>Saul)</hi> the day following? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 19. And while we conſider, that the Lord is unchangeable in his love, For he is not a man that he ſhould repent, this cannot be the cauſe, want of Gods love, that Chriſtians are without divining Prophets. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55875:6"/>
place, as little reaſon is there to ſay, That we which are Chriſtians have no need of forewarnings of our ſuffering, nor of our deliverance. As if the oppreſſions in <hi>Egypt</hi> were more than under the Pope, and theſe not ſeven-fold greater then thoſe; as the burning in a fiery furnace or in fire than making and burning of brick by, and in ſuch a place; or the thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the body greater then of the ſoul; or the length of the captivity under <hi>Pharaoh</hi> which laſted not in all two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifteen years, more tedious then under Antichriſt, who began to reign above a thouſand years agoe.</p>
            <p>Whereupon neither of theſe two Cauſes being to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, want of love from the Lord toward his people, and no need of Premonitions, and likewiſe neceſſarily admitting, and confeſſing it to be truth, Fully illuminated, and infallibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Prophets have not been found (and are not now to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected) much after our Saviours leaving the earth, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth us to enquire after the reaſon of this thing. Of which by Gods grace I find there are Two Cauſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Why we may not look for ſuch Prophets in theſe times which are fully illuminated and infallible, is the End and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration thereof, for which ſuch Prophets were ſent by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for the information of his people, which being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and come and paſt, that which points to that end is not neceſſary any longer. Such Prophets were inſtituted to be forerunning Types and Figures of Chriſt, thereby to ſignifie that there was a Prophet to come after them like unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but greater, who ſhould fully and infallibly know the Lords mind and counſels. For thus ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> of our Saviour who was to be exhibited in the fleſh, and making himſelf the Type of Chriſt, <hi>Deut. 18. 15. The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet from the midſt of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me, unto him ye ſhall hearken.</hi> In reſpect of whom, ſome, though not all of the Prophets, had power, at ſome, not at all times, to work certain Miracles, and alluding to this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55875:7"/>
it is ſaid, The Prophets were unto <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Prophets were more fully enlightned before our Saviours coming, than in theſe times there can be found any, for another cauſe, even for their ſakes to whom their Prophecies and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages were ſent, that is, becauſe of the people. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were ſent principally to call men to repentance; thus ſpeaketh the Lord, <hi>Jerem. 7. 25. Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day, I have even ſent unto you all my ſervants the Prophets, daily riſing up early, and ſending them,</hi> V. 26. <hi>Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined their ear, but hardened their neck, they did worſe then their fathers.</hi> The different condition of the people therefore is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe, why the old Prophets were more enlightned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, then the Prophets or Preachers, which now are (for ſo are Preachers called by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul)</hi> or neceſſarily are required to be. In thoſe old times the underſtanding of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning God and heavenly things was very ſmall; witneſſe the Apoſtles themſelves, who were converſant with Chriſt, when <hi>Peter</hi> reproved our Saviour ſpeaking of his ſuffering death, telling his Maſter, that this ſhould not befall him; that he ſhould not dye. Yea, the Lord threatens his people blindeneſs of mind, and ſtupidity of underſtanding grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then formerly they had, by the mouth of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> calling it <hi>fatneſs of heart;</hi> for fat is inſenſible. For which cauſe if the Prophets ſhould not have ſhewn before their eyes great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull matters, they would not have beleeved; and if ſuch Prophets had not alſo had extraordinary knowledge, they would have wanted a guide, if they had not alſo been indued with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, the people would certainly have fallen into errours. And notwithſtanding all this, ſcarcely did they then beleeve the Prophets. For how ſoon had they forgotten the miracles which <hi>Moſes</hi> did before them? when being told more then once, that God had promiſed to bring them into the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to give it them for a poſſeſſion, after that he had performed his promiſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55875:7"/>
in bringing them out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had led them by a pillar of fire and a cloud, yet being purſued by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> they murmured againſt the Lord, beleeved not his ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding they ſhould be then ſlain by the <hi>Egyptians, Exo. 14. 12. Iſaiah</hi> who was ſo far acquainted with the Lords mind, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly told King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> as a ſigne which was required by the king, by the going back of the ſhade of the Sun on the Diall of <hi>Ahaz</hi> ten degrees, the recovery of the king, and the lengthening of his life fifteen years, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. yet complaineth the Prophet that what he propheſied was neither underſtood nor beleeved, <hi>Iſa. 53. 1. Who hath beleeved our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> Likewiſe when <hi>Jeremiah</hi> propheſied to the Jews, and what he foretold of their captivity came fully to paſs, then falſe Prophets which propheſied of their ſudden return were more credited by the People. For that remnant of the People which was left behind by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after thriſe carrying them away into <hi>Chaldea,</hi> the firſt in the third year of <hi>Jehojakim, Dan.</hi> 1. 2. the next in <hi>Jehojakims,</hi> the third in <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jachins</hi> reign, and with him, plainly did not beleeve <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> nor <hi>Ezekiel</hi> propheſying unto them the deſtruction and burning of their City and Temple, boaſting notwithſtanding that they ſhould not be, nor the City any more taken, calling <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Caldron, and themſelves the fleſh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 3. concluding thereby, that the City was made for them, and they for the City, ſo as that they ſhould not be parted.</p>
            <p>So for the Neceſſity of the work, that the children of God might have a firm foundation on which their faith ſhould be built, the Holy Pen-men of Scripture were fully inſpired by God, ſo as no word in Holy Scripture written by the Prophets and Apoſtles is there found which God did not miraculouſly inſpire into the mindes of thoſe Holy men. Concerning his Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts Chriſt promiſed, that they ſhould be guided into all truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13. and <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>That no Prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation;</hi> whoſe meaning is not,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55875:8"/>
as the Papiſts pretend, That no private or ſingle perſon may expound the Scripture; nor as it is by us commonly expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That every Pen-man of the Books of God was inſpired by Gods Spirit, and wrote not his own private conceits; but this, <hi>No Prophecy of the Scripture,</hi> ſo called becauſe it contains the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's counſel, <hi>is of any private interpretation;</hi> not only as it is <hi>free from the mixture of humane inventions, which are contrary to the mind of God, but there is not one word therein nor ſyllable which was not dictated unto them by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And this is fully to my purpoſe. For we know that the Scripture is the Word of God, and he that expoundeth and applieth it as he ought, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing but the Word of God, but the firſt is of no private, but the other is of private interpretation.</p>
            <p>But for the times which followed, the Lord promiſed they ſhould be ſuch, as that in them old men ſhould dream dreams, and young men ſhould ſee Viſions, and that their Sons and their Daughters ſhould propheſie, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 17. and that their ſervants and handmaids ſhould have Gods Spirit poured upon them, <hi>Joel</hi> 12. 29. ſignifying that in thoſe times which began ſooner after our Lords Aſcenſion, and now are, very ordinary and mean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould have ſuch an extraordinary meaſure of Divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge exceeding the foregoing ages, as that they may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all Prophets and Propheteſſes. But <hi>Daniel</hi> declareth in what manner and by what means this great knowledge ſhall be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thereby expounding what the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> and out of him S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Dan. 12. 4. Many ſhall run to and fro, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall be encreaſed.</hi> Where by running to and fro is to be underſtood Labour and Search, that is, Study. So for that theſe times are within the ages of great light, which as it was promiſed, ſo we have by experience found it fullfilled, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people which are bred up under able Teachers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and which give themſelves to ſearch into the written My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Salvation, are not ſo fat-hearted and ſtupid as not to underſtand, and not to beleeve the Word of God preached unto
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55875:8"/>
them, but are able by Gods Spirit to ſearch the Scriptures, and to diſcern whether thoſe things which are delivered unto them from their Prophets be true or not. And therefore for this cauſe there is no need of a fully illuminated Prophet to be among us, either leſt we ſhould want ſure guides, or be deluded with errors, having both the Old and New Teſtament for our direction, which <hi>ſure word of Prophecy</hi> the ancients were partly or wholly without.</p>
            <p>As for the foreknowledge of things which are to come, there is nevertheleſſe ſtill and will be a profitable uſe and neceſſity thereof; and a part thereof contained in the Viſions which are written in Holy Scripture, and the ſearching of them commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us by the Spirit of God, ſaying, Whatſoever was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in former time was written for our learning, another part in thoſe Signes which God hath ſent and will ſend into the world as miracles to be conſidered by us. For the words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our fully declare, that there ſhould be Signes of things which were to follow in the heavens, on the earth, and in the waters, <hi>Luk. 21. 25. And there ſhall be Signes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars, and upon the earth; diſtreſs of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with perplexity, the Sea and waters roaring:</hi> v. 26. <hi>Mens hearts failing them for fear, and looking after thoſe things which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on the earth.</hi> But to what purpoſe had the Prophecies and Viſions of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and the moſt myſtical Viſion of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of S. <hi>John,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, been as they are left unto us unexpounded, if God had denied wholly unto us a Prophetical Spirit to preſage what was to be afterward, and what was contained in the Holy Viſions? For there is little difference whether the Lord ſends the Viſion to us at firſt, or by them unto us, what he intends to do.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is to be gathered from the fore-named Scriptures by diligently weighing and comparing them one with another, that the diſtinction of the Old Prophets which lived and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied before our Saviours Incarnation (I underſtand Prophets or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55875:9"/>
Seers, moſt properly ſo called, for the other were their ordinary Preachers, as may be collected from ſundry Scriptures, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. 7.) from thoſe which have ſince and now live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, doth conſiſt in two things: 1. In a more full, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, and more infallible Diſcovery of Gods ſecrets unto thoſe old Prophets, for the Cauſes which have been alledged.</p>
            <p>2. In cauſing the Prophets to whom ſuch Viſions came, to underſtand them, either inſtantly, and at firſt ſight of them, or if not with the ſight of them immediatly, yet at leaſt after Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Prayer, all concurring nevertheleſs to declare, that the Revelation of them came immediatly from God, and was not helpt then forward with Study and Labour.</p>
            <p>For the firſt Difference, although S. <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth, that he with the reſt of his brethren knew in part, and propheſied in part, yet is that ſo to be underſtood, as with relation to the more perfect knowledge, and revealing Gods myſteries in the life to come, and partly that we ſhould know, that neither S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, nor the Prophets before him did partake of all Gods minde and counſel. The Apoſtle knew not certainly, whether a beleeving husband having an unbeleeving wife, yet content to dwell with him, ought or ought not to put her away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 12. But for what he did know, and the neceſſary things which were to be known, he and the reſt of the Prophets may be ſaid, according to Chriſts promiſe to his Diſciples, to have all things ſhewn unto them.</p>
            <p>Touching the ſecond Difference, it is evident that <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion which he ſaw, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 1. was immediatly underſtood by him. For <hi>the heavens</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>were opened, and I ſaw Viſions of God;</hi> and <hi>v. 3. And the hand of the Lord was there upon him,</hi> which is, <hi>in that very place, the illuminating Spirit of God was upon me.</hi> Unto <hi>Daniel</hi> the words of the Angel are, <hi>Dan. 9. 23. At the beginning of thy ſupplication the commandment came forth, and I am come to ſhew thee; for thou art greatly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, therefore underſtand the matter, and conſider the Viſion.</hi> This
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55875:9"/>
you ſee was granted upon ſupplication; but in theſe later times, as it is firſt the Lords gift to ſet us to conſider thoſe Viſions which he ſends, it is next the Lords bleſſing upon our labor and ſtudy, or, running to and fro, in making us underſtand them. Nor are ſuch Viſions ſent immediately or conveyed mediately unto us in theſe days underſtood at the firſt inſtant, as then they were, nor much of ſuch Viſions to be underſtood, although in their own nature capable of being underſtood, until a certain time come. I ſhall not need to uſe any other teſtimony hereof then that of <hi>Daniel, Dan. 12. 9. And he ſaid, Go thy way Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, for the words are cloſed up, and ſealed till the time of the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whether now adays God hath ſent Viſions, and Signes of things to come, and what he intends to bring upon the earth, or to acknowledge our Bleſſed Saviours words true, that there ſhall be Signes, &amp;c. or rather that they are not now to be expected, but nearer the end of the world, let us hear the words of that wiſe heathen man <hi>Cicero,</hi> whether it be found true by experience, that God hath ſent forewarnings unto the world of what matters of great moment he intends to do. For to do ſo in behalf of his great love to his children, and their neceſſities is moſt reaſonable. Thus writeth <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his <hi>firſt book De Divinatione, Vetus opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio eſt jam uſque ab heroicis ducta temporibus, eaque &amp; populi Romani, &amp; omnium gentium firmata conſenſu, verſari quandam inter homines Divinationem, quam Graeci</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>appellant,</hi> id eſt, <hi>praeſenſionem, &amp; ſcientiam rerum futurarum. It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>an old opinion derived from thoſe long-paſt forgotten times of the antient Heroes, that there is ſuch a kind of Divination to be found among men, as is the foreknowledge and foreſight of things enſuing, which the Greeks name Prophecy.</hi> This the Philoſopher proving, not from the bare opinion of one or two, nor of all nations, which in ſuch a caſe were little worth; but the opinion being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the particular and concurring obſervations, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all, is to be eſteemed an argument of great moment. For
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55875:10"/>
the ſame <hi>Author</hi> in the <hi>ſame book</hi> a little after addeth, <hi>Gentem qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem nullam video, neque tam humanam atque doctam, neque tam immanem atque barbaram, quae non ſignificari futura, &amp; à quibuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam intelligi, praedicique poſſe cenſeat.</hi> Which is, <hi>I can finde no Nation, neither civil and learned, nor ſavage and barbarous, which is not of this opinion, That future things are not only foreſhewn, but that ſome there be which can underſtand them, and foretell what ſhall come.</hi> This obſervation and opinion grounded thereon, of all nations, I ſhall confirm by the Judgement of an Authour a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt in Profeſſion, yet in his opinion a very Atheiſt, who inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Princes in all kinde of wicked Arts, which may ſerve to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their greatneſſe, even to the mocking of Almighty God, by making a ſemblance of Religion to delude the people, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confeſs, though unwillingly, and againſt himſelf, that Troubles and Wars are ordinarily and miraculouſly foreſhewn to ſuch, whom it concerneth to know them. <hi>Machiavil</hi> is that man who in his <hi>firſt book and 36. Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Diſcourſes upon Livy,</hi> writes in the Italian tongue what ſounds thus in Engliſh, <hi>Great Troubles which are to befall Cities and Provinces are uſually fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told; and this is done, either by certain Signes and Tokens, or elſe by the Preſages of men.</hi> Then afterward he proceedeth in this manner, <hi>As I ſhall willingly confeſs, the Cauſe I am ignorant of, ſo that notwithſtanding the thing is true, it cannot be denied, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples which may be produced both in former and later times, but I muſt acknowledge, that all great Troubles which have befallen any City or Countrey have been commonly foreſhewn and premonſtrated, either by Preſagers or ſome Revelation, or by Prodigies and Signes in heaven.</hi> Who laſtly in the ſame place is driven to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that theſe Premonitions and Forewarnings do proceed from a knowing and Loving Nature, in naming and deſcribing of which <hi>Machiavil</hi> goes no farther then the Heathen which taught him, calling them Spirits and Intelligences. <hi>Unleſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> (ſaith he in the ſaid Chapter) <hi>the air be full of Spirits and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences, which foreſeeing things which are to enſue, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55875:10"/>
at mens adverſities do by ſuch forerunning Signes make them known to men, that they may make timely preparation and defenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, among thoſe which profeſs Chriſtianity, whether they be of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the Reformed Religion, it is a received opinion on both ſides, That God doth give miraculous Forewarnings in theſe days. I ſhall not need name more then thoſe three great lights of the Reformed Proteſtant Profeſſion, Orthodox, Judicious, and Learned, <hi>Calvin, Perkins,</hi> and <hi>Uſsher,</hi> which every one acknowledge what I have ſaid, touching miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Admonitions, the firſt in his <hi>Comment</hi> upon <hi>Mebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> dream; the ſecond, where he adviſeth to examine when a man pretendeth Revelations, whether the man be honeſt which is the relator, and alſo not diſtempered in his mind; the third in his Treatiſe <hi>De Succeſſione Eccleſiarum,</hi> where he maketh mention of the Prodigies which happened about the year <hi>M.</hi> after our Saviour.</p>
            <p>But the ancient Heathen did make ſuch an account of Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, that they inſtituted certain Officers which were named for their number, at firſt <hi>Quinque viri,</hi> afterward <hi>Decemviri,</hi> laſt of all <hi>Quindecimviri,</hi> that is, <hi>the Five, Ten, Fifteen Men,</hi> whoſe office was to perform Rites and Ceremonies, and they were (as <hi>Livy</hi> ſhews) to look after thoſe Portents, by conſulting their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual books for the finding out ſuch Rites and Expiations as might divert the anger of their gods, which they judged thoſe Portents did foreſhew. If the Heathen by the light of naturall reaſon had ſo much knowledge as to judge ſuch ſtrange things muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain myſteries within them pertaining to their Gods, it is a great folly unbeſeeming Chriſtians ſo to be deluded with the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> School, as to attribute all wonderful works whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaven or on earth, either to the workmanſhip of Nature, or to the errors thereof; that School being more athieſt then the unlearned and barbarous nations. To which ſort of men Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of that <hi>falſe-named ſcience</hi> called <hi>wiſedom,</hi> as the name <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:55875:11"/>
ſoundeth, but as S. <hi>Paul</hi> truly ſpeaketh, unduly ſo called in ſundry matters. If you ſhall ſhew a Signe in Heaven or earth, which hath formerly appeared, as Comets, Haloes, Suns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will render you an imaginary and naturall reaſon. If ſuch a Meteor appear as was not heard of before, they have recourſe forthwith unto phanſy, and frame a cauſe in their own brains, of that of which before they never had ſight nor experience, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it muſt be ſo, becauſe they think it ſo. Thus do they make Gods Signes called by Heathen men <hi>monſtra, oſtenta, portenta,</hi> and <hi>prodigia,</hi> which <hi>Cicero</hi> well obſerves, becauſe according to their names they point at ſomething, to be uſeleſs things, and of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at all.</p>
            <p>Others there are many which do acknowledge, that the Lord doth now adays by wonderful Signes premoniſh us of things to come, and doth point at alſo as with the finger ſuch things as we too much neglect, as to bid us regard them, which will hardly conſent, that it is in the power of any man ſince the days of the Prophets and Apoſtles to open the myſteries and untye the rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of ſuch Divine Tokens. Whoſe reaſon is, becauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit hath long ſince departed from the children of men. It will not be ſufficient to return unto their reaſon the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all Nations before-mentioned, gathered from Preſagers, nor yet the Obſervation of <hi>Machiavil</hi> which I related, yet let them conſider what is ſpoken by <hi>Cicero</hi> in his 2. <hi>Book de Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one; Qualis autem iſta mens eſt deorum, ſi neque ea nobis ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in ſomnis quae ipſi per nos intelligamus, neque ea quorum inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretes habere poſſimus? ſimiles enim ſunt dii, ſi ea nobis objiciunt quorum neque ſcientiam, neque explanationem habeamus, tanquam ſi Poeni aut Hiſpani in Senatu noſtro ſine interprete loquerentur,</hi> that is, <hi>What I pray mean the gods by this, if they ſhew ſuch things to us in our dreams, which we can neither underſtand of our ſelves, nor any elſe make us to underſtand? for if the gods ſhew us ſuch matters, which neither we our ſelves can know what they are, nor any other can declare unto us, they do juſt as if Carthaginians or Spaniards
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55875:11"/>
ſhould ſpeak in the Romane Senate without an interpreter.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which the Philoſopher giveth, why Viſions ſent by a Divine Power cannot but be of the nature of things which may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, tends to this purpoſe, to ſhew that otherwiſe the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of ſending them ſuch meſſages were wholly vain; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is true, it being repugnant to the wiſedom of the Almighty to do any thing, much more great and extraordinary things to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But it is clear from Holy Scripture, that ſuch extraordinary Divine admonitions as Viſions are, were therefore ſent from God unto men, on purpoſe that they might be underſtood, and that they might learn by them ſomewhat they knew not, or diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. Theſe are the words of <hi>Elihu Jobs</hi> beſt friend, <hi>Job 33. 14. For God ſpeaketh once, yeatwiſe,</hi> yet man <hi>perceiveth it not,</hi> v. 15. <hi>In a dream in a Viſion of the night, when deep ſleep falleth upon men in ſlumberings upon the bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore it is to be concluded, that it is the fault of men, that Gods Signes and wonders are diſregarded.</p>
            <p>To the reaſon which was objected, the Departure of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit from the children of men, ſo as if for that cauſe we cannot now be aſſured of Gods ſecret Counſils, I anſwer, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have not at this time, as of old it was, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, a full and clear light like unto theirs, there is yet light enough given to men, that will pray for, and ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, for a ſufficient underſtanding of ſuch Signes and Viſions as the Lord ſends in theſe times. The Miniſters of the Goſpel in theſe ages are not indued with that light of knowledge in the waies of God as the Prophets and Apoſtles were, who were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that they ſhould be led into all truth, as befitting ſuch rules as were to be delivered by them for all poſterity, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet is there ſufficient knowledge given unto them, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of faith, and ſalvation of mens ſouls, and this above other men; <hi>Rom. 10. 14. How then ſhall they call on him in whom they have not beleeved? and how ſhall they believe in him of whom they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55875:12"/>
have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> Which Preachers of Gods Word therefore have ſufficient knowledge for the work of the Miniſtry, and building up of the Church their appointed work, as the Prophets and Apoſtles had more light and infallibility in them befitting their buſineſſe. Even ſo, although the infallible Spirit remain not among the Sons of men in all parts of Gods Word, yet is there enough to be obtained for the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient underſtanding of his Myſteries, whether written or ſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly, that is of his word and wonders. For if this be not ſo, to what purpoſe is the accounting of the Number of the Beaſt commended to our ſearch (although ſhewn to <hi>John</hi> alone) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely? <hi>Rev. 13. 18. Here is wiſedom, let him that hath underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing count the Number of the Beaſt.</hi> All in vain were this Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nirion, if we muſt deſpair by any means to attain the knowledge of the Beaſts Number. Although we muſt acknowledge the difference betwixt the knowledge which the Apoſtle had of it, and ours; by him it was preſently ſeen and underſtood, by us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much ſearch, and hardly yet to perfection.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it will undoubtedly be objected and in favour of the former Reaſon, That there are at this day none to be found which can preſage aright of things by any Signes or Wonders whatſoever, nor which do profeſs the knowledge of Gods My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and Miraculous Meſſages, whether of things paſt, preſent, or to come; or if perchance ſome few do, they are all by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant experience found either willful and impudent Impoſtors, or Brain-ſick, or down-right Mad-men.</p>
            <p>Whereunto, paſſing by all thoſe Teſtimonies formerly allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (albeit among the reſt <hi>Machiavil</hi> is not to be deſpiſed, a man neither ſo fooliſh, nor yet of ſo eaſie belief, that he ſhould affirm there were preſagers of future troubles, if haply a wiſe man might judge ſuch preſages caſual) and by <hi>Cicero</hi> comprehended under the general acknowledgement of all nations, I may ſay, there are that think <hi>Savanarola</hi> had a foreſight of ſuch a Propheticall nature in certain things, and ſome alſo of our own nation to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55875:12"/>
have had the like, which I ſhall not name in this place.</p>
            <p>But although I ſhould grant that no man hath been able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Prodigies or Viſions, which we have met with, it doth not therefore neceſſarily imply, that the thing is not to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any man. May a man therefore determine that there was no way to attain the knowledge of the Greek tongue in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe until <hi>Linacre</hi> brought the ſame into this Kingdom, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture there was no man found skilful therein? Some Arts have quite periſhed (if we may believe Authors) which no man yet hath regained, yet we muſt not therefore conclude, that the refinding of them is impoſſible; for it might rather have been thought ſo before their firſt invention. Shall we ſay, becauſe the Natives of <hi>America</hi> are wholly ignorant of the Mathematiks, that therefore thoſe Sciences are impoſſible to be learned by them? For it is not a firm Argument to reaſon from what is not to what cannot be. As little reaſon have we to argue, That Divine and Miraculous Viſions cannot be underſtood, becauſe men every where perſwading themſelves that ſuch ſtrange Signes are natural, ſeduced by the falſe Doctrine of the Peripateticks School which feigneth ſuch cauſes of their generation, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times groſly abſurd, neglect the ſtudy of them, and wonder at it in others. As for thoſe which pretend their Revelations, of which there have been many theſe laſt years, partly mere Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors to fill their bellies, and to get a name, partly men of more Phanfie then Judgement, which ſtrongly imagine what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhould be, and what they much think of in the day, dream of peradventure in the night, and byaſſed by their deſires and hopes give ſuch interpretations to their dreams, which they call Viſions, as ſerve their turns and fit their phanſies, and publiſh them for truths, ſuch men with the Aſtrologians and monethly Prognoſticators, all their foundations being falſe, no man may expect truth from them. In which ſort of men we may plainly diſcern the malice and ſubtlety of the devil, who, as he hath ever been accuſtomed as well by fraud as by force to hinder Gods
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55875:13"/>
Glory, and the good of the Church, and to ſteal honour unto himſelf, doth by waies ſometimes alike, othertimes contrary op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe whatſoever makes for the foregoing ends. At that very time when <hi>Jeremiah</hi> propheſied truth, <hi>Hananiah</hi> a falſe Prophet propheſied lies, to pleaſe the people, and diſcredit the Prophet, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 28. 10, 11. In thoſe days in the land of <hi>Chaldea</hi> unto the Jews did <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> propheſie as true Prophets: But at that time of their captivity how many were there which in that place being falſe Prophets divined lies unto them? For thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 8. <hi>Let not your Prophets, nor Diviners, which be found in the midſt of you deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which you cauſe to be dreamed.</hi> When <hi>Elijah</hi> was a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prophet, and with him <hi>Micaiah,</hi> unto <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. <hi>and</hi> 22. beſide <hi>Zedekiak,</hi> who ſmote <hi>Micaiah</hi> on the cheek for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth, it is apparent that there was a great number of falſe Prophets like unto <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 23. And leſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſhould gain credit to their preaching by working miracles, and propheſying things to come, the devil oppoſeth this work by his Prophets. For then were <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> the Sorcerer, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. a Damoſel having a divining wicked Spirit, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. and certain vagabond Jews, and 7. ſons of one <hi>Sceva</hi> a Jew, Exorciſts or Conjurers, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. Even ſo, leſt at ſuch a time when there is great need, in times of great fears, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and dangers, to be forewarned of the iſſue of things, when the Church of God is in great diſtreſs and greater fears, yea, when Divine Premonitions, Viſions, and Prodigies are found, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil inſtructs and perſwades hypocrites, and crack-brain'd men and women with Aſtrologians to delude ſome, whoſe apparent deceits joyned with the Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> School harden others which are more wiſe, in an obſtinate incredulity to the diſhonour of Almighty God, making them affirm, that no future thing is foreſhewn in theſe days miraculouſly, and that ſuch and ſuch things which indeed are, be no portentous Signes. And which is more, as if it were true, as it is indeed true, that we may expect
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55875:13"/>
in troubleſome times miraculous Signes and Tokens, as well and as much as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> their uſual Signes, the devil hath ſo much prevailed with ſome, that they have feigned that they have ſeen Viſions, ſome of them only that people may wonder at them, others that they may get a little money by publiſhing their falſe Viſions, to the belying of God Almighty (a fearful ſin) and deluſion of the people. Beſides, God hath not granted to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ſuch a meaſure of wiſedom, as if he would, he ſhould be able to underſtand the meaning of Gods ſecret Meſſages, For as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaith, even in Schools we may pick out ſome fit to make Souldiers, others husbandmen. God hath given ſundry ſorts of gifts to ſeveral men, according to the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the diverſity and diſperſing of divine gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. ſaith. <hi>To another</hi> (he giveth) <hi>the working of miracles, to another</hi> (not every one) <hi>Prophecy.</hi> Nor were there under the Law very many preſaging Prophets, much leſs in one place, and at one time.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Davids</hi> time we reade of <hi>Samuel, Nathan,</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> who was called the Kings Seer. In the time of <hi>Eli</hi> the prieſt no Prophet before <hi>Samuel,</hi> and after <hi>Malachi</hi> unto our Saviour there were as few. When thoſe Prophets were moſt in number, ſo much as we have light from Holy Scripture, the Jews for the ſpace of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years the time of their Babyloniſh Captivity enjoyed two in <hi>Judea, Urijah, Jer.</hi> 26. 20 in the days of K. <hi>Jehojakim,</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> under <hi>Jehojakim, Jehojakin</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah;</hi> two likewiſe in <hi>Chaldea, Daniel</hi> from the beginning of <hi>Jehojakims</hi> reign, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the fifth year of <hi>Jehojachins</hi> captivity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their coming out of their captivity, <hi>Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> in both places. By which account the Jews for the ſpace of their captivity in thoſe whole 70 years had but ſix Prophets ſent unto them, and in the time of miſerable afflictions. Now, although I cannot but acknowledge that I have not heard almoſt of any Prophet of future events in theſe times, who hath not been a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver or deceived, or who hath uſed any lawful way to expound
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55875:14"/>
Divine Viſions, ſaving Interpreters of Holy Scripture; whoſe rules, if men would follow them, and adjoyn faſting and prayer after the Prophet <hi>Daniels</hi> example in the like caſes, they would ſome of them uſing the right means undoubtedly attain the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red end. For it maketh no difference, but there is ſtill the ſame way of interpreting Viſions ſent from God and enrolled in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or ſent from him and preſented before our eyes, yet ſo as what I laid down before as a rule be remembred, what the old Prophets underſtood in an inſtant, or ſoon after, and fully, we have it not given to us to finde out, but by labour, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and (uſing faſting and prayer as common to both) not to perfection. Whereunto let this be added, becauſe Chriſtian people are according to promiſe more enlightened in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings then thoſe of old times, thoſe Prophecies and Viſions which are now to be interpreted are by thoſe that hear them expounded, to be examined in the ballance of right reaſon agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Holy Word, when moſt of the old Viſions were to be credited becauſe a Prophet pronounced them who could not lye. For this was appointed to be the touchſtone of a Prophet, the certainty of his predictions in the event, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 22. <hi>When a Prophet ſpeaketh</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to paſs,</hi> that is, <hi>the thing which the Lord hath not ſpoken; but the Prophet hath ſpoken it preſumptuouſly; thou ſhalt not be afraid of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us ſee, ſince the Lord hath uſed in evil and wicked times to ſend among his people Admonitions, and Forewarnings alſo of their ſorrows like as of their deliverances, their captivity in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and going out, their going into <hi>Babylon</hi> and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and when there is no cauſe imaginable why he ſhould not do the like unto us in <hi>England,</hi> if God hath not by immediate and wonderful Meſſages from himſelf, warned us of our ſins, and forewarned us of our afflictions, and what will be the end of them. For the calamities which the children of God have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe Three Kingdomes of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:55875:14"/>
are ſo great, as like and equal to them, never any Nation upon whom the Name of God hath been called, hath undergone by whomſoever, conſidering that monſtrous and univerſal Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland</hi> as the chief part, and the general Injuſtice, and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie in <hi>England,</hi> and ſufferings from our own brethren who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſo frequently love, pity and compaſſion toward us, (a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which we never ſuſpected) the next.</p>
            <p>If therefore the Lord is wont to foreſhew great troubles, is it improbable that he hath forewarned his dear children of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt which ever befell the Church of God? And if all injuſtice be a ſin, and oppreſſion a crying ſin, is it unlikely that the greateſt Injuſtice and Murther that ever was committed (all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces conſidered) ſince the crucifixion of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, the Murther of our Innocent Soveraign Lord King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the firſt, and the revenge thereof ſhould be alſo foreſhewn us? Nor is what I ſpeak concerning Gods foreſhewing of matters concerning the Church ſo ſtrange a Doctrine, and incredible, but that divers Reverend and Learned men have obſerved the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and applied the Events unto the Signes when they have plainly ſeen them fulfilled; among the reſt and above others the <hi>Magdeburg Century</hi> Writers have done it carefully, collecting the Signes and Portents which befell in every age; and while others ſay, That Signes are interpreted when they are fulfilled, implying thereby that they were of that nature that they were capable of being expounded before their fulfilling. Whenſoever ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Signes are expounded, though after their events, God procureth unto himſelf the praiſe of his Providence, Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Power, and Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if we neglect to conſider ſuch Signes we deprive our ſelves of our own mercy, by neglecting thoſe comforts which the Lord of tender mercies ſends expreſly to ſupport his fainting children under the rod of their enemies. For but conſider, if the Signes which are ſent by him to premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, if, as it is in <hi>Job,</hi> man regardeth not, we do not unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fruſtrate the end (I ſay) and ſcope for which they were ſent.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55875:15"/>
As for the end and iſſue of theſe evils in this and in the two other counited Kingdoms, as he hath dealt with other nations; it is not improbable but he hath in his great and endleſs Mercy ſo dealt with us, ſignifying together with their calamities how he would farther and at laſt ſhew himſelf toward them. The Lord unto the ſervitude which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to endure in a land which was not theirs 400 years, doth annex this comfortable news and the iſſue of their captivity, and in a Viſion, that in the fourth generation they ſhould come out thence, and with great ſubſtance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. and by <hi>Moſes</hi> did promiſe them the poſſeſſion of the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> On the contrary, he hath unto the pomp, pleaſures, and delicacies of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> foretold and foreſhewn the burning and devaſtation thereof, and that it ſhall never be built again, by the Type of a Milſtone caſt into the Sea by an Angel, and ſaying, <hi>Rev. 18. 25. Thus with violence ſhall that great City Babylon be thrown down, and ſhall be found no more at all.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is full as likely that Almighty God with our Sins and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows hath foreſhewn, whether he will utterly forſake <hi>England,</hi> and caſt us off, or with our true repentance which he will give us, take away our long continued miſeries.</p>
            <p>Liſten now, O Reader, I bring you glad <hi>glad tidings from a far Countrey,</hi> as cold water to thy thirſty ſoul, but according to the ſenſe of the holy Proverb, that i, ſuch news as have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected theſe twenty years, but hitherto in vain, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſpaired after ſo many changes and fruſtrated expectations; ſaid to be <hi>from a far Countrey,</hi> when they are long in coming, as if from far, and ſo in great danger of miſcarrying, becauſe I tell you what is much feared. And this is ſent thee O <hi>England</hi> from thy merciful God by the hands of him, from whom, conſidering the crimes of too many, undeſerved, in reſpect of ſo many fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of hopes and promiſes made by all others much feared, even by our Gracious Lord King <hi>CHARLES,</hi> through the Power and Mercy of God Almighty reſtoring him unto his juſt and undoubted Right and Inheritance of his Three Kingdomes,

and for the ſakes of that ſmall number who have mourned and do mourn for all the abominations of this Kingdome ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and who have continually ſought the Lord to give us our True and Lawful Soveraign (whom bleſſed be the Lord we now enjoy to the gladding of our hearts) for the eſtabliſhing of Gods own and true Religion and Juſtice in the Land, and for ſhewing Mercy to the poor afflicted and oppreſſed.

This <hi>Elihu</hi> hath taught me, <hi>Job</hi> 32. 21.

And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his ſoul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moſes, neither after him aroſe there any like him;</hi> So ſhall King <hi>CHARLES</hi> II. prove unto us the beſt of <hi>Englands</hi> Kings, and the expreſſe Antitype unto good <hi>Joſiah.</hi> And it is not without example for one eminent perſon to be Type of the other. <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> the Greekiſh King in ſundry chief reſpects (for ſmall and ſingle ſerve not the turn) was the Type of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> For in as many and ſuch, nay more ways doth our Soveraign reſemble <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and how he ſhall expreſs him more exactly in what of his Majeſty in his bleſſed Government we ſhall enjoy, will follow by Gods aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this Diſcourſe. <hi>Joſiah</hi> was named three hundred years before he was born, and by the name <hi>Joſiah</hi> deſigned to defile the altar of <hi>Bethel</hi> by burning mens bones thereon, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 2. which was ſo fulfilled by that King according to the Prophecy, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. 16. So ſhall it be made apparent anon in due place, that King <hi>CHARLES</hi> II. was appointed by Almighty God to the great work of reforming Church and State, (which <hi>Joſiah</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55875:16"/>
did before him) twiſe three hundred years before his reſtoring to his Three Kingdoms, by a plain deſcription of his Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. K. <hi>Joſiah</hi> made a covenant with God, both he and his people, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 34. 31, 32. and he cauſed them to ſtand to it, and he himſelf kept it, ſo hath, and will our Gracious Soveraign. King <hi>Joſiah</hi> was the ſon of a murthered father, ſo was the precious Innocent bloud of our Royal Soveraigns Father ſhed. King <hi>Joſiahs</hi> Father King <hi>Amon</hi> was conſpired againſt by his own ſervants, and ſlain in his own houſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 36. In like ſort our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns Father King <hi>CHARLES</hi> I. was deſigned to death in his Houſe of Parliament, adjudged to death by ſome of his ſervants, and kill'd at the gate of his own Houſe, and all by conſpiracy. But the People of the land (they were the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the Jewiſh Parliament) ſlew all thoſe which conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt K. <hi>Amon,</hi> v. 25. So let the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> imitate them to the full, whom they imitated in this part, which made <hi>Joſiah</hi> his ſon king. So much in this place touching the great Inſtrument of Gods glory and our deliverance ſent from heaven, until I ſhall proceed to make this my aſſertion good touching his Royal Majeſty our Soveraign.</p>
            <p>I have declared and proved unto you how probable it is that Almighty God had given us warnings and forewarnings of theſe our evils, and the iſſue, and do now proceed in order to declare that it is not only likely ſo to be, but ſo in truth and in deed. But here I ſhall firſt admoniſh thoſe that have read thus far, or hear of this Treatiſe, that they prejudge not the thing eſteeming it a Fable, but to follow the advice of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who admoniſheth us not to deſpiſe Prophecy, and not to ſtreighten the word in its due ſignification, as if it were only to be underſtood of preaching, knowing that the commandments of God, according to the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, are exceeding broad, in which breadth many things there are on the right hand commanded, as on the left hand forbidden, which do not at firſt ſight appear. For I cannot but foreſee, that ſome will ſmile at what they reade, whom I adviſe they take heed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55875:16"/>
of contemning that which for ought they or any man living can deny, may all prove true; which if it do, they deſpiſe not me the writer, but him who ſent the Meſſage, who hath told us, That he will not be mockt. Others, no doubt, unwilling to have theſe things fall out true, becauſe it ſerves not their particular intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, will ſhew their teeth, not laugh, at what I have here written, like thoſe Jews which for the like cauſe cenſured our Saviours mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as Diabolical even againſt their knowledge. To theſe and the like men I ſay, they deſpiſe not this but him which ſent it. As for ſuch men who more favourably will call it pretty, and cenſure the Diſcourſe to be the fruit of a melancholike phanſie, if it did extend no farther then to touch the perſon of the Writer, as if the argument were not skilfully enough handled, and no more, all this (I ſay) will be eaſily confeſt by me, but when it pierces to the matter it ſelf, as if it were an argument to play withall, and not rather as it ought to be thought a Diſcovery to be admired, let every ſuch commender know that God deſpiſes ſuch cold praiſes. It was truly ſpoken by <hi>Agellius book 19. c. 3. Turpius eſſe exiguè atque frigidè laudari, quàm inſectanter &amp; graviter vitupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari,</hi> that is, <hi>It is more to the diſgrace of a man to be ſparingly and coldly praiſed, than bitterly and moſt reproachfully to be reviled.</hi> But he that will ponder and well conſider the things which are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhall (I truſt in God) finde the words of reaſon and ſoberneſs, and no melancholy, nor other humour in them at all. The man who is weak of underſtanding, although the book be little, yet is it too big for him to ſwallow; ſuch a one is deſired to lay it by. Let the man of wiſedom and judgement reade it with the ſtricteſt obſervation, and the Lord give him underſtanding. Now to make what I have promiſed to appear true in every part, that as well our ſins and with them our troubles the Lord was pleaſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were in being to make known unto us, as that after all our vexations and afflictions we ſhall be delivered from all thoſe burthens which lye upon us, and that by the hand of our Gracious Soveraign, whom God preſerve, <hi>CHARLES</hi> II. we
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55875:17"/>
ſhall be freed (I ſay) and made a happy people, and that we only may not be thought to reap the benefit of his Royal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what Recompence ſhall accrue from God unto our good King, firſt take a view ſtrictly of <hi>Iſaiahs Prophecy, Chap.</hi> 1. In this Chapter you ſhall finde the ſame ſins to have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then by the Jews, which we labour under at this day, the ſame Hypocriſie and ſin of Murther, by which not only our late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, but divers of his Innocent Subjects have had their blood ſpilt, to the defiling and making guilty too many of this our land. Our great Oppreſſions and Oppreſſors are parallel to thoſe there named in the Prophet. And as they were promiſed deliverance (but that afar off, and not yet accompliſhed) ſo are we, and ours near at hand, through the Mercy of God toward thoſe that fear him, by the adminiſtration of our Good King. <hi>V. 16. Waſh you, make you clean</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>put away the evil of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil.</hi> V. 17. <hi>Learn to do well, ſeek judgement, relieve the oppreſſed, judge the fatherleſs, pleade for the widow.</hi>

            <p>Have not our Sins been ſuch, as that the Cauſe of the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Poor, the Fatherleſs, and the Widow, hath not ſo much as come before thoſe which ſate in Parliament, a Court of the utmoſt redreſs? Or, if peradventute by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied labour and violent importunity they have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far as to be heard, have they judged the cauſe of the Poor and Fatherleſſe, and not perverted their Judgement? and have they pleaded for the widow, and not wreſted her cauſe to pleaſe and favour the rich man? Who is ignorant, that they have not ſo done? And thus complaineth the good Prophet, <hi>V. 23. Thy Princes are rebellious and companions of theeves, every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards; they judge not the fatherleſs, neither doth the cauſe of the widow come unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our great Governors alſo were Companions of Theeves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſuffered us without all remorſe to be robbed or ſpoiled, no great matter of whom, and yet farther; becauſe they took
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55875:17"/>
bribes, by doing whereof they become Thieves fellows, in that they require gifts as a Thief doth a Travellers purſe, or elſe we and our cauſe ſhall fall under them. Of which ſort of gifts, though given ſecretly, and in the boſome, ſome have come to light not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding; and of the reſt we may definitively pronounce, They were Receivers and Expecters of Bribes, becauſe, then them no greater Reſpecters of Perſons in Judgement to be found; as we learn from <hi>Solomon Pro. 28. 21. To have reſpect of perſons</hi> is <hi>not good, becauſe for a piece of bread that man will tranſgreſs.</hi> May we not likewiſe ſay properly with the Prophet, <hi>ver. 21. How is the faithful City become an harlot? it was full of judgement; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs lodged in it, but now murderers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The hypocritical ſervice of God which the Jews performed, conſiſting in outward and formal worſhip, how like was it to our wonted frequent Praying, Faſting, and Thankſ-giving, and the moſt ſtrict enjoyning of reſt on the Sabbath? For the Lord took no pleaſure neither in thoſe, becauſe not proceeding from ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, nor in the outward hypocritical worſhip of the Jews, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>v. 13. Bring no more vain oblations, incenſe is an abomination unto me; the New Moons, and Sabbaths, the calling of Aſſemblies, I cannot away with,</hi> it is <hi>iniquity, even the ſolemn Meeting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the reaſon, for which God did deſpiſe all this, was not the cauſe of the Jews and ours here in <hi>England</hi> all one? expreſſed, <hi>v. 15. Your hands are bloods,</hi> that is, <hi>defiled and polluted with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which people for their great ſins their heavy puniſhment the Prophet expreſſeth, <hi>v. 7. Your Countrey is deſolate, your Cities are burnt with fire, your Land ſtrangers devour in your preſence, and it is deſolate as overthrown by ſtrangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Part of this hath been fulfilled upon the Nation of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, in Fire, Sword, and Famine in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the bloody <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and the other part in <hi>England,</hi> when we were devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by friends and foes in a conſuming war, of our own nation and our neighbours, as if we were eaten up by ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:55875:18"/>
All which ſins of theſe ſinfull Jews, of which the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, as well of the great as of the ſmall, and the negligence of thoſe which ſhould have applied the remedies, and the general deſpair, none hoping for amendment, the Prophet doth Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically deſcribe in the nature of a ſpreading diſeaſe from head to foot, and ſeizing upon the vital parts. For thus ſpeaks the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>v. 6. From the ſole of the foot even unto the head,</hi> there is <hi>no ſoundneſs in it, but wounds, and bruiſes, and putrifying fores, they have not been cloſed,</hi> Heb. <hi>cruſhed, neither bound up, nor mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with ointment,</hi> and before, <hi>ver. 5. The whole</hi> or <hi>every head is ſick, and the whole</hi> or <hi>every heart faint.</hi> Yet to put them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in ſuch a hopeleſs condition of ſin, and ſorrow, when he had before told them in the ſame verſe, <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? ye will revolt more and more,</hi> he foretelleth them of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, and a change from all their wickedneſs and afflictions, by ſending them good Magiſtrates, and taking away wicked men, in the following verſes. <hi>Ver. 24. Therefore ſaith the Lord, the Lord of hoſts, the mighty One of Iſrael, Ah, I will eaſe me of mine adverſaries, and avenge me of mine enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver. 25. And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy droſſe, and take away thy tinn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver. 26. And I will reſtore thy Judges as at the firſt, and thy Counſellors as at the beginning, afterward thou ſhalt be called the City of righteouſneſſe, the faithfull City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which part of the Prophecy, as the Jews eſtate runs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to <hi>England,</hi> as I have ſhewn, and as under the Type of a diſeaſe in the ſame Chapter the Prophet deſcribes allegorically their ſins and ſufferings, ſo hath the Lord God miraculouſly by two Diſeaſes of the body of man deſcribed unto us myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, the people of <hi>England,</hi> and ſuch as reſemble the Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſet down in the Text, our ſins, and our calamities. And as by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> are deſcribed the inſtruments of their wo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of a diſeaſe, no leſſe are the Authors of our miſeries comprehended in the myſtery of the fore-named di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55875:18"/>
and over and above what Perſon ſhall be our deliverer. Obſerve, that it is there ſaid, <hi>ver. 5. Every Head is ſick, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heart faint;</hi> and <hi>v. 6. From the ſole of the Foot even unto the Head, there is no ſoundneſſe in it, but wounds and bruiſes, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying</hi> or <hi>corrupt ſores.</hi> Like unto this Diſeaſe are thoſe Two Maladies, one whereof is called the <hi>Rekets,</hi> the other the <hi>Kings evil.</hi> They are thus alike, the <hi>Rekets</hi> is a diſeaſe of the head, yea, of every head, for it is not that diſeaſe if it be without that Symptome any time; the <hi>Kings-evil</hi> is a noyſome infirmity full of bruiſes, or hollow apoſtemated ſwellings, and ſores which run with filthy mattur.</p>
            <p>But that I may perſwade my Reader, that theſe Two Diſeaſes may ſignifie ſomewhat more, then what all diſeaſes do, Gods juſt diſpleaſure againſt, and puniſhment of ſin, I ſhall ſhew examples of diſeaſes in Holy Scripture, which do plainly confirm what I here affirm of theſe. One of theſe diſeaſes is mentioned, <hi>Exo. 9. ver. 8. And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of the aſhes of the furnace, and let Moſes ſprinkle it toward the Heaven, in the ſight of Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>V. 9. And it ſhall become ſmall duſt in all the land of Egypt, and ſhall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beaſt throughout all the land of Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>V. 10. And they took aſhes of the furnace, and ſtood before Pharaoh, and Moſes ſprinkled it up toward Heaven, and it became a boyl break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth with blains upon man and upon beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>V. 11. And the Magicians could not ſtand before Moſes, becauſe of the boyles; for the boyl was upon the Magicians and upon all the Egyptians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This plague of a noiſome and grievous ſore, named before in <hi>Exodus</hi> a boyle breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beaſt, by reaſon of which, neither the Magicians, nor Egyptians could ſtand before <hi>Moſes,</hi> is in a Viſion ſhewn unto <hi>John,</hi> in this manner, <hi>Rev. 16. 2. And the firſt</hi> (Angel <hi>went, and poured out his vial upon the earth, and there fell a noiſome and grievous ſore upon
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55875:19"/>
the men, which had the mark of the Beaſt, and them which worſhiped his Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The diſeaſe in the Story written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Viſion thereof in the principal matters ſhewed unto <hi>John,</hi> did in brief portend and foreſhew, That in a place a part of Spiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is <hi>Rome,</hi> a certain man ſhould take the aſhes of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. which was himſelf, and advancing duſt and aſhes toward Heaven in the Popes place, by the Oath of Supreme Head of the Church, which ſhould ſo fall upon the men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and others void of wiſedom, Clergy and Laity, that it ſhould beget boiles and blains, that is, be lothſome and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome. For while the Clergy, who had ſworn to the Pope, were compel'd to ſwear the ſame to K. <hi>Henry,</hi> they as men trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſore boiles knew not which way to turn themſelves to finde reſt; if they ſware to K. <hi>Henry</hi> they wounded their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, if they denied it they ſuffered death. And as bodies full of boiles and botches are lothſome to be lookt upon, ſo this oath when it was taken, could not but make them odious to thoſe that knew it was done out of fear, not from their hearts.</p>
            <p>So could not the Magicians ſtand before <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor thoſe Clergy men, but all that well could, hid themſelves, or fled. For the Vial fell upon thoſe which had the Mark of the Beaſt, and them which worſhiped his Image; By the Mark is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Signe of the Croſs, becauſe a Saltier Croſſe in this form X is the Mark of the Beaſt which is the Pope, noting numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally among the Greeks ſix hundred, being the round Number of his Name, which in full is DCLXVI. And thoſe that worſhiped the Image of that Peaſt, are thoſe which adore the Hoſte or Sacrament of the Altar. Becauſe the Bread and Wine hallowed by ſuperſtitious Conſecration from the Prieſts mouth, is made to have life, and to become of thoſe Elements a <hi>living Chriſt Soul and body:</hi> It is called the <hi>Image of the Beaſt</hi> becauſe found out by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and eſtabliſhed by him under the name of the <hi>Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> who is that <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> as is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55875:19"/>
elſewhere abundantly proved, and this is the ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>Rev. 13 15. And he had power to give life unto the Image of the Beaſt,</hi> That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould give life unto dead crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Bread and Wine making them a living Chriſt by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>So much briefly for the Firſt Diſeaſe which was Portentous; The Second follows, and this is the <hi>Leproſie,</hi> which, as it was in ſome reſpect a puniſhment of ſin, particularly the <hi>Leproſie</hi> of <hi>Miriam, Numb.</hi> 12. and of <hi>Gehazi, 2 King.</hi> 5. 27. and that of K. <hi>Azariah, 2 King.</hi> 15. 5. and it was called the Plague of <hi>Leproſie,</hi> and ſimply the Plague ſundry times, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. and 14. (for the Malady was Painful and Loathſome, and the cauſe of ſolitary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation to the <hi>Leper)</hi> ſo for the kinde and Nature of it, this diſeaſe was ſuch an extraordinary Meſſenger of God, as which did contain in it a figure of the Pollution and Odiouſneſſe of Sin, the diffuſive nature thereof, with the Puniſhment, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer from the guilt and puniſhment alſo, a Perſon which ſhould free us from both, the Son of God <hi>Chriſt Jeſus. Leproſie</hi> was then in the higheſt, when the Diſeaſe was as white as Snow; ſuch a <hi>Leper</hi> was <hi>Gehazi</hi> in the place above-named; and thus was <hi>Moſes's</hi> hand leprous as ſnow, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 6. It ſeized likewiſe upon ſundry parts of the body, and ſometime the whole, as the head, forehead, beard, and ſometime garments of skin, and of wollen, and linnen, and divers times houſes. In which caſes, and in ſuch parts of the body, the <hi>Leproſte</hi> was either a bright ſpot with white hair growing in it deeper then the skin, and ſpreading, or a white riſing in the skin, turning the hair white, or in ſome caſe yellowiſh thin hair, and where appeared quick raw fleſh in the riſing in mens bodies, or a white reddiſh ſore in a bald head or forehead. In garments if there did appear a greeniſh or reddiſh ſpot and ſpreading. The <hi>Leproſie</hi> in a houſe were hollow ſtrakes greeniſh or reddiſh, appearing deeper then the wall, and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. See of all thls, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. and 14.</p>
            <p>The uncleanneſs of ſin defiling the ſoul was ſignified, when the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55875:20"/>
               <hi>Leper</hi> having a covering upon his upper lip, his clothes rent, and his head bare, was to cry twiſe, Unclean, Unclean, to note defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſoul by ſin, and his body by <hi>Leproſie, Lev.</hi> 13. 45, 46.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Leproſie</hi> in the garments and in the houſe judged by the colour, deepneſs, and ſpreading, did inſinuate the ſpreading conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and from without, and outward ſenſes the inward motion thereof into the heart and affections, and by example, as our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are carried and worn outwardly, and in our houſes as ſpreading in a family among our ſervants, children, and betwixt husband and wife. The Separation and living apart of the <hi>Leper</hi> noteth, That the ſociety of the wicked is to be avoided, and the above-named Levitical Law is applied unto the company of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 17. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you.</hi> The pain and torment of the <hi>Leproſie</hi> conſiſteth in itching and burning, the later whereof is to be gathered from <hi>Moſes, Lev.</hi> 13. 24. of both which ſome kinde of lepers found at this day do tell us, and Writers do declare. That which among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was white as ſnow, and burning, figureth the pains of Hell, on the right hand, as it were, and the Duration and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of Hell Torments, as on the left hand. For the ſnowy whiteneſs is the whiteneſs of ſalt, and one is very like the other, and it hath this whiteneſs to ſignifie <hi>ſalt,</hi> not ſnow, unto us. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is ſignified by <hi>ſalt</hi> in two reſpects, 1. Becauſe <hi>ſaltneſs</hi> is the effect and fruit of burning, as we ſee in aſhes of wood: 2. for that <hi>ſalt</hi> whether it be taken inwardly, or applied outwardly, cauſeth a ſenſe of burning. We uſe to ſay, As ſalt as fire, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſalt, as if we were burnt with it as with fire. Touching the continuance of the Pains of Hell, <hi>Salt</hi> ſignifieth that alſo, for the property of <hi>ſalt</hi> is to keep from corruption and decaying. In which ſenſe, the phraſe of Holy Scripture is, <hi>a Covenant of ſalt;</hi> ſignifying a Covenant which is never to be broken, but to endure for ever.</p>
            <p>The Lake of <hi>Sodom</hi> the moniment of Gods vengeance upon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55875:20"/>
thoſe ſinſul Cities <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and the Cities about them, is uſed by the Holy Ghoſt as a Type of Hell, the place and condition of the damned, and called the Lake of Fire burning with Brimſtone, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20. becauſe in that lake called the Dead Sea, and <hi>Aſphaltitis,</hi> is found much <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Latine <hi>Bitumen,</hi> which by the Poet <hi>Ovid</hi> is ſhewn to be a matter apt to take fire, and unquenchable, though by him diſtinguiſht from Brimſtone, and is a pitchy ſubſtance known to Apothecaries, although in ſome place it is by the Interpreters of the Bible called Slime, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 10. it is called by another Hebrew word, and by a Greek word ſo interpreting it, Brimſtone, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 23. and in the above-named place in the <hi>Revelation, Ovids</hi> words make it of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Brimſtone notwithſtanding, <hi>Metamorph. Book</hi> 14.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Lurida ſupponunt faecundo Sulphura fonti,</l>
               <l>Incenduntque cavas fumante Bitumine venas.</l>
               <l>Blew-burning Brimſtone's caſt into the Spring,</l>
               <l>And ſmoaking Earth-pitch fires the veins within.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This place as it is a Figure of Hell in reſpect of the matter of unquenchable fire contained in it, being a remainder of that Brimſtone which being kindled fell from Heaven, and deſtroyed thoſe Cities, and ſo likewiſe was it a Type of Hell in relation to the <hi>ſaltneſse</hi> of that Lake, called alſo, the <hi>Salt-ſea</hi> (being ſo exceeding <hi>ſalt</hi> that no living creature is found therein) as it were painting unto us the Duration of their Torments, and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies preſerved from Corruption. All the qualities of this Lake, for which it is by God Almighty conſtituted a Modle of Hell, are not neceſſarily to be reckoned up, but ſome of them are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to have been expreſt to inſtruct and direct us, while the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are not mentioned, that we may take pains to ſearch after them. For thus we finde in an expreſſion of that Lake, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone ſometimes left out of the deſcription, and only Fire menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>Rev. 20. 14. And death and hell were caſt into the Lake of Fire.</hi> But of the <hi>Saltneſſe</hi> of that place, and as to a Puniſhment, it is confirmed, <hi>Deut. 29. 23. And that the whole land thereof is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55875:21"/>
Brimſtone, and Salt, and Burning, that it is not ſowen, nor beareth, nor any graſſe groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha, Admah and Zeboim, which the Lord overthrew in his anger and in his wrath.</hi> I might take a view of ſome other things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to this diſeaſe of the <hi>Leproſie,</hi> wherein ſome other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are pointed at, but what I have already ſpoken will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to denote what it typifies in the Nature of Sin, and the Puniſhment. But the great thing which was intended by this ſtrange diſeaſe, and for which cauſe it was ſent, and when that was come, ceaſed to be any more; and the chief Scope unto which the <hi>Leproſie</hi> by the Wiſedom of the Lord aimed, was his Son Chriſt Jeſus, which was then to come; the <hi>Leproſie</hi> the Shadow, Chriſt the Subſtance. And as when the Body comes, the Shadow thereof gives place, in like manner when our Lord and Saviour had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pains of death for the ſins of the world, and made us clean being our High-prieſt, from our uncleanneſſe, ſo many as he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternal life, whom he pronounced clean as a good and skilful Prieſt, ſaying, <hi>Joh. 13. 10. You are clean, but not all;</hi> then afterward began the <hi>Leproſie</hi> quickly after his death to depart. For the chief thing which was ſignified by the <hi>Leproſie</hi> was now come, and the Myſtery ſulfilled; our Prieſt was come, and made us clean. For now no ſuch <hi>Leproſie</hi> found in <hi>Paleſtina</hi> nor any where among the nation of the Jews. And the Ceremonies and Rites uſed in cleanſing the Leper do point out our Saviour, and what he did and ſuffered for us. In the Cleanſing of a Houſe healed of the <hi>Leproſie,</hi> uſe was made of two living Birds, Cedar-wood, Scarlet, and Hyſſop; one of which birds was to be killed over run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning water in an earthen veſſel, and dipping the living bird, the Cedar-wood, Scarlet, and Hyſſope, in the blood of the ſlain bird, and in the running water, and ſprinkling the Houſe ſeven times, it is ſaid, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. 52. that with all the fore-named things the Prieſt ſhall cleanſe the Houſe; and <hi>ver. 53. But he ſhall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for the Houſe, and it ſhall be clean.</hi> Who, to whom God
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55875:21"/>
hath given but an ordinary underſtanding, willl not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge here, that the ſhedding of the blood of one bird (and the other let fly) into running water, and in an earthen veſſel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to running water as to go into the Sea; whither all running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is carried, and all rivers run, to be conveyed all the world o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for from thence come all fountains, did ſignifie ſo much touching the ſhedding of our Saviours blood for all the world? Or who can then doubt that the receiving of it in an earthen veſſel, did betoken our Saviours taking our fleſh upon him, whoſe bodies as his being originally from the earth, are called earthen veſſels? Nor can we gainſay the flying away of the other bird, one of the ſame kinde, did declare our Saviours reſurrection and aſcenſion into Heaven; as birds are called fowls of Heaven. It will certainly be granted, that the Cedar ſignified two things; his Croſs, as it is a tree, on which he ſuffered death, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his perſon above all other men; as the Cedar in lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe excelleth all trees. And eminent men are metaphorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Prophet called Cedars, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. 3. 22, 31. and by the Holy Penman 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 9. The Scarlet being lambs wool ſo died figured his innocent, patient, and bloody death. But the Hyſſope a low ſhrub growing upon the wall, as Scripture calleth it, and in a relation of <hi>Solomons</hi> Hiſtory of Trees is oppoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cedar, the loweſt to the higheſt, and in the Ceremonials appointed in cleanſing the leprous Houſe being joyned to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, pointeth at our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, in his humility, who humbled himſelf to take our trail nature upon him, yea, the form of a ſervant, deſcending from heaven, and diſrobing himſelf of his tranſcendent glory. With this dipt in blood of the Paſchal Lamb were the lintels and two ſide-poſts of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> doors to be ſprinkled for ever. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 22, 23, 24. And a ſponge filled with vinegar put upon hyſſope, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 29. was given to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour on the croſs; both examples declaring unto us that by the blood ſhedding and ſharp ſufferings of him that made himſelf of no account we ſhould be delivered. Thus God did guide the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55875:22"/>
hearts and heads of all his enemies, though ignorantly and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icouſly to ſet forth the honour of his Son. But <hi>David</hi> expreſly doth by the name of Hyſſope underſtand no other thing, no not in ceremony, but our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, where he prayeth unto the Lord, to purge him with hyſſope, <hi>Pſa. 51. 7. Purge me with hyſſope, and I ſhall be clean; waſh me and I ſhall be whiter then ſnow.</hi> As for waſhing liquid and thin ſubſtance is proper; but no other water whatſoever hath the power to make clean and white bloody ſins, but the blood of the Lamb of God. So much for theſe two Prodigious Diſeaſes and their Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall ſhew you Reader, that ſome Remedies and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines have alſo been appointed by Almighty God to typifie things of great moment, preſent, and to come. I could finde out ſome more of this nature, but I hope to ſatisfie my Reader with two. The Firſt of theſe two Remedies ſo ſignificative, is the precious liquor or oyl of <hi>Balm,</hi> whoſe plant grew not at firſt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thence by the gift of the Queen <hi>Sheba</hi> unto <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> tranſplanted into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately affirms. For the Holy Scripture declareth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where it firſt ſhews, that the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> tranſported from <hi>Gilead</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> Spicery, Balm and Myrrhe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 25. which had not been done, if the <hi>Balm tree</hi> had grown and yielded <hi>Balm</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Again, <hi>Balm</hi> is by <hi>Jacob</hi> to his Sons named among the beſt fruits of the land, which he was minded to ſend as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent into <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 43. 11. And <hi>Pliny</hi> in his <hi>Naturall Hiſtory, Book</hi> 12. 25. acknowledgeth that tree to be peculiar to the land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and therefore not elſewhere originally to be found. I ſhall not follow much the praiſes which are given unto this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Oil of <hi>Balm,</hi> by <hi>Pliny</hi> or other ancient heathen Writers, as of the incomparable ſweetneſſe thereof to the ſmell above all other liquors, nor touching the price thereof, which <hi>Pliny</hi> avers to have been ſold for twiſe the weight thereof in Silver. Nor will it make much matter what particular diſeaſes, they ſay, it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55875:22"/>
was helpful againſt, which is affirmed to have been very effectuall againſt the pain of the Head; and Dimneſs of ſight. But in what God ſhall here enable me to ſpeak thereof, the Scripture ſhall be my guide and Experience. The Scripture doth commend this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of <hi>Balm</hi> as an incomparable medicine, taken according to the literall under the myſtical ſenſe thereof, againſt diſeaſes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe incurable, and to be a taker away of pain, <hi>Jer. 8. 22. Is there no Balm in G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lead?</hi> Is there <hi>no Phyſician there?</hi> why then is not the <hi>health of the daughter of my people recovered?</hi> And <hi>cha. 46. 2. Go up into Gilead, and take Balm, O virgin the daughter of Egypt; in vain ſhalt thou uſe many medicines, for thou ſhalt not he cured.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Cha. 51. 8. Babylon is ſuddenly fallen, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; howl for her, take Balm for her pain, if ſo be ſhe may be healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were the natural vertues of <hi>Balm;</hi> but this was not the end and ſcope of the Prophet, as if he would have the people of <hi>Judah</hi> in their ſpiritual diſeaſe of ſin take and uſe a natural and outward Remedy pertaining to a Bodily Diſeaſe. For what could natural <hi>Balm</hi> do in help to recover the miſerable and deplorable eſtate of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> deſtined to deſtruction (whoſe many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies mentioned were no other then ſundry waies and means affaied to avoid ruine) though they ſhould have gone unto the mountain of <hi>Gilead,</hi> and fetched <hi>Balm</hi> from thence where it grew? Beſides, how could that medicinable oyl prevail to help the fall and deſtruction of the City of <hi>Babylon?</hi> For it was not the ſickneſſe of the body under which the <hi>Babylonians</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured.</p>
            <p>Wherefore obſerve, that if we muſt not underſtand theſe things according to the Letter, becauſe the diſeaſe and pain is not to be taken literally, it behoves us here to finde out what is meant by Diſeaſe and want of health and Pain; which are of ſuch a nature, as that they can be taken away by <hi>Balm</hi> in what ſenſe ſoever taken, and by no other thing; So doing we ſhall finde what I did at firſt affirm concerning natural <hi>Balm</hi> to be true.</p>

I ſaid before, that ſins were named diſeaſes, and that Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Puniſhments were called by the name of Diſeaſes. I ſhall yet farther prove it unto you, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 41. 4. <hi>Heal my ſoul</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) for I have ſinned;</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 4. The diſeaſed have ye not ſtrengthened, neither have ye healed that which was ſick, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ye bound up that which was broken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which place the people are likened to a flock of ſheep, their ſins of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in Judgement and Life, and Troubles in Conſcience, called by the names of Diſeaſes, Sickneſs, and Breaking of Bones; their Prophets and Teachers are named Shepherds; as often in other places. And when Chriſt healed men, he forgave them their ſins, as healing of men is interpreted forgiving of ſins; for when our Saviour had made mention of the groſneſs of the peoples hearts, the darkneſſe of the eyes of their mindes, he concludes, they were obſtinate and refuſed to be healed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 14. and in the ſame hiſtory repeated by <hi>Mark, cha.</hi> 4. 12. this healing is called forgiveneſſe of ſins. <hi>That</hi> (ſaith the Evangeliſt) <hi>ſeeing they may ſee, and not perceive, and hearing they may hear, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, leſt at any time they ſhould be converted, and their ſins ſhould be forgiven them.</hi> The heathens themſelves eſteemed Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Diſeaſes and Maladies of the Soul. <hi>Cicero</hi> in <hi>Tuſculane Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, Book</hi> 3. hath theſe words, <hi>At &amp; morbi pernicioſiores, plureſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſunt animi.</hi> That is, <hi>But for the Diſeaſes of the minde, they are more hurtful, and of greater number,</hi> meaning, <hi>then thoſe which are of the body.</hi> Afflictions and Puniſhment are called by the name of Diſeaſes, when as Sorrow for ſin even to deſpair is called bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bones, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 51. 8. and the ſame by <hi>Solomon</hi> is named wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Sins Tranſgreſſions and Afflictions being the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of theſe people the Jews, Egyptians, and Babylonians, and the Remedy preſcribed unto them all being <hi>Balm,</hi> and <hi>Balm</hi> only, what can hereby be ſignified, but <hi>He</hi> that was the onely Fountain opened for ſin and uncleanneſſe, the only Medicine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe maladies, He that healeth ſickneſs both of Soul and

body, the precious blood of him, called by <hi>David</hi> for his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <hi>Hyſſope,</hi> for the medicinable quality of his blood <hi>Balm?</hi> Which counſel in reſpect of the Times is thus to be applied. When the Jews were without Natural <hi>Balm,</hi> as now they are, and fick, and miſerable, as they alſo be, and the Spiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> and Spirituall <hi>Babylon</hi> (both which places typifie and note <hi>Rome,)</hi> now tending to deſtruction, had no Remedy left for their miſeries, but all of them by faith in one and the ſame <hi>Jeſus</hi> to apply that univerſal Medicine <hi>Balm.</hi> Which Medicine the miſerable Jews deny, and the Roman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Notwithſtanding of ſuch things as do point at matters of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not only paſt, or preſent, but to come, whether ſingly or jointly, there is a difference. Some there be which do only in an <hi>ordinary</hi> manner, and <hi>ſecondarily</hi> without any wonder ſet forth ſuch things; of which ſort are the <hi>Paſchal lamb,</hi> betokening <hi>Chriſt</hi> who was to be revealed, in his innocency; the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the ſhedding the blood of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> prefiguring Chriſts <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and <hi>offering up himſelf</hi> a bloody Sacrifice: <hi>Hyſſope</hi> betokens his <hi>humility,</hi> and multitude of things of that ſort. A ſecond ſort of things there is and Perſons, which figure the things forenamed in an <hi>extraordinary principal</hi> manner, and are accompanied with <hi>wonder;</hi> theſe like extraordinary Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors are by the Mercy of the Lord ſent to point out great and moſt weighty matters unto us.

And of this ſecond ſort of Signes was <hi>Balm, extraordinarily, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,</hi> and <hi>wonderfully</hi> betokening <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It was a liquor, if we may believe <hi>Pliny</hi> in the place aforeſaid, iſſuing out of the ſides of the wounded tree, and (though not at firſt) turning to a <hi>red colour,</hi> ſo reſembling <hi>blood,</hi> and for the precious medicinable nature of it, moſt like out Saviours blood, and by the miraculous ceaſing at firſt (as it may be thought, by that great ſcarcity of the oyl from ſuch a multitude of Trees mentioned in <hi>Pliny)</hi> of the <hi>Balm</hi> it ſelf, and ſoon after of the tree, even to this day, that it was of thoſe Types of Chriſt, which when he came, ceaſed to be, and that wonderfully. And to this very time the Prophet alludes, when he ſaith, <hi>Is there no balm in Gilead?</hi> Is there <hi>no Phyſician there?</hi> even to the later times of the Jews after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. As if he ſhould have ſaid, Although there be no, <hi>Balm,</hi> yet there is notwithſtanding a <hi>Phyſician</hi> there, yea, becauſe there is no <hi>Balm</hi> in <hi>Gilead,</hi> look for a <hi>Phyſician</hi> in that place, for the Soul-ſick Nation by faith in him. Which Lord in mercy make haſte to give that miſerable people. And of this portending Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine <hi>Balm</hi> hitherto.</p>
            <p>The Second Medicine Prodigious ſhewing in part what was preſent, and what to come, mentioned in Holy Scripture, is the <hi>Pool</hi> of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> which cured thoſe which were put therein, with what diſeaſe or infirmity ſoever they were troubled. Of which water and the Medicinal quality thereof, hear what S. <hi>John</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>ch. 5. ver. 2. Now there is at Hieruſalem by the Sheep-market a Pool, which is called in the Hebrew Tongue Betheſda, having five porches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>In theſe lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>For an Angel went down at a certain ſeaſon into the Pool, and troubled the water; whoſoever then firſt after the troubling of the water ſtepped in, was made whole of whatſoever diſeaſe he had.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the water of this <hi>Pool</hi> did not by any natural vertue cure
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55875:24"/>
all ſorts of diſeaſes, I need uſe no Argument to prove. For although there have been found and now are certain waters, which do cure or help ſome Diſeaſes, but no waters were ever heard of that could cure other diſeaſes, much leſs all of what kind ſoever. The Text it ſelf ſhews, by what power this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue was given to the wate, expreſſing, That an Angel went down at a certain ſeaſon, and troubled the water, and ſo at that time and no other it became helpful. This needs no words more to ſhew how wonderfull it was, ſo far from obſervation of the like and courſe of all natural Medicines. Wherefore I conclude, that this miraculous <hi>Pool</hi> was a true and appointed <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>blood,</hi> becauſe of the univerſal extenſion of the curing by the waters; of his blood (I ſay) which was ſhed for all our ſins and ſoul diſeaſes, and ſickneſſes, which by faith it cures and takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. For when the water was troubled, at that time only it was indued with ſanative virtue, which was when the water in its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance reſembled blood; at which time of its ſtirring and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the water being made thick by the mixture of the earth from the ſides and bottome of the <hi>Pool;</hi> and when the mixt ſubſtance by ſtanding ſtill of the water ſetled again, the water becoming and loſing the likeneſs of <hi>blood,</hi> which haply at that time of ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it might attain in colour alſo, the medicinable quality va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed therewith. If the water which iſſued out of the rock in the wilderneſſe was a Type of Chriſts blood, for as much reaſon and more agreeable to outward ſenſe muſt the water of this <hi>Pool</hi> be a Figure of the ſame. Yea, I doubt not but that the water which came out of that rock which ſignified Chriſt, ſhould have been a troubled water and thick like unto this, but that a clearer liquor was permitted unto them by indulgence, leſt it might offend their ſtomachs; here a more groſſe and blood-like water fit enough to bathe in, was more perfectly to paint out our Saviours blood. And theſe two waters, the one to drink, the other to bathe, allude to the words of our Saviour, ſaying, <hi>My blood is drink indeed,</hi> Joh. 6. 55. and of Saint <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 1. 5.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55875:25"/>
ſpeaking of our Saviour, that he <hi>Waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, it appeareth that this <hi>Pool</hi> of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> was in all the forenamed reſpects a <hi>Type</hi> of our <hi>Saviours blood,</hi> and a ſhadow of him; for after his death, this wonderful quality of curing all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes left it for ever. So far concerning Diſeaſes and Medicines which were prodigious, ſhewing things, ſome paſt, others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but chiefly things which were to come, <hi>principally, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,</hi> and <hi>wonderfully,</hi> and among other things which they did ſignifie as with relation to him, they aimed at the Perſon and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt Jeſus our Saviour.</p>
            <p>But whereas all matters of moment have been ordinarily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewn which concern Gods glory, and his dearly beloved Spouſe the Church, ſince <hi>KINGS</hi> and Potentates of the earth are ſuch Perſons, as upon whom the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>welfare</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> of God depends, when they are good Princes; but being not ſo they are not only Perſecutors of the Church themſelves, but all their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects follow their Princes example; a great part therefore of ſuch matters which the Lord is pleaſed to premoniſh his people of, whether good or evil, is joyned with the Perſons and Princes which ſhall be principal authors of ſuch things. This is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> firſt and ſecond Viſion, and in many of <hi>Daniels;</hi> wherein are foreſhewn the different eſtates of the Four Monarchies in reſpect of their Princes, and by <hi>Ezekiel, chap.</hi> 1. in the Viſion of the Four living Creatures with four Faces, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied diſtinctly unto the Church, how thoſe Princes of the Four Monarchies ſhould exerciſe their authority toward the Jews their Subjects and Captives. Inſomuch that not only <hi>Joſias</hi> was fore-named who ſhould be a Pious and Excellent Prince unto the Jews, near three hundred years before his birth, but <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo a heathen Prince, who ſhould be Gods Shepherd to help and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh his people, many years before he was born; pointing and ſhewing them as with the finger, a King, who contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of other Princes ſhould ſend them home freely out of their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55875:25"/>
captivity assisting them in whatſoever they could deſire. So it is not without example, that a Prince ſhould be deſigned by name, (if otherwiſe by ſome way equivalent to a name, it will be the ſame thing) to ſome great work ſome ages before he was.</p>
            <p>Now having laid a ſtrong foundation (as I ſuppoſe) for what follows concerning the Matter, which I have before affirmed to have been comprehended in the two forenamed Diſeaſes the <hi>RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KETS</hi> and <hi>KINGS-EVIL,</hi> I come at length to make good my aſſertion, by making it by Gods grace appear to a judicious and competent Reader to be altogether true.

Moreover it encreaſeth the wonder of our Kings Gift of Healing, that his power extends not ſo far, as to heal all other diſeaſes, like as the <hi>Struma,</hi> why not the <hi>Feaver,</hi> the <hi>Gout, Palſie,</hi> &amp;c. and that all Patients, and why e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, receive not benefit by his Royal Hands? All this muſt of neceſſity cauſe wonder in thoſe that conſider all this, even to aſtoniſhment. But wonder never was the utmoſt end, for which the Lord at any time did ſend his Miracles; which indeed is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than an inthralling and captiving of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reaſon, that it can move no farther; which comes ſhort in us of the end which the Lord aims at in his marvellous works. Much leſs doth wonder diſtinguiſh one work from another. Our Saviour did his Miracles to ſhew, and make them know, he was the promiſed Meſſias, which when they ſaw, all men (as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt tels us) marvelled. But did this effect anſwer the end which the Lord intended thereby? Plainly it did not. Much leſs doth aſtoniſhment and amazement at the ſight of the Lords mighty and ſtrange works, make any the leaſt difference between them; but that one Anſwer muſt be given of them all; as, <hi>I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at theſe ſtrange things,</hi> or, <hi>God knows what they mean.</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration indeed is the way which God hath ordained for men to look up for a higher Workman than ordinary (as when a man is led into a maze or labyrinth, he is taught by nature to ſeek a way out) which needs muſt be the Author of ſo great a matter; and as the work it ſelf is not light and vulgar, that is wrought, ſo muſt it be for ſome extraordinary end, which ought to be ſought out.</p>
               <p>The wondring at theſe two Diſeaſes hath ſeized upon many, but it hath pleaſed Almighty God of his meer mercy to make known unto me the Cauſes why they were ſent, his love unto King <hi>Charles</hi> II, and his Pity toward the long diſtreſſed people

               <p>But that I may finde out the ſignification of the ſecond Diſeaſe the KINGS-EVIL, it will be neceſſary that it be enquired, whether the cure of this Diſeaſe hath alwaies been performable by our Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and if not, who, and what he was, who firſt of our Engliſh Kings had this Gift of <hi>Healing</hi> given unto him, as it is called the Diſeaſe of the KINGS-EVIL for being cured by the King.</p>
               <p>The Gift of healing the <hi>Struma</hi> now called the KINGS-EVIL, we ſhall finde to have been given by the Lord, firſt of all Kings of <hi>England,</hi> to King <hi>Edward</hi> III, before the Conqueſt, commonly named <hi>Edward the Confeſsor,</hi> by the following words of <hi>Ailredus, Abbot of Revesby, De Vita &amp; Miraculis Edwardi Confeſſoris,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>ten Engliſh Hiſtorians, printed at London for Cornelius Bee, 1652. page 390.

for her face was not only disfigured by a Diſeaſe, but ſhe was barren alſo, which drew away the affection of her husband from her. For under her jaws there grew a ſort of kernels which by their ſwelling made her look deformedly, and the humours corrupting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her chin, turned her blood into mattur, which breeding worms ſent forth a very ſtinking ſavour.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, We are to conſider more accurately the Perſon to whom the Lord firſt gave this great Gift of Healing the <hi>Kings-evil.</hi> Firſt, in reſpect of his DIGNITY and DESCENT; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in regard of his ORDER and PLACE of SUCCES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SION.

               </p>
               <p>Thus much for this K. <hi>Edwards</hi> DIGNITY and DESCENT, who firſt of our Engliſh Kings healed the KINGS-EVIL.</p>

Thus <hi>Edward the Martyr</hi> the <hi>Firſt, Egelred</hi> the <hi>Second, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Ironſide</hi> the <hi>Third, Hardicanutus</hi> the <hi>Fourth, Edward the Confeſſor</hi> the <hi>Fifth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, for his new SIRNAME the CONFESSOR; that he was ordinarily called <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> and for his HOLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSE, witneſſeth <hi>Henry Knighton Canon of Leiceſter,</hi> in his <hi>firſt book. ch. 8.

Fourthly, In what pertains to King <hi>Edward</hi> the CONFES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SORS ADVENTURES; he was by reaſon of an Uſurper for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſhift for himſelf, and to live as a baniſhed man in <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> for ſo writes <hi>Ailredus, De Sancto Edwardo Confeſſore ac Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, pag.</hi> 366. in the <hi>forenamed Volume of Hiſtorians, Edwardus frater Edmundi filius Edelredi, qui in Normanniâ exulabat,</hi> that is, <hi>Edward the brother of Edmund</hi> (Ironſide) <hi>who lived in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy in Baniſhment.</hi> From which place of his exile he was ſent for, by the teſtimony of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> called <hi>John Bromptons</hi> Abbot of <hi>Jerevall,</hi> not written but ſet out by him, <hi>Edwardus à Normanniâ vocatus,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> (ſaith the Hiſtorian) <hi>was ſent for out of Normandy.</hi> But how welcome the King was, and to whom, Let us hear the words of <hi>Ailredus</hi> in the place aforeſaid, <hi>Veniens igitur in Angliam Edwardus ab univerſo clero &amp; populo cum maximâ exultatione ſuſcipitur. But when King Edward came into England</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he was welcomed by all the Clergy, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the land with all expreſſions of joy;</hi> and ſome of the reaſons of that great and univerſal gladneſs are in the ſame place expreſt by the ſame <hi>Ailredus</hi> in this manner, <hi>Homo manſuetus, &amp; magis pace quàm armis regnum protegens, habebat animum irae victorem, avaritia contemptorem, ſuperbiae expertem.</hi> which is, <hi>He was a milde Prince, who defended his Kingdom more by peace then by war, of ſuch a frame of minde that he could bridle his anger, hated cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and was void of all prids.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I ſhall by Gods grace ſhew unto you, in what manner it hath pleaſed Almighty God out of theſe Two Diſeaſes the REKETS and KINGS-EVIL, to foreſhew unto us our <hi>Publike</hi> SINS and MISERIES, and the AUTHORS of them, and DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIVERANCE from them in One, and the SINS we have been publikely guilty of, and our MISERIES which we have within theſe twenty years undergone, with the PERSON who ſhall by GODS mercy deliver and ſet us free from theſe long and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble afflictions in the Other, KING CHARLES <hi>II</hi> our DELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERER. Of which Two Diſeaſes I will and may affirm juſtly,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55875:30"/>
That if it be probable, that the Lord hath been wont to foretell Great Troubles to Nations and Kingdomes, and the iſſue of them, and if it be certainly true, that in all reſpects no Nation under Heaven upon whom the Name of God or Chriſt hath been called, hath felt ſuch miſeries and ſo great in ſo ſhort a ſpace as the Engliſh have done in the laſt twenty years, unleſs they have been predicted by the REKETS and KINGS-EVIL, there was never of theſe great things any Divine Forewarning mentioned in any Hiſtory. Much leſs was any Prediction like to theſe, but ſuch as did quickly vaniſh after their appearance, in a moment, as it were; or if any have been of longer continuance, their matter and argument hath not been ſo copious. But theſe Two Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the REKETS and KINGS-EVIL have been ſtable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, the eldeſt of which in the Prodigious Healing thereof hath continued ſix hundred years. The former of which, as the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie</hi> in time of the Law, was to typifie the Great Cleanſer Chriſt <hi>Jeſus</hi> our ſpiritual King, who was anointed with oyl of Grace above his fellows, and as the <hi>Balm of Gilead,</hi> and <hi>Pool of Betheſda</hi> were made to foreſhew that Merciful <hi>Phyſician,</hi> who with his blood ſhould heal our ſins and miſeries, and waſh us from impurity, was determined to ſhew Gods <hi>Providence, Power, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiee,</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> to poor <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of his anointed Servant K. CHARLES <hi>II.</hi> Whoſe Perſon, I ſay is with the other evils deſigned in the ſecond Diſeaſe the KINGS-EVIL. He is that Phyſician to cure thoſe wounds and putrified ſores, which our <hi>State-Phyſicians</hi> (as they have been often called) have made and cauſed. The things which are foreſhewn are in General, our <hi>Sins,</hi> and our <hi>Calamities:</hi> 2. The <hi>Authors,</hi> thoſe that have cauſed our miſeries, and 3. he which ſhall be our <hi>Deliverer.</hi> The method of this diſcovery is plain, for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which have been and ſhall be the Authors of theſe contrary effects, are plainly deſcribed, as if it were by their names, theſe in the one, this in the other Diſeaſe. The Sins and Calamities which ſome have been guilty of, and which almoſt all have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55875:31"/>
are ſhewn unto us, as under the <hi>Allegory</hi> and <hi>Type</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes in ſo plain a manner, as that the Diſeaſes are nothing elſe but in every part and circumſtance living pictures of what we have done and ſuffered, and but <hi>Metaphorical</hi> names of the very things. And either they are the very <hi>pictures</hi> and likeneſs of the things which I would have them ſignifie, and in this reſpect we give their natural ſignification, or elſe, they are <hi>Metaphorical</hi> expreſſions of ſuch things, and bear ſome good proportion unto the things which I ſhew they typiſie. Which <hi>Metaphors</hi> are not wreſted and ſtrained, but eaſie and taken from Holy Scripture, and uſed here in that ſignification in which they are there uſed. Nor is there any Trope or Figure which is leſs hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, nor more uſual in our mother tongue, or the Latine, Greek, or Hebrew tongues then <hi>Metaphors;</hi> inſomuch, that for uſing of names to certain things, we do not only commonly, but by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, borrow the names of other things, that is, uſe <hi>Metaphors.</hi> Such are theſe expreſſions in ordinary and familiar uſe; To be in <hi>high</hi> or <hi>low</hi> place, that is to be <hi>honorable,</hi> or <hi>without honor,</hi> and it is taken from places high and low in a Phyſical notion; ſo to be <hi>poor,</hi> when there is <hi>little fleſh</hi> upon any creature, is borrowed from that word which properly ſignifies <hi>want</hi> of <hi>things neceſſary,</hi> but is made to ſignifie, being <hi>lean,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

And both <hi>Regent</hi> and <hi>Tenent Participles</hi> of the preſent tenſe, and this from <hi>Teneo.</hi> Then in <hi>Regets</hi> the letter <hi>(g)</hi> is turned into <hi>(k)</hi> and of <hi>Regets</hi> is made REKETS; which change is alſo found in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue. <hi>Ghaucer</hi> in the <hi>Shipmans Prologue,</hi> no. 13. ſaith,

                     <l>His barge was called the Maudelain.</l>

For that veſſel which the Poet there, and <hi>Barclay</hi> in his <hi>Poeme</hi> called <hi>The Ship of fools,</hi> in ſundry places calleth <hi>a barge,</hi> we at this day do name (as is well known) <hi>a barke,</hi> with the like mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>(g)</hi> into <hi>(k).</hi> For the calling of it, as we do, REKETS pronouncing of it as if it were written with <hi>(i)</hi> in the firſt ſyllable, there is little difference in the ſound whether it be written with <hi>(e)</hi> or <hi>(i),</hi> for the letter <hi>(i)</hi> there ſounds not full, but like the ſound of <hi>(e)</hi> inſomuch that ſometimes <hi>(e)</hi> is pronounced like as we would have <hi>(i)</hi> pronounced in RIKETS written with an <hi>(i).</hi> Thus is the letter <hi>(e)</hi> ordinarily pronounced in <hi>end, metre, Peter,</hi> &amp;c. and in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> well <hi>puteus</hi> is uttered as if the vowel and the word were the ſame with will <hi>voluntas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus in the Name of this Diſeaſe are in the firſt place diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe men who were the AUTHORS of our late CALAMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIES; for according to the Name of the Diſeaſe they were not Kings, but ſuch as took upon them REGAL AUTHORITY. For the Diſeaſe is not expreſt by a word of the ſingular number REKET, but plurally REKETS, ſince not one ſingle perſon,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55875:32"/>
but many were the cauſes of our miſeries. And in this Name the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is put for the effect, for that thoſe men were the cauſe of our evils, the <hi>evils</hi> are called by the Names of ſuch who were the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of them. The <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Original Sin</hi> are called the <hi>Old man</hi> in relation to <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the fountain thereof, <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> called the <hi>New man</hi> directing unto <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the worker of it, in Holy Scripture, by a <hi>Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> put for the <hi>Effect.</hi> Thus our unjuſt and uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing High Governors being by the Name of the Diſeaſe marked out unto us; the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Symptomes</hi> of the Diſeaſe do pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray unto us their <hi>cunning, fraud, combinations, injuſtice, cruelty,</hi> with the reſt of their <hi>eminent Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Diſeaſe it ſelf let us firſt conſider the Pathognomik, and moſt conſtant Signe and Symptome thereof, which is the HEAD OVER-GREAT. For the underſtanding whereof if we call to minde, that in Holy Scripture a HEAD is a GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNOR, or perſon chief in rule, as where the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Tribes</hi> are ſtiled, the <hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>children of Iſrael, Numb.</hi> 13. 4. and when the <hi>Husband</hi> is named, <hi>Head of the wife, Eph.</hi> 5. 23. (for <hi>Head</hi> in both Teſtaments is near ſeventy times ſet for the chief, and for <hi>Rulers)</hi> and that it is proper not only to the Hebrew, but to the Greek and Latine nations, and to our own language, to call Magiſtrates and Rulers our Heads, we will not I hope deny, but that it is fitly enough expreſt by the OVER-GREATNESS of the HEAD, deſcribing the OVER-GREATNESS of ſuch men, by aſſuming unto themſelves, and growing to ſo great POWER, to have been the moſt certain and unremoveable cauſe of our late afflictions. For <hi>much</hi> power is called <hi>great</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, where the Angels are ſtiled, <hi>Greater in Power, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 11. By the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of the <hi>head</hi> therefore is very aptly ſet out unto us the taking and gaining too-much power to have been the firſt and great cauſe of the miſery, which we have undergone from thoſe which were ſet over us.</p>
               <p>In the next place, the SOBER GRAVITY of the FACE of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55875:32"/>
ſuch children comes to be examined, and we may joyn thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the more then ordinary WIT and UNDERSTAND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING found in ſuch children, far beyond what is found in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that age. This argues in what ſenſe and ſignification <hi>head</hi> is to be taken, that is, in no other than as a HEAD of WISEDOME, Counſeil, and GRAVITY; this laſt being a diſcreet behaviour of a man ſuch as may ſerve for the begetting of awe and reverence in inferiors, that their governors be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed; and this is expreſt in, and meſnaged very much by the SADNESS of the COUNTENANCE, <hi>Eccleſ. 7. 5. Anger is better then laughter, for by a ſad look the heart is made better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas it is obſerved, that the <hi>NOSES</hi> of ſuch which are troubled with this Malady are <hi>UNPURGED,</hi> remaining dry without diſtillation of Rheum, which in other children abounds; this is to let us underſtand, that theſe our ſwelling heads which thus ruled over us, although they ſeemed to cleanſe themſelves, by removing Malignants, which they named PURGING of the HOUSE, again and again from ſitting among them, yet did not theſe Heads PURGE THEMSELVES from, nor yet caſt out from among them Malignity and Malignants, but did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>retein</hi> in themſelves their <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>vices,</hi> ſuch as leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Court of <hi>Juſtice, Oppreſſion,</hi> and <hi>Delay,</hi> among many other leſs ſcandalous ſins. PURGING in the Scripture is caſting away the <hi>FILTH</hi> of <hi>SIN, 2 Tim. 2. 21. If any man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) therefore purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſel unto honor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the Noſe I come unto the TEETH, which in ſuch children become all ROTTEN, and FALL out, or elſe beyond the cuſtome in other yong children, they for a great ſpace TOOTHE NOT. The Signification whereof that we may underſtand, we are to conſider that the TEETH are thoſe Bones which God hath given unto us for grinding and <hi>CHEWING MEAT</hi> by which the body is nouriſhed. We likewiſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that PREACHING of Gods word is termed FEEDING of Gods flock, becauſe thereby is adminiſtred unto the hearers
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55875:33"/>
FOOD for their SOULS, for it keeps the ſoul by that profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knowledge (knowledge being hungred after by the ſoul as meat by the body) from eternal death to everlaſting life, in feeding upon Chriſt by faith. Well therefore may thoſe PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STORS which prepare, by breaking it after grinding in their mindes and hearts, the Bread which came down from Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Holy Word, be accounted, and be typified by TEETH; in which ſenſe the ſame are to be underſtood, <hi>Cant. 4. 2. Thy teeth</hi> are <hi>like a flock of</hi> ſheep <hi>that are even ſhorn, which come up from the waſhing, which all of them bear twins;</hi> and <hi>Chap. 6. 5. Thy teeth</hi> are <hi>as a flock of ſheep which go up from the waſhing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.</hi> The TEETH of the CHILDE of GOD, whereof the King is Head, are the PREACHERS: the ROTTEN TEETH are to be expounded ſuch Miniſters which being COR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RUPT and UNSOUND in their LIVES, DOCTRINE and FAITH (unto all which the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture gives ſuch names) have been removed from the Church.</p>
               <p>But NOT-TOOTHING and LATE-TOOTHING doth imply that SOUND PREACHERS which ſhould painfully, skilfully, and uprightly prepare nouriſhment for the Body of Chriſt which is his Church, ſhould here in <hi>England,</hi> be MUCH and LONG WANTING, withdrawing and hiding themſelves, leaving the mouth empty as it were, thoſe places where they ſhould be fixed, as it hath proved moſt true alſo in the event, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of unlawful oaths and engagements againſt their Sovereign, to be laid upon them, which with a good conſcience they could not ſubmit unto and for the like un juſt cauſes.</p>
               <p>The ARM BONES of ſuch children as labour of the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KETS turn CROOKED, the Myſtery whereof we ſhall finde by Scripture phraſe. <hi>ARMES</hi> in Gods Word noteth ſundry times military Forces and <hi>ARMIES,</hi> and this not without juſt reaſon; in a fleſhly arm men put their confidence and the ſtrength thereof, for by the ſtrength of their arm they yield their ſword

And it is held for ſo great an advantage which we of this Nation enjoy above all others; the ſtrength and multitude of our Ships, that it is almoſt grown into a Proverb, to ſay, <hi>The wals of England are wals of wood.</hi> So ſignificatively the <hi>Knops</hi> of the <hi>RIBS</hi> are called <hi>KNOTS,</hi> which is a kinde of <hi>faſt</hi> and ſometime <hi>indiſsoluble</hi> binding of a thing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto us, that by thus <hi>guarding</hi> the <hi>Seas</hi> with ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſtrong <hi>Ships,</hi> they judged they were ſo <hi>faſt</hi> and ſo ſecure that all the world could not <hi>undoe</hi> them.

The <hi>feet</hi> of ſuch children joyned unto the <hi>legs</hi> with <hi>STRONG KNOPPY ANCLE-JOYNTS,</hi> is a proper Type, How all men in <hi>place</hi> and <hi>power</hi> receiving them from the <hi>later</hi> and ſucceeding Parliaments, ſhould by wicked cunning, and by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing on them unlawful. Oaths and Engagements be made faſt to them thereby, to ſecure that uſurped power, well knowing, that without ſuch inſtruments ſo compacted, they could not <hi>go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> in their deſignes, nor themſelves <hi>ſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the irregular ſhape of the <hi>SHIN-BONES</hi> in ſuch children, firſt let us examine the thing it ſelf, and then deſiring Gods help, I ſhall ſearch out the hidden Myſtery. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in a word. The figure of the <hi>bone</hi> is a <hi>RISING</hi> forward of the <hi>BONE</hi> upon the <hi>SHIN</hi> very <hi>HIGH</hi> in the <hi>MIDS,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOVE</hi> and <hi>BENEATH RECLINING.</hi> Which figure doth as it were in a picture repreſent and declare unto us, that great ſin of which the <hi>ſucceeding</hi> Parliament (a part I mean of the firſt, and left behinde in the Houſe of Commons) was guilty of. For this <hi>riſing</hi> of the <hi>bone</hi> is not in the <hi>Thigh</hi> but <hi>Leg,</hi> which I ſhewed to ſignifie not the former but the after Parliament. Now although this enormous figure appear in both legs, as if both Houſes were guilty of that ſin, it is not ſo to be underſtood, but that part which ſate in the Houſe of Commons. Two ſuffered upon the Croſſe beſide our Saviour, both are ſaid to have railed upon him, yet one only was meant, the other was a true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and honoured our Saviour. The Myſtery of theſe bones is, That this <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> ſhould raiſe themſelves <hi>too exceeding high,</hi> and whereas the <hi>FIGURE</hi> of ſuch bones doth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55875:36"/>
manifeſtly paint the inſtrument by which our innocent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign loſt his life, the <hi>EDGE</hi> of an <hi>AXE,</hi> that out of their <hi>mouths</hi> would proceed that bloody <hi>Inſtrument</hi> (as out of the <hi>mouth</hi> of Chriſt a <hi>two-edged ſword</hi> is ſaid, <hi>to proceed,</hi> becauſe that which is commanded to be done, comes out of the mouth which enjoyneth it) by which our Soveraign ſhould loſe his <hi>Royall</hi> Head.</p>
               <p>This figure indeed is not like unto the <hi>Axe,</hi> wherewith his <hi>Majeſties</hi> life was taken away, for the edge thereof is <hi>ſtraight</hi> and not at all reclining, but being like the <hi>Axe</hi> which is carried before <hi>Traytors,</hi> of ſuch a ſhape as they commonly call <hi>glancing,</hi> doth more plainly and fully declare the <hi>perſon</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> of the King, then if the ſhape of the edge of the other had been made upon ſuch childrens legs. Otherwiſe being <hi>even,</hi> if the <hi>Shin-bone</hi> had been never ſo ſharp, it could not ſo eaſily have been appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to ſignifie an <hi>Axe.</hi> Again, every one that ſuffers death as a Traytor hath not ſuch an axe, or any born before him, when he goes to his triall; but ſuch only as are perſons of high degree. For which cauſe the Lord would not that ſuch a monſtrous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of hypocritical and but once parallel'd wickedneſs, that an innocent King ſhould be accuſed, condemned, and ſuffer as a Traytor, againſt expreſs vows, ſhould not be written in viſible Characters for the eyes of all men.</p>
               <p>In the next place I am to conſider, that theſe diſeaſed children, although when they were yonger they were able to walk, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in this Diſeaſe the uſe of their FEET is TAKEN AWAY. We finde in Holy Scripture that <hi>Walking</hi> is working in <hi>Performance of proper Duties,</hi> whereour Saviour Chriſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his reſolution not to forbear to preach and heal the ſick, he ſaith, <hi>Luk. 13. 33. I muſt walk to day and to morrow;</hi> and he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing his Diſciples of their duties, bid them, <hi>Joh. 12. 35. Walk while ye have light.</hi> So theſe Great Supporters of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes body when they ſate in Council together, and to do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Judgement, when at firſt for a while they began to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55875:37"/>
walk how ſoon after did they leave off performing cheif duties, and do nothing at all to the oppreſſed, or worſe. For the duty of our Parliament is to do that under the King, which God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned King <hi>Solomon</hi> to do, 2 <hi>King 6. 12. To walk in his Statutes, and to execute Judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt of this Diſeaſe is, that Childrens <hi>GROWTH,</hi> is <hi>HIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRED;</hi> whereas ſome continue Dwarſes hereby for ever. And as theſe children are hindred in their growth, ſo moſt certainly and fully doth the Antitype anſwer hereunto, ſhewing that thoſe people which ſhould be ſick of theſe <hi>Regents,</hi> ſhould <hi>grow</hi> neither in <hi>Grace,</hi> nor <hi>Riches,</hi> nor in <hi>Reputation,</hi> nor in any thing that may be called good. Theſe are the particular Symptomes of the Diſeaſe collected from all which are troubled therewith, and the ſignifications of them, ſo far as the Lord hath enabled me; I have alſo examined the Name of the Diſeaſe, and found out the Myſtery thereof, but although the REKETS be the general name to all degrees and ſorts of this Malady, yet when the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed are troubled, with ſuch <hi>JOYNTS</hi> and <hi>RIBS</hi> as they call <hi>DOUBLE,</hi> this they call the <hi>TENT.</hi> See <hi>Arnoldus Bootius in libello De Affectibus Omiſſis, in Cap. De Tabe Pectoreâ.</hi> If you then ask me, What means this Name? I anſwer, By a <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>Adjunct</hi> it ſignifyeth and expreſſeth <hi>Souldiers</hi> and <hi>Armies.</hi> For <hi>Caſtra</hi> the Latine word by interpretation <hi>Tents</hi> among the Romans is very often put to expreſs an <hi>Army</hi> or <hi>Armies</hi> in the Field, where Tents were uſed; as among the Holy Writers <hi>Tents</hi> are put for <hi>Habitations</hi> and Houſes, becauſe in former times the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> dwelt in Tents, and ſometimes <hi>Shepberds dwellings,</hi> becauſe their habitations in the Fields were conſtantly ſuch. But becauſe among us here is no uſe of <hi>Tents</hi> but in time of War, it muſt ſignifie naturally, according to its Name, and doth confirm, that ſuch Joynts were in ſignification a <hi>combining</hi> of <hi>Generals</hi> and Commanders with <hi>Souldiers,</hi> of <hi>Parl.</hi> with <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying</hi> by Lands with Soldiers; and though by <hi>Sea,</hi> there is no uſe of Tents, yet the Denomination is given to all, for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55875:37"/>
likeneſs of the Types, although proper but to Two of them, and that not without example; as the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Sceptre</hi> are uſed in ſpeech, when by them we mean nothing but a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Thus the Wiſe God knoweth every word in our Tongues, and when men or women give names to things they know not what, nor why, doth oftentimes ſo overrule them, that they ſpeak the Truth in a Myſtery. So did the High-Prieſt not knowing what he ſpake, propheſy of our Saviour.</p>

               <head>The MYSTERY of the THREE GENERAL REMEDIES.</head>
               <p>AFter the Myſtery of the <hi>REGETS</hi> and <hi>TENT,</hi> and of each <hi>SYMPTOME</hi> thereof, the <hi>three</hi> forenamed Vulgar REMEDIES are not without their <hi>Myſtery.</hi> The firſt Remedy is SWINGING ſuch children from ſide to ſide, and TOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SING them up and down, and TURNING them <hi>Topſey Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey.</hi> This is ordinarily taken to be, and uſed as a Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Diſeaſe, but careful obſervation and experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the contrary, that it is vain. Thus for a Remedy againſt our evil <hi>Regents,</hi> we were promiſed, when we ſhould change from a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to a Common-wealth we ſhould have all amended. But that then failing, we were made to beleeve, how ſuch a <hi>Protector</hi> would indeed perform, what others had promiſed; and when he had deceived, we muſt have a piece and the worſt piece of a Houſe of Commons to over-rule us, who pleaded the Juſtice of their own cauſe, as the reſt did, although the people never received Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice from any of them. And was not this <hi>Toſſing England from ſide to ſide, and up and down?</hi> When we were ſometime under a <hi>King and Parliament,</hi> we were <hi>up,</hi> when we were ſubject to a <hi>Few,</hi> or <hi>One</hi> of our <hi>Fellow-</hi>Subjects, we were <hi>down.</hi> At laſt we were turned <hi>Topſey Turvey</hi> when the <hi>Heels</hi> the <hi>Souldiers</hi> poſſeſt the place and RULE of our <hi>Superiors</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi> And this was a Falſe Remedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:55875:38"/>
The Second REMEDY is the <hi>Lifting</hi> up ſuch ſick children by the <hi>Armes.</hi> The meaning of which thing will by Gods grace be underſtood, if we remember, in what ſenſe I declared to you from Holy Scripture and the reaſon thereof, <hi>Armes</hi> are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which is in ſignification of <hi>Armies.</hi> This Remedy, <hi>Lifting</hi> the ſick children up by the <hi>Armes,</hi> is a <hi>Falſe</hi> Remedy, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed with ſucceſs. But it is much to be obſerved, that above all other Remedies which are wont to be applied to ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, there are none ſo much abhorred by them as this; for when it is done they will <hi>complain</hi> and <hi>cry out.</hi> The Myſtery hereof is, that when the childe of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be lifted up by the <hi>Armes,</hi> at which time the weight of the body depends upon the <hi>Armes,</hi> that is, the <hi>Armies;</hi> and at that time the <hi>Armes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are <hi>lifted</hi> up, and lifting up ſignifieth raiſing to honor, <hi>Pſal. 113. 7. He raiſeth up the poor out of the duſt, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill, ver. 8. That he may ſet him with Princes, even with the Princes of his people,</hi> The poor Patients which were troubled with the <hi>Regents,</hi> would leaſt of all endure, and moſt of all complain againſt the Tyranny of the <hi>Soldiers</hi> and <hi>Army</hi> bearing rule, that is, the <hi>Lifting up by and of the Armes.</hi> This was fulfilled to the utmoſt, when the <hi>Agitators</hi> of the <hi>Army</hi> pluckt and threw out of the Parliament houſe that Piece remaining and left of the Whole Houſe of Commons, and for a ſhort ſpace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greateſt indignation of the people, ruled alone.</p>
               <p>The Third <hi>REMEDY</hi> generally famous, but <hi>Falſe</hi> is the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the diſeaſed children <hi>Blood Behinde the Ear.</hi> And how true it hath been in the Antitype, that the <hi>Head</hi> our <hi>Royal Head,</hi> our Dear Lord the KING ſhould for a pretended cure of our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be let blood behinde the <hi>Eare,</hi> that is, in the <hi>Neck</hi> by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off his Head, to the encreaſe of our miſeries, I abhorre to think, and much the more, becauſe it was plotted and acted by men which were Profeſſors of the auſtereſt religion. But let not the Profeſſion of Religion be branded for this cauſe. Were not thoſe that had the chiefeſt hand in our Lord Chriſts death
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55875:38"/>
one of his Diſciples, and the Prieſts? Is not he that hath been guilty of ſo much of the blood of the Saints, that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> is become drunk therewith, counted the moſt Holy Father the Pope, and with him the Fathers of the Clergy. This is the craft of the old Serpent, when he cannot deſtroy the Church by open enmity, to endeavour it by ſeeming friends.</p>
               <p>But for the real Cure and true REMEDIES of the Diſeaſe we call the REKETS, as we take it according to the letter, it may for good cauſe be accounted wonderful in that regard alſo, and therein like unto the <hi>Leproſie.</hi> The <hi>Leproſie</hi> was a Diſeaſe not curable by any Art or <hi>Power</hi> of man. For thus anſwereth <hi>Ahab</hi> unto the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> who ſent unto him, deſiring that he would heal his ſervant <hi>Naaman</hi> of the Leproſie, concluding the curing of that Diſeaſe to be a Divine work above mans ſtrength, 2 <hi>King. 5. 7. Am I God to kill and to make alive, that this man doth ſend to me to recover a man of his Leproſie?</hi> To which purpoſe and more plainly ſpeaketh our Saviour, <hi>Luk. 4. 27. Many Lepers were in Iſrael in the time of Elizeus the Prophet; and none of them was cleanſed ſaving Naaman the Syrian.</hi> Even ſo neither is the malady of the <hi>Rekets</hi> curable by any Art or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician upon the Earth; although, I doubt not, all men both Learned and unlearned beleeve the contrary, perſwaded from what they ſee, that divers children afflicted very much with this Diſeaſe, at length become found and perfect. But although it cannot be denied, that many children have recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Rekets</hi> to a ſoundneſs in every part, yet is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion falſe, To aſſert thereupon, That this Diſeaſe hath been ſo cured by Phyſical Medicines. And the ſeeming contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is thus reconciled to the truth, by example of the <hi>Leproſie.</hi> No Leper was cleanſed, ſaving <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> ſaith our Saviour in the place aboveſaid, yet we read under the Law a Preſcription of the Rites and Ceremonies to be uſed in Cleanſing of Lepers, under this Title, <hi>Lev. 14 2. This ſhall be the Law of the Leper in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55875:39"/>
the day of his cleanſing.</hi> Moreover, it is acknowledged by the words of Almighty God, that in the Legal times Lepers were cleanſed, <hi>ver. 3. And the Prieſt ſhall go forth out of the Camp</hi> (ſaith the Lord to <hi>Moſes) and the Prieſt ſhall look, and behold, if the plague of Leproſie be healed in the Leper.</hi> Hence by comparing the words in <hi>Moſes</hi> with the ſpeech of our Saviour Chriſt, the one acknowledging Lepers to have been healed, and the Form thereupon of their cleanſing preſcribed, the other denying any then to have been cleanſed, but <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> we are taught to finde aneaſie way out of this appearing Labyrinth, and which doth exactly fit the cure of the REKETS by looking up to God; by whoſe hand we muſt know many untoucht by man were heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; although by mans Art and Power, until our Saviour came, no Leper was cured. It is moſt apparent to our eyes, that very many children labouring under the REKETS, have recovered in their Limbs, Ribs, Heads, and Body, but ſuch as enjoy this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, are not made partakers thereof by Phyſical helps. For we deceive our ſelves, while we think, whatſoever is applied to ſuch children, in ſuch a time in which it pleaſeth the Lord to be in healing them, to be the very cauſes of their recovery. As it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſs, that ſuch medicines which are applied unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſick of <hi>Agues</hi> or <hi>Toothe-ache,</hi> although moſt of them are known to be of no force againſt thoſe griefs at all, if in the uſe of ſuch Applications, the Agues and Tooth-ache leave ſuch Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which ever almoſt ſooner or later go away of themſelves, are famed for moſt approved Helps againſt the ſaid Diſeaſes. Whence ariſeth ſuch a multitude of Falſe Remedies againſt thoſe and other Griefs. And, if it be peradventure of little credit moſt confidently to proteſt mine own experience, which here I do, of the Remedies againſt the Rekets, were it a Naturall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, and ſuch as thoſe which write of it report it to be, applied by me, before the Lord gave me this knowledge, to have been without the leaſt ſucceſs, let the anxious Reader conſider and weigh, that ſome have been healed without the leaſt Application
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55875:39"/>
of Natural means, others have died of that diſeaſe, others have retained the Symptomes ſtill, againſt all uſe of means. Of the Firſt kinde of whom Almighty God is pleaſed (bleſſed be his Name) to make my little Son a welcome Example.</p>
               <p>Wherefore by the way I adviſe every man, in the fear of the Lord, and for the foregoing Reaſons, to abſtain from <hi>Humane help</hi> in the REKETS, as the Jews did moſt religiouſly in their <hi>Leproſie;</hi> and to implore Divine aſſiſtance by Prayer and Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For as in the <hi>Leproſie,</hi> when our Saviour was come and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his work he came about of our Redemption, firſt leprous perſons were healed, afterward all Leproſie vaniſhed, ſo when He our Gracious K. CHARLES <hi>II</hi> who now is come, hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the work he is come to do of <hi>Reformation,</hi> the Diſeaſe of the REKETS will be heard of no more in the Land.</p>
               <p>But this may not be expected from our Royal Soveraign now, at his firſt coming into his Kingdom, until that ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed which undoubtedly by Gods grace will be; for till the things typified are come the Types will remain. Thus the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie and the cure thereof did ſo deſigne our Saviour the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian of Soul and Body, and ſo point at him as it were with the finger, that unto the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> who ſent to know of him, whether he were the Meſſias, he gave no other anſwer, but bid them tell <hi>John,</hi> that the Lepers were cleanſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet notwithſtanding was not the Leproſie taken away till after his Paſſion, when the Type was fulfilled.</p>
               <p>His Royal Majeſty ſhall take away the Diſeaſe of the <hi>Rekets</hi> in two kindes, Firſt, the Typified <hi>Rekets,</hi> and each Symptome thereof, removing from us that which he hath put his Royal Hand to already, the <hi>Pining</hi> of our even famiſhed <hi>Body</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> ſo that betwixt the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> there ſhall be a due and meet <hi>Proportion,</hi> By whoſe Gracious Favour, neither the <hi>Doubling</hi> of the <hi>Joynts</hi> of <hi>Armies</hi> with their <hi>Generals</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,</hi> nor of the <hi>Parliament</hi> with their <hi>Subſtitutes,</hi> not the <hi>Ribs doubled</hi> in multiplying <hi>Ships</hi> to guard our <hi>Seas,</hi> or <hi>Garriſons</hi> to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55875:40"/>
fortiſie our <hi>Land-Coaſts.</hi> Theſe will not be needful. The <hi>Lord</hi> will reſtore unto us, as he promiſed the Jews by his Prophet, our <hi>Judges</hi> as at the firſt, and our <hi>Counſellors both Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> as in the beginning. The <hi>Two Legs, Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhall be no more <hi>crooked</hi> and <hi>unjuſt,</hi> but <hi>upright.</hi> The <hi>Breaſt-plate, Armour</hi> and <hi>Ships</hi> in great number ſhall be <hi>put off,</hi> and <hi>layd by,</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> ſhall not <hi>fly</hi> away. The Childe of <hi>England</hi> ſhall be <hi>healed</hi> of all her Maladies; Her <hi>teeth</hi> ſhall no more <hi>hide</hi> themſelves, yea, the <hi>ſound teeth</hi> of Orthodox and <hi>unblameable Preachers</hi> ſhall <hi>fill</hi> their <hi>empty places.</hi> The <hi>ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Heads</hi> of the People ſhall <hi>purge</hi> their <hi>own corruption.</hi> In ſuch manner as when our Saviour did cleanſe the Lepers, he did ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thereby the taking away of ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God Almighty hath ordained our Lord King CHARLES II to take away the <hi>Typical Rekets,</hi> even the <hi>Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſeaſe</hi> it ſelf. And as our Saviour cured Both the <hi>Typified leproſie of ſin,</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment</hi> by his <hi>Suffering;</hi> and the <hi>Typicall</hi> in <hi>Perſons</hi> firſt, and took the <hi>Leproſie</hi> away at laſt, and <hi>He</hi> and none but <hi>He</hi> could do it, ſo King CHARLES II, firſt taking away the ſignified <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> by his Gracious <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Wiſedom,</hi> ſhall take the <hi>Bodily Rekets</hi> quite away, when this work is done; which the LORD haſten. And his Majeſty hath given us a great Eſſay thereof already, in his Gracious Aſſent to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding the Army, in his Edicts againſt Drunkenneſs and Riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude concerning the REKETS; As the <hi>Leproſie</hi> was ſuch a Diſeaſe which infected no other Nation, but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (excepting <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> intimating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that Chriſt ſhould by his Death cleanſe the Leproſie of the ſins of the Gentiles) and ſeems by <hi>Tacitus</hi> the Hiſtorians words to be imputed to them, and no other Nation beſide, although he falſly concludes, that for ſuch a Diſeaſe they were drove out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> So is the REKETS the proper Diſeaſe unto the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to the Kings Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55875:40"/>
and to no other people beſide, unleſs living in his Majeſties Kingdoms. And as the Leproſie did portend the Phyſician thereof ſhould be the Lords Chriſt our King, ſo doth the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KETS point at the Lords Anointed to be the Healer thereof our King.</p>
               <p>But my Reader peradventure will ſay, This being all granted to be true, and that all this muſt be performed by a King, yet it ſtill remaineth doubtfull, by what King all theſe things ſhall be wrought. The reſolving of which doubt by neceſſity brings me to examine the other ſtrange Diſeaſe the KINGS-EVIL. Theſe two Diſeaſes do portend and foreſhew one and the ſame thing, the greatneſs of our <hi>calamities</hi> Both and that we ſhall be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them through the mighty <hi>Hand</hi> of the moſt merciful <hi>God.</hi> For is it not a very wonderfull thing, and above the thoughts of man, among all other Infirmities of the REKETS, perfectly cured in like manner, to ſee and conſider the <hi>crooked bones</hi> of Arms and Legs to become <hi>ſtraight</hi> of their own accord? Albeit the Wiſe-man ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ. 1. 15. That which is crooked cannot be made ſtraight.</hi> Touching the cure of the <hi>Struma,</hi> no man of judgement can deny the Hand of God therein. Which Two Maladies, as in part they do agree, ſo do they alſo thus differ; the REKETS beſide the Diſeaſe ſheweth who ſhould be the <hi>Authors</hi> of our evils, under the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Diſeaſe;</hi> the KINGS-EVIL, who ſhould cure us, with the <hi>Title</hi> of his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Again, the REKETS explaineth Fully what the KINGS-EVIL delivereth more Briefly, and this is to be done by one Perſon, our Dread Soveraign, who by the Grace of God given unto him, as he healeth the <hi>Bruiſes</hi> and <hi>Putrified</hi> Sores of thoſe whom he toucheth, will take away the <hi>Falſneſs</hi> of Doctrine and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> in Religion, Injuſtice, Oppreſſion in the <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>wicked living</hi> from all. Which may well be ſignified by <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>putrid Ulcers,</hi> by a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> name: becauſe theſe things proceed from a Diſeaſed Soul, are <hi>loathſome</hi> and odious to God and man, and <hi>ſtink</hi> in their noſtrils. To prove therefore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55875:41"/>
King CHARLES II and no other to be that King which ſhall perform thoſe great things in <hi>England,</hi> it will be neceſſary to ſhew this unto you by Example of the <hi>Leproſie,</hi> and thereof who was or were the <hi>Firſt</hi> Cleanſers, and who the <hi>laſt,</hi> that ſo in like manner, Who he was who firſt cured the KINGS-EVIL being known, we may know the <hi>laſt,</hi> and he that was <hi>preſaged</hi> thereby. The <hi>Firſt</hi> Cleanſer of the <hi>Leper</hi> was the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as appears in <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. But the Perſon <hi>foreſhewn</hi> thereby was our Saviour <hi>Chriſt, a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedech.</hi> From which Example of the Leproſie, <hi>two Rules</hi> are to be laid down. 1. That the <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Antitype</hi> be both <hi>alike.</hi> 2. That there be as <hi>much,</hi> and <hi>more</hi> in the <hi>Antitype</hi> than in the <hi>Type,</hi> in the moſt perfect <hi>Antitype.</hi> As in the Precedent of the Leproſie; The <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Antitype</hi> were Both to be <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and not ſo on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (I ſpeak of the Perſons) but leſt it might be thought, that any of the Prieſts the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſucceeding the Firſt Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer before Chriſt, might be the Perſon prefigured, therefore a more excellent Prieſt was to be ſtill expected, not ſuch an one as <hi>offered</hi> up Buls and Goats, like the Typical Prieſts, but <hi>himſelf</hi> once for all. According to which two <hi>Rules,</hi> our Dear Lord King CHARLES II is the <hi>Antitype</hi> unto the <hi>Firſt Curer</hi> of the KINGS-EVIL, But becauſe Chriſt had many Types of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf which being put together did ſo deſcribe him, that no man might miſtake him when he was come, for he was not fully prefigured by Prieſts, but partly by Prophets, by their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling, their raiſing the dead, as <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> did, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſedom, <hi>Jonas's</hi> being in the Fiſhes belly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But our Lord the King having no ſuch Types of him, beſide the Firſt healer of the KINGS-EVIL, as our Saviour had, therefore his whole Type is pourtrayed in <hi>Edward the Confeſſor.</hi> Secondly, it will follow that more muſt be in the Cure of our Soveraign the <hi>Antitype,</hi> then was in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Type, from the ſecond Rule, leſt ſome other of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> might be thought <hi>Edwards</hi> Antitype: but in the outward and bodily cure they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55875:41"/>
are alike and equal, therefore that more in the Antitype muſt be of thoſe fore-named things ſignified thereby. I now will ſhew you according to the Firſt Rule, a Full Equality betwixt King <hi>Edward</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> ſo that no other King but King <hi>Charles</hi> II can be the parallel to his Royal Predeceſſor King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Confeſſor.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> was baniſhed his Countrey, ſo was our Liege Lord King <hi>Charles.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> was ſent for to come and govern, thus was our Dread Soveraign hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreated by Both his Houſes of Parliament, to Aſſume the Government of his Kingdomes, and was ſent for. And how <hi>welcome</hi> our King was unto the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who expected re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution into their places, and to all Miniſters which before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be deprived of all maintenance, as they were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and how far above the welcome of King <hi>Edward the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor</hi> to his, who felt and feared no ſuch evil, the different rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will plainly determine. And with what gladneſs of heart his <hi>Subjects</hi> received King <hi>Charles,</hi> after their intolerable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and never otherwiſe likely to be removed, no man can doubt, nor can tongue expreſs; but their <hi>Preſents,</hi> their <hi>Triumphs,</hi> their <hi>Attendance,</hi> their inceſſant <hi>Shouts</hi> and <hi>Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> as in a continued Street from <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>London</hi> of yong and old, to ſee their King, do plainly teſtifie. But above all King <hi>Edward the Confeſſor</hi> was the Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the Martyr; even ſo our Gracious K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Confeſſor was Son to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr. And leſt it trouble my Reader to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how <hi>Edward the Confeſſor</hi> may be called the ſon of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> ſince in property of ſpeech, and by general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he is not the <hi>Son,</hi> but <hi>Nephew</hi> and brothers ſon to <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Martyr.</hi> All this notwithſtanding <hi>Edward the Confeſſor</hi> by the Phraſe of Holy Scripture (which we for the moſt part follow, and ought to follow in this Divine interpretation) is the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Martyr.</hi> For we reade, 1 <hi>Chro 3 16. And the ſons of Joakim, Jeconiah his ſon, Zedekiah his ſon,</hi> when indeed and in nature <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was not the ſon but the uncle of <hi>Jeconiah;</hi> but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55875:42"/>
cauſe <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was <hi>Jeconiahs</hi> Succeſſor, he is called his ſon; as by the ſame rule, <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor</hi> being Succeſſor to <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Martyr</hi> is called <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Martyrs</hi> Son. And yet a farther reaſon thereof common to both is, That in orderly and legal Succeſſion the ſon of either ought to have ſucceeded his Father, that is, of <hi>Jeconiah,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Martyr.</hi> Here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is brought in the ſecond Rule in ſome part, <hi>Edward</hi> was ſtiled the <hi>Martyr</hi> only (as it is declared) becauſe he was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered innocently, <hi>Edward</hi> was ſir-named the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> becauſe he was a Pious and Charitable man, and enacted good Laws. But for far better cauſe is our Royal Soveraign King <hi>Charles</hi> I named the <hi>Martyr,</hi> which name his Majeſty took unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is ſo intitled in the Writings of Learned men, and is ſo to be accounted, for giving Teſtimony with his blood to that which in the ſecret thoughts of his heart he judged to be the Truth. King <hi>Charles</hi> II our Gracious Soveraign for better cauſe then his Predeceſſor King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that name, for his Majeſty hath made a Holy and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Confeſſion</hi> with his mouth. Wherefore I moſt humbly Almighty God, in whoſe hand are the hearts of Kings, ſo to diſpoſe his Majeſties heart, and I humbly beſeech his Majeſty to be entreated that he will not ſuffer ſuch men who have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened their mouths in vows to the Moſt High God to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced either to revoke that which cannot be recalled, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pious, skilful and faithful laborers, for that cauſe to be excluded from working in the Lords Harveſt. And I do with confidence believe, that my prayer is heard in heaven, and will be upon the earth.</p>
               <p>Whereunto (if there be need of more marks which may ſhew, that King <hi>Charles</hi> II was deſigned to be the Antitype of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor)</hi> though the diſtance of time betwixt them be the ſpace of 600 years or more; for <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi> died about the year 1066. having reigned much about the time of twenty three years.

               <p>Now according to Example in the Balm, according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and reaſon, as that precious oyle ceaſt to be when Chriſt had ſuffered, and as the ſubſtance being come, the ſhadow goes away, and there is no reaſon to expect a ſigne when the thing ſignified thereby is now come, I conclude, that our Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign will be the laſt of the Kings of this Nation, to whom God will give the gift of healing the KINGS-EVIL.</p>
               <p>Now Reader take here notice of the Pride, Malice, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety of the Devil, and his Emulation of Almighty God, who hath ſo wound himſelf into the mindes of Impoſtors, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row them into the perſwaſions of the ignorant and rude multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that the <hi>ſeventh ſon</hi> in order from the firſt, without any daughter born betwixt is able to <hi>cure</hi> that Diſeaſe which we call the KINGS-EVIL. And this Impoſture is frequently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and performed by ſtroaking with the hand, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter thereof is called a <hi>Stroaker.</hi> This I ſay, is attributed by ſome to a <hi>ſeventh ſon,</hi> by others to a <hi>ſeventh ſon of a ſeventh ſon.</hi> Which, albeit a lye from the father of lies the devil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly proceeding, doth nevertheleſs declare the devils <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and fore-knowledge of our Royal Soveraign King
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55875:43"/>
CHARLES II his <hi>virtue.</hi> And as the Lord will win glory unto himſelf from all Creatures, and all Things; for to this purpoſe they were by him created, ſo will he likewiſe from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and his practices, even to illuſtrate and confirm, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the mindes of the Serpent, his Glory, and Truth. This is the matter; the Prerogative which the Lord hath given to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and among, but far above them to our Dread Soveraign <hi>Charles</hi> II, the devil having a foreſight of, in his counſell which he giveth to Impoſtors, doth ſecretly thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and yet defaceth, but not wholly, by adding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of his own. For it is true, that a <hi>ſeventh ſon</hi> of a <hi>ſeventh</hi> is indued with Power from above, not only to <hi>cure</hi> the bodily malady called the KINGS-EVIL, as others have had, but to take away the <hi>Evil of the Kingdom,</hi> and is his Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which none of his Predeceſſors have had. This Profeſſion of curing this Malady is held out ordinarily in this form, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>ſeventh ſon without a daughter</hi> born betwixt them cures the KINGS-EVIL. In which expreſſion the devil, as he hath wont to do, abuſeth the truth three waies: 1. By <hi>ſpeaking am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguouſly,</hi> as he did uſe in the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> leaving it uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether Son be in thoſe words to be taken according to the common acception of the word, or otherwiſe. 2. By <hi>leaving</hi> out ſome <hi>part</hi> of the matter (which notwithſtanding ſometimes I have heard uſed, and which ſerves to diſcovery of the truth) and that is theſe words, <hi>of a ſeventh.</hi> 3. By <hi>adding</hi> words thereto whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>falſe,</hi> ſuch are, without a daughter born betwixt, and putting <hi>Son</hi> after ſeventh, ſo making it to be, of a ſeventh ſon. Thus did Satan ſpeak doutfully, when he told our firſt parents, They <hi>ſhould be as God,</hi> or <hi>Gods knowing good and evil.</hi> The word there ſignifying <hi>God,</hi> and alſo <hi>damned Spirits,</hi> and knowing good and evil to be interpreted both knowledge of <hi>ſpeculation,</hi> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>feeling, joy</hi> and <hi>ſorrow,</hi> the later of which, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> felt, as did thoſe loſt Angels. As for <hi>leaving</hi> out <hi>part</hi> of the truth, the Devil was guilty thereof, when ſpeaking unto our
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55875:43"/>
Saviour to faſt himſelf down from a pinnacle of the Temple, he uſed this expreſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down; For it is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone;</hi> in which words taken out of <hi>Pſa.</hi> 91. 11, 12, theſe words are left out by the devil, <hi>to keep thee in all thy waies.</hi> Laſtly, by <hi>adding words</hi> the devil corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the truth, which he did when he ſpake unto <hi>Saul,</hi> unto the truth which he ſpake in part by aujoyning lies. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. <hi>And the Lord hath done by him</hi> (ſaith the devil concerning <hi>David</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>as he ſpake by me,</hi> which was <hi>falſe;</hi> for the Lord ſpake not ſo by the Devil, but by the true <hi>Samuel.</hi> What I affirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That a <hi>ſeventh ſon</hi> of a ſeventh ſhall <hi>cure</hi> the KINGS-EVIL, and to be underſtood in ſuch manner as aboveſaid of the Perſon of King <hi>Charles</hi> II, doth thus appear. Account all the <hi>Deſcents</hi> from father to ſon, that is in a right line, from King <hi>Henry</hi> VII to our Dread <hi>Soveraign</hi> now reigning, taking and including both terms, we ſhall finde them to be <hi>ſeven;</hi> ſo that our <hi>Soveraign</hi> laſt in order is the <hi>ſeventh ſon of a ſeventh,</hi> underſtand <hi>Henry.</hi> For it is common in Scripture not to call the grandchildren ſons only, as <hi>Joſiah</hi> is ſaid <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 11. to have begotten <hi>Jeconiah,</hi> but thoſe which <hi>after many generations</hi> have come out of the loins of a man, by the name of ſons to ſuch a one; as the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of <hi>Eſau.</hi> But more nearly to our purpoſe, <hi>Enoch</hi> is called the <hi>ſeventh</hi> from <hi>Adam Jude</hi> 14. in which place <hi>ſon</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. For <hi>Henry</hi> VII is the <hi>Firſt, Margarite</hi> his daughter Q, to <hi>James</hi> IV. King of <hi>Scotland</hi> the <hi>Second, James</hi> V the <hi>third. Mary</hi> Q. of <hi>Scotland</hi> his daughter the <hi>Fourth, James</hi> VI King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> the <hi>fifth,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> I, the <hi>ſixth,</hi> K. <hi>Charles</hi> II, the <hi>ſeventh.</hi> And this is a good Argument to prove that King <hi>Charles</hi> II the <hi>ſeventh of a ſea earth</hi> is not to be underſtood ſo to cure the <hi>Kings-evil</hi> as in a literal ſence, which ſome of theſe, and more of his Predeceſſors have done, but in ſome ſpeciall and myſtical way, as I have declared. And this computation agrees in another account; if we reckon by the <hi>daughter</hi> of Queen <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garite</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:55875:44"/>
and her iſſue; for Queen <hi>Margarite daughter</hi> to King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry VII,</hi> firſt married to King <hi>James IV,</hi> had iſſue <hi>James V,</hi> after married to <hi>Archibald Douglas</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> by him had iſſue <hi>Margarite.</hi> As King <hi>Henry VII</hi> the <hi>firſt, Margarite</hi> Queen to King <hi>James IV</hi> the <hi>ſecond, Margarite</hi> her daughter by <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> and Wife to <hi>Matthew Stuart</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenoix</hi> the <hi>third; Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Darley</hi> her ſon, husband to <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> the <hi>fourth,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> his ſon King of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> the <hi>fifth,</hi> King <hi>Charles I</hi> the <hi>ſixth,</hi> King <hi>Charles II</hi> the <hi>ſeventh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For which cauſe I do humbly beſeech the Kings Majeſty, that a Law may be enacted by the King and his Parliament, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment of ſuch diabolical impoſtures, as this is which is frequently committed in this land by ſeventh ſons taking upon them the Royal Prerogative of our Kings, with the touch of their hands to cure the <hi>Kings-evil.</hi> For the practice here of tends much to the diſhonour of God, and of our good King, and to the deluſion of his Majeſties Subjects.</p>
               <p>But one thing more touching the <hi>Rekets</hi> muſt not be forgotten, that is to ſay, the <hi>time</hi> when that Diſeaſe firſt ſeized upon Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in this Kingdome, and had that name of <hi>Rekets</hi> given unto it. It was the <hi>third year</hi> after our Royall <hi>Soveraigns Nativity,</hi> or the next unto it, when the weekly <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Mortality</hi> mentioned <hi>one</hi> to have been <hi>buried</hi> of the <hi>Rekets</hi> in the <hi>Moneth</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and no mention thereof in any of the ſaid Bils before that time. As I have found by ſearch in the <hi>Pariſh Clerks Regiſter</hi> kept in their Hall. For as the time when <hi>Darius</hi> took the <hi>Babylonian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> is expreſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 31. to be, when he was <hi>about threeſcore and two years old,</hi> that the Jews might obſerve (as judiciouſly <hi>H. Broughton</hi> hath noted upon that place) that at the time they were carried into captivity, which was about the time of <hi>Darius</hi> his <hi>birth,</hi> the Jews might then know the Lord had a <hi>Deliverer born</hi> for them, So the Nation of <hi>England</hi> may learn Gods ſpecial care, that he did not ſend them the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> of the <hi>Rekets,</hi> till <hi>He</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:55875:44"/>
was <hi>born</hi> who ſhould <hi>free</hi> them from the <hi>Miſeries</hi> ſignifyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and from the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> it ſelf. Hitherto of the <hi>Kings-Evil</hi> as it pertaineth to the King and Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas I ſaid, The ſins and calamities of this Nation with the Cauſers of them were pointed at by the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> of the <hi>Rekets,</hi> and not the Name of our <hi>Deliverer,</hi> but in the other the <hi>Kings-Evil,</hi> yet notwithſtanding it doth appear who ſhall be our <hi>Deliverer,</hi> albeit not in the Name of the Diſeaſe, or the Symptomes of the <hi>Rekets,</hi> yet in the <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>Perſons</hi> which are troubled therewith. The Patients ſo afflicted are <hi>Children</hi> and no other; partly, but not principally, that we might be left without all pretence of any other <hi>inferior cauſe,</hi> but be conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to look up to the Hand which hath ſmitten us; and yet we will not, but in deſpight of reaſon ſeek about after this and that cauſe moſt vainly. Again, partly it is to let us underſtand, that the afflictions foreſhewn thereby ſhould fall upon the childe of <hi>God.</hi> Thirdly and principally, the <hi>Rekets</hi> is laid on <hi>children,</hi> that by the quality of the <hi>perſon afflicted</hi> by it, it being the <hi>childs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe</hi> we may underſtand him that ſhall <hi>free</hi> us from it, and what is ſignified thereby. As it is called the <hi>Kings-evil,</hi> not becauſe it is cauſed by, or laid upon, but <hi>cured</hi> by the <hi>King;</hi> So is it called and to be called the <hi>Childes diſeaſe,</hi> becauſe a <hi>childe</hi> ſhall <hi>heal</hi> it. Surely you will ask me, What childe? We finde in Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that our Saviour hath called himſelf barely by the name of the <hi>Son; If the Son ſhall make you free</hi> (ſaith our Savior) <hi>you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> And ſince we finde that God doth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his own Name to <hi>Princes,</hi> calling them <hi>Gods,</hi> and hence it ſeems to have been firſt uſed among Princes to name themſelves in the plural number, though ſingle, by the word <hi>we</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating as it were the Lord Almighty who is <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Three,</hi> he doth ſeem to expreſs by this word the <hi>childes Diſeaſe,</hi> the Diſeaſe of the <hi>childe above</hi> all <hi>other</hi> children, the <hi>childe</hi> a <hi>ſon</hi> of the <hi>King.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which manner the <hi>ſon</hi> and <hi>daughter</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>infante</hi> and <hi>infanta,</hi> that is, the <hi>ſon</hi> and <hi>daughter childe,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

well enough expreſt alone to underſtand what ſon and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is meant thereby. So when we ſay, the <hi>childes Diſeaſes</hi>

How great a matter of comfort is hereby adminiſtred unto us that are the people of the land, that the Lord is ſo pleaſed, that the King ſhall not <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> the making us a happy nation to his old age, but go about it and perfect the Lords work while he is <hi>yong?</hi> Secondly, here is an Argument of Almighty Gods great <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> that he ſhould frame his Majeſties heart to clemency, as not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him although his Royal <hi>Father</hi> was murthered, to break out in <hi>cruel</hi> and unjuſt <hi>revenge.</hi> It is the <hi>Lords doing,</hi> and it is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in our eyes.</p>
               <p>And leſt any man ſhould thus object, This <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets</hi> is common to <hi>women</hi> children as well as to <hi>men,</hi> as that it ſhould not ſeem thereby to point at a cure to be performed by the King in regard of the ſex, as to be performed by the <hi>ſon</hi> more than the <hi>daughter</hi> of a King; let him take a view of thoſe great Types of our Savior the <hi>Prophets,</hi> whereof although the moſt part were <hi>men,</hi> yet were there among them Prophets of another ſex, ſome alſo <hi>Propheteſſes, Miriam, Deborah, Huldah,</hi> and <hi>Types</hi> of our Savior <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I will not diſpute here the reaſon thereof in them, but great cauſe there is that this <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> ſhould be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to <hi>both ſexes.</hi> Firſt, becauſe it is laid upon us by the Lord as a <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> and ſo indifferently to lye upon both ſexes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their parents ſin. Secondly, to premoniſh us how the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55875:45"/>
                  <hi>Afflictions</hi> and Calamities ſhould lye hard upon women as well as men.</p>
               <p>But yet as the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Propheteſſes</hi> both aimed at a <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come who was a <hi>male</hi> (who ſometime by ceremony was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be ſuch, as in the <hi>Paſchal lamb</hi> enjoyned to be a <hi>male</hi> of the flock) ſo did and do both <hi>males</hi> and <hi>females</hi> in this <hi>childes Diſeaſe</hi> point out unto us a <hi>Son</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>King</hi> to be our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it remains, that I give the like account concerning the <hi>Struma,</hi> as it is healed by the touch of the hand of the <hi>French</hi> King. Which healing in ſuch manner <hi>Guido, Tagautius,</hi> and <hi>Laurentius</hi> ſpecially, French Authors do averr, and <hi>Sennertus</hi> a famous and very judicious Phyſician of <hi>Germany</hi> acknowledgeth in his Cure of the <hi>Struma,</hi> but unjuſtly aſcribeth the work by a Divine Diſpenſation to the French King only. Of which brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly. As thoſe calamities and corrupt ſores which ſhall be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and healed by King <hi>Charles</hi> II in the kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> in ſuch manner muſt certainly the putrid ſores, and bruiſes, and wounds be healed in the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> For the Diſeaſe is one in both Kingdomes, the Form of healing the ſame, by the Touch, and the Healers of like Dignity being Kings, as to ſhew unto us, theſe things ſhall be accompliſhed by the hands of a King. But as in theſe fore-named things there is a Parity in the healing of the <hi>Kings-evil</hi> by the King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>French</hi> King, ſo is there a Difference in the qualifications of the firſt Healers. For the Firſt Healer of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> was not the Son of a Martyr, as was our Soveraign; but the French Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries tell us, how <hi>Clovis</hi> the Firſt of that name, and Fifth King of <hi>France,</hi> who reigned about the year of our Lord 500. had firſt of the Kings of that Kingdom, this gift of healing the <hi>Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> (which ſince we call the <hi>Kings-evil)</hi> beſtowed upon him. And what was this King? The Story tels us, That he was firſt a Heathen and an Idolater, and being afterward converted to the Chriſtian faith, then this great gift of healing the <hi>Struma</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:55875:46"/>
was from the Mercy and Power of God beſtowed upon him, which hath continued thorow the ſeveral families of their Kings unto them all, even to this day. This King <hi>Clovis</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who firſt <hi>cured</hi> this Evil in <hi>France,</hi> is to be the Type, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Example in <hi>England,</hi> of him that is to be the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype in <hi>France,</hi> to do all thoſe fore-named things which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured thereby; after which time alſo no King of <hi>France</hi> ſhall be able to heal in ſuch a manner the foreſaid Malady. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I conclude, When the <hi>French</hi> King, or King of <hi>France,</hi> from being ſuch a one as King <hi>Clovis</hi> was, becomes and is <hi>turned</hi> ro ſuch a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> indeed, as he was after ſtiled, then at that time by ſuch a King of <hi>France</hi> ſhall the <hi>wounds, bruiſes,</hi> and putrid <hi>ſoars</hi> of that diſtreſſed <hi>Kingdom</hi> be healed. I need not here be large; but by what hath already been ſaid, will the Judicious Reader underſtand, that I mean the corruptions of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and by ſuch a King who is of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth for ſalvation only upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Head.</hi> Nevertheleſs, to determine what Perſon individually ſhall be that King, who ſhall there perform that great and incredible work, by what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Type, is not ſo eaſie a thing; becauſe the Antitype (if what I aſſert be granted) doth not declare what that man ſhall be, nor at what time it ſhall be done. For if the Antitype muſt neceſſarily anſwer to the Type (may ſome ſay) as the Type is of a ſingle Perſon, who firſt was an Ethnick, and afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Chriſtian, ſo ought the Perſon which ſhall perform theſe great matters be a ſingle Perſon, who from a falſe religion ſhall be converted to the true. To which objections I make this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That although it be not clearly contained in the Type, when and by what Perſon or Perſons, King or Kings of <hi>France</hi> theſe works ſhall be brought to paſs, yet other circumſtances there are pertaining thereunto, which help to ſignifie both Time and Perſon. For Almighty God, when he is pleaſed to work deliverances for his people, is wont ſooner or later to expreſs the <hi>Time</hi> when ſuch mercies ſhall be wrought, and who ſhall be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55875:46"/>
the <hi>Deliverer.</hi> That nothing may be wanting to the <hi>comfort</hi> of the Lords people, and that his children may follow and <hi>cleave</hi> unto thoſe that are ſo appointed to be their <hi>deliverers.</hi> That the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be no longer ſervants in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but that in the Fourth Generation they ſhould come out from thence, it was foretold <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15. and that <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould bring them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> God called them by name, <hi>Exo.</hi> 6. 26. The abiding of the Jews in <hi>Chaldea</hi> was determined to be for 70 years, and their Deliverer <hi>Cyrus</hi> by name expreſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not without precedent when God hath appointed Salvation, and a Saviour, to name the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Perſon,</hi> as well as the thing. But where it is laid down for a Rule, That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype muſt be a ſingle Perſon, as well as the Type; this I deny. Becauſe the Type of a ſingle Perſon may prefigure One or More, according to the nature of the things. <hi>Adam</hi> a ſingle Perſon was the Type of all man-kinde. The <hi>Image</hi> of one mans Perſon ſeen by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a Type of the <hi>ſeveral Princes</hi> of the four enſuing Monarchies. So the meaning of the Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Struma</hi> by King <hi>Clevis,</hi> when of a Heathen he turned a Chriſtian, is to this effect. When a King of <hi>France</hi> from the falſe ſhall be of the true Reformed Religion, then ſhall by ſuch a King theſe evils of that Kingdom be taken away. Which may be affirmed, both when the ſame Perſon is converted, and when another King of the true Religion comes in the room of a former of the falſe. Having therefore this liberty, to place the Antitype of King <hi>Clovis</hi> either on Two Kings, or elſe on One, as need requires, I here place it upon Two, and of all Kings, upon King <hi>Levis</hi> the 14, and King CHARLES <hi>II</hi> our reigning So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, the later of which by being inthron'd King of <hi>France,</hi> God our Mighty and Merciful Lord will enable and encline to do thoſe great things. For as the Things fore-named ſhall moſt certainly be brought to paſſe by a King of <hi>France,</hi> the Lord hath left the reſt touching the <hi>Time</hi> when, and the <hi>Performer</hi> who, to be collected from probable Arguments. Which probable
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55875:47"/>
Arguments are all for, and none againſt our Gracious Soveraign, and by deſigning his Majeſty, the Time and Perſon are both made known. For it is not probable, that from the preſent <hi>French</hi> King ſuch fruit ſhall proceed, by his converſion to the Reformed Religion, or ſo eaſing the burthens of his Subjects, having ſeized already lately on <hi>Aurange</hi> and <hi>Marſeilles</hi> two great receptacles for thoſe of the Religion, and their ancient Liberties, and who ſtill threatneth <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here I muſt take leave to aſſume liberty to draw an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from that which is not yet fullfilled, but begun only, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it as already done. For thus doth S. <hi>Paul,</hi> from the certain converſion of the Jews, which was then to be, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his time, nor to this day fulfilled, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. perſwade the Chriſtians, not to deſpiſe that people, but account them as brethren. And the Holy Ghoſt aſſuring us of the burning of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> a thing not yet accompliſhed, adviſeth the people of God to leave that City, leſt they ſhould periſh with it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 4. Thus I having already declared and by the fore-going rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons proved, that K. <hi>Charles II</hi> will perform by Gods Grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly in <hi>England,</hi> all the promiſed matters, do by probable conjecture infer, that it ſhall in <hi>France</hi> be performed by him alſo. For to do ſuch great matters is not every day ſeen; None of all the Kings of <hi>France</hi> ſince King <hi>Clovis,</hi> nor <hi>French</hi> Kings have cured the putrid ſores of that Kingdom. None of the 27. Kings and Queens of <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Confeſſor</hi> have done that till now. Nor is it probable that any of the <hi>French</hi> Kings there educated would be of the Reformed Religion. And as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely it is, that any of thoſe Kings ſhould take away all the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in Juſtice and Manners. But, ſince it muſt be done, how probable may it ſeem, that it can be done by none elſe, but by him who hath done the like in <hi>England,</hi> and may do the ſame in <hi>France,</hi> unto which Kingdom he hath a moſt juſt Title? So much for my firſt Argument.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is not likely that God will honour him who hath
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55875:47"/>
not the right as him who hath the juſt Title to that Crown, with ſo glorious a work in that place. For the Crown of <hi>France</hi> by juſt Title is devolved upon our Gracious Soveraign from <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward III</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> in right of his mother Queen <hi>Iſabella.</hi> She was daughter unto <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> which <hi>Philip</hi> had three ſons ſucceſſively Kings of <hi>France,</hi> viz. <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wik Hutin, Philip</hi> the <hi>Tall,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fair;</hi> all which dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without iſſue, <hi>Iſabella</hi> their only ſiſter remaining alive was married unto <hi>Edward II</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> by whom ſhe had iſſue <hi>Edward III,</hi> to whom our Royal Soveraign is the next heir by deſcent from him. Againſt whoſe right the French do only pretend the <hi>Salique</hi> Law, by which no daughter of <hi>France</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Crown, but when and by what ſufficient authority there enacted, their Lawyers give us no ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>And the Reaſons why the <hi>Perſon</hi> is not ſo expreſly <hi>deſigned</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> as here before for <hi>England,</hi> are of moment. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by ſetting us to enquire after that Prince, who ſhall work ſo great a happineſs to that Kingdom, we are thereby driven to finde out the cauſes for which moſt probably God may give (as He hath formerly given Kingdoms to Princes, and extraordinary poſſeſſions to others) Princes ſuch an opportunity and bleſſing, we may thereby light upon the very Perſon. For God hath made all things for his own Glory, and all men, but ſpecially Princes, induing them for that purpoſe with great power, and thoſe which ſuffer great things for his ſake, and ſtand for him and love his people, he ſeldome ſends them away without ſome am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple recompence in this life. Yet it was needful that the King whom the Lord had appointed for the <hi>happineſs</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be more clearly <hi>diſcovered,</hi> as it hath pleaſed God to do touching our Royall Soveraign. For who could conjecture, that a Prince who had been ſo exceedingly enraged by the wickedneſs of ſome, ſhould be ſo merciful as to ſpare his cruel enemies, and to be ſo loving and merciful to his people, ſo tender toward thoſe whoſe conſciences cannot admit that for fear of man, which their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55875:48"/>
ſincere love to God made them to deny, if God had not more expreſly ſhewn King CHARLES <hi>II</hi> to be that Good Prince? For which cauſe the King which ſhall be the <hi>Deliverer</hi> of <hi>France</hi> is more <hi>obſcurely figured,</hi> becauſe he is already diſcovered in the Type of <hi>Englands</hi> Helper. 2. Becauſe the aſſurance of what ſhall be by our Soveraign done in <hi>France</hi> to Gods people there (which cannot be until he rule there as King) ſhall appear unto his Royal Majeſty, when God ſhall move his Heart to begin in <hi>England</hi> firſt; ſo that the Lord would have him to haſten that great, weighty and heroick work.</p>
               <p>Now let us look back to the cauſes which the Lord ſeemeth to have reſpect unto in making King CHARLES ſo happy, and ſee if we can finde like Examples. Obſerve his unjuſt and cruel ſufferings. Shall a Prince, who, after the murther of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Father, under the pretence of Juſtice by the moſt <hi>unjuſt Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> which ever ſate in Judgement, and by feigned Holineſs, was baniſhed with the whole Royal Family as malefactors, and the King himſelf made a Traytor, and his precious life hunted after, ſhall his <hi>Innocence</hi> with the reſt of that Royal houſe, againſt none of whom the leaſt crime or cauſe was objected, only make his people happy? May a King who hath ſuffered ſuch <hi>wrongs,</hi> and done ſuch <hi>excellent</hi> things for God, and his people, expect no bleſſing, but a bare reſtitution? God owes no man any thing, but what we receive is of gift; yet the Lord Almighty hath not wont, but in ſuch caſes to ſhew his <hi>acceptance</hi> and make <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. Nebuchadrezzar</hi> for fighting againſt the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> which rejoyced at the captivity of the Jews, when they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried unto <hi>Rabylon,</hi> received the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt</hi> as a reward of his labor; <hi>Ezek. 29. ver. 18. Son of man, Nebuchad-rezzar King of Babylon cauſed his Army to ſerve a great ſervice againſt Tyrus; every head was made bald, and every ſhoulder was peeled, yet had he no wages nor his army for Tyrus; for the ſervice which he ſerved againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 19. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchad-rezzar King of Babylon, and he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55875:48"/>
ſhall take her multitude, and take her ſpoil, and take her prey, and it ſhall be the wages for his army.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 20. I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſerved againſt it, becauſe they wrought for me, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And did not the Lord beſtow upon Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed memory, for her <hi>impriſonment,</hi> for <hi>maintaining</hi> of Gods true <hi>Religion,</hi> for <hi>reſiſting</hi> the <hi>Spaniard, befriending</hi> the <hi>French</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the League, and <hi>protecting</hi> the <hi>Neatherlands,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland?</hi> For what of that Kingdom had all her Anceſtors who were called Lords, and Kings thereof, but charge and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, beſide a bare Title? But to her was the <hi>Kingdom conquer'd,</hi> and <hi>quieted,</hi> that, as the Author of the Hiſtory called <hi>Pacata Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernia</hi> in the Epiſtle to the Reader, ſpeaks, Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> might have it juſtly written upon her Tomb, <hi>Pacata Hibernia,</hi> or, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Tamed.</hi> But our Royal Soveraign is doing <hi>more,</hi> and hath begun it already, and <hi>ſuffered longer,</hi> and <hi>worſe,</hi> than ever Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did. Yet not thou, O <hi>Charles,</hi> but God which is in thee. Secondly, If we conſider his Majeſties <hi>Conſtancy</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> in the mids of his great Tentations. Shall K. <hi>Charles</hi> II, who was by wicked men <hi>baniſhed</hi> from his own Kingdome, forced to remain in the Dominions of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prince, ſuch a King, who by no <hi>Neceſſities,</hi> nor <hi>Sollicitations</hi> could be drawn to forſake God, to advance himſelf, ſhall he, I ſay, be <hi>miraculouſly preſerved</hi> in his eſcape from his cruel hunters, and more miraculouſly in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and only be kept to make us happy? God forbid. Had not <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whoſe bow abode in ſtrength, whom the archers ſorely grieved, ſhot at, and hated, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 49. 23, 24. a <hi>double portion</hi> to him and his poſterity? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 13. having one portion for that cauſe above his brethren given him by his father taken out of the hand of the <hi>Amorite</hi> with the ſword and with his bowe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 22. But our Soveraigns bowe abode as much and more in ſtrength, when for the ſollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Egyptian Romiſh</hi> harlot he ſtarted not aſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:55875:49"/>
Beſide in the very letters of their <hi>names</hi> there is a <hi>parity</hi> between the Type and Antitype (and this ſometime happeneth, not by chance but providence, as when <hi>Mary Aarons</hi> Siſter a virgin, and <hi>Jeſus Moſes</hi> ſucceſſor <hi>prefigured</hi> in deed and names the <hi>virgin Mary,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> our Savior) betwixt <hi>Clovis</hi> and C and <hi>Clovis,</hi> as to note, thoſe great evils ſhall be taken away when C and <hi>Lovis</hi> meet, as now they do.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Healing of the <hi>Kings-Evil</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and what is prefigured thereby thus far.</p>
               <p>If any of my Readers ſhall object, which doubtleſs moſt will do, that what I do preſage touching our Royal Soveraign and the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> is no more then probable; to him I will be bold to ſay, and let him well conſider, that even among the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Law, <hi>great Probabilities</hi> have the eſteem of <hi>Certainties,</hi> and according thereunto <hi>Sentence</hi> is pronounced by them. And we know, that in the difference of the two Harlots about a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving childe, who ſhould be the true mother thereof, when King <hi>Salomon</hi> gave ſentence on her ſide who ſhewed pity toward the Infant, as to be mother thereof, judgement thus given from <hi>probable</hi> conjecture, is ſaid to be the <hi>Wiſedom of God</hi> in him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 28. Or are our children known to be the <hi>fathers,</hi> but by <hi>probability?</hi> Yea, although we are enjoyned to <hi>give diligence to make our calling and election ſure,</hi> how few of the elect ever attained to that height in this life, that all his miſ-doubtings were taken away, and that he was fully <hi>aſſured</hi> of a future <hi>happineſſe?</hi> I muſt acknowledge that there are <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>likelineſs;</hi> ſome things which are probable are not yet firm enough to conclude, others of ſo high a degree of probability, that according to the example commended by the Spirit of God in <hi>Solomon,</hi> they are as ſtrong as the cleareſt certainties. And of that ſort of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things which are the ſtrongeſt or very near them, I here main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe ſore-named to be.</p>
               <p>Thus much pertaining to the cure of the <hi>Struma</hi> performed by the French King, and what is ſignified thereby. And here
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55875:49"/>
at laſt it will not be unſeaſonable to explain, what before was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch'd by me, whence it is that neither our Soveraign, nor yet the French King do heal of the <hi>Struma</hi> all that are touch'd by their hands. 2. That they do not likewiſe help ſuch as are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the Gout, Feavers, Palſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this <hi>Evil</hi> onely. 3. Kings of this Kingdom, and of the French nation, although they have erred in the faith, and have been of a falſe Church, have healed this Diſeaſe, as well as thoſe which have been ſound in the faith, and members of that true Church, of which Chriſt is Head, in which ſmall number our Royal Soveraign is one, and a principal. 4. That in ſome few although healed at preſent, the foreſaid diſeaſe through ſome occaſion breaks out again.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to the firſt Objection, firſt acknowledging, if the healing of this <hi>Evil,</hi> were perfectly miraculous, like unto thoſe cures wrought by our Saviour, it ſhould be perfect, in any of which our King ſhould lay his Royal hands, <hi>Joh. 7. 23. Are ye angry at me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>becauſe I made a man altogether whole upon the Sàbbath day;</hi> (Then was there no unſoundneſs left behinde) therefore we may conclude, this power given unto our Kings, was not for the ſame cauſe for which our Saviour and his Apoſtles healed the ſick. To the ſecond Objection, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that whereas our Saviour healed all that were ſick, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Apoſtles, yea, the <hi>Pool</hi> of <hi>Betheſda</hi> all with what infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſoever they were troubled, it was to ſignifie that which the Scripture elſewhere ſaith, <hi>He healeth</hi> all thy Diſeaſes, that is, all both outward and inward Diſeaſes, of which ſort are ſins ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Wherefore for ſome other diſtinct cauſe doth our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign cure the <hi>Struma</hi> only. Nevertheleſs it cannot be denied, that this vertue given to our Kings is miraculous, although not to perfection. To the next Objection, I ſay, That even mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles themſelves were wrought by the hands of the evil as well as the good ſometimes, For is it not written that at the laſt day, ſome reprobates ſhould ſay unto our Saviour, <hi>Have we not in thy Name caſt out devils?</hi> And this was given unto them, not as it

was unto the Apoſtles, who repreſented Chriſts perſon, and were as in Chriſts ſtead; ſo the gift of healing this Evil, becauſe it was given as a ſigne of what was to come, ſo much as they were Types in being Kings of ſuch a Kingdom, was given to the evil as well as to the good Kings. Thus to the laſt thing which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected I ſay, I cannot deny but to have known, how ſome after a long continued ſoundneſs and being cured of their mattury ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, have began to fall back into the ſame Diſeaſe, and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, but being touch'd again have recovered. All which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſtanding doth not diſprove the miraculous cure, but pointeth at ſomewhat elſe therein. Now to ſatisfie the firſt and ſecond objection to the full, Our Royal Soveraign doth not take away the <hi>Struma</hi> by that power which is given him from above, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a <hi>great</hi> evil, for there are greater which he cannot cure, nor yet becauſe it is a <hi>little</hi> one, as if his vertue could extend it ſelf to ſmall Diſeaſes, for we know there are leſs which he cannot take away, but for that this Diſeaſe which we call the <hi>Kings-evil</hi> is ſuch a malady which is <hi>parallel</hi> to the things which are <hi>ſignified,</hi> his Majeſty ſhall help; and other Diſeaſes are not like them. For what likeneſs is there in the <hi>Gout, Feavers,</hi> and <hi>Palſie,</hi> to the <hi>bruiſes,</hi> and putrid <hi>ſores</hi> full of <hi>corruption,</hi> of which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaketh, the <hi>corruption</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>manners leath ſome</hi> to the <hi>eyes,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory</hi> to the <hi>noſtrils</hi> of God and man? <hi>Eraſmus</hi> though torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Stone</hi> rejoyceth, that he did not ſuffer under ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe which might make his preſence <hi>leathed.</hi> But the <hi>Kings-evil</hi> we know hath <hi>bruiſes</hi> and putrid <hi>ſores,</hi> full of <hi>corruption.</hi> This Malady therefore the Providence of God did make choice of to demonſtrate what <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>afflictions</hi> our <hi>Royal Soveraign</hi> through Gods mercy will cure, not for it ſelf, nor for the ſick Patients ſakes, but for the cauſe of that which being moſt <hi>like</hi> unto it, was to be taken away. Nor is it done to perfection in all, ſome being remedileſs, which are touch'd, that we may know that corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in juſtice, unſoundneſs in faith and doctrine, ſhall not and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo univerſally taken away by our Good King, but that

ſome (do what he can) tares, and wicked men will continue among the wheat, and good men. And touching the laſt Objection, where it is ſaid, that ſome which have been healed of this <hi>Evil</hi> have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed,</hi> it doth indeed plainly inferr, that this healing of the <hi>Evil</hi> by our Kings muſt be in that reſpect different from the like mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of old. The ſmiting of the rock <hi>twiſe</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> was his <hi>ſin,</hi> as if the doing of it once had not been ſufficient, and the virtue of cauſing the water to flow out of the rock had been in his hand, If once touching by the Royal hand be not ever and altogether ſufficient for the cure, and the ſecond be helpfull, it may well ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that in this our good <hi>Joſiahs</hi> reformation, men ſhall not be ſo fully reformed, as that none ſhall endeavour to <hi>fall back</hi> again, but yet by his Royal hand they ſhall be <hi>reduced.</hi>

               <p>In the mean time let us beſeech Almighty God to plant in our Soveraigns Heart the awful Fear of his Holy Name, and that his unerring Word may be the Meaſure and Rule, by which alone Religion and Juſtice may be reformed, as by <hi>Joſiah</hi> his Royal Type was done. Haſten him O Lord herein, that thou mayeſt haſten to reward him with another Crown upon the earth, and a Crown of Glory hereafter which is void of cares, and fadeth not. Make me, O Lord, and all his Subjects unfeignedly to love and honour him for thy ſake; and grant we may never forget, what by woful experience we have found true, the counſel of thy wiſe ſervant King <hi>Solomon, My Son, fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them which are given to change. For their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity ſhall riſe ſuddenly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi> Amen. Laſtly, of all which hath been ſpoken, to God alone be given the Praiſe and Glory; <hi>for from him, and by him, and to him are all things:</hi> He revealeth the deep and ſecret things, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is in darkneſs, and the light dwelleth with him: For thine is the Power and the Glory, and thou haſt now made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the Kings matter.</p>
