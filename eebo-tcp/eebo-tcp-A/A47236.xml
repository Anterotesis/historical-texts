         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Great Sir!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>PErmit me, I beseech You, to lay at Your
Royal Feet this small Manual, which
has no other design but the Supporting
of Your Sacred Majesty, and Your Faithful
Friends and Adherents under those Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
which Your Majesty has born with
so much Magnanimity, Patience, and
Christian Resolution, that it shews You to
be the Heir not only of Your Royal Father's
Crown, but of his Afflictions and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
Exerting the like Constancy and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
under them, as that Blessed Martyr
did. 'Tis true, indeed, Your Royal Father
was a Protestant, and Liv'd and Dy'd in and
for that Profession; and I cou'd heartily wish
that Your Majesty was so too: For then we
might quickly hope to see an end of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb facs="tcp:37148:3"/>
Miseries in a short time. But tho' so
great a Blessing be deny'd us, yet shall my
Loyalty and Duty approve it self the same,
as if You were <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; for I cannot conceive
(what ever some may think) that Your
Majesty's being of another Perswasion than
my self, can discharge me from my Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to You. And I hope Your Majesty will
not the less regard what I have here Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
because I profess my self, as I always
did, to be a Member and an Vnworthy Son
of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> For as it has
always been my Iudgement, that he that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,
Lives, and Prays, according to the
Rules that Christ has given us, is a True
Christian and a happy Man; so I believe
that the next way to Heaven is not to look
after Controversie, but Conscience; and to
spend our Zeal and Time not in being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,
but Religious: And therefore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
I live in the Christian World, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
East or West, it is not my being a good
Scholar that will make me happy, but a good
Christian; not a Learned Disputant for
Christ, but a Devout Servant to him: Nor
the being of such or such a Party or side in
<pb facs="tcp:37148:3"/>
the Church, but a True Member of his Body.</p>
            <p>AND if Your Majesty wou'd Vouchsafe
to bear with me a little, I cou'd easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
this to be the most Safe Way: For,
if I am Regenerated by the holy Spirit, and
made a Christian by true Baptism, believing
the Scriptures; can it with any Colour of
Reason, be Suppos'd that I shall suffer Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
for not equally Believing Traditions?
And if I make Conscience to serve and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
GOD, can it be thought I shall Perish
for not Worshiping Images? If I pray to
GOD, as our Blessed Saviour hath taught
me, saying, <hi>Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> Who can
think I should incur the Sentence of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
for not Invocating Saints and Angels?
And if I receive the holy Communion of the
Body and Blood of Christ, in both kindes,
according to Christ's Institution, as even the
<hi>Roman Church</hi> Confesses, who can believe
I shall be damned, because the Cup is taken
away by a Council?</p>
            <p>THESE things I urge with all humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
only to let Your Majesty see what reason I
have to believe the Protestant Religion to be
the most Safe Way: And if through the
<pb facs="tcp:37148:4"/>
Divine Blessing they should be made Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
to cause Your Majesty to Return to,
and Embrace the Religion professed even to
Death, by Your Royal Father, for whom I
am sure You have so justly a great Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it wou'd be the Ioy and Rejoycing of all
Your People; and wou'd open a Door of hope
to 'em, even in this <hi>Valley of Achor.</hi>
But if for our Sins, we shall still be depriv'd
of so great a Blessing, it is yet our Duty to
submit to the Soveraign Will of our Almighty
Maker, and to continue our Loyalty to Your
Majesty, praying, That the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
would graciously support You under
those great and many Troubles wherewith
it has pleased Him to Exercise You here;
and at last to Translate You to a brighter
Crown, even a Crown of Immarcessible Glory.
Which is the Daily and Earnest Prayer of,</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>HAVING with grief of Heart,
observed that Uninterrupted Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Afflictions that has now
for some Years attended one of the most
Royal Families in <hi>Europe</hi> (to which I
have the Honour to be particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
and thereby am involved in their
common Fate, my self having run the
same Risque with that of my Royal
Master, and suffered the loss of all as
well as He) I have thought it my Duty,
by the Ensuing Meditations, to cast
my Mite into the Royal Treasury, and
by considering the Vicissitude and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of all Sublunary States and
Things, to offer some Support under
that weight of Sorrow, which a Mind less
Magnanimous than that of our Great
Master, would have sunk under long ago.</p>
            <p>AND since the Holy Scriptures do
inform us, that <hi>Afflictions rise not out of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37148:5"/>
the Ground, neither does Trouble spring out
of the Dust,</hi> it will not be unnecessary to
inquire into the Cause from whence our
great and sore Calamities arise; for as in
the Case of a Diseased Body, to know
the Cause from whence the Morbifick
Affect proceeds, is accounted half the
Cure; so if by a thorow search we can
come to know the Cause why it has
pleas'd the Soveraign Majesty of Heaven
to Bring and to Continue these Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
upon us, it may, (accompany'd with
the Divine Blessing) go a great way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Removal of them: There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing more certain, than that the
way to have our Offended Maker Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
unto us, is, <hi>To Search our Hearts,
and try our Ways, and to turn unto Him
against whom we have sinned;</hi> and so may
we hope He will have Mercy upon us,
and say to the Proud Waves of Affliction
that have so long been rolling over our
heads, <hi>Thus far have ye gone, but ye shall
proceed no further, and here shall your proud
Waves be stopped:</hi> For the same GOD
that puts a stop to the Raging of the Sea,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37148:5"/>
can soon put a Period to the Madness
of the People, and bring back our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
as the Streams in the South.</p>
            <p>NOW since the Loss of what we
formerly Enjoy'd, is that which makes us
the most Uneasie, and gives us the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Disquiet, I will first Endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
it, by giving you a Scheme of the
Vanity and Emptiness of all those things;
and consequently that it is not worth our
while to afflict our selves for the Loss of
that which is so Fading and Transitory in
its own Nature, and when Enjoy'd in its
greatest Advantages, adds so very little
to our happiness: Which things are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
reducible to three Heads, <hi>viz.
Honours, Riches,</hi> and <hi>Pleasures,</hi> which I
shall distinctly consider in Meditations
upon each. And that what I write may
be the more effectual to the End for
which it is written, I shall Address my
self to the Divine Majesty for a Blessing
thereupon.</p>

            <head>A PRAYER.</head>
            <p>O Most Gracious and Blessed GOD,
who art the Source and Fountain
of all Blessings, without whose Gracious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
the best of all our Performances will
neither bring glory to thee, nor Profit to our
selves, Look down, we pray thee, in Mercy
upon us, and let this Work be so attended
with thy Blessing, that it may be Efficacious
through thy Grace, to take off our Hearts
and Affections from the love of those things
of which thou hast justly depriv'd us for
our Sins; that so we may now with more
earnestness and intenseness of Soul, seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
those things that cannot be taken from
us; to which end, we pray thee, shew us
the emptiness of all present things, whether
they be Honours, Riches, or Pleasures; and
that Thou only art that chief Good which
alone can satisfie our Souls: Hear us, O
Lord, and help us, for Iesus Christ his
sake: And let these Words of our Mouths
and Meditations of our Hearts, be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in thy sight, O LORD our GOD and
our Redeemer.</p>

            <head>Meditation I.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of the Vanity and Vncertainty of Honour.</head>
            <p>THERE is certainly nothing so
convincing as our own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and if we truly consider it, it is
no small Advantage that we reap even
by our Losses, if thereby we come to be
convinc'd of the Vanity of that which we
have lost. For such is the Deceitfulness
of our Hearts, and the Corruption of our
Natures, that while we are in the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of any outward Good, we are loth to
let it go; and tho' we find no real
Good in it, we are yet so much pleas'd
with it, as to Endeavour with all our
Might to retain it: And let us hear from
the Ministers of GOD's Word never so
long and learned Harrangues of the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Uncertainty of them, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to believe them. But when the
Storm of GOD's Anger is come upon us,
and the Tempest of his Wrath has cover'd
us, and taken from us, our King, our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37148:7"/>
Queen, our Princes and Nobles, all our
pleasant and delectable things; we by our
own Experience come to see that Honour
is but an Empty Puff of Air, that it is
only <hi>Vox &amp; preterea nihil,</hi> a Voice and
nothing else; and that <hi>all is Vanity and
Vexation of Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to come a little more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to shew the Vanity of Honour:
What Certainty is there in that which
consists in Popular Applause, and depends
on the breath of the Vulgar? Well may
it be compar'd to Wind, for with every
Wind it changes: Did not the common
People change their Notes like the Wind,
even to our Saviour himself? How did
they cry <hi>Hosamna</hi> one Day, and the next
<hi>Crucifie him?</hi> Now the Blessed Jesus is
esteem'd a <hi>Prophet</hi> by 'em, and anon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<hi>a Samaritan that hath a Devil.</hi>
Nor had his Followers less Experience
of the Inconstancy of the People: When
St. <hi>Paul</hi> escap'd Shipwrack, and was cast
upon the Island call'd <hi>Melita,</hi> a Viper
fasten'd on his hand, which made the
People take him for a <hi>Murderer;</hi> but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37148:7"/>
when they saw him shake it off, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing him any harm, they chang'd
their Minds and said he was a God:
And the same St. <hi>Paul,</hi> accompanied with
St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> were at another time first
honoured with Paganish Devotion, as
tho' they had been <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi>
and soon after stoned, as tho they were
Malefactors. Again, St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi>
were one time imprison'd in the lowest
Dungeon at <hi>Philippos,</hi> and afterwards
Honour'd and Ador'd of the same Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
that was their Executioner: Even as
our Blessed Lord was honour'd of the
same <hi>Iudas</hi> that was his Betrayer, and of
the same <hi>Pilate</hi> that was his Condemner.
How lamentable was the Case of <hi>Zedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>
who of King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> was made
a Captive to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and
put in Chains; he had indeed for a short
time his Eyes spared, but it was only that
he might behold the Dreadful Slaughter
of his Children, and then the Light of his
Eyes was obscur'd in utter Darkness: O
lamentable Vicissitude of Worldly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours!
When Crowns and Scepters are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37148:8"/>
tumbled under Foot! And Royal Blood
is shed like Water on the Ground, that
cann't be gather'd up again! How soon
was <hi>Pharoah</hi> tumbled from his Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal
Chariot, (when he pursu'd the
<hi>Israelites</hi>) and was made Food for Fishes,
and all his Pomp lay buried in the Sea!
The like unhappy, but just Fate, befel
<hi>Adonibezeck,</hi> who from a great and a
Puissant King, was disgracefully mangled
in his Hands and Toes, and forc'd to Eat
such Crumbs as fell under the Table,
like a Dog. And <hi>Agag</hi> likewise, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Royalet, was hewn in Pieces like an
Ox, even when he thought the bitterness
of Death was past. And <hi>Iezabel</hi> (who
well deserv'd her fate) tho' a great Queen
her self, and a Kings Daughter, was Eaten
up and gnaw'd by Dogs like Carrion.
Nay, the great <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Monarch of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> whilst he
was hugging of himself in his own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and Contemplating the Glory of
his Kingdom, and the honour of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
was turn'd out of his Pallace, and
forc'd to graze like a brute Beast in his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37148:8"/>
own Park. See here the Instability of
Worldly Honour! And what prodigious
changes a moment can produce! When
from the highest Pinacle of Glory, a
Mighty King whom all the World obey'd,
is turn'd a grazing with the very Beasts!</p>
            <p>NOR do we find that prophane Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are wanting in producing Numerous
Examples of the Uncertainty of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Greatness, and how Airy a Nothing
the Breath of Honour is: Of which one
fatal Instance is that of the great <hi>Bajazet</hi>
the Emperour of the Turks, who like a
Wolf, or some wild Beast of Prey, was
carried up and down by Conquering
<hi>Tamberlain,</hi> in an Iron Cage, and expos'd
to that Contempt which he thought
worse than Death, and therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
himself, he knock'd out his Brains
against the Bars of the Cage in which
they kept him. <hi>Valerian</hi> the Emperour
was another Instance likewise, who as a
Slave and Vassal to <hi>Sapores</hi> King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
was forc'd to hold his Stirrop whilst
he got up on Horseback, as tho' he had
been Pope. And even amongst Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37148:9"/>
               <hi>Frederick</hi> the Third, one of the best
of Emperours, was Trod upon by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the Sixth, one of the worst of
Popes, in St. <hi>Mark's</hi> Church in <hi>Venice,</hi> as
if he had been an Asp or a Basilisk, the
Pope most Blasphemously using these
Words, <hi>Thou shalt tread upon the Lyon
and the Adder, the Young Lyon and the
Dragon shalt thou trample under feet.</hi> Nor
is it without a just Compassion to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
that the Emperour <hi>Mauritius</hi>
had his Empress and his Children slain
before his Eyes, by that Bloody <hi>Phocas,</hi>
his Servant, who, after he had slain
his Master, and usurp'd his Empire,
was Countenanc'd in all his Villany by
the Pope, because he stil'd him Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Bishop. This sudden change of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
likewise, befel the Aged <hi>Priam</hi> King
of <hi>Troy,</hi> and <hi>Palaeologas</hi> the Emperour of
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> when those two Famous
Cities were destroy'd, the one by the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> the other by the <hi>Turks:</hi> These
and many more Great Ones in the World,
have been suddenly thrown down from
the Top of all their Worldly Glory, to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37148:9"/>
most Abject Condition; and cast, as was
threatned to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> from the Heaven
of highest Exaltation, to the Hell of
lowest Confusion.</p>
            <p>BUT we have no need to cross the
Seas for Examples of this nature; our
own Chronicles afford us fatal Instances:
Witness <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second,
both Kings of <hi>England;</hi> who found by
a too sad Experience, there was but a
small distance between the Prisons and
the Graves of Princes.—And to come
nearer to our Times, I need not question
but there are many still alive, who can
remember <hi>Charles</hi> the First, the Potent
Monarch of Three Opulent and once
Flourishing Kingdoms, O'ercome by His
Rebellious Barbarous Subjects, and shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
at His own Pallace-Gates, His
Royal Blood upon a Scaffold by the
Hangman's Hands.—This is indeed too
sad an instance of the Uncertainty of
Worldly Honours! To see the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of it thus barbarously Butcher'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a pretence of Justice, as if he had
not been the Lord's Anointed! The
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37148:10"/>
very thoughts on't fills my Soul with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
so that my Trembling Hand can
hardly hold my Pen; and I cou'd even
wish <hi>my Head were Waters, and my Eyes
a Fountain of Tears, that I might weep
Day and Night,</hi> for the Untimely Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
Fall of this Illustrious Martyr; and
well may He be call'd so, since He Dy'd
for His so firm Adherence to the Church
of <hi>England:</hi> Yet neither the Sacredness
of his Majesty, which in His lowest Ebb
of Fortune, shin'd brighter than the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
He wore, nor all His God-like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
were able to preserve Him from
being made a Victim for His People; nor
hinder the Breath of our Nostrils, the
Anointed of the Lord, from falling into
the hands of the vilest of Men. Well
therefore might <hi>Solomon</hi> say, <hi>There is one
Event both to the Righteous and the Wicked;</hi>
and that <hi>no man can know Good or Evil by
any thing that is before him in this Life:</hi>
For we daily see <hi>the Race is not to the
Swift, nor the Battel to the Strong, nor Bread
to the Wise, nor Riches to Men of Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
But Time and Chance happens unto all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:37148:10"/>
BUT whither has my Grief Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
me? The consideration of the
Father's Death, has kept me from Deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the unhappy Fate of His Son, my
Royal Master; who is yet a fresher In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Mutability of Worldly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
who from all the Pomp and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of a Crown, with which we have seen
His Royal Head incircled, has been forc'd
to seek for shelter in a Foreign Country,
and live upon the Alms of others: And
that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (who until
now has had no Blot upon her) shou'd
be concern'd in such a Revolution, even
that Church for whom His Royal Father
dy'd a Martyr, is that which most of all
amazes me.</p>
            <p>BUT this abundantly confirms this
Truth, That no Estate of Man on this
side Heaven, is free from Mutability and
Changes; and sufficiently shews how
vain a thing it is for any Man to place
his Felicity and Happiness in Eminency
of Dignity, and high Exaltation, since in
the Twinkling of an Eye all humane
Glory may be laid in the Dust, and the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37148:11"/>
Sun of Honour either Set, or Eclips'd,
or Clouded in Ignominy and Disgrace;
as the hot gleaming Sun oft turns into
a sudden Storm; like the Honour of
Proud <hi>Haman,</hi> that was taken from Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
with the King and Queen, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
hang'd upon the Gallows.</p>
            <p>AND as the slipperiness of Honour
is always an Allay to the Enjoying of it,
and extreamly debases and lessens its
value; so likewise is the little satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
it gives us when we do Enjoy it:
What Content did it give <hi>Haman,</hi> tho'
he was the Kings peculiar Favorite, and
that his Seat was set above all the Princes
of <hi>Persia,</hi> and reverenc'd and bow'd to,
by all the Kings Servants? So far was
he from being Contented with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that he had, that he never Enjoy'd
it; it availed him nothing, because <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay</hi>
the <hi>Iew</hi> did not bow to him and
give him reverence. Honour is very apt
(unless it be kept within due bounds by
supernatural Grace) to puff up the Minds
of Men, so that they often forget both
God and themselves; They are ready
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37148:11"/>
to think of themselves above what they
ought, when they find that all Mens
knees are bowing down to 'em. <hi>Herod</hi>
found Honour a very fatal thing to him;
when the People honour'd him, and
cry'd, <hi>'Tis the Voice of a God!</hi> He was so
impious to take that Honour to himself,
<hi>and gave not God the glory;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God soon made him know he was
a mortal Man; for he was immediately
<hi>smitten with Worms and Dy'd,</hi> and all
his Honour was cover'd with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Ignominy. It indeed renders a Man
more unsafe, for the higher any Man is
plac'd, the more Enemies he has, and the
more he is liable to be attack'd; yea, the
more obnoxious he is to those that seek
his ruine. The lofty Oaks are sooner
ruin'd by the stroke of Thunder, than
the humble Shrubs: He that stands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Pinacle, tho' he may be gaz'd at by
the Crow'd, stands more unsafe than he
that walks upon the ground, and passes
unobserv'd. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, That <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is not seemly for a Fool,</hi> and yet it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
becomes their Portion. When
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37148:12"/>
Men are laden with much Honour, they
have need to be well Balasted with Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
lest they be Over-set. Besides, what
Satisfaction is there in those things of
which we can have no Assurance of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment?
What Comfort can a Man take
in a House, when he is but a Tenant at
Will, and may be turn'd out, at the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his Landlord, at an Hours war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
What Content has he that Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Tent on the Sand, ready to be
wash'd away with the rolling of every
Sea? And what greater certainty is there
in Honours, which like the Spokes of a
Wheel, are now Uppermost, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after at the Bottom? How often
have we seen the Sun shine bright and
gloriously, when the next moment, thro'
the interposing of some envious Cloud,
'tis muffl'd up in Darkness. There also
is another thing that makes Honour less
Honourable; and that is, when it is not
honourably obtain'd; for if Honour be
worth any thing, it is when 'tis the Guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and Reward of Vertue: 'Twas this
that made at first a Difference among
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37148:12"/>
Men: Those that had done great things for
the Publick, and deserrv'd well of their
Country, had a peculiar Mark of Honour
put upon them, as the just Reward of their
Merits; and this it was that made 'em truly
Honourable. But afterwards, as Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
more and more, so Honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Mercenary, and thereby lost its Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue:
And that indeed has been the chiefest
cause of Envy's Lacquying after it: For
when Men were preferr'd above their
Brethren, whose Worth and Merit came
far short of theirs, they straight way En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd
'em, as Men unworthy of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
they possess'd: What Honour can we
think that Man deseves, who by Extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Oppression has amass'd together a
vast sum of Money, and with that Money
purchas'd Honour? It must surely be an
ill Purchase that's encumber'd with a
Curse; and that Honour cannot but
prove ruinous, that's built on Ruines.</p>
            <p>I do confess I have been much affected,
when I have consider'd how some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
very meanly born, Sons of the Earth,
and taken from the Dunghil, have been
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37148:13"/>
rais'd from their Original Dust, and set
up with Princes: Such were <hi>Maximinus,
Probus, Aurelius, Pertinax,</hi> and others;
who from common Souldiers became
Emperours; <hi>Iephthah</hi> and <hi>Abimelech,</hi>
tho' Bastards, were both Renowned Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
and famous for their Arms; and
the <hi>Norman</hi> Duke <hi>William,</hi> whom we call
<hi>William the Conquerour,</hi> was one of the
same Classis. So likewise <hi>Peter Comestor,
Gratian</hi> the Collector of the Decretals,
<hi>Lumbard</hi> the Master of the Sentences,
first Founder of School Divinity, were
all the Bastards of Nuns, and all Famous
for Arts: <hi>Agathocles</hi> was the Son of a
Potter, <hi>Abdolominus</hi> a Gardiner, <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
and <hi>Marius</hi> meanly born, and yet
came to be Kings of <hi>Sicily, Syria,</hi> and
great Potentates. And what shall we
say to <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> of whom Sacred
Writ tells us, <hi>His adde Saulum et Davi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,
Asinas et Oves passenter ad Regnum
pervenienies;</hi> the one was taken from
seeking Asses, and the other from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Sheep, and advanc'd to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. and 16. How strange
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37148:13"/>
was the Exaltation of <hi>Cosmus de Medices</hi>
Of <hi>Florence,</hi> whom <hi>Machiavel</hi> in his <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine
History</hi> tells us, liv'd all his Youth
obscure and miserable; when on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the Sun of his Glory shin'd forth,
as from under a cloud? How was <hi>Huni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi>
fetch'd out of a Prison, and <hi>Henry</hi>
the Third, of <hi>Portugal,</hi> out of a Poor
Monastry, to be Crowned Kings?</p>
            <p>THESE are so many Instances of
the great Uncertainty that all Men meet
with here in their Pursuit of Honour:
Some are the Favourites of Providence,
and from a mean Condition rais'd to the
highest Pinacle of Worldly Glory; whilst
others from the Summit of their hopes,
have in a Moments time been thrown
into Despair, and all the glittering Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Crowns have only serv'd to
light 'em to Destruction.</p>
            <p>AND yet tho' most Men so unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riedly
pursue this gaudy Idol Honour,
let us a little now consider what 'tis they
are the better for't. And one would
think that those whom Nature sends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World with Crowns upon their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37148:14"/>
Heads, and Scepters in their Hands, that
from their Birth are plac'd in such a
Sphere of Glory that they have nothing
more to wish for, have all the cause that
may be to esteem themselves happy:
And yet if we Enquire of them, whether
the Dignities that they Enjoy, and the
high Station they are in, has made 'em
happy? They'll tell us the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
No Good whatever can make a Man
happy, without it be permanent and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and whatever 'tis that is not so,
must needs leave the Soul short of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness:
And that Honours, I mean
Worldly Honours, are not permanent,
is what I have already prov'd by many,
and some too fatal Instances: And yet
this is not all, for while they do Enjoy
'em, they find their Crowns are lin'd
with Care, and sometimes made of
Thorns; nay, oftentimes the Scepter that
they Weild proves but a Reed, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be depended on. And can we think
such Crowns and Scepters can Cure the
Chagrin of the Mind, or keep off Cares
and Griefs from hovering about 'em?
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37148:14"/>
No, on the Contrary, it is the Crown
that brings 'em, and the Scepter that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
'em. <hi>O Crown,</hi> said the great <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Monarch, <hi>He that did but know how
heavy thou sittest on the Head, would hardly
take thee up, tho' he shou'd meet thee on his
way.</hi> This Prince gave Law to the whole
World, and each Man's Fortune was
what he pleas'd to make it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to appearance cou'd give to every
Man Content; and yet he here confesses
he wanted it himself. And what better
Account can the rest give us, if they will
speak their Minds Impartially? And
here I will not ask of <hi>Dionysias</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who was more content
with a handful of Twigs, to Whip the
little Children of <hi>Corinth</hi> in a School,
than with the Scepter wherewith he had
beaten all <hi>Sicily:</hi> Nor will we ask of
<hi>Sylla,</hi> who having robb'd the common
wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> (which had her self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
robb'd the whole World) never
found means of Rest in himself: Nor,
to come nearer home, will we Enquire of
<hi>Charles</hi> the Royal Martyr, the lustre of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37148:15"/>
whose Crown did only serve to Tempt
his Enemies, not only to take it from his
Head, but even to take his Head off too;
and whose Scepter was too weak to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Force of Armed Rebels: Nor
will we ask of his two Exil'd Sons, of
which the Eldest endur'd twelve years of
Banishment ere he Enjoy'd his Crown;
and he who still survives, warn'd by his
Royal Father's Tragick End, was forc'd
to fly for Refuge to a Neighbouring
Monarch, whose Generous Goodness has
ever since supported him. It is of none
of these Unhappy Princes that we will
ask what Happiness they found in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours:
But surely <hi>Solomon</hi> may very well
be Esteem'd Capable of giving the best
Answer to this Question; who had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
to all the Honour that the World
is capable of giving, both with respect to
his singular Wisdom, which without
doubt made him a very competent Judge
of this matter; as well as for that vast Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of Riches which he had amass'd
together; and more especially for that
largeness of heart he had to make use of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37148:15"/>
it: And yet this is the <hi>Summa Totalis</hi> of
all his Honour and Glory, That <hi>all is
Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT because we will have more than
one Mans Opinion, let us ask of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Augustus,</hi> who Peaceably possest
the whole World, and we shall hear
him bewailing his Life past, and among
infinite Toils wish for the Rest of the
meanest of his Subjects, esteeming that a
happy Day that would ease him of his
insupportable Greatness, and suffer him
to live quietly among the least.</p>
            <p>AND if we Enquire of <hi>Tiberias</hi> his
Successor, he will tell us, <hi>That he holds
the Empire as a Wolf by the Ears; and
that, if he cou'd do it without danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bitten, he wou'd gladly let it go:</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of Fortune for lifting him so
high, and then taking away the Ladder
that he cou'd not get down.</p>
            <p>IF we ask <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> a Prince of
great Wisdom and Vertue, in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the World; he will prefer his
voluntary Banishment at <hi>Solona,</hi> before
all the Roman Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:37148:16"/>
AND, to conclude this Head, if we
Enquire of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the
Fifth, who is generally esteem'd the most
happy that hath liv'd these many Ages,
He will Curse his Conquests, Victories
and Triumphs; and not be asham'd to
own, That he hath felt more good in
one day of his Solitude, than in all his
Triumphant Life.</p>
            <p>NOW how can we imagine those
happy in this imaginary Honour and
Greatness, who think themselves unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in it? And especially, since they
profess that Happiness consists in being
Lesser, and not Greater. In a word,
whatever Happiness Honour and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
promiseth, it is nothing else but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of much Evil to get more. Men
think by daily climbing higher to make
themselves happy, and yet the height
whereunto they so painfully aspire, is
the height of Misery it self.</p>
            <p>BUT having thus consider'd both the
Uncertainty and Vanity of Worldly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
it is necessary to see what use is to
be made of it, before we proceed any
further.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:37148:16"/>
               <head>The Soul's Expostulation.</head>
               <p>AND now, O my Soul, why shou'dst
thou Disquiet thy self for the
loss of that which is not worth the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
If the Possession of it cou'd add
nothing to thy Happiness, what hast thou
to complain of, now 'tis lost? Is it not
better to enquire what just Title thou
hadst to it, than to repine at the loss of
it? If thy Honour was the Reward of
Vertue, it is still thy own; for whilst the
Cause continues, (which is Vertue) the
Effect cann't cease; and then thou hast
no reason to complain: But if thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
came from any other Cause, thou
truly never hadst any real Honour, it only
was an empty Name, and nothing else:
For it is Vertue is the Life and Soul of
Honour. Thou oughtest therefore, O my
Soul, to look well before thou leap'st into
the Chair of Honour; or else the higher
thou climbest, the lower thou fallest: If
Vertue prefer thee, then Vertue will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
thee: But if Gold or Favour do
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37148:17"/>
advance thee, thy Honour is but pinn'd
upon the Wheel of Fortune, and when
that Wheel shall turn, thy Honour falls,
and thou remain'st an everlasting monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thy own Ambitious Folly. If
therefore thou desire, O my Soul, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
Honour with thy Wealth, consider
first how that became thine: If thy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
got it, let thy Wisdom keep it; if
Oppression found it, let Repentance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
it; and if thy Parents left it, let thy
Vertues deserve it. For if thou art a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
Honour (like the Sun-beams) will
make thee more Glorious; but if thou art
a Dunghil, the Sun may shine upon thee,
but it cannot sweeten thee: Thy Prince
may give thee honour, but not make thee
honourable. The best way therefore, O
my Soul, is to despise that empty Nothing
which the World calls Honour; and seek
after that Honour which none can Rob
thee of, or take away; and that is, in a
word, to seek the Honour which GOD
gives: For they that honour Him, He
has promis'd to honour; whereas they
that despise Him shall be lightly esteemed.</p>

            <head>Meditation II.</head>
            <head type="sub">On the Vncertainty of Riches.</head>
            <p>THERE is nothing in the World
more certain than the Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Riches; therefore it is that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls 'em <hi>Vncertain Riches,</hi>
bidding us <hi>not to trust in Vncertain Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
but in the Living GOD.</hi> And tho'
there be many in the World that make
Wings for Riches, I mean, that Study
and Contrive how to spend it, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they
shall never be poor; yet they need
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37148:18"/>
not be so much concern'd about that, and
might well save themselves that Labour,
for whether they make them Wings or
no, <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us that <hi>Riches will make
themselves Wings, and fly away;</hi> yes, says
he, they will fly so far as never to return
any more, for they will <hi>fly as an Eagle
towards Heaven:</hi> Riches are such Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
things, as he compares them to Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Entities;
<hi>Wilt thou,</hi> says he, <hi>set thy Heart
on that which is not?</hi> Riches are like
Quicksilver, so Volatile, there's no fixing
of 'em; for they fly away, when their
Possessors think themselves as sure of 'em
(having them close Prisoners in Bags and
Bolts, under Lock and Key) as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
thought themselves of the Goddess
<hi>Victoria,</hi> when they clipt her Wings, and
Wall'd her within their City. And tho'
in this respect also our own Experience
is more convincing than a Thousand Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
yet will it not be amiss to recite
some Examples of the Uncertainty and
Emptiness of Worldly Riches; and the
rather, that we may see there is nothing
has befallen us in the late Revolution,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37148:19"/>
but what has befallen others in former
times, who have been better than we:
Now that we are Try'd in the Furnace of
Affliction, we may have good hopes of
coming forth like Gold, refined and made
better; but if we faint in this Day of our
Adversity, it will argue our Strength is
but small.</p>
            <p>AND first, The Example of <hi>Iob</hi> is
Illustrious, who was not more Eminent
for his Riches than his Piety, which was
so very remarkable, that he was the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>such
of his Age, the very boast of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
<hi>Hast thou considered my Servant</hi>
Job, says the Almighty, <hi>that there is none
like him, a Perfect and an Vpright Man,
one that Feareth God, and Escheweth Evil?</hi>
What Man cou'd have a fairer Character,
especially considering who it was that
gave it? And yet this holy <hi>Iob,</hi> this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
of Heaven, was deprived in one
Day, Nay in one Hour, of such an Estate,
(besides his Children, which were more
dear to him than all the rest) in Oxen,
Camels, Sheep and Moveables, as the
greatest Man in the East did not possess
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37148:19"/>
the like: And yet <hi>Iob</hi> never murmur'd
at his Loss, but only made this Inference
from it, <hi>Naked we came into the World,
and Naked shall we go out again: The
Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, and
blessed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> There
is at this Day an Illustrious Instance in
the World, that has well near Equaliz'd
<hi>Iob</hi> in his Afflictions: God grant that
he may do it in his Patience and his Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and then we may all hope for the
like Issue.</p>
            <p>BUT to Enumerate more Examples of
the Mutability of Riches, is to hold a
Candle to the Sun; for who can walk the
streets without meeting Variety of Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
How many Men, who formerly
liv'd plentifully, and were in good Esteem
for Wealth and Riches, are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
from a <hi>Spring-Tide</hi> of <hi>Plenty,</hi> to the
<hi>lowest Ebb</hi> of <hi>Poverty?</hi> Neither has this
befallen one sort of Men alone, but Men
of all Ranks and Qualities, Gentlemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Merchants, Mariners, Tradesmen, Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,
Citizens and Country-men, Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Farmers: Those who were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37148:20"/>
as Rich as <hi>Croesus,</hi> are now as poor
as <hi>Conon;</hi> and from a <hi>Dives,</hi> turn'd into
a <hi>Lazarus:</hi> And if you shou'd Enquire
by what means all this comes to pass,
some wou'd inform you 'twas by <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack</hi>
at Sea, others by <hi>Suretiship</hi> on
Land; some by <hi>bad Debtors</hi> and <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
Bankrupts,</hi> those Pests of <hi>Trade,</hi> and
<hi>Shopwracks</hi> of the <hi>Citizens;</hi> others by
<hi>Sickness, Physick</hi> and <hi>Physicians;</hi> and
some by <hi>grinding Vsury;</hi> others by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Forfeitures</hi> and <hi>double Taxes,</hi> have
been brought to an irrecoverable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption:
Some have been undone by
Careless, Thievish, and Fugitive Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
And even <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and a <hi>sense of
our Duty to God</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> has through
the Cunning Craftiness of some Men,
been made the occasion of Ruining many.
But besides all these, there want not
many that have been their own Ruine;
Some by Good (or rather Bad) Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
others by <hi>great House-keeping,</hi> their
<hi>Minds</hi> being too big for their <hi>Means;</hi>
some by <hi>Hawks, Hounds, Horses,</hi> and
<hi>Whores;</hi> these are destroy'd by their own
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37148:20"/>
Lusts, and Eaten by the Wolf bred in
their own Flesh; or, as 'tis Fabled of
<hi>Actaeon, are devour'd by their own Dogs.</hi>
And surely those may well be call'd Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Riches, that have so many Wings
to fly away. I had forgot to mention
<hi>Fire,</hi> which where it gets the Mastery,
proves very fatal, and in a few hours time
makes Beggars of the richest Merchants;
of which that dreadful one in <hi>London</hi> in
the Year 1666. Serves for a thousand
Instances. Which shews sufficiently the
mutability of Worldly Riches, and what
small cause we have of Trusting in 'em.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' perhaps some Men may
prove more fortunate, and that their
Riches shou'd stay with 'em, as tho' they
had been wedded to 'em, not to depart
for term of Life; yet there must be a
Separation when they come to dye: For
as the Word of Truth, besides our own
Experience, infallibly assures us, <hi>The Rich
Man when he dyes shall carry nothing away
with him, his Pomp shall not descend to
the Grave.</hi> And therefore as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
St. <hi>Augustine</hi> has it, <hi>Vide Viven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37148:21"/>
cogita morientem, quid hic habet, quid
secum tollit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eye the rich Man, poise and
ponder his Estate, living &amp; dying, to consider
what he hath here, and what he takes with
him from hence. Damascene</hi> hath a Notable
Fiction of Three Friends, which all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Love to a Man, and the Trial of
it was this: One Friend would stay with
him all the time of his Health and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity;
that Friend was Pleasure, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousness
and Mirth: The Second
Friend wou'd stay with him in his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
yea, to the hour of Death; that
Friend was Riches; but having brought
him to the Grave, there it left him: The
Third Friend goes with him beyond the
Grave, even to God's Tribunal, and
pleads for him there, and this Friend is
God's Fear, and God's Favour: This
Friend is more worth than all the rest:
For as for the second Friend, Riches, that
leaves us, you see, at the Grave. These
Friends, saith <hi>Bernard,</hi> either have their
End before we dye, or see our End when
we dye; either they forsake us, or are
forsaken of us. We have already heard
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37148:21"/>
what holy <hi>Iob</hi> said, <hi>Naked came we into
the World, and Naked shall we go out again:</hi>
And the great <hi>Saladine,</hi> the Conquerour
of <hi>Asia</hi> (a second <hi>Tamberlain</hi>) well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
it to himself; for dying in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
instead of all other Obsequies, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
only a Linnen Cloth, a Winding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheet,
to be carried before him on the
Top of a Spear, throughout the Camp,
with this Proclamation, <hi>Saladini quod
Reliqnum: Here's all that's left of great
Saladine:</hi> Ensigns, Trophies, Victories,
Triumphs, are all included in this Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
Rag, the cover for my Dead Corps;
and except this, all the rest must remain
behind: Our Houses, Lands, Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
we must shake hands with 'em all,
and bid a long Farewel to 'em when we
come to dye. <hi>Gulielmus Parisienses</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
those that load themselves here with
thick Clay, to a Parcel of Boys that have
robb'd an Orchard, who after they have
Eaten what they can, stuff their Pockets,
Sleeves and Coats full, to carry out with
them; but at the door there stands one
that searcheth them, takes all they have,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37148:22"/>
and sends them away with no more than
they brought in: The World says he,
is the Orchard; the Cormorants of the
World are those greedy Boys; the Fruit
stolen, are Riches ingross'd; and the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is Death, who makes 'em leave it all
behind 'em. It is also compared to a
poor Man invited to a rich Mans Table;
he has the use of his Plate to drink in,
and of his Silver Spoons to Eat his Broth
with, while he is there at the Feast; but
if he presumes to pocket up any Plate,
or to carry away the least Spoon, there
is search made by the Porter for what is
missing, and it is taken from him with
disgrace. We are in the World as in
an Inn, saith <hi>Tully;</hi> and we may use it
as our Hosts House, and our Bed too, that
proper place to which God hath called
us, for the time we lodge; but we must
carry away no Cloaths, no Coverings,
except we borrow a Winding-sheet, use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
only as the Secondine to the Child,
to wrap us in; for Excepting this, Death
as a Common Pyrate, or a Thief, strips
us of all the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:37148:22"/>
NOW what Contentment or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
can we propose to our selves in
the Enjoyment of such Uncertain fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
Things, Which either ere long will
leave us, or of necessity we must leave
them? It is surely a great argument of
our Minds being plac'd upon Wrong
Objects, when we can mourn for the loss
of such Flying and Lying Vanities.</p>

               <head>The Soul's Expostulation.</head>
               <p>DISQUIET not thy self, O my
Soul, about the Things of this
World; nor set thine heart on that which
is not: If thou hadst not lost the World,
perhaps thou mightst have lost thy self,
in setting thy heart too much upon it.
And since God's Word has told thee,
<hi>That if any Man love the World, the love
of the Father is not in him;</hi> thou hast
cause to rejoyce that thou hast lost that,
which might (hadst thou kept it) have
caus'd thee to lose the Favour of GOD:
And yet what hast thou lost in losing it?
Or what didst thou gain by it when thou
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:37148:23"/>
hadst it, except Trouble and Care? Thou
hadst then no more than Food and Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that thou hast still, tho' thou
hast lost thy Riches: When thou hadst
most occasion for 'em, then they left thee,
and fled away to strangers: Is it not
therefore far better to trust in the Living
God, than in uncertain Riches? For
Riches profit not in the Day of Wrath,
but Righteousness delivereth from Death.
And if thou mak'st it thy chief Business
to seek first the Kingdom of GOD, and
the Righteousness thereof, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
necessary for thee, but GOD has
promis'd it shall be added to thee. And
wilt thou grieve because thou art depriv'd
of Unnecessary Things? Learn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O my
Soul, to make the Will of God the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of thy Desires: And when thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest
nothing but what God wills, thou
may'st desire what thou wilt, and obtain
it. Thou mayst assure thy self that God
wills what is best for thee, and when
thou hast conform'd thy Will to his, thou
needest not fear a blessed Issue. And if
what God has done, appears not at the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37148:23"/>
present best to thee; it is not because it
really is not best, but because by reason
of thy present Darkness, thou canst not
see it so. God sees the End of all his
Works from the beginning, and perfectly
knows the Events of all his Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but thou, O my Soul, are short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted,
can'st not see far before thee;
and since thou canst not see what God
intends by his present Providences, 'tis
now thy time to live in the Exercise of
Patience; and glorifie him by believing.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the Vanity of Worldly Pleasures.</head>
            <p>PLEASURE is that which all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
and covet, tho' most mistake
the Object of it: It is that for which Men
value their lives, and without which they
think it wou'd scarce be worth the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But if they mean the Pleasures of
this World, abstracted from the Love of
God, and those unspeakable Delights that
are in him, there's nothing in which men
are more mistaken: So far is Worldly
Pleasure from making of Men happy,
that it puts 'em in a state of Death: This
St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures us, 1 Tim. V. 6. <hi>She that
liveth in Pleasure, is dead while she liveth.</hi>
And large Experience confirms this Truth;
for those that have most affected it, have
always found it fatal.</p>
            <p>LET us give a few Instances: (For we
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37148:25"/>
are apter to be led by Examples than Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts)
The <hi>Philistines</hi> had taken <hi>Sampson</hi>
thro' the Treachery of <hi>Dalilah; Sampson</hi>
wou'd needs enjoy his Pleasure with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah,</hi>
but she refus'd to let him, unless
he told her where his strength lay; which
when she knew, she straight betray'd him
to his Enemies: And this was the effect
of <hi>Sampson's</hi> Pleasure. When the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines</hi>
had obtain'd this Prize, it made 'em
mighty merry, and they must needs go
take their pleasure too: And <hi>Sampson</hi>
(whom they barbarously had blinded)
must be sent for, that he might make
them Sport: But it was fatal Sport to
the <hi>Philistines;</hi> for <hi>Sampson</hi> having with
some assistance grop'd out the two Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters
or chief Pillars of the House, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God to strengthen him that he
might be aveng'd for his two Eyes, was
heard and answer'd, and <hi>Sampson</hi> pulls
the House about their Ears, whereby they
all were slain, which put a bloody Period
to their Pleasure.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Persians</hi> were a People given
up to Pleasure above other Nations, which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37148:25"/>
made 'em so effeminate, as render'd 'em
an easie Conquest to their Enemies:
<hi>Belshazzar</hi> was a Prince given to Pleasure,
and liv'd in great Voluptuousness; and
that not only in a time of Peace, but when
he was surrounded by his Enemies, and
<hi>Darius</hi> lay with a Vast Army on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side the River <hi>Euphrates:</hi> This not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
<hi>Belshazzar</hi> was resolv'd to
take his Pleasure, and makes a great
Feast to a Thousand of his Lords, and
drinks Wine before 'em, even out of the
sacred Vessels taken out of the Temple
of the House of God which was at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
But while <hi>Belshazzar</hi> was taking
of his Pleasure, and Carrousing with his
Lords, there appears suddenly <hi>a Hand
Writing upon the Wall,</hi> which tho' the
King understood not, yet <hi>his Countenance
was chang'd, and his Thoughts so troubled
him, that the Ioynts of his Loyns were
loosed, and his knees smote one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
This quickly put an End to all
their Pleasure, and fill'd 'em with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
and Astonishment: And the sad
Epilogue to this Jovial Feast, was, That
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37148:26"/>
               <hi>God had number'd his Kingdom. and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
it;</hi> and that <hi>he was weigh'd in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances
and found wanting,</hi> and <hi>his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was divided, and given to the Medes
and Persians:</hi> And that Night <hi>Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
himself was slain, which put a final
End to all his Pleasure. So that it is very
evident that what is affirmed of Wordly
Sorrow, is much more true of Worldly
Pleasure, <hi>That it worketh Death.</hi> And
<hi>Solomon,</hi> who of all Men was best able
to Extract the quintessence of Pleasure,
and taste what was in it, gives us this poor
yet true Account of it, after he had made
the Experiment, <hi>Behold this also is Vanity,</hi>
Eccles. II. 1, 2. Not only <hi>Vain,</hi> but <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
it self,</hi> in the Abstract; and as if this
was not enough, he lays a greater Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
on it in the next Verse, where he
tells us, <hi>I said of Laughter, It is mad;
and of Mirth, What doth it?</hi> And this
he further Exemplifies, by telling us, <hi>It
is better to go to the House of Mourning,
than to go to the House of Feasting</hi> Eccles.

            <p>INDEED all Pleasures, if they die not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37148:26"/>
like Children in their very Birth, yet they
are liable to so many accidents, that they
quickly wither and decay, and all their
Gust is gone: The pain in one Tooth,
the Cramp in one Joynt, the Gout in one
Toe, the Megrim in the Head, the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
in the Guts, the Feaver in the Blood,
the Sciatica in the Thigh, the Fistula or
Hemorrhoids in the nether parts, or any
one of these, takes away the relish of our
Pleasures, and imbitters all the Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Persons Enjoyments; turning his
Singing into Sighing, his Musick into
Mourning, and his Riot into Rage. And
who wou'd mourn the loss of things so
Subject to a Thousand Accidents, which
have so little real Good in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>

               <head>The Soul's Expostulation.</head>
               <p>AND now, O my Soul, consider
with thy self, how vain and how
pernicious the Pleasures of the World are!
For tho' Mankind do generally give up
themselves to the Pursuit thereof, yet
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37148:27"/>
how full of Pain do they find these Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures!
Consider, O my Soul, that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Pleasures are the Pleasures of Beasts;
which relish them with more delight than
Men, and use 'em according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Nature, and for the Satisfying
of their Wants; and that with more
Moderation; for they only drink for the
quenching of their Thirst, and Eat for the
satisfying of their Hunger: Whilst Men,
endow'd with Reason, and born to a higher
End, even to Glorifie and Enjoy their
Maker, do immerse themselves in the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Puddles of Drunkenness and Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and other base Carnal Delights, and
thereby degenerate below the Beasts that
Perish. Raise up thy Affections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
O my Soul, and place them upon
Things above; there are Pleasures and
Delights that are worthy of thee, even
such as are adequate to thy Wants, and
capable of Satisfying the Desires of an
Immortal Soul. And tho' thy outward
Circumstances and late Losses, have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
thee uncapable of Pursuing the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of this World, thou art thereby the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37148:27"/>
more fitted to aspire to those Pleasures
that the World cann't take from thee,
and which alone are Worth the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
If thou hearkenest to the Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Syrens of Worldly Pleasure, they do
but intice thee with their Pleasant Songs
(as they would have doue <hi>Vlysses</hi>) till
they bring thee to cast thy self into the Sea
of Destruction, and over-whelm'd thee
with Eternal Ruine. But if, O my Soul,
thou waitest at the Gates of Wisdom,
and hearkenest to her Voice, thou soon
shalt find, not only that her Ways are
Ways of Pleasantness, but also, that all
her Paths are Peace.</p>

with Patience the Race that thou hast set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me. And since I find in thy Word, that
that it is the Character of some in the last
Day, That they shall be Lovers of Pleasures
more than Lovers of God; make me, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beseech thee, in the Number of those that
have rather chose to suffer affliction with the
People of God, than to enjoy the Pleasures
of Sin for a season: Like <hi>Moses</hi> esteeming
the Reproaches of Christ, to be far more
Eligible than the Pleasures of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Grant
this, O Lord, for Iesus Christ his sake, thy
Beloved Son, and my alone Saviour; who
has further taught me to Pray, saying, Our
<hi>Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <head>Meditation IV.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of the Nature and Causes of Afflictions.</head>
            <p>NOtwithstanding what has been
said in the three former Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Uncertainty and Emptiness
of Honours, Riches, and Pleasures, and
what little Cause we have to be troubled
at the loss of them; yet since the best of
Men are apt to look upon the loss of those
things as Afflictions; and are more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to bemoan themselves under them,
than to Enquire into their Causes; and
since the finding out of their Causes, is
the best way to remove their Effects; I
will now Enquire into the Nature and
Causes of Afflictions, and therein what
were the Sins that procur'd those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
under which our Royal Master
and his Family has so long suffer'd.</p>
            <p>AFFLICTIONS are always Evils
in themselves, and in their own Nature;
tho' through the Over-ruling Providence
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37148:29"/>
of Almighty God, they are often turn'd
to the great Advantage of those that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
'em: So the Author to the <hi>Hebrews
tells us, No Chastening for the Present is
Ioyous but Grievous; nevertheless after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it yieldeth the Peaceable Fruits of
Righteousness to them that are excercised
thereby,</hi> Heb. XII. 11. And this was the
Experience of the Royal Prophet, <hi>Before
I was Afflicted, I went astray, but now,</hi> says
he, <hi>have I kept thy Word.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place he tells us, <hi>It is good for me,
that I have been afflicted:</hi> And yet these
Afflictions were grievous to him to bear,
for he cries out, <hi>They made him go mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Day long.</hi> But these suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are never brought upon a People,
or a Family without a Cause, for <hi>God does
not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children
of Men;</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us expresly,
that it is not without <hi>need be, that we are
in Heaviness</hi>—And it is as sure that Sin
is always the cause of Suffering. And
therefore the Psalmist says, <hi>When thou
with rebukes doest correct Man for Iniquity,
thou makest his Beauty to consume as the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37148:29"/>
Moth:</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah asks
Wherefore does a living Man complain, a
Man for the Punishment of his Sins?</hi> So
that nothing can be more clear then that
Sin is the cause of Affliction: Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
laid down as an Undoubted Truth,
it remains that we Enquire what those
Sins are, which are most likely to bring
down National Judgments; and then to
Examine whether we have not been guilty
of those Sins; that so we may thereby
come to know wherefore it is that God
contendeth with us; and knowing that,
that we may repent of our Iniquities, and
return unto him against whom we have
Sinned, that he may return unto us with
Mercy and with loving kindness.</p>
            <p>1. THE Sin of Prophane Swearing
and Cursing, is that which brings Gods
Judgments on a Nation: Hence the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
tells us, That <hi>because of Swearing the
Land mourns;</hi> and this Sin is expresly
forbidden by the third Commandment;
which enjoyns us <hi>not to take the Name of
the Lord our God in vain;</hi> and threatens,
that <hi>God will not hold him guiltless that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37148:30"/>
does so;</hi> whereby is implied, That GOD
will charge the guilt and violation of his
holy Law upon such a one; the taking
his Name in vain being a Prophaning of
it: Whereas we are commanded to fear
that great and dreadful Name, The
<hi>LORD</hi> our <hi>GOD:</hi> And this prophane
Swearing is also forbidden in the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament,
our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> strictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
us <hi>not to Swear at all;</hi> Mat. v. 34.
And this St. <hi>Iames</hi> presses further, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Above all things, my Brethren, Swear
not,</hi> Jam. v. 12. Not that hereby we are
forbidden to testifie the Truth of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon Oath before a Magistrate, as
some dream; for in this case St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
us, That <hi>an Oath for Confirmation is an
end of all strife,</hi> Heb. vi. 16. The intent
therefore is, That we abstain from all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Swearing, which is a Taking of
God's Name in vain, and a procuring
Cause of his Judgments upon a People
and Nation; of which there wants not
plenty of Examples, both Sacred and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
were it needful to insert 'em.</p>
            <p>BUT that which more concerns us, is,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37148:30"/>
To Enquire whether we are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
guilty hereof our selves, and so
are justly made an Example to others?
And in this case, I must say, Our guilt is
too evident to be deny'd; for we declare
our Sin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and hide it not: Our
Tongues being oftner us'd in impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Divine Vengeance, even Damnation
it self, upon our Souls, than in imploring
the Pardon of our Sins. How many are
there that pretend Love and Loyalty to
our King, yet will shew it no other way,
but by Drinking his health, till they have
lost their own; and by their horrid exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
Oaths, defying of the Majesty of
Heaven? Alas! What can be expected
from those Men, that are every hour bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Defiance to the Almighty, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
God to damn them? With what
face can they pretend to love their King,
that thus affront their Maker? Whoever
thus harden'd himself against God and
prosper'd? It was these Fighters against
Heaven that brought the Royal Martyr
to the Block; and were more guilty of
his Death, than the Regicides that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37148:31"/>
him, or the Villanous Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
that sever'd his Royal Head from
his Sacred Body: And it is such as these
that have turn'd our Royal Master out of
his Throne, and forc'd him to Abdicate
(as some will have it) his Crown and
Kingdoms: For when GOD was thus En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
against him, by the reiterated Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Imprecations of his pretended
Followers, how cou'd he hope to stand?
For shame, therefore, Gentlemen, let us
either lay aside our pretences of Loyalty
to the King, or cease to offend GOD
as we do every Day, by Belching forth
such Vollies of loud Oaths and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
against him. For had we but as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Employ'd our Tongues in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him, as we have done in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of our selves, and in Blaspheming
God, we might have long since hop'd a
better Issue. If therefore we wou'd shew
our selves good Subjects to the King, let
us approve our hearts to God as good
Christians, which we cannot do but by
walking in his Ways, and keeping of his
Laws. We have seen the fatal effects of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37148:31"/>
Cursing and Swearing, let us now steer
a contrary Course, and betake our selves
to Prayers and Tears, the Churches only
Weapons in suffering Times. Of which
I shall say more at the Conclusion.—
But,</p>
            <p>2. Whoredom and Adultery is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
crying Sin that brings down God's
Judgments upon a Nation: This Sin is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
against the Seventh Commandment;
which <hi>forbids us to commit Adultery;</hi> and
however the Fools of this Age, I mean
such as <hi>make a Mock at Sin,</hi> have stil'd it
but a <hi>Trick of Youth;</hi> and that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church</hi> calls it but a <hi>Vanial Sin;</hi> yet
we have a more sure Word of Prophecy,
even the holy Scriptures, which tells us,
That <hi>for these things the Wrath of God
comes upon the Children of Disobedience:</hi>
And well it may, since the Author to the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> assures, That (how slight so ever
others make of it, yet) <hi>Whore-mongers and
Adulterers God will judge.</hi> And that this
Sin brings down Judgments on a Nation,
the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> informs us, <hi>Ier. v.
7, 8, 9.—When I had fed them to the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37148:32"/>
full, then they committed Adultery, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
themselves by Troops in the Harlots
Houses: They were as fed Horses in the
Morning; every one Neighed after his
Neighbours Wife:</hi> This was their sin: And
what the effect of it was, the next Verse
shews us; <hi>Shall I not Visit for these things,
saith the Lord? And shall not my Soul be
avenged on such a Nation as this?</hi> This
sufficiently expresses God's Anger against
it, especially when it is grown common.</p>
            <p>IT now concerns us therefore to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
our selves, and see whether this
also be not registred in that black Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of Sins which we are guilty of!
And I am much afraid that there is but
few of us that can say in this respect, my
heart is clean: For the foot steps of this
Sin are but too plainly to be trac'd among
us. And therefore all of us have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to humble our Souls before God,
and to say, <hi>O Lord, to us belongs confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Face, to our Kings, to our Princes,
and to our Nobles,</hi> (as well as to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons)
<hi>because we have sinned against thee.</hi>
For my part, I know not what unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37148:32"/>
Liberty some Men give themselves
in this matter; as if those in high places
had a Toleration, or a License to Sin:
But I am sure God's Word allows none;
no, not to the greatest of Men: The
Law of God is, <hi>Thou shalt not commit
Adultery;</hi> and I know of no Exception.
Of this sin, When King <hi>David</hi> himself
was found guilty, though he had an Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Pardon sent him from Heaven,
<hi>Thou shalt not dye;</hi> yet it did not Exempt
him from Temporal Judgments, for the
Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> told him plainly, <hi>The
Sword shou'd never depart from his House,
because he had despised God, in taking the
Wife of Vriah</hi>—Therefore let all that
are concerned herein (how great soever
they be) humble their Souls under the
mighty hand of God, and turn from the
Evil of their doings, that God may be
thereby reconciled unto us, and have
Mercy upon us. For this is a sin that if
not repented of, will keep good things
from us; and make a Separation between
us and our God: And such have the
more reason to do this, because their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37148:33"/>
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample may have corrupted many: For,
<hi>Regis ad Exemplum totus Componitur Orbis.</hi>
And indeed this Sin has spread so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
upon that account, that I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
it has been none of the least
causes of God's heavy displeasure against
us. Yet will not this in the least justifye
them, of a lower degree, who shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
so ill an Example, for by them God's
holy Law is violated, and Himself pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
by their Filthiness; and themselves
thereby made the cause of bringing down
the Judgments of God both upon King
and People; such have therefore great
reason forthwith to break off their Sins
by Righteousness, and turn from the Evil
of their Ways; that the Lord may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
their Sins, and heal our Land.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Cruelty and Bloodshed</hi> is a great and
crying Sin, which defiles the Land, and
brings down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Judgments from Heaven
upon it: Nay, it causes the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to shut out our very Prayers, so that
he will not hear us: The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>
gives us a full account of this, in the first
Chapter of his Prophecy, in the 7th Verse
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37148:33"/>
he gives an account of God's Judgments
on the <hi>Israelites</hi> not altogether unlike
what has befallen us; for, says he, <hi>Your
Country is desolate, your Cities are burnt
with fire; your Land, strangers devour it in
your presence, and it is desolate, as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
by strangers.</hi> And in the 15th
Verse, GOD tells them, <hi>When ye spread
forth your hands, I will hide mine Eyes
from you, and when you make many Prayers,
I will not hear:</hi> Would you know now
what it is that has provok'd the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
against them? He assigns this as
the reason of all, in the latter End of the
15th Verse, <hi>Your hands are full of Blood.</hi>
This is also farther Evident from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of King <hi>Saul,</hi> who was a Bloody
Man, not only in commanding the Priests
of the Lord, even Fourscore and five Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that wore a linnen Ephod, to be
slain, but also because he sought to slay
the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> under a pretence of Zeal
to the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah,
2 Sam.</hi> xxi. 2. But these things brought
down publick Judgments upon the Land
several years after; for when in the Reign
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37148:34"/>
of <hi>David</hi> there was a famine in the Land
for three Years, and <hi>David</hi> Enquired of
the Lord to know the cause thereof, he
was answered, <hi>It is for Saul, and for his
Bloody House;</hi> and nothing cou'd appease
God's Anger, till seven of <hi>Sauls</hi> Sons were
hang'd on that account: So loud is the cry
of Innocent Blood against the shedders
thereof.</p>
            <p>LET us now Enquire how far we are
concern'd in the guilt of this Sin also:
And shou'd we go about to clear our selves
herein, the very Gates of the great City
of the Kingdom wou'd cry out against
us: And all the West of <hi>England</hi> would
testifie the contrary to us. I am well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
that our Royal Master is not a
Prince that does delight in Blood, and I
wish with all my heart, that I cou'd say
as much for all his Servants: But alas!
How many are there that under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Zeal for the King's Service, have
executed their own Private Revenge, and
thereby exceedingly disserv'd the King, on
whom the <hi>Odium</hi> always lay: We all
know there was a Rebellion in the West
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37148:34"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> and there is no question but
Justice requir'd some Examples shou'd be
made: But had the Kings Ministers (to
whom he intirely left it) made as much
use of Mercy as they did of Justice, I am
sure they wou'd have done the King more
Service; and I have reason to be of this
Opinion, since <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, (who had
also a Rebellion broke forth at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his Reign, against him) That
<hi>the Kings Throne is Establish'd by Mercy.</hi>
But I will say no more of that, because
those who were the chief Instruments
therein, have long since given an Account
of their Actions before a higher Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
where they have receiv'd the just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of their Reward. And if there
be any of us yet alive that have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in shedding of Innocent Blood, or
that have pursu'd our own Revenge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a shew either of Loyalty or Justice,
they have great reason to acknowledge
their Sin, and to humble their Souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and take shame to themselves,
as having, to the utmost of their Power,
therein brought down the Judgments of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37148:35"/>
God both upon our King and on his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
As to my self, I can appeal to the
Searcher of Hearts, that I was grieved to
see that Effusion of Christian Blood, and
wou'd have prevented it, had it lain in
my Power; and as I had an Opportunity,
I shew'd Mercy; and where I cou'd not,
I have not been wanting to pray that the
guilt of that Blood might not fall upon
the King, nor on his Royal Issue. For
even then my fore-boding Soul had great
apprehensions that it wou'd cry loud for
Vengeance.</p>
            <p>BUT in the Fourth Place, <hi>Opression</hi>
and <hi>Injustice,</hi> is another crying Sin that
brings down Judgments on a Nation.
To this, the Word of GOD abundantly
bears Witness: Hence it is that God so
often complains, That <hi>they Iudge not the
Fatherless, neither doth the Cause of the
Widow come unto them; but every one loveth
Gifts, and followeth after Rewards;</hi> and
that <hi>he looked for Iudgment, but behold
Oppression; for Righteousness, but behold a
Cry:</hi> And therefore the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>
exhorts them, if they expect Mercy, to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37148:35"/>
               <hi>seek Iudgment, relieve the Oppressed, judge
the Fatherless, and plead the Cause of the
Widow;</hi> threatning that if they refus'd,
<hi>they shou'd be devour'd with the Sword;
for the Mouth of the Lord had Spoken it.</hi>
And in another Place the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
<hi>That Iudgment is turned away back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and Iustice standeth afar off; for
Truth is fallen in the street, and Equity
cannot enter:</hi> And for this God threatens
that <hi>the whole Land shall be desolate;</hi> and
that <hi>the Earth shall mourn, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
above shall be black:</hi> These things
sufficiently declare the dreadful conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
and effects of Injustice and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
And that it brings down Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Judgments.</p>
            <p>LET us now Enquire how far we are
concern'd in the Guilt of this Sin. And
I am afraid that neither in this shall we
be able to acquit our selves; for tho' I
wou'd not be thought to charge my Royal
Master in this matter, yet I am very sure
that those through whose hands the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Affairs then passed, made
so many false steps, that they can by no
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37148:36"/>
means be acquitted of Injustice, as well as
great Imprudence: And this I am the
bolder to say, because it was for Their
Mis-management, that the King now suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.
And that this may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
I will descend to a few Particulars.</p>
            <p>TO say nothing of Turning the West
into a Slaughter-house, and making such
a shambles of the Roads and High-ways
there; exercising this Cruelty upon many
that the whole Country knew were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
innocent of that for which they
suffer'd, which was the ready way to bring
an <hi>Odium</hi> upon the King, by making the
People believe that he was as Inexorable
as his Ministers: I say, To pass by this,
having before said something of it, It was
undoubtedly a great Piece of Injustice to
set up a New Court for the Management
of Ecclesiastical Affairs, contrary to the
Express Laws of the Land; whereby the
Church and Clergy of <hi>England</hi> were Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to the Wills of some Men that were
Enemies to both; who made the Kings
Authority a staulking-horse to their own
private Malice and Revenge, and thereby
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37148:36"/>
put many fears into the Hearts of those
that were the King's best Friends, who
cou'd not but fore-see the fatal Tendency
of such Proceedings.</p>
            <p>IT was likewise a great Piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
to suspend the Right Reverend the
Bishop of <hi>London</hi> from the Exercise of his
Pastoral charge, for that which in it self was
no offence; the said Bishop having acted
(at least in that Affair) with all that
Caution and Prudence which the Duty
of his Place requir'd. Which besides the
Injustice and Oppression of it, was a great
disservice to the King; in disquieting the
Minds of his good Subjects, who began
to grow doubtful whereto such things
might tend; and many of 'em (as the
Event too sadly shew'd) began to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
such thoughts of his Majesty, as was
inconsistent with their Duty; and might
have forewarn'd the Authors of those Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
Actings, that, that which was their
Sin, wou'd quickly be their Punishment.</p>
            <p>THE Declaration for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
(tho' it might indeed shew the
Kings Lenity to Dissenters) was certainly
a false step in the Advisers, both as it
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37148:37"/>
put too great a Power into the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
hands, who had been lately so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
Prosecuted; as also because it was
expresly against Law: For tho' the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
might have been conniv'd at in
their different Way of Worship (which
wou'd have satisfy'd them, and have been
serviceable to the Government, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them easie, and so keeping them
quiet: Yet to make 'em capable of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Offices in Corporations, and setting
'em upon an Equal Foot with the Church
of <hi>England</hi> (or rather above it) was too
bold a stroke at once; and made the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
too much inclin'd to think it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to serve another Interest, rather
than that of Protestant Dissenters. And
tho' in this I am Verily perswaded of the
King's Sincerity aud Uprightness, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be so of some that were very near
him, and to whom he cou'd scarce deny
any thing.</p>
            <p>THERE was also another false step
in the putting out of this Declaration,
and which was a great piece both of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
and Oppression, and that was,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37148:37"/>
The Enjoyning it to be sent to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of every <hi>See,</hi> to be by them
ordered to be read by their Respective
Ministers in each <hi>Diocess.</hi> Why should
the Bishops be deny'd Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
when it was granted to Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
And why could not the Dissenters
enjoy the Liberty of their Consciences
without the Bishops being enjoyn'd to
read the Declaration, which they knew
to be contrary to the Law, and therefore
illegal? Not that the Bishops were against
Indulgence to Dissenters, when it should
be propos'd in Parliament, but they then
saw there was <hi>latet in Anguis,</hi> a Snake in
the Grass, which many were not aware
of: And that the Bishops shou'd be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison'd
in the Tower, for Refusing to
do that which was against their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
was certainly a very false step in
the Advisers, besides a great piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice:
And I am very sorry that the
fatal Consequence thereof was no more
perceiv'd by the King and his Ministers.
I have however, this Consolation in my
Self, That what I acted at that time, was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37148:38"/>
out of Duty both to God and the King;
and that I am no way to be charg'd with
what afterwards follow'd thereupon; and
if I was at all mistaken, or acted beyond
what I ought to have done, I humbly
beg Pardon both of God and the King;
being well assur'd in my own Integrity,
and that it was without any Evil Design.
I did indeed soon perceive of what ill
Consequence it would be to his Majesty,
and what Improvement his Enemies
wou'd make of it; but it was not in my
power to help it.</p>
            <p>THE Violent Proceedings against the
President and Fellows of <hi>Magdalen-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> was also very Unjust and
Oppressive, and a very false step, both in
the Advisers and Actors: And what I
cannot remember, when I consider what
effect it had upon the People, without
great Compassion to his Majesty; who
by the Violent Passions of some hot and
fiery Spirits, was precipated into such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Counsels; where all the Profit would
redound to others, but all the <hi>Odium</hi> rest
upon the King. As to the Fellows, I must
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37148:38"/>
own they did but their Duty, and they
could not chuse otherways then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Statutes of the Colledge. And
indeed to compel them to do it, was both
against Law, and against the Kings Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for Liberty of Conscience, which
surely extended to them as well as to
others, they having the same Plea.</p>
            <p>IT is not without cause that I have
so largely insisted on these several Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Injustice and Oppression: For these
things carry'd the Evident Tokens of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Displeasure along with 'em, and
were afterwards made the chief Motives
for Introducing the late Revolution:
Which tho' it was too wide a stretch, and
very unreasonably urg'd so far, (for a
Chimney that smoaks may be mended,
without any danger of the House being
pull'd down) yet was it such a Rebuke
to the Authors of those precipitate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
that (as I said before) they might
easily see their Sin in their Punishment;
nor shou'd I have at all mourn'd their
Fate, had they not involv'd my Royal
Master in the same Ruine with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:37148:39"/>
               <hi>UPON a serious Reflection on the
fore-mentioned Sins, and our own guilt
therein, we may plainly discern that it
is not without very great Cause, that it
has pleas'd God to bring these Afflictions
upon us; And that we have reason to
joyn in that Confession of the Church in
the Lamentations,</hi> The Lord is Righteous,
for we have rebelled against his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Thou hast made us as the off-scou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and refuse in the midst of the People:
For we have transgressed and rebelled, and
thou hast not pardoned; but hast covered
us with Anger, and Persecuted us; yea, thou
hast covered thy self with a Cloud that our
Prayer should not pass through. The Lord
hath accomplished his Fury, he hath poured
upon us his fierce anger, for the Sins of her
Prophets, and the Iniquity of her Priests.</p>
            <p>WHAT then remains, but that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the cause of our Afflictions, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to remove them, by humbling
our selves under the mighty hand of God,
and by searching and trying our Ways,
and turning again to the Lord: For <hi>the
Lord will not cast off for ever,</hi> but if we
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37148:39"/>
repent of our sins, and turn unfainedly
to him, <hi>tho' he cause grief, yet he will have
compassion, according to the multitude of
his Mercies; for he doth not afflict willingly,
nor grieve the Children of Men; to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the right of a Man before the face of
the most High, to subvert a Man in his
Cause, the Lord approveth not:</hi> Let us
therefore in good Earnest set about this
Work of Repentance and Reformation;
for were we once but a Reformed Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
we should soon be a happy People:
Our Losses would soon be made up, and
<hi>strangers should no more rule over us.</hi> But
whilst we are going on in our old Sins,
we must still expect that GOD will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us with his Judgments until we be
consumed. <hi>For if we do wickedly, we shall
be destroyed, both we and our King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NEITHER let our Hearts fret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Lord; but submit to his Will;
for 'tis he that hath done it, and 'tis our
duty to be patient under it, and wait his
Time for our Deliverance: To go about
to deliver our selves, is but to make our
Bonds the stronger; and to entangle our
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37148:40"/>
selves more: <hi>Our Strength is to sit still,</hi> and
to wait for the Salvation of God: For
when he works, there's none can let it;
and till he does arise and work, all we
can do, will be in vain. And this many
have found to their cost. Let us learn to
be wise, by other mens harms. <hi>There are
many Devices in the heart of Man, but the
Counsel of the Lord that shall stand:</hi> And
whoever goes about to resist it, will find
him self sadly deceiv'd. I will always
maintain my Loyalty to the King, and
quietly submit to the Power that Protects
me. That so I may keep <hi>a Conscience void
of offence both towards God, and towards
Man.</hi> And it is the grief of my heart to
see any otherwise minded: For if we
must not <hi>Speak wickedly for God,</hi> nor <hi>Talk
deceitfully for him,</hi> much less must we <hi>Act
wickedly for him.</hi> And yet I would be
found doing too; I mean, I would be
found in the daily Exercise of Faith and
Repentance, and endeavour to get a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and a contrite Heart for my past Sins;
because God has assur'd me, that <hi>with such
Sacrifices he is well pleased.</hi>

               <head>The Soul's Expostulation.</head>
               <p>AND now, O my Soul, consider with
thy self, If Sin be the procuring
Cause of all thy Troubles, hast thou not
greater Reason to be troubled for thy Sins,
than for thy Sufferings? Afflictions may
make thee better, but Sin always makes
thee worse. It may be necessary some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to chuse Sorrow, but it never can be
so to chuse Sin. 'Tis God alone is that
Wise Alchymist that can Extract Good
from Evil; and make even the Sins of his
People turn to his Glory: Thus through
the working of God's Grace, thy Pride
may tend to humble thee, and a due sence
of thy Passion may produce Patience. But
this is alone the Effect of God's Grace,
for the Nature of Sin is only Evil. What
reason then, O my Soul, hast thou to
bless God, who has made thy Outward
Losses prove thy Inward Gain; by taking
thee off from the Pursuit of Sin, and
Training thee up in the School of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction!
Sure, O my Soul, it concerns thee
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37148:41"/>
to see what good Lessons thou hast learn'd
there; for if thou art not the better for't,
thou wilt certainly be the worse: Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is a Furnace, and if thou comest not
forth purified like Gold, thy dross will
appear the more. But if thou canst say
with <hi>David, It has been good for me that
I have been afflicted,</hi> thou hast great cause
to bless God for it. If these Trials have
done thee good, what hast thou to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of? And if by the light of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
thou hast seen the greatness of thy
Sin, and that sight of Sin has humbled
thee, and brought thee to Repentance,
thou art hereby become a greater Gainer,
than all the outward Prosperity in the
World could make thee: For there is no
Comparison between Temporal Losses,
and Spiritual Gains: For all <hi>the things
that are seen, are but Temporal; but the
things that are not seen, are Eternal:</hi> How
blessed a thing is it, O my Soul, to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted!
Seeing <hi>these light Afflictions that
are but for a moment, work out for thee a
far more Exceeding and Eternal Weight of
Glory:</hi> T his, O my Soul is enough not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:37148:41"/>
only to make them rejoyce, but even
glory in Tribulations, since they have so
blessed an effect: See then, O my Soul,
that thy <hi>Tribulation worketh Patience, and
Patience Experience, and Experience Hope,
even that Hope which maketh not ashamed;</hi>
and so shalt thou have rejoycing in thy
self, and not in another.</p>

               <head>A PRAYER.</head>
               <p>O Almighty and merciful Lord God, who
madest all things for thy own Glory,
and canst Over-rule all Events so, as to
bring glory to thy Name, and good to thy
People, out of the darkest of thy Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

these Afflictions with which thou hast been
pleased to Exercise me, may by thy gracious
Ordination bring forth the Peaceable fruits
of Righteousness unto me; that I may be
Enabled to say, It is good for me that I
have been Afflicted. And suffer me not, O
Lord, neither to despise thy chastening, by
going on in those Ways of Sin and Rebellion
against thee, which have brought thy Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

my Repentance for those Iniquities which I

declared in thy Word, That he which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his Sins shall not prosper, but that those
who confess 'em and forsake 'em shall find
Mercy; Help me, I humbly beseech thee,
with all thy People, to make our Confession

hearken'd to thy Servants, the Ministers,
which spoke in thy Name to our Kings, our

Righteousness belongs unto thee, but unto us
Confusion of face, as at this day, to our
King, our Princes, and our Iudges, because
we have sinned against thee: And have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this Evil unto all the rest, that yet we

            <head>Meditation V.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of the Benefit and Advantage of Afflictions.</head>
            <p>WE have in the former Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Enquir'd into the Nature
of Afflictions, they are Evils in themselves,
not joyous but grievous; and into the
Causes of them, which generally is Sin;
and what some of those Sins are, we have
also examin'd, and found our selves to
be concern'd in them; which calls for
our hearty Sorrow and Repentance. But
as a wife Physician will so temper Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as not only to allay its Venom, but
turn it into an Antidote; so does the
great Physician of our Souls do with Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions;
making them work together
for our Good, and bring forth for us the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37148:43"/>
Peaceable Fruits of Righteousness. And
here I will a little Meditate upon the
reasons why it pleases God to Afflict his
Children, and what the Benefits are that
we reap thereby.</p>
            <p>1. Because we might shew our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to our Blessed Redeemer, <hi>who
first Suffered, and then Entered into his
Glory:</hi> In like manner we are told that
<hi>if we suffer with him, we shall also reign
with him:</hi> And the greater Tryals we
endure here, the brighter will our Crown
of Glory shine hereafter: The Author to
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> having given a large account
of the sufferings of the People of God,
in former Ages, and of their not accepting
Deliverance, gives this as the reason, that
<hi>they expected a better Resurrection:</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to which, our Lord tells us, That
<hi>those that are persecuted</hi> here <hi>for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
sake, are blessed,</hi> because <hi>theirs is the
Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> And seeing <hi>the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of our Salvation was made Perfect
through Sufferings,</hi> why should it not also
be the same with his Followers?</p>
            <p>2. Another Reason why it pleases God
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37148:43"/>
to Exercise us here with Afflictions, is,
That our hearts might be drawn off from
the love of the World, which is an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to God; The inordinate love of the
World, makes the Soul uncapable of the
love of God; for St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
<hi>That if any Man love the World,
the love of the Father is not in him:</hi> How
much better is it then to have the hatred
of the World, and to have God our
Friend, than to have the World our
Friend, and God our Enemy? And sure
we have no reason to complain of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
since St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>We are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
of the Lord, that we might not be
condemned with the World.</hi> God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to imbitter the World to us by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
as a Tender Mother does her
Teat, when she wou'd wean her Child
from the Brest; she rubs her Nipple with
Aloes or Wormwood, which the Child
tasting, will take the Brest no more: So
when the World wou'd intice us to the
love thereof, by its Delights and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
our merciful Father sends us Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations
and Afflictions to take our hearts
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37148:44"/>
from the love of present things; which
could we have quietly Enjoy'd, we should
have been for building Tabernacles here.
Could the Prodigal Son have fill'd his
Belly with Husks, he would never have
thought of Returning to his Father; but
Want and Affliction brought him from
the Swine, with whom he would have
staid, could he have got his Belly full.</p>
            <p>3. Another Benefit we receive by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
is, That we are thereby Cured of
our Soul-Disease; and that too, of such
as are otherwise almost incurable. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
Riches, and a Prosperous Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the World, causes us too often
to contract those sinful Habits which we
never come to reflect upon, much less to
repent of, until Affliction makes us:
Therefore it is that <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>The
Rod and Reproof give Wisdom.</hi> The Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Ioseph's</hi> Brethren is remarkable;
they had sold their Brother to the <hi>Ishmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litish</hi>
Merchants, and made their Father
believe he was torn in pieces of Wild
Beasts, and then thought all was well; and
were not at all troubled that they had
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37148:44"/>
sold their Brother, and deceiv'd their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But afterwards when they went
down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp; were there put in Ward,
and charged as being Spies, this Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
brings to their remembrance their
former Usage of their Brother <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and
now they cry out, <hi>We are verily guilty
concerning our Brother: We saw the anguish
of his Soul, when he besought us, and we
would not hear; therefore is this distress
come upon us.</hi> Had it not been for that
affliction, in all probability they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
repented of their Cruelty to <hi>Ioseph.</hi>
One likeneth Afflictions to the Rod of
<hi>Moses,</hi> for as the striking that upon the
Rock, brought forth Water; so the Rod
of Affliction often mollifieth stony-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Sinners, and makes the Waters of
Repentance to gush out. Another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
it to a File, for as that cleanses the
Iron from its Rust, and make it bright,
So Affliction files off that Rust of Sin,
which worldly Prosperity has contracted,
and makes our Graces shine more bright
and glorious. The Scripture likewise
compares it to a Furnace wherein Gold is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37148:45"/>
tried, and purged from all its filth and
dross, and brought to the greatest degree
of Perfection. It may also well be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to a Purging Potion, for as that dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the corrupt and ill humours out of
a diseased Body; so Afflictions drive out
evil Passions and corrupt Desires and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
out of the Soul; such as Pride,
Vain-glory, Sloth, Niceness, Lust, Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,
Drunkenness, and many more.
And <hi>Elihu</hi> speaking to <hi>Iob</hi> of the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
with which God uses to exercise
his People, tells him, It is <hi>that he may
with-draw Man from his Purpose, and hide
Pride from him;</hi> he does indeed, says <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,
chasten him with Pains upon his Bed,
and the multitude of his Bones with strong
Pain; so that his Life abhorreth Bread,
and his Soul dainty Meat; yea, his Soul
draweth near to the Grave, and his Life to
the destroyers: Lo these things,</hi> says he,
<hi>worketh God often-times with Man:</hi> But
wou'd you know to what End? 'Tis <hi>to
bring back his Soul from the Pit, to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
with the light of the Living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Another Benefit of Affliction is,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37148:45"/>
That it is a Preservative from Evil, and
keeps us from many Sins which we should
otherwise run into: This is what God
intends, by the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> when he
tells the Children of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that were
bent upon Idolatry, and resolved to go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Lovers, that God wou'd prevent
'em, and put a stop in their Way; <hi>I'll
hedge up thy way with Thorns,</hi> says God:
That is, I will bring such afflictions upon
you, as shall be as so many Thorns in your
sides, which shall put a stop to your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reir
in Wickedness. And this was the
Experience of holy <hi>David</hi> long before:
For he tells us, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxix. 71. <hi>It is
good for me that I have been Afflicted:</hi> If
you ask why it was good for him, or
what Benefit he found by it? He readily
tells you, Vers. 67. <hi>Before I was affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
I went astray; but now have I kept thy
Word:</hi> And therefore instead of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
against God for Afflictions, he
justifies God; <hi>I know, O Lord,</hi> says he,
<hi>that thy Iudgments, are just, and that in
faithfulness thou hast afflicted me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. ANOTHER Advantage we reap
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37148:46"/>
by Afflictions, is, That hereby God puts
us upon the Tryal of our Graces: There
are many that will swim with the Tide,
that won't venture when the stream is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
'em. What the Devil falsly said of
<hi>Iob,</hi> is but too true of many Men, <hi>they
won't serve God for nought!</hi> When God
blesses them with the good things of this
Life, and they have all that their Hearts
can wish, then they will be for God, and
for the Profession of Religion; but if he
puts forth his hand, and takes away what
they have, they will be like those that the
Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaks of, who when they
<hi>are hungry, and hardly bestead, shall fret
themselves, and curse their King and their
God.</hi> And therefore <hi>Iob's</hi> Constancy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
those great Afflictions, made his Piety
and Patience so much the more Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
'Tis Affliction that shews us which
are Hypocrites, and which are sincere
Christians; a sincere Christian varies not
with the Times, but is <hi>semper idem,</hi> always
the same; whereas a Hypocrite is a Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server,
and will turn with the Times, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than be turn'd out: If Tribulation
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37148:46"/>
comes, he is for avoiding of it, let it come
from what Quarter it will. How many
can we remember that made the greatest
Pretences of Loyalty to the King, that
cou'd be; and had there been no occasion
to try their Loyalty, would have been
Loyal still; but when Times of Affliction
and Trial came on, and the King was
forc'd to with-draw himself, they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
with-drew their Loyalty. This shews
that times of Affliction are times of Trial;
by which God proves the Truth of our
Love to him, and our Zeal for him: And
by which we also may come to know the
Deceitfulness of our own Hearts; which
is also the Design of God in our Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
as the holy Ghost testifies 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
xxxii. 31. where speaking of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
we have these words, <hi>Howbeit, in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of the Ambassadors of the Princes of
Babylon, who sent unto him, to enquire of
the wonder that was done in the Land, God
left him, to try him, that he</hi> (i. e. <hi>Hezekiah</hi>)
<hi>might know all that was in his Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6, Another Benefit that we receive by
Afflictions is, That they make us run to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37148:47"/>
God: Fulness and Prosperity oft makes
us forget God, and run away from him,
but Afflictions generally drive us to him;
and indeed is the only way to reclaim us.
This the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> tells us, where
God speaking of his People that had gone
away from him, and follow'd Idols, threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
to bring Afflictions upon 'em; <hi>I will
be as a Lyon, and as a Young Lyon to the
House of</hi> Judah, <hi>I will tear and go away;
I will take away, and none shall rescue.</hi>
Would you know God's design herein?
<hi>I will go,</hi> says he, <hi>and return to my Place,
till they acknowledge their offences, and seek
my Face:</hi> But when will that be? O,
says God, <hi>In their Affliction they will seek
me Early.</hi> When we are walking abroad
in the Fields, and the Weather is good,
we are not solicitous about a Place of
shelter; but if a Storm arises, and a Shower
comes, then we look out for a Shelter,
and make haste unto it: God is call'd in
the Scripture, <hi>A Covert from the Storm and
from the Rain,</hi> Isa. iv. 6. And therefore
when the Tempest of God's Wrath ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and the Storm of his Anger is pour'd
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37148:47"/>
upon the World, whither shall we run
for safety, but to Him who is a Covert
from the storm and from the rain? At such
times especially we run to God, as to
our great <hi>Assylum</hi> and Refuge; knowing
that under the shadow of his Wings we
shall be safe. Thus it was in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with the <hi>Israelites;</hi> a stiff-necked ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
continually provoking God by
their unbelief; and this they did to that
degree, that God often sent his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
amongst them, by which many of
them were destroyed; and these Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
made them seek after and run to
God; for so the Psalmist tells, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxxviii.
34. <hi>When he slew them, then they sought
him; and they returned, and enquired ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after God.</hi> And tho' the Psalmist tells
us, that <hi>they did but flatter him with their
Mouth, and lied unto him with their Tongue,
and that their heart was not right with him,
neither were they stedfast in his Covenant;</hi>
yet this running of theirs to him in the
time of their affliction, did so far prevail
with God, that <hi>he being full of Compassion
destroyed them not; but turned his Anger
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37148:48"/>
away, and did not stir up all his Wrath.</hi>
And <hi>David</hi> himself frequently professes
that God was his Refuge in time of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>whereto he did continually resort.</hi> So
that this is certainly a great Advantage
that we gain by Afflictions, that they drive
us to God, to whom we fly for Refuge,
and where we find Security.</p>
            <p>7. There is also this Advantage in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
That by means of them we come
to live in the daily exercise of all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
which without Afflictions we could
not do: This St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 3.
<hi>We glory in Tribulations also, knowing that
Tribulation worketh Patience; and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Experience; and Experience, Hope;
and Hope maketh not ashamed:</hi> This is the
natural Consequence of Afflictions; for
then we live in the Exercise of Faith, by
believing Gods Promise, that all things
shall work together for our Good; and
relying upon him for our Deliverance:
We live in the Exercise of Hope, by an
assured Expectation of the Reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to them that suffer: And in the
Exercise of Charity, by having our hearts
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:37148:48"/>
inflam'd with the love of Christ, who
gave himself for us, whereby we are made
willing to offer up our selves a Free-will-Offering
to him, both in Life and Death:
Our Patience is Exercis'd in suffering
the Will of God, with Quietness and
Resignation of Soul; and our Humility,
by abasing our selves in the sight of God,
and being willing to suffer shame for
his sake.</p>
            <p>8. ANOTHER Advantage that we
reap by Afflictions (which is the last I
shall mention, because I affect brevity)
is, That when they have brought forth
in us the Peaceable Fruits of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
our Mouths (and our Hearts too)
shall be filled with Songs of Deliverance:
Thus <hi>David</hi> rejoyc'd in God, <hi>Psal.</hi> LIX.
16. <hi>I will sing of thy Power, yea, I will sing
aloud of thy Mercy in the Morning; for thou
hast been my Defence and Refuge in the Day
of my Trouble:</hi> The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> had
been kept a long time in the House of
Bondage, in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where
they were made to serve with Rigor:
But with what Songs of Praise were their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37148:49"/>
Mouths filled, upon their Deliverance!
How did they exult in the Lord, and
glory in the God of their Salvation!
There had been no occasion for those
Songs of Deliverance, had they not been
kept in Bondage! Nor had they seen the
Power of God so wonderfully display'd
on their behalf, which made them cry out,
<hi>Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the
gods! Who is like unto thee! Glorious in
Holiness, Fearful in Praises, doing Wonders!</hi>
Had King <hi>David</hi> come to the Crown
without meeting with those Troubles that
preceded it, he had not been so sensibly
affected with God's Mercy in Delivering
him, as he was, nor in all probability
have writ that excellent Song of Praise
recited both in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxii. and in <hi>Psal.</hi>
xviii. Intituled, <hi>A Psalm of</hi> David <hi>the
Servant of the LORD, who spake unto
the LORD the words of this Song, in the
Day that the LORD Deliver'd him from
the hand of all his Enemies, and from the
hand of</hi> Saul: In which he first gives an
Account of his great Distresses; for, says
he, <hi>The Sorrows of Death compassed me,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37148:49"/>
and the floods of ungodly Men made me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid;</hi>
nay, he goes further than this, and
tells us, <hi>The sorrows of Hell compassed him
about, and the snares of Death prevented
him:</hi> And then exults in GOD for his
great Deliverance; <hi>The Lord was my stay:
By Thee have I run through a Troop; by
my GOD have I leaped over a Wall: As
for GOD, his way is perfect: The Word
of the LORD is tried: He is a Buckler to
all those that trust in Him: For who is GOD
save the LORD? Or who is a Rock save
our GOD? The LORD liveth, and blessed
be my Rock, and let the GOD of my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
be exalted: It is GOD that aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
me, and subdueth the People under me—
He delivereth me from mine Enemies: Yea,
Thou liftest me up above those that rise up
against me: Thou hast delivered me from
the Violent Man: Therefore will I give
thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
Heathen, and sing Praises unto thy Name:
Great Deliverance giveth He to his King,
and sheweth mercy to his Anointed, to</hi> David
<hi>and to his Seed, for evermore.</hi> Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi>
being delivered out of his Troubles,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:37148:50"/>
fill'd his mouth with Songs of Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to his great Deliverer. [GOD is
the same GOD still, and has the same
Power to save, and the same Bowels of
Compassion to shew Mercy. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lift up our Eyes and our Hearts to
Him: We have been long looking to
Men; but they have prov'd but as broken
Reeds, that have rather pierc'd our hands,
than holpen us: We have experienc'd
the Truth of what <hi>David</hi> long ago af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
<hi>That Men of low degree are Vanity,
and Men of high degree are a Lye:</hi> And
therefore let us all say as he does, <hi>Psal.</hi>
LXII. 5. <hi>My Soul wait thou only upon God;
for my expectation is from him.</hi>]—But to
proceed: It is (as I have said before)
none of the least Benefit of Afflictions, That
it makes deliverance more sweet to us:
For as after a great drouth, a shower of
Rain is more refreshing to the Earth; or
when we are extream thirsty, a draught of
Drink is sweeter to us; and a Calm is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
more pleasant and acceptable to
Passengers, after a troublesome Tempest;
so will our deliverance be more grateful
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:37148:50"/>
to us, after we have been exercis'd with
great and sore Afflictions. Thus in the
LXVIII. <hi>Psalm,</hi> and the 13th vers. <hi>Tho'
ye have lien among the Pots,</hi> (like Sons of
Clay, esteem'd as the filth of the World,
and the off-scouring of all things) <hi>yet</hi>
(when your Deliverance shall come) <hi>ye
shall be as the Wings of a Dove cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Silver, and her Feathers with yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Gold:</hi> i. e. Ye shall be so much the
more bright and glorious; and for every
Sorrow you underwent in the time of
your Affliction, you shall receive redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Consolations after your Deliverance.
And this Deliverance will come in due
time, if with Faith and Patience we be
found waiting for it: <hi>For tho' Heaviness
may endure for a Night, yet Ioy will come
in the Morning;</hi> especially if we let Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
have its perfect work: But if through
impatience we seek to hasten it, we shall
but retard it; for <hi>he that believeth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not haste.</hi>—And that we may the
more quietly submit to the good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of GOD, and rest satisfied in his
Wise Disposal of things, our next Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37148:51"/>
shall be of our Resignation to
the Will of GOD.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>The Soul's Expostulation.</head>
               <p>LET us now, O my Soul, a little
Contemplate on the adorable Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of GOD, who is wonderful in
Counsel, and excellent in working; whose
way is in the Sea, and his Path in the great
Waters, and his footsteps are not known:
Since then, O my Soul, his Judgments
are such a great deep, that all the Lines
of a created Understanding can never fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
them, Is it not much better to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of his Fatherly Chastisements, than
to quarrel with his Proceedings? Present
Afflictions may be far better than a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
Condition, if thou hast Wisdom
to improve 'em to the end for which
GOD designs 'em. Will it be a Mercy
to be made conformable to thy blessed
Redeemer, who first suffered, and then
entered into his glory? And will it not
be thy happiness to have the same mind
in thee as was in Christ Jesus? And if
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:37148:51"/>
Afflictions do this, surely thou oughtest
to Thank God for Afflictions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
that thou art counted worthy to
be a Partaker of Christ's sufferings. Again,
If by Afflictions thy heart be weaned from
the World, and thy Affections set upon
the things above, where there are better
and more durable Treasures, thou art
certainly an infinite Gainer by the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
And if outward ease and Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
has caused thee to contract sinful ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
and evil Diseases, which are purged
away by Afflictions, what reason hast thou
to complain? Or if God by his afflicting
hand hedge up thy way with Thorns;
that thou canst not do all the Evil that
is in thy heart, is not this the greatest
Mercy that can happen to thee? And if
by outward sufferings thou approvest the
sincerity of thy heart to God, oughtest
thou not to rejoyce therein? Thou canst
not but know, O my Soul, how apt thou
art to start aside from GOD, like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
Bow; and if to Cure thee of that
Evil, the Floods of Affliction, like those
of great Waters, do arise, and force thee
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:37148:52"/>
to run to God as thy strong hold, for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Refuge, is there not a hand of
Mercy to be eyed therein, which thou
oughtest thankfully and humbly to adore?
And likewise, if Afflictions cause thee to
live in the Exercise of Faith, Hope, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Patience, Humility, and other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Graces, thou hast exceeding reason
to be thankful to God, and to say with
<hi>David, It is good for me I have been Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</hi>
Lastly, O my Soul, consider
how pleasant it will be to look back, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the various Issues of Divine Providence,
when God shall have wrought Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
for thee? How wilt thou then, O
my Soul, exalt and magnify the Lord,
and rejoyce in God thy Saviour? Thou
art now apt to blame the Conduct of
Divine Providence, and to say with good
old <hi>Iacob, All these things are against me:</hi>
But then thou wilt be of another mind,
and conclude that <hi>he hath done all things
well,</hi> so that it could not be done better;
and break forth into that Pathetical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
of the holy Apostle, <hi>O the depth
of the Riches both of the Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37148:52"/>
of God! How unsearchable are his
Iudgments, and his ways past finding out!</hi>
And thence conclude with him, <hi>That of
him, and through him, and to him, are all
things: To whom be glory for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

               <head>A PRAYER.</head>
               <p>GRACIOVS and Merciful Father,
help me thy poor unworthy Creature
to adore thee for that Goodness and Mercy
which thou hast been pleased to Vouchsafe to
me, by all the various Methods of thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
towards me; and more particularly
for those Afflictions which it has pleased
thee to Visit me withal: O Lord be thou
pleased to make them effectual for those gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Ends and Purposes designed by Thee;
That by them I may be made more confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to my Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ,
who was a Man of Sorrow, and acquainted
with Grief; and who learned Obedience by
the things that he suffered; and having suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
entered into his glory; and that by
them also I may find my Heart and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
drawn off from the love of the World,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37148:53"/>
because the Friendship of the World is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to God; but grant, O Lord, that my
Affections may be raised, and set upon things
above, even where my blessed Redeemer sits
at thy right hand; that so when he shall
appear, I also may appear with him in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
Grant also, O Lord, That tho' no Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
at the present is Ioyous but Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
my Afflictions may be so tempered with
the Oyl of Mercy by the great Physician of
my Soul, that they may purge out all those
sinful Distempers and Evil Habits that
Prosperity and Ease has caus'd me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
that so being purged from my Sins,
and refined in the Furnace of Affliction, I
may come forth like Gold. And seeing my
Foolish and Deceitful Heart is so ready to
run after Lying Vanities, let thy Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be as so many Thorns to hedge up my
Way, that so being stopt from running into
the Paths of the Destroyer, my Soul may be
like a Garden inclosed, a Spring shut up,
and a Fountain sealed: And blessed Lord,
grant also that by my Patient continuance
in well doing, under thy Afflicting hand, I
may Evidence the sincerity of my Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towards
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37148:53"/>
thee; which the Waters of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
can never quench, nor all the Floods
of Tribulation drown. And tho' former
Prosperity has caus'd me to forget thee; yet
let this storm that it has pleased thee in
thy Righteous Iudgment to bring upon me,
cause me to fly unto thee for shelter, who
art a Covert from the Storm and from the
Rain; and my only Refuge and Rock of
Defence, where I can be safe against the fear
of Evil. And as the depressing of a Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
makes it grow the Straighter, and the
treading of Cammomile makes it smell the
Sweeter, so let my present Afflictions cause
the Graces of thy holy Spirit in me to send
forth the greater Fragrancy, and to appear
more Eminently: And further be pleased to
grant, O Lord, through thy Wise and all-Disposing
Providence, these light Afflictions
that are but for a moment, may work out
for me a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of Glory: And that when thou shalt
graciously please to accomplish all the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of thy Grace towards me by thy Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
hand, and caused thine Anger towards
me to cease, that my Mouth may be filled with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37148:54"/>
Songs of Diliverance, That I may say with
thy Servant of Old, Bless the Lord, O my
Soul, and all that is within me bless his
holy Name; Bless the Lord, O my Soul,
and forget not all his Benefits, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth
all thine Iniquities, who healeth
all thy Diseases, who redeemeth thy Life
from Destruction, and Crowneth thee with
loving Kindness and tender Mercies! Grant
this, O Lord, for the sake of Iesus Christ,
thy blessed and only Son, who for the Ioy
that was set before him, endured the Cross,
and despised the Shame, and is set down at
the right hand of the Majesty on high. To
whom, with thee, O Father, and the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Spirit, be ascribed all Honour, Glory,
Power and Praise, World without End.

            <head>Meditation VI.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of our Resignation to the Will of God.</head>
            <p>OUR Blessed Saviour, in that most
Excellent Form of Prayer he has
taught us, has made this one Principal
Petition in it, <hi>Thy Will be done on Earth
as it is in Heaven:</hi> And tho' I hope we
all make use of this Prayer, yet how few
of us are there that understand what we
ask? Tho' there is nothing more pleasing
to God, nor nothing that tends more to
the Establishment of our own quiet, than
this Resignation of our Wills to the Will
of God, which we therein pray for: For
could we in times of greatest Trouble,
and at the lowest Ebb of Affliction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that it is the Will of God, without
whom nothing comes to pass, and whose
alone Will is the Rule of all Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that consideration would soon allay
all those storms of Passion and Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
which are so ready to arise in our
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37148:55"/>
Souls under such Dispensations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and make all calm and quiet
there. And this was that which silenc'd
all the Complaints of Gods People in
the Days of Old, when they were even
cover'd with the Cloud of his Anger.
Of which, tho' many Instances might be
given, I shall confine my self to a few.</p>
            <p>AND the first shall be that of old
<hi>Eli</hi> the Priest, who was a good Man, but
too indulgent a Father his wicked Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
—who thereby took Encouragement
to sin; by which God was so provok'd,
that he sent <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Eli</hi> with such a
Message as was enough to make his Ears
to tingle; importing no less than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of him and his house, and that
<hi>the Iniquity of his house should not be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with Sacrifice nor Offering for Ever,</hi>
because <hi>his Sons had made themselves Vile,
and he restrained them not.</hi> And yet even
under so heavy a Message as this was,
the good old Man resigns himself up
to the Will of God, saying, <hi>It is the
LORD, let him do what seemeth him
good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:37148:55"/>
A Second Instance shall be that of
King <hi>David,</hi> when he was forced to fly
from the Rebellion which <hi>Absalom</hi> (his
own Son) had rais'd against him. <hi>Absalom</hi>
having aspir'd to the Kingdom, and
wheedled the People out of their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
and Allegiance, upon a Pretence of
the Mismanagement of his Father, telling
those that came to the King for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in any Cause, That <hi>there was no
Man deputed of the King to hear them,</hi> and
then wishing <hi>he was made Iudge in the
Land, that he might do them Iustice:</hi> By
which sly Insinuations he had stolen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the hearts of the <hi>Isralites</hi> from his
Father: And when by these ill Practices,
things were ripe for an Open Rebellion,
Religion too must be brought in for a Part,
and a Vow to the Lord is pretended to
be paid at <hi>Hebron,</hi> on which pretence
<hi>Absalom</hi> having obtain'd leave to depart
from the King, blows the Trumpet of
Rebellion throughout all <hi>Israel,</hi> and makes
himself King in <hi>Hebron.</hi> This News be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought to <hi>David,</hi> he finds himself
in Danger from his Rebellious Son, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37148:56"/>
thereupon resolves to Abdicate the Royal
City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to which <hi>Absalom</hi> was
hastening as fast as he could. In this flight
of the King, he had several of his Loyal
Subjects to attend him, and among them
were <hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Priests, and
the honest <hi>Levites</hi> with the Ark of God:
But the good King, (who was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
for the Ark of God than for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self)
knowing that <hi>God had chosen the
Gates of Zion before all the Dwellings of
Iacob,</hi> would by no means suffer the
Ark to be carried after him, but sends it
back again into the City; (not knowing
how God might deal with him) with this
Noble Resignation of himself to the Will
of God: <hi>Carry back</hi> (says he to <hi>Zadock)
the Ark of God into the City; if I shall
find Favour with the Lord, he will bring
me again, and shew me both it and his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
But if he thus, say, I have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in thee; behold here am I, let him do
to me as seemeth good unto him.</hi> This is a
truly Royal Example, and well worthy
Imitation.</p>
            <p>A Third Instance of this Resignation
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37148:56"/>
of our Wills to the Will of God, shall
be that of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who after his
Recovery from Sickness, having Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Congratulatory Ambassadors of
<hi>Merodach Baladan</hi> the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
was so pleas'd with the Honour which
he thought was thereby done him, that he
shewed the Ambassadors the House of his
Precious Things, the Silver, and the Gold,
and the Spices, and the Precious Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and all the House of his Armour,
and all that was found in his Treasure.
But this thing was displeasing to the
Lord, who saw <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had his heart
lifted up thereby, and therefore he sends
the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> to him, with this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Message, <hi>Behold the days come, that all
that is in thine House, and that which thy
Fathers have laid up in store until this day,
shall be carried to</hi> Babylon; <hi>nothing shall
be left, saith the Lord: And of thy Sons
that shall Issue from thee, which thou shalt
beget, shall they take away, and they shall
be Eunuchs in the Palace of the King of</hi>
Babylon. Wou'd we know now how
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> took this doleful Message? Why
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:37148:57"/>
instead of fretting against God, or going
about to excuse himself, he resigns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
up to the good pleasure of God, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, Good is the
Word of the Lord which thou hast spoken;
For there shall be Peace and Truth in my
Days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Fourth and last Instance I shall
mention, shall be that <hi>Illustrious One</hi> of
our <hi>Blessed Saviour:</hi> Who being under a
sense of Divine Wrath, in that bitter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony
and Bloody Sweat which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent
for our Sins, in the Garden, and
which none but himself could have born,
(for it would have crush'd all Mankind
into Nothing, and all the Angels too, to
have lain under it) he prayed to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
saying, <hi>If it be possible let this Cup
Pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will,
but as Thou wilt.</hi> Matth. xxvi. 39. And
in the 42d vers. he went away again,
praying the second time, and said, <hi>O my
Father, if this Cup may not pass away ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
I drink it, Thy Will be done:</hi> And in
vers. 44. He prayed again the third time,
saying the same words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:37148:57"/>
THIS is indeed the greatest Instance
of Resignation to the Divine Will, that
can be given. And after such an Instance,
sure none can deny that it is a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
Duty. Nor is it more our Duty than
it is our Priviledge: For when our Wills
are thus resigned to the Will of God,
there is no cross Accident that can sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
us, nor no Affliction trouble us;
because we have given our selves up to
his Disposal, who best knows how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all things for us; and are secur'd in
so doing, that all things shall work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for our good.</p>
            <p>THIS Resignation of Soul to the
Will of God, consists principally in an
absolute Acquiescence to the Divine Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
in every State and Condition of
Life; whereby we are willing that God
should chuse that Condition which he
sees best for us; whether it be Sickness
or Health, Life or Death, Poverty or
Riches, Honour or Disgrace: And this
without Murmuring, or Repining, or
Thinking we are not well dealt with, or
that we cou'd have provided better for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:37148:58"/>
our selves; but on the contrary we ought
to think our present Condition the best
for us, be it what it will, because it is
the Result of Divine Providence; and
this requires, or supposes in us, a sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
belief of God's Governing the World,
and ordering all Affairs in it according
to the Counsel of his own Will. And
he that by a stedfast Faith in God (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
him to be the most Wise, most
Powerful, most Just, most Merciful and
Beneficent Being) has resign'd himself up
to his Disposal, is prepar'd for all Events;
and tho' he may lose Crowns, Kingdoms,
Riches, Honours, Friends, Relations, and
all things else which are look'd upon as
outward Blessings, yet he can never lose
that inward Peace of Conscience and
Satisfaction of Mind, which the World
can neither give nor take away.</p>

               <head>The Soul's Expostulation.</head>
               <p>CONSIDER, O my Soul, if thy
Resignation to the Divine Will,
be so absolute a Duty, what progress
thou hast made therein; and whether
thou hast so given up thy self to the
Will of God, to be absolutely at his
Disposal: That thou art so, is indeed
unquestionable; and so are the Devils
too; for notwithstanding all their Rage,
and all their Malice, they cannot break
those Chains of Darkness wherein they
are bound, to the Judgment of the great
Day; But they have not resign'd their
Wills unto his, but on the contrary do
whatever they can to oppose it, tho in
Vain—But, O my Soul, is thy being at
the Disposal of Divine Providence, the
effect of thy <hi>Choice,</hi> as well as of God's
<hi>Power?</hi> If it be so, 'tis what it ought to
be: But then, <hi>what means this bleating
of the Sheep, and lowing of the Oxen,</hi> as
<hi>Samuel</hi> said to <hi>Saul</hi> in another case?
What means all this murmuring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:37148:59"/>
at thy present Condition? What
means that hankering after those Honours,
Riches, and Pleasures, that thou Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst
heretofore? And thy present Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness
under the want of them? Do'st
thou believe that thy present Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
are the Result of the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and what God thinks best for
thee? Then let thy Mouth be stopt for
ever; For nothing can be more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
than to complain: How prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
is it, O my Soul, to pray to God,
<hi>Thy Will be done;</hi> and yet when it is done,
to murmur? This seems strongly to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
that thou art no further willing
God's Will should be done, than as it
suits with thine; which is the Reverse of
what thou hast pray'd for. Therefore,
O my Soul, either leave off Praying <hi>Thy
Will be done,</hi> or cease to let thy Practice
thus contradict thy Prayers. Remember,
O my Soul, that it is <hi>the foolishness of
Man that perverteth his way, and makes
his heart to fret against the Lord.</hi> And
take heed lest thy repining makes thee
appear to be such a one. Is it not far
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37148:59"/>
better to give up thy self to his Conduct,
by an intire Resignation of thy Will to
his, who better knows how to order thy
Affairs, than thou thy self do'st? So may
the bitter Draught of Affliction be made
a wholesome Potion to thee; whereby
thou may'st Experience the Truth of
<hi>Sampson</hi>'s Riddle, <hi>Out of the Eater comes

               <head>A PRAYER.</head>
               <p>O Almighty and Eternal God, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
all things according to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of thy own blessed Will, and whose Will
is the Rule of all Righteousness; Look down
in Mercy upon a poor and worthless Sinner
before thee, whose heart was lifted up, and
forgot God, in the time of my Prosperity;
and therefore thou hast justly depriv'd me
of those Mercies which I did not Improve
to thy Praise: And since I would not serve
thee in the fulness of all things, it is but
just I shou'd serve thee in the want of them.
And yet such is the Vainty and Deceitfulness
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:37148:60"/>
of my heart, that I am now apt to repine
against thy Providence, and fret against
thee for what thou hast done, instead of
Kissing thy Rod, and Submitting to thy
Fatherly Chastisements: O therefore be thou
pleased to subdue this Rebellious heart of
mine, and by an intire Resignation of my Soul
to thy Soveraign Disposal, cause me to rest
satisfied in every condition into which it
shall please thee to bring me: And however
things may seem to me, through the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of my Mind, and the Darkness of my
Vnderstanding, to go contrary to my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
yet make me to know, O Lord, that it
is my great Interest to acquiesce in thy Will,
who doest all things well. Pardon, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beseech thee, the Stubbornness of my
Heart, and the Vnwillingness of my Will
to submit to thy good Pleasure; and make
me sensible that there is nothing more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs
thy restoring of former Mercies to
me, than my murmuring and repining at thy
Present Dispensations. Give me therefore,
O Lord, such a composedness of Spirit, that
I may thankfully entertain whatever thou
art further pleased to bring upon me, how
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:37148:60"/>
hard soever it may seem to Flesh and Blood,
and be made willing to say, The Will of the
Lord be done. And if the blessed Angels, that
are always in thy presence, and the Spirits of
just Men made perfect, rejoyce in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of thy Will, what am I, sinful Dust
and Ashes, that I shou'd murmur and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
thereat! Help me, O Lord, to Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that, however my heart may fret against
it, yet thy holy Will is the Result of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Wisdom, as well as the Rule of all
Righteousness: And that therefore it is both
my Duty and Interest willingly to submit
thereto. And help me also, O Lord, to believe,
That when thou hast humbled me by thy
present Providences, and brought me to lie
at thy foot, in a due sense of my own Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness,
and a just acknowledgment of
the Righteousness of thy dealings towards
me, that thou wilt again cause the Light
of thy Favour to shine upon me, and make
the Bones that thou hast broken, to rejoyce.
Grant this, O Lord, and whatsoever else
thou seest needful for me, for the sake of Iesus

               <p>O Lord we are brought into Times
of great Sorrow and Affliction,
and we have seen Violence and Spoil
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:37148:62"/>
before our Eyes: Our Houses are full of
Mourning, and our Hearts of bitter La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation:
And tho' thy Temples are
not shut up, yet several of thy Ministers
are shut out of thy Temples! Dearest
Lord! These things are due to our Sins;
Thou art Just and Righteous in thy
Dealings, but we are sinful and wicked:
For we have sinned against the great
Means of thy Grace, and the Mercies of
they Goodness for many years Vouchsafed
to us, and to our Fathers before us: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
which, we are full of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
full of Prophaness, full of Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and most Abominably wicked:
And I, even I, have contributed by a
great measure of my Sins, to fill up
those Woes. But O God! That art Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
as thou art Just, (that delightest
not so much to appear Just as Merciful)
Pardon those Sins of ours that cause these
Woes, and pardon those Sins of mine
which concur to that Cause! And with
the pardon of our Sins, grant us a release
of our Punishments: Let all Feuds and
Animosities cease, and true Piety and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:37148:62"/>
Peace flourish again amongst us! Thou
that out of Evil canst work Good, and
out of Confusion didst set up the Order
of the World, be pleas'd out of those
Evils and Confusions that are upon us,
to bring forth a blessed Establishment for
us! O thou King of Kings, and Judge
of the World, plead the Cause of thy
Servants to the faces of all those who
seek to distress and destroy us! And do
thou from Heaven own us in our Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and deliver us! O thou that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
canst, Mercifully do this for us:
To the Honour of thy great Name, and
to the Comfort and Happiness, both in
Body and Soul, of us and ours, and all
that truly fear and love thee, and true
Religion in and for Thee! Even for thy
Tender Mercies sake, hear us; and for the
Precious Blood and Passion of our dearest
JESUS, help us! Even for his sake, in
whose Merits and Mediation alone
stands all our Hope and Help, thy dear
Son, our only Saviour, Jesus Christ our

               <p>O Lord, the Church is thy Body, and
thou art her Head; She is thy
Spouse, and thou art her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
O save thine own Body, preserve
thine own Spouse! Protect her from all
Enemies, Men and Devils! Keep her
from all Ills, Errors and Dangers! Thou
didst Purchase thy self a Church at the
Price of thy Blood, O let no hand seiz
and spoil so dear a Purchase!</p>
               <p>MORE particularly, O Lord, hear
my Prayers for that part thereof in this
Nation: The Petition of a poor unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Child for a dear distressed Mother!
Many, O Lord, are the Enemies that
wou'd destroy it, and few are the Friends
that it has to defend it; Strong are the
Arms that are ready to pull it down, and
weak are the hands that are willing to
uphold it: But, O Powerful God, do
not thou desert it! Uphold it with thy
mighty Arm! Maintain the Religion
Established amongst us; and thy holy
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:37148:63"/>
Truth and Worship in that Religion!
Maintain a Clergy that may be able by
Learning and a holy Life, to defend thy
Truth and Worship; and the Means that
may continue such a Clergy: Let not Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and Heresie corrupt it, Ignorance
blind it, Superstition infect it, Prophaness
over-grow it, Schism tear it, Sacriledge
devour it, Atheism lay it waste, Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
make it desolate. Lord make us
as happy as we were, and more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and less sinful, that we may be so
happy! Let Errors vanish, Sects cease,
Fury leave us, and the Spirit of Truth
and Love again possess us! Let Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
end, and all Irreverences in thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
be banish'd from us, and holy Order
and Decency be more regarded amongst
us. Let Divisions be cemented, and
Names of Reproach buried in Oblivion,
and the Voice of True Peace and Joy be
heard again in our Land. Lord, let us
have that Religion which may make us
happy in Heaven, and that True Peace
which may give Time and Leave to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
that Religion! And to that end, let
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37148:64"/>
Power be Establish'd upon Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Employ'd for the Preservation
of thy Church and People; and then
maintain that Power and them! O Thou,

thy Church, Grant us these Blessings, to
the Glory of thy Name, the Quiet of our
Lives, and the Saving of our Souls! Even

Keep me from a Revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Spirit, that I fall not into the
hands of thy Vengeance: And since it
is thy Will that I should exercise Pity,
and Patience, and Pardon, let me not

What tho' I have lost my Estate wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and been turn'd out of my Place
for my Loyalty to the King, yet have I

against thee my God? why shou'd I then
Meditate Revenge against the Instruments
whom thou, O Lord, hast made the just
Executioners of thy will for my Deserts:
O help me rather to look unto thee, who
hast justly suffered these things to befal
me for my sins, than to study Revenge
against those that have Injur'd me. Thou,
O most Meek and Merciful Saviour, didst
pray for thy bloody Enemies! O let me
then forgive my greatest Foes! Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my Cause to thee, who wilt do
Justice for me on them, if I seek not to
revenge my self; and for thy self upon
me, if I do. Thine, O Lord, is the
Sword of Vengeance, and thine is the
sharpest Sword. O let me not dare to
take it out of thy hand! Lest while I
strike others, I fall justly by thy Sword.
Tho' Flesh and Blood provoke me to it,
let thy holy Spirit withhold me from
it: And cast and keep out of me that
Evil Spirit, by thy Power, O good God

Thou hast commanded that I should love

I <hi>Ioy</hi> in thy <hi>Cross,</hi> not in thy <hi>Grief,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>THERE are some very lavish in
their Praises of the <hi>Wood</hi> of the <hi>Cross:</hi>
But it was the <hi>Blood of the Cross</hi> by which
Redemption is Purchased: And what
Good doth not grow from and upon that
Pulpit of Repentance, Pillar of Faith,
Anchor of Hope, Magazine of Charity,
Armory of Mortification, School of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:37148:81"/>
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Mirror of Obedience, Rock of

               <p>I Grieve to see Thee Crucify'd <hi>again,</hi>
O Christ, and my Soul is Crucify'd for
having a hand in thy Cross: Wo to the
World for offences, which make Thee
bleed afresh, and bring Thee to thy
Cross again. Wo is me that see Thee dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Crucify'd betwixt Hereticks and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
Thieves of thy Truth; between
Hypocrites and Profligates, Thieves of thy
Grace; amidst Men of Intemperate Heats
and Cools in Religion, Thieves of thy
Honour.</p>
               <p>I Grieve to see Thee Crucify'd in <hi>vain:</hi>
So much of the World lost, when all was
paid for! A Price sufficient to have ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som'd
not a World only, but a Hell-full
of Devils, Effectual only to a handful of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:37148:81"/>
Men. Yea, even within thy Holy Pale,
which should preserve thy Blood to a
drop, wo is me! how is it spilt to a
stream! Whilst so many make void by
their Sins, the healing vertue of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Blood! By Unbelief how many
Millions are lost out of the Church! And
by Mis-belief, how many Thousands in
it! And by Miscarriage of Life, how
many Thousands of Millions both in and
out! My heart bleeds to see thy Creed
without Faith, thy Decalogue without
Obedience, thy Prayer without Use, thy
Sacraments without Reverence! Nay, to
see it made Faith, Conscience, Devotion,
Zeal, to have no respect to Sacrament,
Prayer, Decalogue or Creed! And, Lord,
what Tears, even of Blood, are sufficient
to bewail it! O my dear Lord! Can my
Eyes see thee thus Crucify'd again Twice,
and in vain Once, and my heart not
grieve!—And yet tho' I grieve, I am
not without Hope. And,</p>
               <p>I hope in Thee, and the Blood of thy
Cross alone. I hope for Pardon, because
I read it Seal'd in thy Blood! I hope for
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:37148:82"/>
Salvation, because I find it Purchased un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Seal. Wilt thou not make good
thy Seal? Wilt thou not prefer thy Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase?
Nor Sin nor Devil then shall
Damn me, O Christ; he shall not steal
thy Purchase, nor make void thy Seal:
Thy Blood is my Plea against both: In
it I see my Pardon and Salvation Written;
nor care I, so thou be my Advocate, for
Saint or Angel to set to their Hands. I
hope in Thee for my Salvation.</p>
               <p>AND so I do for my Mothers too,
the Spouse bought with thy Blood, and
Lov'd as thy Body: O Lord thou art her
Saviour, and shall she want thy Salvation?
O let her not want thy Bowels for whom
thou gavest thy Blood! Behold her Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and forgive her Sins! Till thy Blood
hath no Vertue, she is not without hope.
And I know, O Lord, that the Streams
of thy Blood are not yet drain'd, and
that the Sea of thy Mercy still flows as
fresh and free as ever. And therefore will
I hope still.—But,</p>
               <p>I fear too: I dread Temptation: Thy
Cross was made of <hi>Adams</hi> Tree: I fear,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:37148:82"/>
because he fell: I Dread Desertion: I
want both <hi>David's</hi> Grace, and <hi>Solomon's</hi>
Wisdom; and yet tho' I had both, I shou'd
fall, if thou forsak'st me: On the Cross
thy Disciples left thee, but let me never
leave thee: I dread Apostacy! O keep
me from that Sin from which even thy
Blood, thy Cross cannot or will not save
me. But then,</p>
               <p>I fear my self for all this: As my Sins
nail'd thee to thy Cross, so my Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
rivets me in my Sins. The heart is
deceitful above all things, and mine is
desperately wicked; and full of divers
Lusts and Abominations. And therefore
from a Tempest of Temptation, from the
Gulph of Spiritual Desertion, from the
Precipice of Apostacy, and from my self
above all, by the Vertue of thy Cross,
deliver me, O Lord.</p>
               <p>O Christ, my Spirit is Incens'd, and I
am full of Indignation for the Affronts
and Injuries done unto thee! To see thy
Blood spilt or scorn'd; to see thy Passion
forgot, or abus'd; Thy Love without
Memory or Value, thy Pains without
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:37148:83"/>
Belief or Remorse. Who can endure,
O blessed Jesus! to see thy Cross made
the Devils Standard? And thy Wounds
(the only shelter for Sinners) turn 'd into
Cities of Refuge for Sins? To see thy
Passion made the Nurse of Presumption,
and thy Mercy the Milk of all Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations?
When Indignation kindles in
thy poor Servants Soul at so great Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
how is it that Wrath flames not
out in Thine? How is it? Even so it is,
because thou art Jesus! Lovest to save,
and art loth to destroy; Waitest our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and Wavest thy Vengeance.</p>
               <p>I am Ravish'd with that good Spirit
of thine, O Christ! Thou hadst it on the
Cross, and keepest it on the Throne!
Where it appears, it doth Ravish me: In
thy Lips! Thou Prayest their Pardons
that are shedding thy Blood! And thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
for their Salvation that are Butcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thy Body! In thy Arms! Stretch'd
out to Embrace all on Earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
strike not, tho' in all the Power of
Heaven! In thy Eyes! As Thou wast
with one of my Mothers, I am with one
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:37148:83"/>
of Thine. Thy Fury frights me, O Lord:
Thy Favour is that One: The Eye with
which thou didst look at the poor Thief,
and give him both thy Pardon and thy
Paradise: The Eye by which thou didst
look at thy dear Mother; and amidst all
thy Wounds chuse her a Guardian, and
have her in thy Cares. The Eye with which
thou did'st look at the dear Disciple,
and Adopt him, of thy Servant, thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Son. The Eye by which thou didst
look at poor Sinners to be saved, a Church
to be bought, and World to be Ransom'd:
But, in thy Heart, O Lord, O what an
Apparition see I there! Through the
bloody Door of thy Wounded Breast,
a House full of Nothing but Goodness,
Pity, Patience, Mercy! O what a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
is there by the way of the Spear!
To see the Prospect of a poor Sinners sole
delight, a Heart full of Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
in the Brest of a Jesus! A Saviours
Heart! From that Heart, with that Eye,
O Christ behold the Afflicted Mother
(thy Church) and thy dear Disciple, her
Child! Breathe Comfort to her for whom
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:37148:84"/>
thou gavest Blood! And to him who is
the Son of her Comfort! Make Peace
between Mother and Children, where
there should be Love. Let them live by
one Spirit, that are bought with one
Blood! And no longer be one anothers
Cross, but bear one anothers Burdens.</p>
               <p>Dart, Lord, from that blessed Eye of
Pity, these Favours on the Face of that
bleeding Body: and with thy Arms,
Nail'd once to a Cross, now extended
on a Throne, Embrace her; and uphold
her in Life! Advance her Throne for
whom thou did'st endure thy Cross; O
Thou who didst with thy Fingers work
Heaven and Earth, and upholdest all things
by the Word of thy Power, those whom
the World treads under foot, take thou
into thy Arms! In thy blessed Arms, O
thou Omnipotent and All Merciful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
and Saviour of the World, in thy
blessed Arms I leave the Wounded Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and at thy Feet I lay the bleeding
Child.</p>
               <p>JESUS, nourish these holy Passions
in me, which my Heart hath conceived,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37148:84"/>
and my Tongue now brought forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Thee! Let thy holy Passion ever
breed them in me, and thy Spirit Nurse
them for thee, even by the Merits of thy
bloody Passion, I beseech Thee. <hi>Amen!

               <p>O Lord, I am every where in thy

therefore shou'd be prophane no where;
but thy special Presence and Face is in
thy Temple: There therefore I should be

be yet more so: Even the Angels are not
pure enough for such a Heavenly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
how then shall a poor mortal
Man appear at so high and holy a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?
How shall I dare to Communicate

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:37148:85"/>
thy Grace, to come as I may, Penitent.
I will be more humble, because less holy;
and more Wash'd, because so Filthy.
And O Lord, give me Grace so to come.
Let me look over my Life in the Glass
of thy Law, and make me wash with
my Tears what is polluted in my Ways;
and Cleanse in Christ's Blood what I
wash with my Tears: O Lord, in a Bath
of this Water warm'd in that Blood,
flowing from a Sinners bleeding heart,
and Saviour's bloody side, shall I not be
clean if I wash? Pierce my heart, O Lord,
that I may repent; open my heart that
I may believe, that so I may wash and
be clean! Tho' I did not live, let me
believe aright; and let me love whom I
do believe, even thee, O God, Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, who didst send
thy Son to shed his Blood and Redeem
me; and Thee, O Son of God, who
didst come and shed thy Blood to make

               <p>DEAR Saviour! that hast given thy

those high and holy Mysteries! Original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Vnclean, Actually Defiled; and even
since my last Coming and Communicating
(for all my Vows and Protestations before
thee) again and again polluted. In these
straits and stresses of Spirit, how shall my
Soul be satisfied? If I come not at thy call,
I rebel against thy Mercy: If I come, I
trespass upon thy Purity! O my God, I
will not stand out a Rebel; but rather fall
down an humble Suppliant before thee. I

am guilty, Lord Pardon me; I am polluted,
Lord purge me: Tho' guilty, tho' polluted,
I am thy Ransomed Soul, Dear Redeemer,

Let the Graces of thy holy Spirit Sanctifie
me from the stains within me! Let the

Prayers which now come from my Believing
Soul, obtain those Graces from thy holy

which may dispose and prepare me for Thee!
By these fit my Soul for thy Self, and my

thine own, and save me: Possess my Soul,

Earthly Tabernacle, and let me live for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with Thee in thy heavenly Habitation!
Even by the Merits and Vertues of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Body and Blood, O sweet Iesus, I
beseech Thee. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I AM now come, through the Divine
Assistance, to the last thing I Promised,
which is, <hi>Some General Rules and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for our Daily Practice:</hi> In which I
shall be very short, a few things well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,
being better than many; which
oftentimes prove burdensome to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and hinder, instead of help.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:37148:90"/>I HAVE already set down a Form
of Prayer to be us'd Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Times of Affliction; besides which,

               <head>Rules of Devotion for the Morning.</head>
               <p>IN the Morning when you first awake,
lift up your Eyes to God and say, I
<hi>lift up mine Eyes to the Hills from whence
cometh my help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEN lift up your heart to God,
and pray, <hi>Lord keep me from all Sin and
danger this day, for Iesus Christ his sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WHEN you are up, kneel down,
and say this Prayer:</hi> Almighty God, who
hast touched my heart with a sense of thy
fear, and holy dread of thy Majesty, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee give me thy grace, so to govern
my thoughts, and look to my Words and
Ways this day, that I may avoid all Sins,
especially those to which I am most inclin'd,
or may be most provoked: That so my Soul

               <p>WHEN you are ready for your Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

            <div type="section">
               <head>Rules for the Evening.</head>
               <p>AFTER you have Used the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Prayers for Evening Service,
and before you go into your Bed, kneel
down and say this short Prayer: <hi>O God,
who hast made the Day for Labour, and
the Night for Rest, let thy Sons Blood cleanse
me from this Days guilt, that I may sleep
in thy Peace, and rise again refreshed and
preserved by thy Favour, through Iesus

                  <hi>AND this Thanksgiving and Prayer:</hi>
Almighty God, who hast preserved me this
day from many Sins and Dangers, I do
humbly magnifie thy Name for thy Grace
and Goodness towards me, beseeching Thee
to forgive me all the Errors of this day,
whereof my Conscience doth or may accuse
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:37148:91"/>
me. And grant that those sins which by
my frailty I have Committed, may by the
help of thy Spirit be more carefully avoided;
that I may ever stand in thy Favour, Walk
under thy Protection, and now rest and lie
down in thy Peace, and at last come to thy
heavenly Kingdom, through the Merits and
Mediation of Iesus Christ. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:37148:91"/>
               <head>Some General Rules for our Daily Practice.</head>
               <p>1. REmember, That tho' Knowledge,
especially the Knowledge of
God, be an excellent thing, yet it will
be no farther available to thee, than as
thou puttest it into Practice: For Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
without Practice, is like Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Heat, which never ripens any Fruit
to the Glory of God, or Good of thy
own Soul. Be sure therefore to labour
after the Knowledge of Gods Will, and
to put that Knowledge into Practice.</p>
               <p>2. Let the Worship of God have the
first place in thy Affections and Actions.
And tho' Private Prayer and secret Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
be necessary, yet let not Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers in the House of God be
Omitted.</p>
               <p>3. Neglect not the Common Prayers
and other Publick Duties of Devotion,
but say with holy David, <hi>I was glad
when they said unto me, We will go into
the House of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Be careful that Divine Service be
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:37148:92"/>
performed aright, as it ought to be, and
delight thy self in the Beauty of Gods
House.</p>
               <p>5. In all the Various Changes that
befal thee, especially in Afflictions and
Distresses, make Prayer thy Refuge.</p>
               <p>6. Set aside appointed times for thy
Private Devotions, and observe them not
only out of Custom, but of fervency of
Spirit, to increase thy Piety.</p>
               <p>7. The Pious Rites and Ceremonies
of the Church, esteem highly of; I mean
those which are not repugnant ot Gods
Word; and on the other side, fly Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</p>
               <p>8. Use constantly the Prayers for the
Church; and by name, for all those for
whom thou art bound to pray, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Royal Family.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. If thou art a Father of a Family,
govern all under thy Care, piously and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously:
Let all resort to Morning and
Evening Prayer, either Privately, or Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
if it may be. And let this be a
Law to thy Family: Whosoever comes
within this House, let him be Sober, Just,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:37148:92"/>
Religious, and Honest in all things: Lye
not, Swear not, Forswear, nor Blaspheme
not: Detract not from others, mind not
Cups and Revels; offend not any Bodies
Ears, or Eyes, or Mind, either by Words
or Deeds. Whoso doth otherwise, let
him depart hence.</p>
               <p>10. Discipline thy Children betimes,
and Train them up in the way they
should go, and when they are old they
will not depart from it.</p>
               <p>11. Rule thy Wife with Prudence;
and provoke her to the Love of Vertue
and good Works, by thy Example.</p>
               <p>12. If thou hast Daughters, be solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
about the Preservation of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity;
the Age is corrupted, and full of
Debauchery; and if they come to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
they are in danger of Eternal Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine;
and therefore this requires thy ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Care, for thou hast no Treasure so
much expos'd as these. And to this End,
keep with a double-Lock their Ears and
Tongue from Obscenity and Scurrility;
let none come near them, that use impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Jests or Gestures, for shameless
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:37148:93"/>
Companions and evil Conversation, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts
good Manners, and ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
as so many Serpents and Vipers.</p>
               <p>13. Be careful to avoid all known
Sins: To which End be sure thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
not the least fault wittingly or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
for the dearest Friends sake: It
is better to renounce all Friendship with
Men, than to endanger the breaking of
thy Friendship with God. And nothing
will break this Friendship sooner than
Sin.</p>
               <p>14. Use not thy self unto Swearing;
I mean not only Vain and Prophane
Swearing, but also Promisory Oaths:
But if thou hast made any such, take
care to perform 'em, tho' it may be to
thy own outward hurt.</p>
               <p>15. Vow nothing rashly, but upon
great Deliberation; and what thou hast
Vowed, pay.</p>
               <p>16. Imitate the Life of thy blessed
Saviour; and follow the steps of his
Saints in all things wherein they ought
to be imitated.</p>
               <p>17. Next after thy Duty to God,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:37148:93"/>
consider what thou owest to thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
and do it whilst it is in the Power
of thy hand.</p>
               <p>18. Do good to all, according to thy
Ability; Feed the Hungry, give drink to
the Thirsty, Entertain the Stranger, Cloath
the Naked, Visit the Sick, Redeem the
Prisoners, and Bury the Dead. This Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
belongs to the Body.</p>
               <p>19. There is likewise a Charity due
to the Soul, which is, To instruct the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
Correct the Sinner, Counsel the
Doubtful, Comfort the Afflicted, indure
Injuries, forgive Wrongs, pray for Others,
yea, for thy Enemies.</p>
               <p>20. Observe Friendship with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
fasten that knot; and if it be
loosed, tie it again. Reconcile those
that are fallen out. Strifes and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which are the Bane of Charity,
Extinguish and Wipe away.</p>
               <p>21. Interpret all things from others in
the best sense; scorn none, nor detract
from any; neither provoke 'em by Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Opprobrious Terms; but give to
all, that honour that belongs to 'em.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:37148:94"/>
22. Let thy gesture be without Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation,
yet not Phantastical; and let
thy Countenance be Free, but not Lofty,
and Chearful, but not Lowring; let thy
Speech be Sober, Simple, and Harmless,
without Deceit or Flattery, and without
Mimical Actions, like a Stage-play.</p>
               <p>23. Be sensible of the hand of God
under all Afflictions; and think with thy
self that he does nothing without a Cause,
and let that keep thee, humble, and put
thee upon a serious Reflection on thy
past Actions.</p>
               <p>24. If Reproaches, Revilings, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Injuries be thrown upon thee, streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
thy Soul in God, and under-go them
both with Courage and Constancey; and,
as far as thou art Innocent, with Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</p>
               <p>25. Under all Afflictions be silent, let
the Causes be what they Will; for it
argues Impatience to Complain: Beware
therefore that thou accuse neither Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
nor Men; for none is more injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to thee, than thou to thy self, if thou
be Impatient. Righteous is the Lord, and
true are his Judgments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:37148:94"/>
26. Be sure take heed, least under thy
Afflictions thou forgettest thy Creator,
and seekest Deliverance by indirect
means: For many have stumbled upon
this Rock, and been broken to pieces by
it: For such men wou'd prescribe to
God, and have him directed by their
foolish Fancies: <hi>But who hath directed
the Spirit of the Lord? Or being his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour
have taught Him?</hi> 'Tis a vain thing
to attempt it. Therefore to be willing
to tarry till God sees good to deliver,
is the way to hasten our Deliverance;
but to go about to deliver our selves, and
throw off the Burden that God has laid
upon us, is the only way to bind it on
the faster, and to keep back that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
which (for ought we know) may
be at the Door. And therefore,</p>
               <p>27. If the Times compel thee to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for Righteousness sake, be not afraid:
The three Children lost nothing by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the fiery Furnace, so long as there
was a Fourth there with them, which
was the Son of God.</p>
               <p>28. In times of Affliction especially,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:37148:95"/>
throw away all vain desire of Riches;
despise the World, and all the Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it, whether they be Honours,
Pleasures, Friends and Acquaintance, or
whatever else. That which keeps down
thy Affections from mounting to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and soaring Above, is a dead weight,
which thou hadst better be without.</p>
               <p>29. Whatever thou losest, take care
to keep thy Innocence: If thou losest
all the World, and keepest thy Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
thou mayst yet be a Gainer. But
if thou losest thy Innocence, then indeed
thou losest All, and thy Loss becomes
truly Unvaluable.</p>
               <p>30. If thou wouldest preserve thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
make Gods Word thy Rule,
and humbly implore the gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and Guidance of his holy Spirit:
For he it is that leads in the way of
Righteousness, and in the midst of the
Paths of Judgment; and he has assur'd
us in his Word, That if in all our Ways
we acknowledge him, he will direct our
Paths.</p>
