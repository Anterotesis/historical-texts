            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>I shall be turnd out, and constraind to beg.</l>
                  <l>I thought, his Friend replyd, that you had known</l>
                  <l>The World too well, to strip your self of all,</l>
                  <l>And trust to the good Nature of a Son,</l>
                  <l>But what is past cannot be now undone;</l>
                  <l>I think I have a Project in my head,</l>
                  <l>Will settle you for your life, and you restore</l>
                  <l>To greater Freedom, than you had before.</l>
                  <l>If you do this, the injurd Man replied,</l>
                  <l>You'll be to me, a Father, and a God.</l>
                  <l>Know then, replyd his Friend, I too was once</l>
                  <l>A wealthy Citizen, I too, had a Son,</l>
                  <l>To whom I gave a plentiful Estate,</l>
                  <l>To set him forth i'th' World, but not my All,</l>
                  <l>Something I kept, against a rainy day,</l>
                  <l>Besides a Rent Charge, upon which I live;</l>
                  <l>I have two thousand Guineas in a Chest,</l>
                  <l>With these I'll trust you, these at several times,</l>
                  <l>You, and I, to your Lodgings will convey.</l>
                  <l>What they contrivd, they soon put in effect,</l>
                  <l>Then by advice, th' Old Man a Sickness feignd,</l>
                  <l>Doctors, and 'Pothecaries, came in shoals.,</l>
                  <l>With Clyster-pipes, and Gally-pots, and Glasses;</l>
                  <l>To whom, when's Son profferd to pay their dues,</l>
                  <l>Hold Child, said he, I have some Money left,</l>
                  <l>Here, take this Key, it opens such a Trunk,</l>

                  <l>He goes, unlocks the Trunk, and finds the Gold,</l>
                  <l>But without breaking Bulk, returns the Key,</l>
                  <l>And was so generous, to defray the Charge</l>
                  <l>Of's Father's Sickness, out of his own Purse.</l>
                  <l>The Old Man recovers, quits his Bed, comes down,</l>
                  <l>Dines, and then proffers to go out, and Smoke</l>
                  <l>Under a Shed, i'th' Yard, as he was wont.</l>
                  <l>Which, when his Daughter saw, Sir, what d'you mean,</l>

                  <l>Use the House freely, take it for your own;</l>
                  <l>You have been lately Sick, you're weak, and old,</l>

                  <l>IN former Times, the Empire of the Birds</l>
                  <l>Did not belong to the Kings Eldest Son.</l>
                  <l>Or any other of the Royal Blood,</l>
                  <l>But was disposd of, as the States thought good.</l>
                  <l>The Bird, who had most Votes in the Grand Diet,</l>
                  <l>Was ownd King, and possessd the Throne in quiet.</l>
                  <l>Of that Assembly, such the Customs were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </l>
                  <l>It was, freely, Elected every Year</l>
                  <l>Out of each several Species of Birds,</l>
                  <l>But might not Act, until the King was dead.</l>
                  <l>Freedom of Speech, Liberty in Debates,</l>
                  <l>Were Fundamental Privileges of those States;</l>
                  <l>The greatest, and the least, were Equal there,</l>
                  <l>None were brow-beaten, none of them domineerd:</l>
                  <l>The Wren was not despisd, nor the Eagle feard.</l>
                  <l>No Votes were to be bought, or sold; no Bribes</l>
                  <l>Given, to corrupt the Officers, or Scribes:</l>
                  <l>And many more, too long, here to inesrt.</l>
                  <l>A King died, and the August Assembly met,</l>
                  <l>A sit Successor on the Throne to set.</l>
                  <l>The first day of the Sessions, 'twas decreed,</l>
                  <l>No Bird of Prey should to the Crown succeed;</l>
                  <l>For they had, heretofore, their Tyranny felt.</l>
                  <l>This raisd the Ostriches, and Peacocks hopes,</l>
                  <l>To obtain the Crown, by their Embroiderd Copes.</l>
                  <l>

                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:101634:63"/>The Pulses of some of the House they tried,</l>
                  <l>But found themselves, even by their Friends, denied.</l>
                  <l>Several Factions, and Cabals were framd,</l>
                  <l>But, before any Candidate was namd,</l>
                  <l>A Politic Parrot to the Rostrum fled,</l>
                  <l>A Parrot, by a Learned Doctor bred,</l>
                  <l>Who often to him talkd, and sometimes read,</l>
                  <l>And with Chymeric Notions filld his Head,</l>
                  <l>Out of old Legends, and Romances culld,</l>
                  <l>Wherewith the World had a long time been gulld.</l>
                  <l>Having cravd Audience, he his Speech began:</l>
                  <l>Let not this Noble Senate take it ill,</l>
                  <l>That I presume, my Advice to interpose,</l>
                  <l>Hear it then, if you think fit, with me close.</l>
                  <l>Under the Cope of Heaven, there is but one,</l>
                  <l>Of all the Birds, worthy to mount the Throne,</l>
                  <l>No more than One. Then he the Fenix nam'd,</l>
                  <l>And on his Vertues, a long hour declaimd,</l>
                  <l>With so Pathetic, and Perswasive Note,</l>
                  <l>That it upon the Attentive Senate wrought</l>
                  <l>To choose the Fenix, by Unanimous Vote.</l>
                  <l>'Twas next debated, how the Instrument</l>
                  <l>Of his Election, might to th' King be sent;</l>
                  <l>And how the Ambassadors should find the Road,</l>
                  <l>For they were all i'th' dark, as to's Abode.</l>
                  <l>Ten thousand Couriers, with expanded Wing,</l>
                  <l>Were sent abroad, in Quest of this new King.</l>
                  <l>They visited every Climate, every Zone,</l>
                  <l>All parts o'th' Globe, which yet remain unknown:</l>
                  <l>Seas, Mountains, Lakes, every Hill, every Plain,</l>
                  <l>Caves, Grotto's, Hermites Cells, but all in vain.</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>This PERFECT KING could never yet be found.</l>
