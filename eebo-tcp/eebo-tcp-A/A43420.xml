            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THis Book may justly challenge the first place for antiquity, from all the Books in the World, being written some hundreds of yeers before <hi>Moses</hi> his time, as I shall endeavour to make good. The Originall (as far as is known to us) is <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,</hi> and severall Translations thereof have been published, as <hi>Greek, Latine, French, Dutch, &amp;c.</hi> but never <hi>English</hi> before. It is pity the <note n="*" place="margin">Doct. <hi>Everard.</hi>

                  <p>Concerning the Authour of the Book it self, Four things are considerable, <hi>viz.</hi> His Name, Learning, Countrey, and Time. 1. The name by which he was commonly styled, is, <hi>Hermes Trismegistus,</hi> i. e. <hi>Mercurius ter Maximus,</hi> or, The thrice greatest Intelligencer. And well might he be called <hi>Herm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> right understanding the Reason of his Name. 3. For his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb facs="tcp:42089:3"/>
he was King of <hi>Egypt.</hi> 4. For his Time, it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Controversie, betwixt those that write of this Divine, ancient Author, what time he lived in. Some say he lived after <hi>Moses</hi> his time, giving this slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Reason for it, <hi>viz.</hi> Because he was named <hi>Ter Maximus;</hi> for being preferred <note n="*" place="margin">Franci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scus Flussas</note> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Customs) being chief Philosopher, to be chief of the Priesthood; and from thence, to be chief in Government, or King. But if this be all their ground, you must excuse my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from them, and that for this reason, Because according to the most learned of his <note n="*" place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of all things contained in the World; which things he divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Three Kingdoms (as he cals them,) <hi>viz. Mineral, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Animal;</hi> which Three, he did excell in the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of; also, because he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to, and transmitted to Posterity (although in an Aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall, and obscure style) the Knowledge of the Quintestence of the whole Universe (which Universe, as I said before, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Three Parts) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called, The great <hi>Elixir</hi> of the Philosophers; which is the Receptacle of all Celestiall and Terrestiall Vertues; which Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, many ignorantly deny, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have chargeably sought after, yet few, but some, yea, and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-men</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:42089:4"/>
upon a <hi>Smaragdine</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the Valley of <hi>Ebron,</hi> after the Flood. So that the Reason before alleaged to prove this Authour to live after <hi>Moses,</hi> seems invalid; neither doth it any way appear, that he lived in <hi>Moses</hi> his time, although it be the opinion of some, as of <hi>Iohu Functius,</hi> who saith in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, That he lived twenty one yeers before the <hi>Law</hi> was given by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: But the Reasons that he, and others give, are far weaker than those that I shall give, for his living before <hi>Moses</hi> his time. My reasons for that, are these; First, Because it is received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Ancients, that he was the first that invented the Art of communicating Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the World, by Writing or Engraving. Now if so, then in all probability he was before

                     <hi>Moses;</hi> for it is said of <hi>Moses,</hi> that he was from <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 7. 22</note> his childhood, skilled in all the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Learning which could not well have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Literature, which we never read of any, before that invented by <hi>Hermes.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, He is said by <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 10.</note> himself, to be the Son of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and by <note n="*" place="margin">Sanch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>In this Book, though so very
<pb facs="tcp:42089:5"/>
old, is contained more true knowledge of God and Nature, than in all the Books in the World besides, I except onely Sacred Writ: And they that shall judiciously read it, and rightly understand it, may well be excused from reading many Books; the Authors of which, pretend so much to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Creatour, and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If God ever appeared in any man, he appeared in him, as it appears by this Book. That a man who had not the benefit of his Ancestors knowledge, being, as I said before, The first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter of the Art of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Knowledge to Posterity by writing, should be so high a Divine, and so deep a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, seems to be a thing more of God, than of Man; and therefore it was the opinion of

There is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Book, that true Philosophy, without which, it is impossible ever to attain to the heighth, and exactnesse of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Religion. According to this Philosophy, I call him a Philosopher, that shall learn and study the things that are, and how they are ordered, and governed, and by whom, and for what cause, or to what end; and he that doth so, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thanks to, and admire the Omni potent Creator. Preserver, and Director of all these things. And he that shall be thus truly thankfull, may truly be called Pious, and Religious; and he that is Religious, shall more and more, know where, and what the Truth is: And learning
<pb facs="tcp:42089:6"/>
that, he shall yet be more and more Religious.</p>
                  <p>The glory and splendour of Philosophy, is an endevouring to understand the chief Good, as the Fountain of all Good: Now how can we come neer to, or finde out the Fountain, but by making use of the Streams as a conduct to it? The operations of Nature, are Streams run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Fountain of Good, which is God. I am not of the ignorant, and foolish opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of those that say, The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Philosophers, are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Atheists; as if to know the Works of God, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his goings forth in the Way of Nature, must necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a man to deny God. The <note n="*" place="margin">Job 38.</note> Scripture disapproves of this as a sottish Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and experience contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts it: For behold! Here is

the greatest Philosopher, and therefore the greatest Divine.</p>

                  <p>I O my Son, write this first Book, both for Humanity sake, and for Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For there can be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion more true or just, than to know the things that are; and to acknowledge thanks for all things, to him that made them: which thing I shall not cease continually to do.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What then should a man do, O Father, to lead his life well; seeing there is nothing here true?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be Pious and Religious, O my Son; for he that doth so, is the best and highest Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher; and without Philosophy,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42089:9"/>
it is impossible ever to attain to the heighth and exactnes of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety or Religion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But he that shall learn and study the things that are; and how they are ordered and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned; and by whom, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p n="6">6. For never, O Son, shall, or can that Soul, which while it is in the Body lightens and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>de back to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: For it is infinitely enamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42089:9"/>
thereof, and forgetteth all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; and when it hath learned and known its <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor,</hi> it can no more Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, or depart from that Good.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And let this, O Son, be the end of Religion and Piety; whereunto when thou art once arrived, thou shalt both live wel, and die blessedly, whilest thy Soul is not ignorant whither it must return, and flie back again.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For this onely, O Son, is the way to the <hi>Truth,</hi> which our <hi>Progenitors</hi> travelled in; and by which, making their Journey, they at length attained to the Good. It is a Venerable way, and plain, but hard and difficult for the Soul to go in, that is in the Body.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. For first, it must war against its own self, and after much Strife and Dissention, it must be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of one part; for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42089:10"/>
is of one against two, whilest it flies away, and they strive to hold and detain it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But the victory of both is not like; for the one hasteth to that which is Good, but the other is a neighbor to the things that are Evil; and that which is Good, desireth to be set at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; but the things that are Evil, love Bondage and Slavery.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And if the two parts be overcome, they become quiet, and are content to accept of it as their <hi>Ruler;</hi> but if the one be overcome of the two, it is by them led and carried to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished by its being and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance here.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. This is, O Son, the Guide in the way that leads thither; for thou must first forsake the Body before thy end, and get the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in this Contention and Strifefull life, and when thou
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42089:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hast overcome return.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But now, O my Son, I will by Heads run thorow the things that are: Understand thou what I say, and remember what thou hearest.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. All things that are, are moved; onely that which is not, is unmoveable.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Every Body is change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

23. That which is alwayes made, is alwayes corrupted.</p>

                  <p n="25">25. First, God, Secondly, the World; Thirdly, Man.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. The World for Man, Man for God.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Of the Soul; that part which is Sensible is mortall, but that which is Reasonable is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.</p>

                  <p n="33">33. Every thing that suffers

is Sensible; every thing that is Sensible suffereth.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Every thing that is sad rejoyceth also, and is a mortall living Creature.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Not every thing that joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is also sad, but is an eternall living thing.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Not every Body is sick; every Body that is sick, is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveable.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. The Mind in God.</p>

Thus, O Son, the whole Nature and Composition of those living things called Men, is very prone to Malieiousnesse, and is very familiar, and as it were nourished with it, and therefore is delighted with it.

When he had thus said, he was changed in his <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Form,</hi> and straight-way in the twinckling of an eye, all things were opened unto me: And I saw an infinite sight, all things were become light, both sweet and exceedingly pleasant; and I was wonderfully delighted in the beholding it.</p>

5. But after a little while, there was a darknesse made in part, coming down obliquely, fearfull and hideous, which seemed unto me to be changed into a certain <hi>moyst nature,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably troubled, which yielded a smoke as from fire; and from whence proceeded a voyce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable, and very mournfull, but inarticulate; insomuch that it seemed to have come from the Light.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Then from that Light, a certain <hi>holy Word joyned it self unto Nature,</hi> and out-flew the pure and unmixed Fire from the moyst Nature upward on high: it was exceeding <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>sharp,</hi> and <hi>operative</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And the <hi>Air</hi> which was also light, followed the <hi>Spirit</hi> and mounted up to <hi>Fire,</hi> (from the Earth and the Water) inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it seemed to hang and depend upon it.</p>

                  <p n="8">8. Then said <hi>Poemander</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, Dost thou understand this <hi>U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. How is that, quoth I? Thus, replyed he, Understand it: <hi>That which in thée séeth, and heareth the Word of the Lord, and the Minde, the Father, God, differ not one from the other; and the union of these, is Life.</hi>

                  <p n="11">11. But when he nodded to me, I beheld in my minde the Light that is in innumerable, and the truely indefinite <hi>orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>world;</hi> and that the fire is comprehended or contained in or by a most great Power and constrained to keep its station.</p>

Thus <hi>Pimander</hi> to me: But whence, quoth I, or whereof are the Elements of Nature made? <hi>Pimander.</hi> Of the Will and Counsell of God; which taking the Word, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the beautifull World (in the Archetype thereof) imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated it, and so made this World, by the Principles and vitall Seeds or Soul-like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of it self.</p>

things unmoveable, that is to say, Things Divine and Humane; every one of which himself will have so to be; but action or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, is of another thing or elsewhere, as we have taught in other things, Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, which must here also be understood.</p>

of this intelligible clearnesse.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. For it is more swift and sharp to pierce, and innocent or harmlesse withall, and full of immortality; and they that are capable, and can draw any store of this spectacle, and sight, do many times fall asleep from the Body, into this most fair and beauteous Vision; which thing <hi>Celius</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> our Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors, obtained unto.</p>

28. On the contrary, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Soul is Knowledge; for he that knows, is both good and religious, &amp; already Divine.</p>

                  <p n="35">35.

And it was once made, and is alwayes, and is ever in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and made, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally makes, or generates things that have quantity and quality.</p>
                  <p n="38">38, For it is moveable, and

43. And the World is the first, and Man the second living wight after the World, but the first of things that are mortall; and therefore hath whatsoever benefit of the Soul all the other have: And yet for all this, he is not only not good, but flatly evill, as being mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. For the World is not good, as it is moveable; nor evil, as it is immortall.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. But Man is evil, both as he is moveable, and as he is mortall.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. But the Soul of Man is carried in this manner, <hi>The Minde is in Reason, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Soul, the Soul in the Spirit, the Spirit in the Body.</hi>

after a certain manner beareth it.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. Wherefore some also have thought the Soul to be blood, being deceived in Nature, not knowing that first the Spirit must return into the Soul, and then the blood is congealed, the veines and arteries emptied, and then the living thing dieth: And this is the death of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. All things depend of one beginning, and the beginning depends of that which is one and alone.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. And the beginning is moved, that it may again be a beginning; but that which is one, standeth and abideth, and is not moved.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. There are therefore these three, <hi>God the Father and the God, the World and Man:</hi> God hath the World, and the

world hath Man; and the World is the Son of God, and Man is as it were the Off-spring of the World.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. For God is not ignorant of man, but knows him perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and will be known by him. This only is healthfull to man; the Knowledge of God: This is the return of <hi>Olympus;</hi> by this only the Soul is made good, and not sometimes good, and sometimes evil, but of necessity Good.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. <hi>Tat.</hi> What meanest thou, O Father?</p>
                  <p n="54">54. <hi>Trism.</hi> Consider, O Son, the Soul of a Childe, when as yet it hath received no disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of its Body, which is not yet grown, but is very small: how then, if it look upon it self, it fees it self beautifull, as not having been yet sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

it were depending yet upon the Soul of the World.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. But when the Body is grown, and distracteth the Soul it ingenders Forgetfulness, and partakes no more of the <hi>Fair, and the Good,</hi> and Forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is Evilnesse.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. The like also happeneth to them that go out of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: For when the Soul runs back into it self, the Spirit is contracted into the blood, and the Soul into the Spirit; but the Minde being made pure, and free from these cloathings; and being Divine by Nature, taking a fiery Body, rangeth abroad in every place, leaving the Soul to judgment, and to the punishment, it hath deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. <hi>Tat.</hi> Why dost thou say so, O Father, That the Minde is separated from
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42089:39"/>
the Soul, and the Soul from the Spirit? When even now thou saidst the Soul was the Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Apparell of the-Minde, and the Body of the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. <hi>Trism.</hi> O Son, he that heares must co-understand, and conspire in thought with him that speakes: yea, he must have his hearing swifter and sharper, then the voyce of the speaker.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. The disposition of these Cloathings or Covers, is done in the Earthly Body; for it is impossible, that the minde should establish or rest it self, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and of it self, in an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Body neither is the earthly Body able to bear such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mottality: And therefore, that it might suffer so great vertue, the Minde compacted as it were, and took to it self the pasfible Body of the Soul, as a Covering or a Cloathing. And the Soul
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42089:39"/>
being also in some sort Divine, useth the Spirit as her Minister and Servant; and the Spirit go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth the living thing.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. When therefore the Minde is separated, and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the Earthly Body, presently it puts on its Fiery Coat, which it could not do, having to dwell in an Earthly Body.</p>

                     <hi>THE Sixth Book</hi> That in God alone is good.</head>
                  <p>GOod, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> is in nothing but in God alone; or rather God himself is the Good always.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And if it be so, then must he be an Essence or Substance, voyd of all motion and genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but nothing is voyd or empty of him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And this Essence hath about or in himself a <hi>Stable,</hi> and firm <hi>Operation,</hi> wanting nothing, most full, and giving abundantly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. One thing is the Beginning
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42089:50"/>
of all things, for it giveth all things; and when I name the Good, I mean that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together and always Good.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This is present to none, but God alone; for he wanteth nothing, that he should desire to have it, nor can any thing be taken from him; the losse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may grieve him; for sorrow is a part of evilnesse.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Nothing is stronger then he, that he should be opposed by it; nor nothing equal to him, that he should be in love with it; nothing unheard of to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with, nothing wiser to be envious at.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And none of these being in his Essence, what remains, but only the Good?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For as in this, being such an Essence, there is none of the evils; so in none of the other things shall the Good be found.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:42089:51"/>
9. For in all other things, are all other things, as well in the small as the great, and as well in the particulars, as in this living Creature; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and mightiest of all.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For all things that are made or generated, are full of Passion, Generation it self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Passion; and where Passion is, there is not the Good; where the Good is, there is no Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; where it is day, it is not night, and where it is night, it is not day.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Wherefore it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in Generation should be the Good, but only in that which is not generated or made.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Yet as the Participation of all things is in the Matter bound, so also of that which is Good. After this manner is the World good, as it maketh
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42089:51"/>
all things, and in the part of making or doing (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) it is Good, but in all other things not Good.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. For it is passible, and moveable, and the Maker of passible things.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. In man also the Good is ordered <hi>(or taketh denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)</hi> in comparison of that which is evil; for that which is not very evil, is here Good; and that which is here called Good, is the least particle, or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evil.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. It is impossible therefore, that the Good should be here pure from Evil, for here the Good groweth Evil, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil, it doth not still abide Good, and not abiding Good, it becomes evil.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Therefore in God alone is the Good, or rather God is the Good.</p>
                  <p n="17">
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:42089:52"/>
17. Therefore, O <hi>Asclepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> there is nothing in men <hi>(or among men)</hi> but the name of Good, the thing it self is not, for it is impossible; for a materiall Body receiveth <hi>(or comprehendeth)</hi> is not, as being on every side encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed, and coarcted with evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and labors, and griefs, and desires, and wrath, and deceipts, and foolish opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And in that which is the worst of all, <hi>Asclepius,</hi> every one of the forenamed things, is here beleeved to be the greatest good, especially that supream mischief <gap reason="foreign">

Knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> put this assurance in my minde, that it is impossible it should be in the World.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. For the World is the fulnesse of evilnesse; but God is the fulnesse of Good, or Good of God.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. For the eminencies of all appearing Beauty, are in the Essence more pure, and more sincere, and peradventure they are also the Essences of it.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. For we must be bold to say, <hi>Asclepius,</hi> That the Essence of God, if he have an Essence, is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="23">23. For all things that are subject to the eye, are Idols, and as it were shadows; but those things that are not subject to the eye, are ever; especially
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42089:53"/>
the <hi>Essence</hi> of the Fair and the Good.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And as the eye cannot see God, so neither the Fair, and the Good.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. For these are the parts of God that partake the Nature of the whole, proper, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar unto him alone, insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, most lovely, whereof ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God is enamoured, or they are enamoured of God.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. If thou canst understand God, thou shalt understand the <hi>Fair,</hi> and the <hi>God,</hi> which is most shining, and enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and most enlightened by God.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. For that Beauty is above comparison, and that Good is inimitable, as God himself.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. As therefore thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandest God, so understand the Fair, and the Good, for
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42089:53"/>
these are incommunicable to any other living Creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are inseparable from God.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. If thou seek concerning God, thou seekest or askest also of the Fair; for there is one way that leads to the same thing, that is, <hi>Piety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p n="30">30. Wherefore, they that are ignorant, and go not in the way of Piety, dare call Man Fair and Good, never seeing so much as in a dream, what Good is; but being infolded and wrapped upon all evil and beleeving that the evil is the Good, they by that meanes, both use it unsatiably, and are afraid to be deprived of it; and therefore they strive by all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means, that they may not only have it, but also encrease it.</p>

                  <p>VVHither are you carried, O men, drunkenwith drinking up the strong Wine of Ignorance? which seeing you cannot bear: why do you not vomit it up again?</p>

                  <p n="3">3. For the malice of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance surroundeth all the Earth, and corrupteth the Soul, shut up in the Body, not suffering it to arrive at the Havens of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Suffer not your selves to be carried with the great stream, but stem the tide, you that can lay hold of the Haven of Safety, and make your full course to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Seek one that may lead you by the hand, and conduct you to the door of Truth, and Knowledge, where the cleer Light is, that is pure from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, where there is not one drunken, but all are sober, and in their heart look up to him, whose pleasure it is to be seen.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. For he cannot be heard with ears; nor seen with eyes,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42089:66"/>
nor expressed in words, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in minde and heart.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But first thou must tear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeces, and break thorow the garment thou wearest; the web of Ignorance, the foundation of all Mischief, the bond of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the dark Coverture, the living Death, the sensible Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casse, the Sepulchre, carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with us, the domesticall Thief, which in what he loves us, hates us, envies us.</p>

                  <p n="9">9. Therefore doth it labour
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42089:67"/>
to make good those things that seem, and are by the Senses, jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and determined; and the things that are truly, it hides, and envellopeth in much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, filling what it presents unto thee, with hatefull pleasure, that thou canst neither hear what thou shouldest hear, nor see what thou shouldest see.</p>

                  <p n="18">18. <hi>Asclep.</hi> Confessedly.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. <hi>Herm.</hi> Therefore the place is unbodily; but that which is unbodily, is either some Divine thing, or God himself. And by some thing Divine, I do not mean that which was made or begotten.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. If therefore it be Divine, it is an Essence or Substance; but if it be God, it is above Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; but he is otherwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</p>
                  <p n="21">21: For the first, God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, not to himself, but to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42089:69"/>
us; for that which is intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is subject to that which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth by Sense.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Therefore God is not intelligible to himself; for not being any other thing from that which is understood, he cannot be understood by himself.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. But he is another thing from us; and therefore is he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by us.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. If therefore Place be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, it is not Place, but God; but if God be intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he is intelligible not as Place, but as a capable Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Now every thing that is moved, is moved, not in or by that which is moved, but in that which standeth or resteth; and that which moveth, standeth or resteth: for it is impossible it should be moved with it.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. <hi>Asclep.</hi> How then, O
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42089:69"/>
                     <hi>Trismegistus,</hi> are those things that are here, moved with the things that are moved? for thou sayest, that the Spheres that wander are moved by the Sphere that wanders not.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. <hi>Herm.</hi> That, O <hi>Ascle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> is not a moving together, but a countermotion; for they are not moved after a like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but contrary one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And contrariety hath a standing resistance of motion, for the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or resistance, is a staying of motion.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Therefore the wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spheres being moved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily to that Sphere which wandereth not, shall have one from another contrariety stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it self.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. For this <hi>Bear</hi> which thou seest neither rise nor go down, but turning alwayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same; dost thou think
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42089:70"/>
it moveth or standeth still?</p>
                  <p n="30">30. <hi>Asclep.</hi> I think it moves, <hi>Trismegistus.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="33">33. But the Circulation which is about the same, and the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the same, are both hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by Station; for that which is about the same, forbids that which is above the same, if it stand to that which is about the same.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. And so the contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion stands fast alwayes, being alwayes established by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. But I will give thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter, an earthly example, that may be seen with eyes.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Look upon any of these
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42089:70"/>
living Creatures upon Earth, as Man for example, and see him swimming; for as the Water is carried one way, the reluctation or resistance of his feet and hands is made a station to the man, that he should not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the Water, not sink underneath it.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. <hi>Asclep.</hi> Thou hast laid down a very clear example, <hi>Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="38">38. <hi>Herm.</hi> Therefore every motion is in station, and is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of station.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. The motion then of the World, and of every materiall living thing, happeneth not to be done by those things that are without the World; but by those things within it, a Soul, or Spirit, or some other unbodily thing, to those things which are without it.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. For an inanimated Body
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42089:71"/>
doth not now, much lesse a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy if it be wholly inanimate.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. <hi>Asclep.</hi> What meanest thou by this, O <hi>Trismegistus?</hi> Wood and Stones, and all other inanimate things, are they not moving Bodies?</p>
                  <p n="42">42. <hi>Herm.</hi> By no means, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> for that within the Body which moves the inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate thing, is not the Body; that moves both as well the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of that which beareth, as the Body of that which is born; for one dead or inanimate thing, cannot move another; that which moveth, must needs be alive if it move.</p>
                  <p n="43">43: Thou seest therefore how the Soul is surcharged, when it carrieth two Bodies.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. And now it is manifest, that the things that are moved, are moved in something, and by something.</p>

                  <p n="63">63. <hi>Asclep.</hi> What dost thou then say at lenghth, that God is?</p>
                  <p n="64">64. <hi>Herm.</hi> God is not a Minde, but the cause that the Minde is; not a Spirit, but the Cause that the Spirit is; not Light, but the Cause that Light is.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. Therefore we must wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God by these two Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are proper to him alone, and to no other.</p>
                  <p n="66">66. For neither of all the other, which are called Gods, nor of Men, nor <hi>Demons,</hi> or
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42089:73"/>
Angels, can any one be, though never so little, good, save on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God alone.</p>
                  <p n="67">67. And this He is, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else; but all other things are separable from the nature of Good.</p>
                  <p n="68">68. For the Body and the Soul have no place that is capable of, or can contain the Good.</p>
                  <p n="69">69. For the greatnesse of Good, is as great as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of all things, that are both bodily and unbodily, both sensible and intelligible.</p>
                  <p n="70">70. This is the Good, even God.</p>
                  <p n="71">71. See therefore that thou do not at any time, call ought else Good; for so thou shalt be impious: or any else God, but only the Good; for so thou shalt again be impious.</p>
                  <p n="72">72. In Word it is often said by all men the Good, but
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42089:74"/>
all men do not understand what it is; but through Ignorance they call both the Gods, and some men Good, that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver either be or be made so.</p>
                  <p n="73">73. Therefore all the other Gods are honored with the title and appellation of God, but God is the Good, not according to Heaven, but Nature.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. For there is one Nature of God, even the Good, and one kinde of them both, from whence all are kindes.</p>
                  <p n="75">75. For he that is good, is the giver of all things, and takes nothing; and therefore God gives all things, and receives nothing.</p>
                  <p n="76">76. The other title and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, is the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his making all things; for it is the part of a Father to make.</p>

                  <p n="78">78. As likewise, it is the greatest misfortune and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for any to be separated from men, without children; and this man is punished after death by the <hi>Demons,</hi> and the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment is this, To have the Soul of this childlesse man, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged and condemned, to a Body that neither hath the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a man, nor of a woman, which is an accursed thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun.</p>
                  <p n="79">79. Therefore, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> never congratulate any man that is childlesse; but on the contrary, pity his misfortune, knowing wha t punishment abides, and is prepared for him.</p>

                  <p n="43">43. But the operation or Act of God, is Power insuperable, to which none may compare any thing, either Humane or Divine.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. Therefore; O <hi>Hermes;</hi> think none of these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or the things above, in any wise like unto God; for if thou dost, thou errest from the Truth,</p>
                  <p n="45">45. For nothing can be like the unlike, and only, and One;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42089:78"/>
nor mayest thou think, that he hath given of his Power to any other thing.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. For who after him can make any thing, either of Life, or Immortality; of Change, or of Quality? and himself, what other thing should he make?</p>
                  <p n="47">47. For God is not idle, for then all things would be idle; for all things are full of God.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. But there is not any where in the World, such a thing as Idlenesse; for Idlenesse is a name that implieth a thing void or empty, both of a Doer and a thing done.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. But all things must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be made or done both alwayes, and according to the nature of every place.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. For he that maketh or doth, is in all things, yet not fastened or comprehended in any thing; nor making or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

one thing, but all things.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. For being an active or operating Power, and sufficient of himself for the things that are made, and the things that are made, are under him.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. Look upon, through me, the World is subject to thy sight, and understand exactly the Beauty thereof.</p>

                  <p n="55">55. For all things are full of Light, but the Fire is no where.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. For the friendship, and commixture of contraries and unlike, became Light shining from the Act or Operation of God, the Father of all Good, the

Prince of all Order, and the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Seven Worlds.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. Look also upon the Moon, the Fore-runner of them all, the Instrument of Nature, and which changeth the Matter here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. Behold the Earth, the middle of the whole, the firm and stable Foundation of the Fair World, the Feeder and Nurse of Earthly things.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. Consider moreover, how great the multitude is of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall living things, and of mortall ones also; and see the Moon going about in the midst of both, to wit, of things immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and mortall.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. But all things are full of Soul, and all things are properly moved by it; some things about the Heaven, and some things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Earth, and neither of those on the right hand to the

                  <p n="61">61. And that all these things are made, O beloved <hi>Hermes,</hi> thou needest not learn or me.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. For they are Bodies, and have a Soul, and are moved.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. And that all these should come together into one it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible without some thing, to gather them together.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. Therefore there must be some such ones, and he altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther One.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. For seeing that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are divers, and many, and the Bodies not alike, and yet one ordered swiftnesse among them all: It is impossible there should be two or moe Makers.</p>
                  <p n="66">66. For one order is not kept by many.</p>

                  <p n="68">68. And if there were one Maker of mutable and mortall living wights, he would desire also to make immortall ones; as he that were the Maker of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ones, would do to make mortall.</p>
                  <p n="69">69. Moreover also, if there were two, the Matter being one, who should be chief, or have the disposing of the facture?</p>
                  <p n="70">70. Or if both of them, which of them the greater part?</p>
                  <p n="71">71. But thinks thus that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry living Body hath its consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of Matter and Soul; and of that which is immortall, and that which is mortall, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable.</p>
                  <p n="72">72. For all living Bodies have a Soul; and those things that

are not living, are onely matter by it self.</p>
                  <p n="73">73. And the Soul likewise of it self drawing neer her Maker, is the cause of Life, and Being, and being the cause of Life, is after a manner, the cause of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal things.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. How then are mortal wights, other from immortal?</p>
                  <p n="75">75. Or how cannot he make living wights that causeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal things, and immortality?</p>
                  <p n="76">76. That there is some Body that doth these things, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and that he is also one, it is most manifest.</p>
                  <p n="77">77. For there is one Soul, one Life, and one Matter.</p>
                  <p n="78">78. Who is this? who can it be, other than the <hi>One God?</hi>
                  </p>

                     </gap>e can it benefit, to make living things, save onely God alone?</p>
                  <p n="80">80. There is therefore one God.</p>
                  <p n="81">
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:42089:81"/>
81. For it is a ridiculous thing to confesse the World to be one, one Sun, one Moon, one Divinity; and yet to have I know not how many gods.</p>
                  <p n="82">82. He therefore being One, doth all things in many things.</p>
                  <p n="83">83. And what great thing is it for God, to make Life, and Soul, and Immortality, and Change, when thy self dost so many things.</p>
                  <p n="84">84. For thou both seest, speakest, and hearest; smellest, tastest, and touchest; walkest, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandest, and breathest.</p>
                  <p n="85">85. And it is not one that seeth, and another that heareth, and another that speaketh, and another that toucheth, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that smelleth, and another that walketh, and another that understandeth, and another that breatheth; but One that doth all these things.</p>

                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:42089:82"/>
86. Yet neither can these things possibly be without God.</p>
                  <p n="87">87. For as thou, if thou shouldest cease from doing these things, wert not a living wight; so if God should cease from those, he were not (which is not lawful to say) any longer God.</p>
                  <p n="88">88. For if it be already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, that nothing can be idle or empty, how much more may be affirmed of God?</p>
                  <p n="89">89. For if there be any thing which he doth not do, then is he (if it were lawful to say so) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</p>
                  <p n="90">90. Whereas seeing he is not idle, but perfect; certainly he doth all things.</p>
                  <p n="91">91. Now give thy self unto me, O <hi>Hermes,</hi> for a little while, thou shalt the more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understand, that it is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary work of God, that all things should be made or done,

that are done, or were once done, or shall be done.</p>
                  <p n="92">92. And this, O best Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, is life.</p>

                  <p n="97">97. And yet this is not like unto him; for he is not sensible of pleasure, for neither hath he any other Fellow-workman.</p>
                  <p n="98">98. But being himself the onely Workman, he is alwayes in the Work, himself being that which he doth or maketh.</p>
                  <p n="99">99. For all things, if they were separated from him, must needs fall and die, as there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no life in them.</p>
                  <p n="100">100. And again, if all things be living wights, both which are
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42089:83"/>
in Heaven, and upon Earth; and that there be one Life in all things which is made by God, and that is God, then certainly all things are made, or done by God.</p>
                  <p n="101">101. Life is the union of the Minde, and the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="102">102. But death is not the destruction of those things that were gathered together, but a dissolving of the Union.</p>
                  <p n="103">103. The Image therefore of God, is Eternity, of Eternity the World, of the World the Sun, of the Sun Man.</p>
                  <p n="104">104. But the people say, That changing is Death, because the Body is dissolved, and the Life goeth into that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not.</p>
                  <p n="105">105. By this discourse, my dearest <hi>Hermes,</hi> I affirm as thou hearest, That the World is changed, because every day
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42089:83"/>
part thereof becomes invisible; but that it is never dissolved.</p>
                  <p n="106">106. And these are the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the World, Revolutions, and Occultations; and Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a turning, but Occultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Renovation.</p>
                  <p n="107">107. And the world being all formed, hath not the forms lying without it, but it self changeth in it self.</p>
                  <p n="108">108. Seeing then the World is all formed, what must he be that made it? for without form, he cannot be.</p>
                  <p n="109">109. And if he be all form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he will be kept like the World; but if he have but one form; he shall be in this regard lesse then the World.</p>
                  <p n="110">110. What do we then say that he is? we will not raise any doubts by our speech; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is doubtfull concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, is yet known.</p>
                  <p n="111">
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:42089:84"/>
111. He hath therefore one <hi>Idea</hi> which is proper to him, which because it is unbodily; is not subject to the sight, and yet shews all forms by the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p n="112">112. And do not wonder, if there be an incorruptible <hi>Idea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="113">113. For they are like the Margents of that Speech which is in writing; for they seem to be high and swelling, but they are by nature smooth and even.</p>
                  <p n="114">114. But understand well this that I say, more boldly, for it is more true: As a man cannot live without life, so neither can God live, not doing good.</p>
                  <p n="115">115. For this is, as it were, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>he Life and Motion of God, to move all things, and quicken them.</p>
                  <p n="116">116. But some of the things I have said, must have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42089:84"/>
explication: Understand then what I say.</p>
                  <p n="117">117. All things are in God, not as lying in a place; for Place is both a Body, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, and those things that are there placed, have no motion.</p>
                  <p n="118">118. For they lie otherwise in that which is unbodily, then in the fantasie, or to appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p n="119">119. Consider him that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines all things, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that nothing is more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious, then that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeall, nothing more swift; nothing more powerfull; but it is most capacious, most swift, and most strong.</p>
                  <p n="120">120. And judge of this by thy self, command thy Soul to go into <hi>India,</hi> and sooner then thou canst bid it, it will be there.</p>
                  <p n="121">
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:42089:85"/>
121. Bid it likewise passe over the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and suddenly it will be there: Not as passing from place to place, but sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it will be there.</p>
                  <p n="122">122. Command it to flie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, and it will need no Wings, neither shall any thing hinder it; not the fire of the Sun, not the <hi>Aether,</hi> nor the turning of the Spheres, not the bodies of any of the other Stars, but cutting through all, it will flie up to the last, and furthest Body.</p>
                  <p n="123">123. And if thou wilt even break the whole, and see those things that are without the World (if there be any thing without) thou mayest.</p>
                  <p n="124">124. Behold how great power, how great swiftnesse thou hast! Canst thou do all these things, and cannot God?</p>
                  <p n="125">

125. After this manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contemplate God to have all the whole World to himself, as it were all thoughts, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellections.</p>
                  <p n="126">126. If therefore thou wilt not equall thy self to God, thou canst not understand God.</p>
                  <p n="127">127. For the like are intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the like.</p>
                  <p n="128">128. Increase thy self unto an immeasurable greatnesse, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping beyond every Body, and transcending all Time; become Eternity, and thou shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand God: If thou believe in thyself, that nothing is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but accountest thy self im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, and that thou canst understand all things, every Art every Science, and the manner and custom of every living thing.</p>
                  <p n="129">129. Become higher then all heighth, lower then all depths, comprehend in thy self,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42089:86"/>
the qualities of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of the Fire, the Water, the Dry, and Moyst; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive likewise, that thou canst at once be every where in the Sea, in the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="130">130. Thou shalt at once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understand thy self, not yet begotten in the Womb, young, old, to be dead, the things after death, and all these together; as also, times, places, deeds, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, quantities, or else thou canst not yet understand God.</p>
                  <p n="131">131. But if thou shut up thy Soul in the Body, and abuse it, and say, I understand nothing, I can do nothing, I am affraid of the Sea, I cannot climb up into Heaven, I know not who I am, I cannot tell what I shall be; what hast thou to do with God? for thou canst understand none of those Fair and Good things; be a lover of the Body, and Evil.</p>
                  <p n="132">
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:42089:86"/>
132. For it is the greatest evil, not to know God.</p>
                  <p n="133">133. But to be able to know, and to will, and to hope, is the straight way, and divine way, proper to the Good, and it will every where meet thee, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where beseen of thee, plain and easie, when thou dost not expect or look for it: It will meet thee, waking, sleeping, sailing, travailing by night, by day, when thou speakest, and when tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p n="134">134. For there is nothing which is not the Image of God.</p>

                  <p n="136">136. For therefore hath he made all things, that thou by all things mayest see him.</p>
                  <p n="137">137. This is the Good of God, this is his Vertue, to appear,

and to be seen in all things.</p>
                  <p n="138">138. There is nothing invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, no not of those things that are incorporeal.</p>

                  <head>THE Eleventh Book OF <hi>Hermes Trismegistus.</hi> Of the Common Minde to <hi>Tat.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe minde, O <hi>Tat,</hi> is of the very essence of God, if yet there be any Essence of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What kinde of Essence that is, he alone knows himself exactly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The minde thereof is not cut off, or divided from the essentiality of God, but united as the light of the Sun.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And this Minde in men, is God, and therefore are some
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42089:88"/>
men Divine, and there Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is near Divinity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For the good <hi>Demon</hi> called the Gods, immortal men; and men, mortal Gods.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But in the bruit Beasts, or unreasonable living wights, the Minde is their Nature.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For where there is a Soul, there is the Minde; as where there is Life, there is also a Soul.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In living Creatures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that are without Reason, the Soul is Life, voyd of the operations of the Minde.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. For the Minde is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor of the Soules of men, and worketh to the proper Good.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And in unreasonable things it co-operateth with the Nature of every one of them, but in men it worketh against their Natures.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:42089:88"/>
11. For the Soul being in the Body, is straight way made Evil by Sorrow, and Grief, and Pleasure or Delight.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For Grief and Pleasure, flow like Juices from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Body, whereinto, when the Soul entereth, or descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, she is moystened and tincted with them.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. As many Souls therefore, as the minde governeth or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleth, to them it shews its own Light, resisting their prepossefsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or presumptions.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. As a good Physitian grieveth the Body, prepossefsed of a disease, by burning or laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it for healths sake.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. After the same manner also, the Minde grieveth the Soule by drawing it out of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, from whence every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease of the Soul proceedeth.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But the great Disease of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42089:89"/>
the Soul is <hi>Atheism,</hi> because that opinion followeth to all Evil, and no Good.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Therefore the Minde resisting, it procureth Good to the Soul, as a Physitian health to the Body.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. But as many Souls of men, as do not admit or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the Minde for their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, do suffer the same thing that the Soul of unreasonable living things.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. For the Soul being a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operator</hi> with them, permits or leaves them to their concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scences, whereunto they are carried by the torrent of their Appetite, and so tend to bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishnesse.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And as bruit Beasts, they are angry without reason, and they desire without reason, and never cease, nor are satisfied with evil.</p>
                  <p n="21">
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:42089:89"/>
21. For unreasonable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Desires, are the most exceeding Evils.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And therefore hath God set the Mind over these, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger and Reprover of them.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. <hi>Tat.</hi> Here, O Father, that Discourse of Fate and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny, which thou madest to me, is in danger to be overthrown: For if it be fatal for any man to commit <hi>Adultery</hi> or <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> or do any evil, he is puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed also, though he of necessity do the work of Fate or Destiny?</p>
                  <p n="24">24. <hi>Herm.</hi> All things, O Son, are the work of Fate, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, can no bodily thing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Good or Evil be done.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. For it is decreed by Fate, that he that doth any evil, should also suffer for it.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. And therefore he doth it, that he may suffer that which he suffereth, because he did it.</p>
                  <p n="27">
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:42089:90"/>
27. But for the present let alone that speech, concerning Evil and Fate, for at other times we have spoken of it.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Now our discourse is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Minde, and what it can do, and how it differs, and is in men such a one, but in bruit Beasts changed.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. And again, in bruit Beasts it is not beneficiall, but in men by quenching both their Anger and Concupiscences.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. And of men thou must understand, some to be rationall or governed by reason, and some irrationall.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. But all men are subject to Fate, and to Generation, and Change; for these are the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end of Fate or Destiny.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. And all men suffer those things that are decreed by Fate.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. But rationall men, over whom, as we said, the Minde
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42089:90"/>
bears rule, do not suffer like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other men; but being free from viciousnesse, and being not evil, they do suffer evil.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>.</hi> How sayest thou this again, Father? An <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> is he not evil? A <hi>Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> is he not evil? and so all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. <hi>Herm.</hi> But the rationall man, O Son, will not suffer for Adultery, but as the Adulterer; not for Murther, but as the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. And it is impossible to escape the Quality of Change, as of Generation; but the Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, he that hath the Mind, may escape.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. And therefore, O Son, I have alwayes heard the good <hi>Demon</hi> say, and if he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it in writing, he had much profited all mankinde: For he alone, O Son, as the first born,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42089:91"/>
God, seeing all things, truly spake Divine words. I have heard him say sometimes, <hi>That all things are one thing, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intelligible Bodies or that all especially intelligible Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="38">38. We live in Power, in Act, and in Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. Therefore a good Minde, is that which the Soul of him is.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. And if this be so, then no intelligible thing differs from intelligible things.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. As therefore it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Minde, the Prince of all things; so likewise that the Soul that is of God, can do whatsoever it will.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. But understand thou well, for this Discourse I have made to the Question which thou askest of me before, I mean concerning Fate and the Mind.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. First, if, O Son, thou shalt diligently withdraw thy self
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42089:91"/>
from all contentious speeches, thou shalt finde that in Truth, the Mind, the Soul of God bears rule over all things, both over Fate, and Law, and all other things.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. And nothing is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, no not of the things that are of Fate.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. Therefore, though the Soul of man be above it, let it not neglect the things that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be under Fate.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. And these thus far, were the excellent sayings of the good <hi>Demon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="47">47. <hi>Tat.</hi> Most divinely spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, O Father, and truly and profitably, yet clear this one thing unto me.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. Thou sayest, that in bruit Beasts the Mind worketh or act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the manner of Nature, co-operating also with their (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>impetus)</hi> inclinations.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. Now the impetuous in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42089:92"/>
clinations of bruit Beasts, as I conceive, are Passions. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Minde do co-operate with these impetuous Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; that they are the Passions in bruit Beasts, certainly the Mind is also a Passion, conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self to Passions.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. <hi>Herm.</hi> Well done, Son, thou askest nobly, and yet it is just that I should answer thee.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. All incorporeall things, O Son, that are in the Body, are passible, nay, they are properly Passions.</p>

Every thing that moveth is incorporeal; every thing that is moved is a Body; and it is moved into the Bodies by the Minde: Now Motion is Passion, and there they both suffer; as well that which moveth, as that which is moved, as well that which ruleth, as that which is ruled.</p>

                  <p n="55">55. But Passion differs from that which is passible; for that (Passion) acteth, but this suffers.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. Beodies also of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do act; for either they are unmoveable, or else are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and which soever it be, it is a Passion.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. But incorporeall things do alwayes act, or work, and therefore they are passible.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. Let not therefore the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of names trouble thee, for Action and Passion are the same thing, but that it is not grievous to use the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable name.</p>

                  <p n="73">73. For of those things that are intelligible every one is, but the Essence of them is Identity.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. But of the Bodies of the whole, or universe, every one is many things.</p>

                  <p n="29">29. For the things that are, being two Bodies, and things incorporeall, wherein is the Mortal and the Divine, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Choice of either is left to him that will chuse: For no man can chuse both.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. And of which soever the choice is made, the other being diminished or overcome, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the act and operation of the other.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. The choice of the better therefore, is not onely best for him that chuseth it, by deifying a man; but it also sheweth Piety and Religion towards God.</p>

                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:42089:102"/>
32. But the choice of the worse destroyes a man, but doth nothing against God; save that as <hi>Pomps</hi> or <hi>Pageants,</hi> when they come abroad, cannot do any thing themselves, but hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; after the same manner also do these make <hi>Pomps</hi> or <hi>Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants</hi> in the World, being sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the pleasures of the Body.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. These things being so, O <hi>Tat,</hi> that things have been, and are so plenteously ministered to us from God; let them proceed also from us, without any scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or sparing.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. For God is innocent or guiltlesse, but we are the causes of Evil, preferring them before the Good.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Thou seest, O Son, how many Bodies we must go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, and how many Quiers of <hi>Demons,</hi> and what continuity and courses of Stars, that we

                  <p n="36">36. For the Good is not to be transcended, it is unbounded and infinite; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p n="37">37. For our knowledge is not the beginning of it, but shews us the beginning of its being known unto us.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. Let us therefore lay hold of the beginning, and we shall quickly go thorow all things.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. It is indeed a difficult thing, to leave those things that are accustomable, and present, and turn us to those things that are ancient, and according to the Originall.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. For these things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, delight us, but make the things that appear not, hard to beleeve, <hi>or the things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:42089:103"/>

                  <p n="41">41. The things most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent are Evil, but the Good is secret, or hid in, or to the things that appear; for it hath neither Form nor Figure.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. For this cause it is like to it self, but unlike every thing else; for it is impossible, that any thing incorporeall, should be made known, or appear to a Body.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. For this is the difference between the like and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; and the unlike wanteth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes somewhat of the like.</p>

                  <p n="45">45. Nothing is without a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but the Beginning is of nothing, but of it self; for it is the Beginning of all other things.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. Therefore it is, seeing it

                  <head>THE Thirteenth Book OF <hi>Hermes Trismegistus.</hi> Of Sense and Understanding.</head>
                  <p>YEsterday, <hi>Asclepius,</hi> I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a perfect Discourse; but now I think it necessary, in suit of that, to dispute also of Sense.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Sense and Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding seem to differ, because the one is materiall, the other essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But unto me, they appear to be both one, or united, and not divided; in men, I mean.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For in other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Sense is united unto Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in men to Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

5. But the Mind differs from Understanding, as much as God from Divinity.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. For Divinity is (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) from or under God, and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>g from the Minde, being the sister of the Word or Speech, and they the Instruments one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For neither is the Word pronounced without Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, neither is Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifested without the Word.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Therefore Sense and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding do both flow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into a man, as if they were infolded one within another.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. For neither is it possible without Sense to understand, nor can we have Sense without Understanding.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And yet it is possible <hi>(for the time being)</hi> that the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding may understand
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42089:106"/>
without Sense, as they that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie Visions in their Dreams.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But it seems unto me, that both the operations are in the Visions of Dreams, and that the Sense is stirred up out of sleep, unto awaking.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For Man is divided into a Body and a Soul; when both parts of the Sense accord one with another, then is the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding childed, or brought forth by the Minde pronounced.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. For the Minde brings forth all Intellections or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings: Good ones, when it receiveth good Seed from God; and the contrary, when it receives them from Devi's.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. For there is no part of the World void of the Devil, which entering in privately, sowed the seed of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per operation; and the Minde did make pregnant, or did bring
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42089:106"/>
forth that which was sown, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries Murthers Stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ing of Parents, Sacriledges, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, Stranglings,</hi> throwing down headlong, and all other things which are the works of evil <hi>Demons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. And the Seeds of God are few, but Great, and Fair, and Good; Vertue, and Temperance, and Piety.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And the Piety is the Knowledge of God, whom who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever knoweth being full of all good things, hath Divine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and not like the Many.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And therefore they that have that Knowledge, neither please the multitude, nor the multitude them, but they seem to be mad, and to move laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hated and despised, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times also murthered.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. For we have already said,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42089:107"/>
That wickednesse must dwell here, being in her own region.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. For her region is the Earth, and not the World, as some will sometimes say, Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheming.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. But the godly, or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worshiping Man, laying hold on Knowledge, will despise or tread under all these things; for though they be evil to other men, yet to him all things are good.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. And upon mature consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, he refers all things to Knowledge, and that which is most to be wondered at, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone makes evil things good.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. But I return again to my Discourse of Sense.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. It is therefore a thing proper to Man, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and conjoyn Sense and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. But every man, as I said
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42089:107"/>
before, doth not enjoy Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; for one man is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, another essentiall.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And he that is material with wickednesse, as I said re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Devils the seed of Understanding; but they that are with the Good essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, are saved with God.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. For God is the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of all things; and when he worketh, he useth Nature.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. He maketh all things good like himself.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. But these things that are made good, are in the use of Operation unlawfull.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. For the Motion of the World stirring up Generations, makes Qualities; infecting some with evilnesse, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying some with good.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. And the World, <hi>Ascle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> hath a peculiar Sense and Understanding, not like to Mans,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42089:108"/>
nor so various or manifold, but a better and more simple.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. For the Sense and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the World is One, in that it makes all things, and unmakes them again into it self; for it is the Organ or Instrument of the Will of God.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. And it is so organized or framed, and made for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument by God; that receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Seeds into it self from God, and keeping them in it self, it maketh all things effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and dissolving them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth all things.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. And therefore like a good Husband-man of Life, when things are dissolved or loosened, he affords by the casting of Seed, renovation to all things that grow.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. There is nothing that it (the World) doth not beget or bring forth alive; and by its
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42089:108"/>
Motion, it makes all things alive.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. And it is at once, both the Place and the Workman of Life.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. But the Bodies are from the Matter, in a different manner; for some are of the Earth, some of Water, some of Air, some of Fire, and all are compounded, but some are more compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and some are more sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. They that are compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are the heavier and they that are lesse, are the higher.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. And the swiftnesse of the Motion of the World, makes the vatieties of the Qualities of Generation; for the spiration or influence, being most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, extendeth unto the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies qualities with one fulnesse, which is of Life.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. Therefore, God is the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42089:109"/>
Father of the World, but the World is the Father of things in the World.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. And the World is the Son of God, but things in the World are the Sons of the World.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. And therefore it is well called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the World, that is an Ornament, because it adorneth and beautifieth all things with the variety of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and indeficiency of Life, with the unweariednesse of Operation, and the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Necessity, with the mingling of Elements, and the order of things done.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. Therefore it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and properly called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the World.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. For of all living things, both the Sense, and the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, cometh into them from without, inspired by that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42089:109"/>
which compasseth them about, and continueth them.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. And the World receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it once from God assoon as it was made, hath it still, <hi>what ever it once had.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="45">45. But God is not as it seems to some who Blaspheme through superstition, without Sense, and without Minde, or Understanding.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. For all things that are, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> are in God, and made by him, and depend of him; some, working by Bodies, some moving by a Soul-like Essence, some quickning by a Spirit, and some receiving the things that are weary, and all very fitly.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. Or rather, I say, that he hath them not, but I declare the Truth; <hi>he is all things,</hi> not receiving them from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but exhibiting them out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
                  <p n="48">
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:42089:110"/>
48. And this is the Sense and Understanding of God, to move all things always.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. And there shall never be any time, when any of those things that are, shall fail or be wanting.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. When I say the things that are, I mean God; for the things that are, God hath; and neither is there any thing without him, nor he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. These things, O <hi>Ascle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus,</hi> will appear to be true, if thou understand them; but if thou understand them not, incredible.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. For to understand, is to beleeve; but not to beleeve, is not to understand: For my speech or words reach not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Truth, but the Minde is great, and being led or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted for a while by speech, is
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42089:110"/>
able to attain to the Truth.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. And understanding all things round about, and finding them consonant, and agreeable to those things that were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and interrupted by Speech, beleeveth; and in that good belief, resteth.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. To them therefore that understand the things that have been said of God, they are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; but to them that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them not, incredible.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. But these things being Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural unto them, are wrought by Nature, whereas Art and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence do not happen unto all, but unto some.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As men are Musitians, but
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42089:112"/>
not all; neither are all Archers, or Huntsmen, or the rest, but some of them have learned some things by the working of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Art.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. After the same manner also, if some <hi>Pismires</hi> did so, and some not, thou mightest well say, they gather their Food according to Science and Art.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But being they are all led by Nature, to the same thing, even against their wills, it is manifest they do not do it by Science or Art.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. For Operations, O <hi>Tat,</hi> being unbodily, are in Bodies, and work by Bodies.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Wherefore, O <hi>Tat,</hi> in as much as they are unbodily, thou must needs say they are immortal.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But as much as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act without Bodies, I say, they are always in a Body.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:42089:112"/>
12. For those things that are to any thing, or for the cause of any thing made subject to Providence or Necessity, cannot possibly remain idle of their own proper Operation.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. For that which is, shall ever be; for both the Body, and the Life of it, is the same.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And by this reason, it follows, that the Bodies also are always; because I affirm, That this corporiety is always by the Act and Operation, or for them.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. For although earthly bodies be subject to dissolution; yet these bodies must be the Places, and the Organs, and Instruments of Acts or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But Acts or Operations are immortall, and that which is immortall, is alwayes in Act, and therefore also <hi>Corpori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:42089:113"/>
17. Acts or Operations do follow the Soul, yet come not suddenly or promiscuously, but some of them come together with being made man, being about bruitish or unreasonable things.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. But the purer Operations do insensibly. in the change of time, work with the oblique part of the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. And these Operations depend upon Bodies; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they that are <hi>Corporifying,</hi> come from the Divine Bodies into Mortall ones.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. But every one of them acteth both about the Body and the Soul, and are present with the Soul, even without the Body.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. And they are alwayes Acts or Operations, but the Soul is not always in a Mortall Body, for it can be without a Body, but Acts or Operations
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42089:113"/>
cannot be without Bodies.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. This is a sacred speech, Son, <hi>The Body cannot consist without a Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. <hi>Tat.</hi> How meanest thou that, Father?</p>
                  <p n="24">24. <hi>Herm.</hi> Understand it thus, O <hi>Tat;</hi> When the Soul is separated from the Body, there remaineth that same Body.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And this same Body ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time of its abode, is actuated or operated in that it is dissolved, and becomes invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. And these things the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cannot suffer without act or operation, and consequently there remaineth with the Body the same act or operation.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. This then is the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between an Immortall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and a Mortall one, that the immortall one consists of one Matter, and so doth not the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42089:114"/>
mortall one; and the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall one Doth, but this Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. And every thing that acteth or operateth, is stronger, and ruleth, but that which is actuated or operated, is ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. And that which ruleth, directeth, and governeth as free, but the other is ruled as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Acts or Operations do not only actuate or operate, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or breathing, or insouled (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="31">31. Act or Operation, O Son,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42089:114"/>
is called, whatsoever is, or is made or done; and there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes many things made, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all things.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. For the World is never widowed or forsaken of any of those things that are; but being alway carried or moved in it self, it is in labour to bring forth the things that are, which shall never be left by it to corruption.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Let therefore every act or operation be understood to be alwayes immortal, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Body soever it be.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. But some Acts or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be of Divine, some of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Bodies, some univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, some peculiar, and some of the generals, and some of the parts of every thing.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Divine Acts or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therefore there be, and such as work or operate upon their proper Bodies, and these
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42089:115"/>
also are perfect, and being upon or in perfect Bodies.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Particular, are they which work by any of the living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. Proper, be they that work upon any of the things that are.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. By this Discourse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O Son, it is gathered that all things are full of Acts or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. For if necessarily they be in every Body, and that there be many Bodies in the World, I may very well affirm, that there be many other Acts or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. For many times in one Body, there is one, and a second, and a third, besides these univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall ones that follow.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. And universall Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I call them that are indeed bodily, and are done by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Motions.</p>
                  <p n="42">
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:42089:115"/>
42. For without these it is impossible that the Body should consist.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. But other Operations are proper to the Souls of Men, by Arts, Sciences, Studies, and Actions.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. The Senses also follow these Operations, or rather are the effects or perfections (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) of them.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. Understand therefore, O Son, the difference of Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is sent from above.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. But Sense being in the Body, and having its essence from it, when it receiveth Act or Operation, manifesteth it, making it as it were corporeall.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. Therefore, I say, that the Senses are both corporeall and mortall, having so much exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence as the Body; for they are born with the Body, and die with it.</p>
                  <p n="48">
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:42089:116"/>
48. But mortal things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have not Sense, as not consisting of such an Essence.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. For Sense can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a corporeal apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, either of evil or good that comes to the Body.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. But to Eternall Bodies there is nothing comes, nothing departs; therefore there is no Sense in them.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. <hi>Tat.</hi> Doth the Sense therefore perceive or apprehend in every Body?</p>
                  <p n="52">52. <hi>Herm.</hi> In every Body, O Son.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. <hi>Tat.</hi> And do the Acts or Operations work in al things?</p>
                  <p n="54">54. <hi>Herm.</hi> Even in things inanimate, O Son, but there are differences of Senses.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. For the Senses of things rationall, are with Reason; of things unreasonable, Corporeal onely; but the Senses of things
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42089:116"/>
inanimate, are passive onely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Augmentation and Diminution.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. But Passion and Sense de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend both upon one head, or heighth, and are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the same by Acts or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. But in living wights there be two other Operations that follow the Senses and Passions, to wit, <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Pleasure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="58">58. And without these, it is impossible that a living wight, especially a reasonable one should perceive or apprehend.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. And therefore, I say, that these are the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Passions that bear rule, especially in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable living wights.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. The Operations work indeed, but the Senses do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and manifest the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they being bodily, are moved by the brutish parts of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42089:117"/>
the Soul; therefore, I say, they are both maleficiall, or doers of evil.</p>
                  <p n="61">61. For that which affords the Sense to rejoyce with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, is straightway the cause of many evils happening to him that suffers it.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. But Sorrow gives stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Torments and Anguish, therefore doubtlesse are they both maleficiall.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. The same may be said of the Sense of the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. <hi>Tat.</hi> Is not the Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal, and the Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Father? or is it rather in the Body?</p>
                  <p n="65">65. <hi>Herm.</hi> If we put it in a Body, O Son, we shall make it like the Soul or the Operations. For these being unbodily, we say are in Bodies.</p>
                  <p n="66">66. But Sense is neither O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, nor Soul, nor any thing
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42089:117"/>
else that belongs to the Body; but as we have said, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not incorporeall.</p>
                  <p n="67">67. And if it be not incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall, it must needs be a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for we alwayes say, that of things that are, some are Bodies, and some incorporeall.</p>

                  <head>THE Fifteenth Book OF <hi>Hermes Trismegistus.</hi> Of Truth to his Son <hi>Tat.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herm.</hi> Of Truth, O <hi>Tat</hi> it is not possible that man being an imperfect wight, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of imperfect Members; and having his Tabernacle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of different and many Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, should speak with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But as far as it is possible, and just, I say, That Truth is onely in the Eternall Bodies, whose very Bodies be also true.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Fire is fire it self on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and nothing else; the Earth is earth it self, and nothing else;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42089:118"/>
the Air is air it self, and nothing else; the Water, water it self, and nothing else.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But our Bodies consist of all these; for they have of the Fire, they have of the Earth, they have of the Water, and Air, and yet there is neither Fire, nor Earth, nor Water, nor Air, nor any thing true.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And if at the beginning, our Constitution had not Truth, how could men either see the Truth, or speak it, or understand it onely, except God would?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. All things therefore upon Earth, O <hi>Tat,</hi> are not Truth, but imitations of the Truth; and yet not all things neither, for they are but few that are so.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But the other things are Falshood, &amp; Deceit, O <hi>Tat</hi> and Opinions like the Images of the fantasie, or appearance.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And when the fantasie
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42089:119"/>
hath an influence from above, then it is an imitation of Truth; but without that operation from above, it is left a lie.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And as an Image shews the Body described, and yet is not the Body of that which is seen, as it seems to be; and it is seen to have eyes, but it sees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ears, but hears no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all; and all other things hath the picture, but they are false, deceiving the eyes of the beholder, whilest they think they see the Truth, and yet they are indeed but lies.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. As many therefore as see not Falshood, see the Truth.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. If therefore we do so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, and see every one of these things as it is then we see and understand true things.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But if we see or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any thing besides, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, than that which is, we
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42089:119"/>
shall neither understand, nor know the Truth.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>Tat.</hi> Is Truth therefore upon Earth, O Father?</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>Herm.</hi> Thou dost not misse the mark, O Son. Truth indeed is no where at all upon Earth, O <hi>Tat,</hi> for it cannot be generated, or made.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But concerning the Truth, it may be that some men, to whom God will give the good seeing Power, may understand it.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. So that unto the Minde and Reason, there is nothing true indeed upon Earth.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. But unto the true Minde and Reason, all things are fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies or appearances, and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. <hi>Tat.</hi> Must we not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call it Truth, to understand and speak the things that are?</p>

                  <p n="20">20. <hi>Tat.</hi> How then is this true, That we do not know any thing true? how can that be done here?</p>
                  <p n="21">21. <hi>Herm.</hi> O Son, Truth is the most perfect Vertue, and the highest Good it self, not troubled by Matter, not encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed by a Body, naked, clear, unchangeable, venerable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Good.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. But the things that are here, O Son, are visible, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Good, corruptible, passible, dissolveable, change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, continually altered, and made of another.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. The things therefore that are not true to themselves; how can they be true?</p>
                  <p n="24">24. For every thing that is altered, is a lie, not abiding in what it is; but being changed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42089:120"/>
it shews us always, other, and other appearances.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. <hi>Tat.</hi> Is not man true, O Father?</p>
                  <p n="26">26. <hi>Herm.</hi> As far forth as he is a Man, he is not true, Son; for that which is true hath of it self alone its constitution, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and abides according to it self, such as it is.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. But man consists of many things, and doth not abide of himself; but is turned and changed, age after age, <hi>Idea</hi> after <hi>Idea,</hi> or form after form; and this while he is yet in the Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. And many have not known their own children after a little while; and many children likewise have not known their own Parents.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Is it then possible, O <hi>Tat,</hi> that he who is so changed, is not to be known, should be
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42089:121"/>
true? no, on the contrary, he is Falshood, being in many Appearances of changes.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. But do thou understand the True to be that which abides the same, and is Eternal, but man is not ever, therefore not True; but man is a certain Appearance, and Appearance is the highest Lie or Falshood.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. <hi>Tat.</hi> But these eternall Bodies, Father, are they not true through they be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>

                  <p n="42">42. For those things that are generated, must of necessity be generated of those things that are corrupted, and the things generated must needs be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that the Generation of things being, may not stand still or cease.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. Acknowledge therefore the first Workman by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of things.</p>

one thing, sometimes another: For it is impossible, they should be made the same things again; and that which is not the same, how is it true?</p>

                     <hi>HErm.</hi> We must now speak of the Soul and Body, O Son; after what manner the Soul is Immortall; and what operation that is, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes the Body, and dissolves it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But in one of these is Death, for it is a conception of a name, which is either an empty word, or else it is wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Death, (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>)</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For Death is destruction, but there is nothing in the whole World that is destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For if the World be a second God, and an Immortall living Wight, it is impossible that any part of an Immortall living Wight should die.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But all things that are in the World, are members of the World; especially Man, the reasonable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>iving Wight.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. For the first of all is God, the Eternall, and Unmade, and the Workman of all things.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The second is the World, made by him, after his own Image, and by him holden to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and nourished, and immortalized; and as from its own Father, ever living.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. So that as Immortall, it
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42089:124"/>
is ever living, and ever immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. For that which is ever living, differs from that which is eternall.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For the Eternall was not begotten or made, by another; and if it were begotten or made, yet it was made by it self, not by any other, but it is always made.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. For the Eternall, as it is Eternall, is the Universe.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For the Father himself, is Eternall of himself; but the world was made by the Father, ever living, and immortal.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And as much Matter as there was laid up by him, the Father made it all into a Body, and swelling it, made it round like a Sphere; endued it with Quality, being it self immortal, and having Eternal Materiality.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The Father being full
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42089:125"/>
of <hi>Ideas,</hi> sowed Qualities in the Sphere, and shut them up, as in a Circle, deliberating to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie with every Quali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>y, that which should afterwards be made.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Then cloathing the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Body with Immortality, lest the Matter, if it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from this Composition, should be dissolved into its own disorder.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. For when the matter was incorporeal, O Son, it was disordered, and it hath here the same confusion daily revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved about other little things, endued with Qualities, in point of Augmentation, and Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, which men call Death; being indeed a disorder hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening about earthly living wights.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. For the Bodies of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, have one order,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42089:125"/>
which they have received from the Father at the Beginning, and is by the instauration of each of them, kept indissolve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. But the instauration of earthly Bodies, is their consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence; and their dissolution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores them into indissoluble, that is, Immortall.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. And so there is made a privation of Sense, but not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Bodies.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Now the third living wight is Man, made after the Image of the World; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the Will of the Father, a Minde above other earthly wights.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. And he hath not onely a sympathy with the second God, but also an understanding of the first.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. For the second God, he apprehends as a Body; but the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42089:126"/>
first, he understands as Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, and the Mind of the Good.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. <hi>Tat.</hi> And doth not this living wight perish?</p>
                  <p n="24">24. <hi>Herm.</hi> Speak advisedly, O Son, and learn what God is, what the World, what an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Wight, and what a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveable One is.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And understand that the World is of God, and in God; but Man of the World, and in the World.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. The Beginning, and End, and Consistence of all, is God.</p>

                  <p>BEcause my Son <hi>Tat,</hi> in thy absence, would needs learn the Nature of the things that are: He would not suffer me to give over (as coming very young to the knowledge of every Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall) till I was forced to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to him many things at large, that his contemplation might from point to point, be more easie and successefull.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But to thee, I have thought good to write in few words, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing out the principall heads of the things then spoken, and to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42089:127"/>
interpret them more mystically, because thou hast, both more yeers, and more knowledge of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All things that appear, were made, and are made.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Those things that are made, are not made by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but by another.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And there are many things made, but especially all things that appear, and which are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and not like.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If the things that be made and done, be made and done by another, there must be one that must make, and do them; and he unmade, and more ancient than the things that are made.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For I affirm the things that are made, to be made by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and it is impossible, that of the things that are made, any should be more ancient than all, but only that which is not made</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:42089:127"/>
8. He is stronger, and One, and only knowing all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as not having any thing more ancient than himself.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. For he bears rule, both over multitude and greatnesse, and the diversity of the things that are made, and the continui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Facture, and of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Moreover, the things that are made, are visible, but he is invisible; and for this cause, he maketh them, that he may be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; and therefore he makes them alwayes.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Thus it is fit to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and understanding to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and admiring to think thy self happy, that knowest thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Father.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For what is sweeter than a naturall Father?</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Who therefore is this, or how shall we know him?</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:42089:128"/>
14. Or is it just to ascribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him alone, the Title and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of God, or of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, or of the Father, or all Three? That of God, because of his Power; the Maker, because of his Working and Operation; and the Father, because of his Goodnessé?</p>
                  <p n="15">15. For Power is different from the things that are made; but Act or Operation, in that all things are made.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Wherefore, letting go all much and vain talking, we must understand these two things, <hi>That which is made, and him which is the Maker;</hi> for there is nothing in the middle between these Two, nor is there any third.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Therefore understanding All things, remember these Two; and think that these are All things, putting nothing into
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42089:128"/>
doubt; neither of the things above, nor of the things below; neither of the things changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor things that are in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or secret.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. For All things, are but Two things, <hi>That which mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and that which is made;</hi> and the One of them cannot depart, or be devided from the other.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. For neither is it possible, that the Maker should be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the thing made, for either of them is the self same thing; therefore cannot the One of them be separated from the other, no more then a thing can be separated from it self.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. For if he that makes be nothing else, but that which makes alone, <hi>simple uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnded,</hi> it is of necessity, that he makes the same thing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to whom it is the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42089:129"/>
of him that maketh to be also All that is made.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. For that which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated or made, must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be generated or made by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but without the Maker that which is made, neither is made, not is; for the one of them without the other, hath lost his proper Nature by the privation of the other.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. So if these Two be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, That which maketh, and that which is made, then they are One in Union; this going before, and that following.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And that which goeth before, is, God the Maker; and that which follows, is, that which is made, be it what it will.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And let no man be afraid, because of the variety of things that are made or done, lest he should cast an aspersion
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42089:129"/>
of basenesse, or infamy upon God; for it is the only Glory of him to do, or make All things.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And this making, or facture, is as it were the Body of God, and to him that mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or doth, there is nothing evil, or filthy to be imputed, <hi>or there is nothing thought evil, or filthy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. For these are Passions that follow Generation, as Rust doth Copper, or as Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do the Body.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. But neither did the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persmith make the Rust, nor the Maker the Filth, nor God the Evilnesse.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. But the vicissitude of Generation doth make them, as it were to blossom out; and for this cause did make Change to be, as one should say, The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42089:130"/>
of Generation.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Moreover, is it Lawfull for the same Painter to make both Heaven, and the Gods, and the Earth, and the Sea, and Men, and bruit Beasts, and inanimate Things, and Trees; and is it impossible for God to make these things? O the great madnesse, and ignorance of men in things that concern God!</p>
                  <p n="30">30. For men that think so, suffer that which is most ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of all; for professing to blesse, and praise God, yet in not ascribing to him the making or doing of All things, they know him not.</p>
                  <p n="31">31, And, besides their not knowing him, they are extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impious against him, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto him Passions, as Pride, or <hi>Oversight,</hi> or Weaknesse, or Ignorance, or Envy.</p>
                  <p n="32">
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:42089:130"/>
32. For if he do not make, or do all things, he is either proud, or not able, or ignorant, or envious, which is impious to affirm.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. For God hath only one Passion, namely, Good; and he that is good, is neither proud, nor impotent, nor the rest; but God is Good it self.</p>

                  <p n="35">35. See then how he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, and how the things are done, that are done; and if thou wilt learn, thou mayest see an Image thereof ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beautifull, and like.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Look upon the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, how he casteth Seeds into the Earth; here Wheat, there

Barly, and elsewhere some other Seeds.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. Look upon the same Man, planting a Vine, or an Apple-Tree, or a Fig-Tree, or some other Tree.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. So doth God in Heaven sow Immortality, in the Earth Change in the whole Life, and Motion.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. And these things are not many, but few, and easily num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred; for they are all but four, God and Generation, in which are all things.</p>

                  <p>THou, <hi>Asclepius,</hi> serves in stead of a Sun un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; for God hath brought thee to us, that thou mightest be present with us in thy divine Discourse, being such which may seem worthy to carry a greater lustre of Piety and Religion, than all the works before done of us, or any gifts inspired by divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration; which if understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly thou shalt regard, thou shalt be richly filled with all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42089:134"/>
good things thorowout thy whole Soul: If notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there be many good things, and not one generall, in which all things are, for the one is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to consent and agree with the other; all these things belong to that One, and that One is All; for the one so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to the other, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be separated. But in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Discourse, by a diligent hearkening, thou shalt fully know it. But thou, O <hi>Ascle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> proceed a little, and call forth him which should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; who entering, <hi>Asclepius</hi> also suggesteth <hi>Amnon</hi> to be present. <hi>Trismegistus</hi> saith, No Envie hindereth <hi>Amnon</hi> from us; for to his name we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber many things to be written of us, as also to his loving and dear Son, many things of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Philosophy, and of many
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42089:134"/>
Out landish and strange things: but this Tractate I will ascribe to your name, neither call any other save <hi>Amnon,</hi> lest a most devout Discourse of so weighty a matter should be violated by the intervention and presence of many comers; for it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of no honest and religious heart, to publish a Tractate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenisht with the fulnesse of the divine Majesty, to the view of every mans conscience. Holy <hi>Amnon</hi> being now entered into a private closet, fitted with the Religion of four men, and the Divine Presence of God, in much reverence and secrecie he begins thus to declare himself in the name of all the <hi>Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> to the consciences and souls of them who are prepared to hear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trism.</hi> O <hi>Asclepius</hi> the soul of every man is immortall, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42089:135"/>
not all alike; for there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence both in the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Asclep.</hi> No indeed, O <hi>Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus,</hi> for every Soul is of one quality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trism.</hi> O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> how quickly hast thou learned, by the very light of reason; for said I not this, That all things are one, and one all things? that all things were in the Creatour, before he created all things; neither unworthily is he said to be All, whose parts are all things: therefore in this whole Discourse have a care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him, who being One, is All, even the very Creatour of all things; all things descend from Heaven into the Earth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Water, and into the Air. The Fire onely, in that it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried upward, is lively subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to that which descends; for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42089:135"/>
whatsoever descends from above is generating, and whatsoever ascends upward is nourishing; the earth alone abiding in it self, is the receiver of all things, and the restorer of all things she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth. In this therfore wholly (as you said) even al things, both the Soul and the World, are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally moved and concluded. So the various equality of every shape being differenced, that the <hi>Species</hi> of the qualities, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, may be known to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, yet so united to this, that the whole may seem one, and from that one, all to have their being; wherefore the whole World are the four Elements of which it is compounded, Fire, Water, Earth, Air; one World, one Soul, one God. Now be thou present with me, as much as thou art able, both in minde, and wisdom: for the reason of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42089:136"/>
the Divinity which is to be known by the divine intention of the understanding, is most like unto a Torrent running with a violent and swift stream from a high Rock, whereby it glides away from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of such, who are either Hearers or Dealers in it.</p>

                        <hi>This first Chapter teacheth, that all things belong to one, and that all things are one, of one, as from which all things are, One; as all the effects which in their cause are one, as that every mans Soul is immortall: but yet after a different sort.

And as all bodies make one body of one world, so it will have all the forms of things to make one uniform form of one world, which it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Form of the world; and these are one Body, one Soul, one World, one God; from whom Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Understanding and the Word passeth from above, with a swife lightening downwards, like unto a swift Torrent, which flows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and fils all things, and this Divine VVisdom and the VVord, what is it (I pray) but the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or Divine VVisdom it self, which is the Creatour of all things, which as the wise man sings, is the onely Mover of all things, and which being one can</hi>

But God who is the Creator of all things is the Governour of Heaven, and of its Soul, and of all things in the world. For from all the foresaid things, of all which there is a Governour, there is a frequent influence carried through the world by nature it self, and by the soul of every Genus and Species in it: for the world is prepared of God to be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42089:137"/>
a receptacle of every sort of Species or form; and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning out nature by the forms, hath brought the world by the four Elements even to Heaven. All the works of God which are pleasing to the eye, and which hang over us are divided into Species, and in that manner I am now about to relate. The <hi>Genera,</hi> or kinds, of all things follow their <hi>Species</hi> for that the <hi>Genus</hi> is the totality, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it, &amp; the <hi>Species</hi> a part of the <hi>Genus:</hi> wherefore there is a <hi>Genus</hi> of good Spirits, and a <hi>Genus</hi> of bad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42089:138"/>
mournes away at injuries. I say of all things which live on the Earth by the preservation of Roots, and Plants, whose <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> are dispersed throughout the whole Earth, the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it self is full of the Majesty of God, whose <hi>Genus</hi> inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that place where all <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> are immortall; for the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> is a part of the <hi>Genus,</hi> as the Soul a part of man being a point of necessity to follow the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it <hi>Genus</hi> from whence it proceeds, that albeit every <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> or kind be immortall, yet every <hi>Species</hi> is not immortall; but the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> of the godhead and the <hi>Species</hi> are immortall, yet the kinds of other things whose eternity remaines in the <hi>Genus,</hi> albeit it dyes in the <hi>Species</hi> is yet preserved by the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of growing: therefore the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42089:138"/>
                     <hi>Species</hi> are mortall as man is mortall, his soul immortal; yet with every <hi>Genus</hi> the <hi>Species</hi> of every <hi>Geuus</hi> is mixed, some which before were made, some made of these; but all these which were made are either of God, of Angels, or of men; being all formes most like unto their kindes: for it is impossible for Bodies to be formed without the will of God; <hi>Species</hi> to be fashioned without the help of Spirits, or brute Beasts to be ordered or disciplined without men. Whatsoever therefore ill Spirits swarving from their kind are joyned into the form of any <hi>Species</hi> of a divine <hi>Genus,</hi> are by that Proximity and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse accounted like unto Gods, but the <hi>Species</hi> of which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, persevering in the quality of their kind, and these loving the wisdom of man are called Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42089:139"/>
there is also the like <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of men, but more large; for the <hi>Species</hi> of mankind is of many Shapes, and full of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and coming from above from the aforesaid fellowship makes a conjunction of necessity almost with all other <hi>Species,</hi> in which respect it comes nearest to God; who with Divine worship hath joyned himself unto God, even in that holinesse he requires; and they come nearest to ill Spirits, who joyne themselves to them: and those men who are contented with a mediocrity in their <hi>Genus,</hi> shall be like those <hi>Species</hi> they resemble and joyne themselves to.</p>

But that God is the Ruler &amp; Governor of all thingst which are in the world, is nothing else, but that God provideth for all things, dispenseth all things in their kinds and</hi> Species, <hi>of all which the World is the receptacle, and God imparteth to every one as to a fit instrument some gift or propriety; as the Sun and Moon are the Divine Organs for the Springing and growing of things, and for their encrease, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and disposeth of men by Angels, and of brutes by men.

They counterfeited even to love, when they brought death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men, saying, Ye shall not die, but shall be as Gods knowing good and evil: what therefore he here speaketh of Angels or Spirits, can not seeme fitly to be applyed to any divine knowledge, but to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the error of the Gentiles; but what he speaks of men are those which cleave unto God and grow</hi>

                  <p>IN this regard, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> Man is a great miracle, a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both to be reverenced and honored being after the nature &amp; Image of God, as though he were a God. This the Angels know, for as much as they were created after the same nature, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained part of the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; relied only on the Divine Nature. O therefore, the more temperate the Nature of man is, and comes nearest to God and to the divinity, the more he despis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that part of his, whereby he becomes earthly; all other things below, with whom he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42089:142"/>
must needs be, he knoweth with a Heavenly disposition, and are near unto him in way of Charity, yet his desires are in heaven: so therefore he is happily placed in the middest, that what things are here below him he loveth, and is himself beloved of those things above. He inhabiteth the earth, and by his agility is mixed with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet by the sharpnesse of his understanding he diveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the depths of the <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>;</hi> all things appear manifest to him neither do the Heavens seem to be above his reach, but as it were near by the quicknesse of his Spirit; no obscurity or darknesse of Air, can disturbe his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie, no thicknesse of ground can hinder his endeavour, nor depth of water hinder his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight; all things are the same with him, even all creatures
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42089:142"/>
whether they take root from above or below. Things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life, grow upwards from one root into woods and bush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; some are nourished with two Elements, some with one; the food is for two parts, the Life and the Body, of which the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> consisteth. The soul of the World is alwaies nourished by a continuall and restles agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Corporeall things encrease and are nourished by such things which the water and earth affordeth. The Spirit, of which all things are full, is mixt with all things, quickens and inlivens all things, adding sense unto the understanding of man, which fifth part by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inspiration is only gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to man; and which not to be seen in any other Creatures doth beautifie advance and lift up the understanding of manto the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42089:143"/>
knowledge of divine mysteries; but for that I am put in minde to speak of the understanding, I will hereafter expound the reason of it unto you; for it is most holy, excellent, and no lesse than that which belongs to the Divinity it self: but now I will dispatch what I began; for I said in the beginning, that in the nearnesse and conjunction of the Deity onely, men enjoy the favour of God: for whosoever have attained to so much feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that they perceive that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sense of Understanding, they are nearest unto the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Wisdom of God, which men onely partake of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Asclep.</hi> O <hi>Trismegistus,</hi> there is not a like understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trism.</hi> O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> All men have not attained that true Understanding, but apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42089:143"/>
some false fantasie, and that without any true reason, out of a rash opinion, are meerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, which begets wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the minde, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the best man into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and likenesse of a beast. But of the Understanding and the like, when I come to speak of the Spirit, I will give you the full reason; for man is only of two parts: the one part simple, which the Graecians call <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Trism.</hi> Thou rightly enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, <hi>Asclepius:</hi> For we also beseech God, that he will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to give the reason; for seeing all things depend on his will, then even those also which are most mysterious; the reason of which we endeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, by our present discourse: Hear therefore, O <hi>Asclepius:</hi> The Lord who is the Creatour of all things, whom we truly call God, made the world first, which might be perceived and seen: but yet I affirm it to have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42089:146"/>
no sense. For of this, whether it hath or no, I will declare an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time; but so that it may be seen of all. Because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made this first, and that the work seemed fair and good unto him, as most full of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of good things, he loved it as a part of his Divinity and Power; and therefore, because it was of such excellencie and goodnesse, he would have Man made, that he might behold the works he had thus made, and likewise imitate his Wisdom and Providence; for the will of God is the chiefest perfection, in that he fulfilled both his will and his deed, in one and the same moment of time. When therfore God perceived that that image of his (the Soul) could not be studious of all things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he should cloath it with an earthly covering, he builded for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42089:146"/>
it this house of clay, confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mixing both parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one, as much as each body should be capable: Wherefore he made Man of an immortall Soul, and mortall Body, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Creature thus composed, he might satisfie both ends, which was, to be in admiration of Heaven and to pray for spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and heavenly things, and to inhabit, and govern these earthly things below: and I do not onely avouch the Earth and the Water to be mortall things, which two (out of the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) Nature hath subjected to the use of man; but all other things whatsoever belonging to man, as tillage, pastorage, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ports, shipping, navigation, traffique, &amp; merchandise, which is the strongest bond of humane Society: And there is a part of the world which is Water and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42089:147"/>
Earth that which is the Earthly part of the world is preserved for the knowledge and use of Arts, and discipline without which God would not have the world to be perfit, for necessity followeth the pleasure of God; and the effects follow his will, for it is not credible that God should be displeased with his own will for he knew long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before what would be, and what would please him.</p>

                  <p>BUt, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> I observe that thou dost earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to heare, how a man may come to enjoy that musicall harmony and divine Worship, which belongs to heaven. Wherefore hear, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> there is one frequent assemblie amongst men for this service of God; and this no other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can perform but man alone. For God is only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and delighted that man should extoll his admired work, sing praises of thanksgiving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and perform such wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and service as belongs to his holy name. Neither do those heavenly graces unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily descend into the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42089:148"/>
of men, lest that this earthly World should seeme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beautified in respect of the want of this heavenly and sweet Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick; but rather that his name who is the Father of all things, might be celebrated with the well tuned voices, and comely praises of men. So that neither in heaven nor earth this sweet Harmony of thanksgiving might cease; for there are some men (though few in number) that are indued with so divine and holy a spirit, that their care is only to please, reverence, and serve the Lord: but whoso ever through the confusion of both natures, the flesh prevailing, have darkned their spirituall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, they are so much given over to their own lusts, and are only intent upon these outward and lower things. Therefore a man is not to be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42089:149"/>
esteemed the weaker in respect that he is in part mortall, but peradventure thereby he may seem the more fitly and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alley composed to encrease in full knowledge and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to wit, because unlesse he had been made of both natures he could not have susteined both, therefore was he framed of both that he might have both an earthly and divine choice. I desire thee O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> not only to harken unto the reason of this tractate; but also to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it with much Zeal &amp; fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of Spirit. For the reason to many is incredible, but to devouter mindes it seemes true and good; wherefore from hence I will begin.</p>

                  <p>THe Lord of eternity is first God, secondly the World, and thirdly Man. The maker
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42089:150"/>
of the World is God, and all things therein governing all things with man whom he hath appointed <hi>Uicegerent</hi> or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, whom he hath made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to take the Charge of his whole work, that both he and the world might be an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of praise unto himself, that by this divine composition of man, the world in Greek might be the more truly called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, an Order or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament. For he knew himself, and knew the world to wit that remembring what resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance it had with his parts, what was for his use, and what for his service, He might la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to give praise and great thankes unto God and to hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our his Image; being not Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that he was made also after the Image of God, of which there are two Images, to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42089:150"/>
wit the world and man; whereby it cometh to passe, that for as much as there is but one joyning together on that part, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of soul and sense, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and understanding he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and thereby may seeme to ascend up into heaven; but on his earthly part which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of fire, water, and air, he remaines a mortall Creature upon earth, is altogether fixed on the things below and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of Nature; for so man is partly divine and partly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall abiding in one body, but he hath a measure of each.</p>
                  <p>Religion before all men (which a virtuous life follows) seemes only then to be perfit, when there is a contempt of all lustfull desires and unlawfull concupiscence, assisted with all manner of virtues. For all such things are contrary to the Soul
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42089:151"/>
and Spirituall understanding, which are possessed with a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and earthly desirel which are well called by the name of goods or possessions, in that they are not born with us but afterwards are possessed of us, wherefore all things of this kind are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from man that we may even despise the body, and those things which we greedily cover, or any vice or wickednesse which we lustfully desire, for so far as he is led by reason; so far he is a man; that contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating of the divinity, he may contemn and despise that part of his, which is mortall, but only so far as necessity compells for preservation of the soul. For, that man may be most perfect in either part, observe him in each to be formed of four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or principall parts with two hands and two feet, and other members of his body, with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42089:151"/>
which he may do service to this lower or earthly world, but with his other four parts, to wit, his understanding, soul, memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and providence, he searcheth and looketh into all divine causes and things, from whence it happens that man with a Restles search enquires into the diversities, qualities, and effects of things. But being hindred by the weight, and too much imperfection of his body, he cannot properly foresee the true naturall causes of things. This man therefore, so framed and fashioned, and that for such a ministery &amp; service commanded of the great God, as in decently governing the world, piously worshiping his God, &amp; worthily &amp; fitly obedient to both the wills of God, what gift dost thou think he shall be recompensed with? for seeing that this world is the work of God, and man
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42089:152"/>
by his labour and industry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth and encreaseth the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, joyneth his labour with the will of God, when by the help of his body, and by daily paines and care he adorneth that <hi>Species</hi> and forme, which by divine wisdom he first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but with that with which our parents were rewarded? with which also that we may be rewarded if it may seem good to his wisdome, we do most earnestly pray and desire, that he will release and free us out of this worldly prison, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from these earthly bonds; and restore us like unto the divine nature, pure and holy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Asclep</hi> Thou saiest thevery truth, O <hi>Trismegistus,</hi> for this is their reward who live piously towards God, and faithfully to the World; but to them that live otherwise and wickedly, both

But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, O <hi>Trismegistus,</hi> sundry soules under the hope of future eternity are much indangered in this world, which seemes to some Incredible, to some Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous and to others Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; for the fruit which is reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by worldly possessions in this temporall life, seemeth to be a very sweet thing; wherefore it obliquely holdeth the soul, that it cleaveth too much on that part of it which is mortall, neither suffers it to take notice of the divine part, envy hating immortallity: for I will, as it were by foreknowledge tell you, that none after us shall have simple election, which is true Philosophy; being a frequent beholding a holy worship and

There was <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Hyle,</hi> which in Greek signifieth the world, and the Spirit was in the world; but not as with God, neither are those things God, of which the world is, wherefore they were not, when they were not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but even then they were in that, from whence they had their being. For those things are not onely said to be, which are not yet created, but those also which have not a fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in generating; so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be produced and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated of them. Whatsoever things therefore have in them a nature of conceiving, those are

things apt to ingender, which may be created of these, albeit they ingender, or are created of themselves; wherefore God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting, God eternall, neither is, or could be begotten; he both is, hath been, and ever shall be. This is that therefore which in it self is the whole nature of God.</p>
                  <p>But the nature of the world, and of the Spirit, albeit they seem to be created from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; yet they have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a vertue of begetting and procreation, as also fruitfulnesse; for a beginning is in the quality of the nature, which contains in it self a quality, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of conception and birth. This is therefore onely gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, or easie to be ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered without the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another; but that which hath in it onely the vertue of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42089:156"/>
conceiving, is by the mixture of another nature. So they are to be discerned, that this place of the world may not seem to be created with those things which are in themselves, as which hath in it self the power of whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I call it a place in which are all things; for neither could all these things be, if a place were wanting which might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all things; for a place was to be provided for all things that were; for neither the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor qualities, nor situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or effects, can be known of things which are not: therefore the world, albeit it be not so created, yet it contains in it self the nature of all things, as which giveth (in all things) rich and fruitfull matter to conceive. This is therfore that whole qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity &amp; matter which may be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42089:157"/>
albeit it be not created: For as Nature is a fruitfull matter of quality, so the same is as fruitfull in malignity. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I said, O <hi>Asclepius</hi> and <hi>Amnon,</hi> which is said of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>, and give a reason: For they affirm, that God ought all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes to have freed the world from wickednesse; for he is so in the world, as though he seems to be a member, or part of it; for it is so provided and ordained by the most high God, as much as with reason he could then, when he hath vouchsafed to dignifie the mindes of men with sense, discipline, &amp; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; for with those things in which we excel other creatures, we can only shun the deceit of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42089:157"/>
sin, guile, and all other corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For he, before that he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared in them, shall by the very sight &amp; uglinesse of them, avoid them, that man is guarded with divine knowledge and wisdom; for it is the foundation of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, consisting in the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of knowledge: for by the Spirit all things are ministered, and refreshed in the world, and (as it were) an organ, or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is subject to the will of the great God. Wherefore hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto in our souls, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of that wise Moderatour and sensible Governour of God, which is called the Spirit, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, which comprehends in it self every place, and the substance of every thing, and the full matter of things begotten and created; and whatsoever else in the world, either for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, quality, or quantity: for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42089:158"/>
all the <hi>Species</hi> in the world, and every thing according to that nature which is given it of God, is moved and governed by the Spirit. But the world is the receptacle of all things, and the haunt and place to move in for all creatures, of which God is the Governour, dispensing in all worldly things, as much as is necessary to every one, who with his Spirit fills all things, of what nature and quality so ever. For the world is round like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Ball or sphere, being for the form or qualities sake invisible to it self. For if you shall chuse any high place in it only to look down, thou canst not see from thence what is below, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it consists of many places and parts, it is supposed to have a quality and by the alone forms of the <hi>Species,</hi> in whose <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> it seems to be ingraven, it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42089:158"/>
is supposed to be visible, when it is shewed, drawn out, or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but indeed it is alwayes to it self invisible. Whereby, the bottom or lowest part of the Sphere (if there be any) is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Asclep.</hi> All these things therefore, as you speak of, which are earthly, O <hi>Trismegistus,</hi>

                     <hi>Trism.</hi> Therefore the world nourisheth the bodies, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the life or soul and sense, or reason; the understanding being a gift with which man is only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, neither all men but few who have a heart &amp; judgment to be capable of so great a benefit: for as the world is inlightned by the Sun, so mans minde is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated by this light &amp; much more. For whatsoever the Sun doth enlighten, by the Eclipses and interposition of Earth and the Moon, and by the approach of night, it loseth, and is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of that light: but reason when it shall be once mixed with mans Soul it becomes, by that lively &amp; growing mixture,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42089:159"/>
of one nature with it. So that minds thus qualified are never intangled with misty and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure errors. Whereby the sense or reason may well be said tobe the soul or Spirit of God; but I say not of all, but of some excellent, and principall ones.</p>

which I now begin by the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red help and assistance of God. There are divers kinds of Gods, and of those one part intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, another sensible. They are called intelligibles, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they may be supposed not to be subject to our senses, (for we perceive them more then those which we call visibles) as our discourse shall shew, and thou if thou mark it maiest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: for divine reason passing beyond the reach and capacity of men, if thou with good care, and great attention listen not unto the speakers, will fly away and passe through thee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the Fountain of it own waters. There are therefore chief Lords o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> Gods of all <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> the Prince of whom is <hi>U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>a;</hi> these are like one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Originall, who by nature e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ct all things, every
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42089:161"/>
one illuminating one anothers work. The chief Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or whatsoever is concluded under that name, is <hi>Iupiter,</hi> for from Heaven <hi>Iupiter</hi> gives life to all. The chiefe Lord of the Sun, is the Light. For the benefit of light is distributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by the globe of the Sun. There are 34. Lords of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roscope, or which speculate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hours of Nativity, placed alwayes amongst the fixed Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, the Prince of these they call <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that is, which hath all snapes or which, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Species,</hi> makes divers Shapes. The seven wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Planets have also their Lords which they call, Fortune and Fate by which all things are changed which, were firmely sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by the law of nature, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by a continual motion. But the Aire is the Organ or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42089:162"/>
of all things, in which all things are brought to passe; and the chief Lord or Prince of this is second in degree conferring mortall things, and the like, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mortall Creatures. These things therefore being so, that these lower things are moved by the higher; So likewise all naturall things are joyned to themselves, as mortall things with mortall, and sensible things with sensible. But the chief matter of Government, belongs to that great Lord, being not many but only one for from that one all things de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Trism.</hi> This, O <hi>Asclepius.</hi> For God the Father, or the Lord of all things, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever name he is more religiously and devoutly called of men, which ought for our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sake to be reverenced of us, in contemplation of so great a Majesty, we have expresly called him by none of those names, for if this sound uttered, setteth forth the whole will of man or that understanding he shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the spirit; the substance of which name consisting of a few syllables, is limited and circumscribed, that there might be in man a necessary and familiar entercourse betwixt the voice, &amp; the eares, the spirit and the understanding, and so of all things by these: Whether
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42089:163"/>
then the name of God be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate or wholly in these? for I suppose not, that the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause of all Majesty, and the Father and Lord of all things, can be expressed by one name though compounded of many Syllables: it is necessary therefore that he should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not by one name but rather by all names, (seeing that he is both one and all things) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meet that all things should be his name; or that He should be styled by the name of All. This therefore being but one, as being all, is full of the fruitfulnesse of both natures, and rich in his own will bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth whatsoever he hath a desire to create. His will is all goodness, and this same good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness pertaines to all things, from his divinity nature proceeds that all things may be as they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42089:163"/>
are, and have been and in all things which shall be, nature hence forward may of it self be sufficient to beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t. Let this therefore be the reason given thee, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> wherefore and how all things, of both sexes are made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Asclep.</hi> You mean God, <hi>Trismegistus?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Trism.</hi> Not only God, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> but all Creatures having life, and all Creatures without life; for it is impossible that any of those things which are, should be unfruitfull, for fruitfulnesse being barred from all things that are, it will be impossible that there be a perpetuity of those things which are: for, I say, that Nature and Reason, and the World do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein in them this nature, and preserve in themselves all things created; for every Sex is full
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42089:164"/>
of procreation, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction or uniting of both is incomprehensible, which you may call Venery or lust or both: this therefore being well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood and clearly conceived, that from the God of nature the invention and office of procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is for ever, in whom is naturally perfect charity, joy, mirth, and divine love; and it might be said how great the force and necessity of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry is but that by the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of him, it is manifest to every ones understanding. For if you o bserve the first time wherein we are fashioned, how both natures frameth an ofpring either Male, or Female, how that the one greedily snatcheth the seed of the other, &amp; shuts it up close within the womb, and lastly how by that common Conjunction at the same time
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42089:164"/>
they beget men and women, which the woman for a certain time beareth in her womb. The effects therefore of so pleasing, and necessary a work, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the dark, lest that by the derisions and mockings of common ignorant fooles, the divinity of nature by the conjunction of both sexes, should be compelled to blush, if it should be subject to the open view of irreligious and ungodly persons, for there are very few in the world that may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted modest and religious, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it hapeneth that in many there remaines malice and lewdnesse, through the want of wisdome and knowledge in those things which are: for by the understanding of divine knowledge, and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>igion, by which all things are sweetly disposed, and ordered, there
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42089:165"/>
is not only a contempt of, but also medicine for all the evils in the world: but so long as ignorance and want of knowledge abide, there all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of sin gets head, and wounds the soul with incurable Vices, which being infected, and defiled with them, swells it, as it were with Poyson, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cured but by a soul fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with divine graces and understanding. If therefore only to a few this shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, it is meet to prosecute and conclude this tractate, to wit, wherefore God hath vouchsafed to impart, only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men understanding and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Hear therefore, when God the Father, and Lord of all things, had after other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Gods or Angels made man of the corrupter part of the world, and of a like measure
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42089:165"/>
of divinity, it happened that sin did remain mixed with those Bodies, with a necessary desire after food and living, (which nature hath given in common to other living creatures) as also other affections and vices of the minde incident to mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. But the Angels which were made of the purest part of nature, and wanting no helps of Reason and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and in a continuall state of immortality yet for unity of order, and for disclipine, and understanding he hath ordained by an eternal Law, (being an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the Law of necessity limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that they should not be far from them, or much different in nature; appointing man above all creatures to be only endued with reason and knowledge by which he might shun the corruption &amp; vices of his body, hath assigned
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42089:166"/>
them for the purpose and hope of immortality, finally he hath made man that he might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall of a divine and mortall nature, that it might appear that man being thus made after the will of God, is in better state then the Angels, who are made only of an immortall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as also all other mortall creatures. In which respect, man comming nearest to the nature of God he should wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him in pure and undefiled religion with an honest heart, and that the Angels with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and loving affection should pity and preserve all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things.

                  <p>ANd because we are now speaking of the similitude, and mutuall fellowship of men and God, acknowledge, O
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42089:168"/>
                     <hi>Asclepius,</hi> the authority and power of man. For as the Lord and Father, or most high God, is the Creatour of the heavenly Gods or Angels; so Man is the creatour of those gods which are set in Temples, contented to be neighbours unto men, and are not onely illuminated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but do also illuminate, doing not only good unto men, but also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that there is a God. Dost wonder at this, O <hi>Ascle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> or dost thou doubt of it, as many do?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Asclep.</hi> I am confounded, O <hi>Trismegistus:</hi> but giving cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to what you say, I judge man to be most happy, who hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to so great blessednesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trism.</hi> Neither unworthily is he worthy of admiration, who is the greatest amongst the gods. For the <hi>Genus</hi> of all things is manifest without confusion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42089:168"/>
propagated of the purest part of Nature, and the similitudes of them to be (as it were) the heads of all; but the <hi>Species</hi> of the gods, which man repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, is fashioned of two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Divine, which is the more excellent and noble part; and Earthly, which is that which is here conversant in earth, and which consists of the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, or severall parts of the outward Man. So Man being mindfull of his Divine Nature and Originall, remains still in the likenesse of God. For as the Father and the Lord hath made eternal Gods, that might be like unto him. So man hath fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned out unto himself gods; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the similitude of his own countenance.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Trism.</hi> Do you not see how
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42089:169"/>
far you are mistaken? living images, full of sense and spirit, doing such and so great things! Images having fore-knowledge of things to come, and fore-tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by many other things, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, cares, and sorrows, which shall happen deservedly to men. Are you ignorant, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> that Aegypt is the image of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or, which is more true, a translation of descension of all things, which are governed and exercised in Heaven? And if we speak rightly, Our land is the Temple of the whole World, and yet for that it beseemeth wise men to fore-know all things, it behoveth you not to be ignorant, that the time will come when it may appear, that the Aegyptians have by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and pious practice in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion served God in vain, and all their holy worship shall become void, and of no effect: For the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42089:169"/>
Divinity shall return back from Earth into Heaven, Aegypt shall be forsaken, and the Land which was the seat of the Divinity, shall be destitute of Religion, and deprived of the presence of the Deity. For when strangers shall possesse, and fill up this Land and Kingdom, not onely there shall be a neglect of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but, which is more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, there shall be Laws en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted against Religion, Piety, and Divine Worship, with punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted upon those that seem to favour it: then this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seat shall be full of Iolatry, Idols Temples, and dead mens Sepulchres. O Aegypt, Aegypt, there shall remain only a fained shew of thy Religion, and which will seem incredible to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and onely letters shall stand ingraven upon thy pillars, which may declare thy pious deeds,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42089:170"/>
and in thee shall inhabit the Scythian, Indian, or some other neer barbarous Nation. For the Divinity shall fly to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the whole Nation forsaken shall die, and so Aegypt shall be forsaken of God and man. I call upon thee, thou most holy Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and presage unto thee things which shall come to passe; thy waters and divine streams shall be filled with blood, which shall overflow thy banks, and make a violent inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, so that there shall be more dead than living, and he that remains alive, shall onely by his language be known to be an Aegyptian, but by his deeds he shall seem a Barbarian. Why weep you, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> Aegypt shall be furnished with far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and worse evils than these, she being heretofore a holy and great Favourer of the Deity, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42089:170"/>
Divine Worship and Religion, and that worthily upon earth, separated alone from other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, became the Mistresse of Sanctity and Piety, shall be an example of the greatest cruelty, and then with grief of heart, the world shall not seem to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and adored. This whole good (than the which there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, hath, or shall be any thing that shall appear, of more excellencie) shall be indanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and seem burdenous to men, and in this respect shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised: neither shall the world be esteemed, which is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable work of God, a most glorious Fabrick, a work com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with the different va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of shapes, an instrument of the will of God, who in his work (without envie) bespake all things to become one; which, of the beholders, might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42089:171"/>
praised, and loved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an united heap of sundry shapes. For darknesse shall be preferred before light, death shall seem sweeter than life, no man shall look up to Heaven, a religious man shall be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a mad man, an irreligious and profane person seem wise, a mad man, valiant; and the worst of all men, good and pious: for the Soul, and all things about it, wherein it is either mortall, or conceiveth that it shall attain to immortality, accordingly as I have declared unto you, shall not onely be esteemed a thing worthy of laughter, but also a meer vanity: For beleeve me, it shall be reckoned a capital of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for him that shall study to be religious, there shall new Statutes and Laws be stablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: nothing which is religious shall be heard worthy of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

or heavenly things, or be entertained in the hearts of men: there shall be a separation of God, which is much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, from the Society of men, onely evil angels shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main mixed with the humanity, which shall violently move to all manner of audacious mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, stir them up to wars, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, robberies, deceit, and unto all things contrary to the disposition of the Soul, then the Earth shall not stand, the Sea shall not be sailed in; and in Heaven, the course of the Stars and Planets shall cease, all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine knowledge shall (of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity) be buried in silence, the fruits of the earth shall be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, neither shall the earth be fruitfull, and the air it self shall languish with a sorrowfull countenance; these and such like times shall come; irreligion

and confusion of the world, with a senslesnes &amp; vacancy of al good things. When these things shall happen, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> then that Lord and Father God Almighty, Governour onely of the world, looking into the manners, and voluntary deeds of men; after his own will (which is his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) punishing vices, taking away all errours and corruption, and drowning all manner of wickednesse, either by an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of waters, or else consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them by fire, or else by plague and pestilence, he will end this world, and restore it to its ancient beauty; so that the world it self may seem to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and honoured: and God, the Creatour and Restorer of so great a work, shall of all men then being, be magnified with continuall praises and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings: For this generation of the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Asclep.</hi> For the nature of God is the counsaile of his will, and his excellent goodnesse his counsaile, O <hi>Trismegist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>

evils, for the Father and Lord of all things, who alone is all, showes himself willingly to all, not where he is in place, nor what in quality, nor how great in quantity, but illuminating man with the alone understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the mind, who when the darknesse of mind is removed; and the brightnesse of truth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, participates himself by the full sense of divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by whose love he is freed from that naturall part which is mortall, and conceiveth hope of future immortality. This therefore shall be the difference betwixt good and evil men, for every one by piety religion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship and reverence of God, shineth and becometh bright as the eye-sight, when he hath throughly seen the truth of reason, and the confidence of hope and excelleth so far other
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42089:178"/>
men, as the Sun excelleth other Starrs in his Light: for the Sun it self not so much in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of diety, as in divinity and sanctity illuminateth the other Starrs. For I suppose this, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> to be the Second God governing all other things, &amp; illustrating all worldly things whether they be creatures with life or without life, for if the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the world hath, is &amp; shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be Living, nothing in the world is mortal. For there is no place of mortality, for every liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part which is in the world, as in one and the same continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all living creature, wherefore it ought to be full of life and eternity, if it must always live. The Sun therefore as the world is eternall, and so is the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of life and livelinesse, and the continual dispenser of them. He is therefore the God of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42089:179"/>
living and of those things which have life in the world, the continuall governour, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall dispensator of life it self, for he hath once dispensed by an eternall Law; and giveth life to every Living thing. In this manner which I will speake of, for in that quicknesse of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the world is moved, and in that living eternity, is the place of the world, for which hereafter it shall neither stand nor be destroyed, the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intrenched, and as it were wrapped in with the eternity of life. It is therefore the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penser or giver of life to all things which are in it, and the place of all things which are governed under the Sun, the commotion of which world consisteth of a twofold effect. For it self is outwardly enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from eternity, and it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42089:179"/>
and inlivens those things which are within it, differing in proportions, and appointed, and prefixed times, all things are known and ordered by the effects of the Sun, and by the course, and influence of the Starrs, all temporall things are established by reason and divine Law, the Earthly seasons are known by the quality of the Aire, as either in the variety of heat, or cold, the Heavenly seasons by the return of the Starrs to the same places, and by the temporall change of tides, and the world is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of time, by whose course and motion it is refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but time is kept by order. Order and time make an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all things which are in the world by course.</p>

                  <p>VVHerefore all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, neither of things created, Heavenly things or Earthly, is any thing stable fixed or immoveable, for only God, and worthily he alone is in himself from himself, and on all sides wholly full and perfect, and this is his firme stability which cannot be removed by the enforcement, or occasion of any other seeing in him are all things, and in all things he is only, unlesse any man will dare to say that his motion consisteth in eternity, but much rather his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity is unmoveable, into which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42089:181"/>
the motion of all times return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and from which the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all times takes it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. God hath therefore been alwayes stable, and his eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alwaies a like stable with him, containing the world not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within himself, which we rightly call sensible. The Image of this God is the world, which is made an imitator or resemblance of eternity: for time hath the force, and nature of stability in the very necessity of return again into it self: wherefore albeit eternity be stable immoveable and fixed, yet because by the mobility of time, motion is alwayes called back into eternity, and that mobility is turned by reason of time, it comes to passe that eternity it self is certainely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, and may seem only by time to be moved in which it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42089:181"/>
self is, for in that time is all the motion; so it happens that the stability of eternity is moved, and the stability of time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes stable by the rule of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so it is credible that God is moved into himself, by the same immoveablenesse, for there is an in immoveable moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the greatnesse of his very stability, for the condition of his greatnesse is immoveable. This therefore which is so, and not obvious to our senses, is infinite, incomprehensible and inestimable, which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be sustained, reported of, nor found out; whereupon it is uncertain wherein, where, how, and in what fashion it is: for he is reported to be in the greatest stability, and in him is his stability, whether he be God or Eternity, whether the one be in the other, or both
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42089:182"/>
in either, for which cause eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is without definition of time: but time which may be defined, returning either by order course or circuit of another is eternal, wherefore both seem to be infinite, both eternall, for stability considering that it is fixed, for that by the Benefit of strength it can sustein all things that are moveable, it worthily obtaineth Dominion: for the beginning of all things which are, is God, and eternity; but the world because it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable hath not the principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for his mobility prevents his stability by the rule of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all motion, having an immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able strength. All sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the divinity being a like and immoveable, moveth it self by his stability, and is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and eternal, or whatsoever may more fitly be called; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42089:182"/>
consisting in the very truth of the high God, full of all sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible things, and full knowledge abiding as I said with God, but worldly sense is the receptacle of all sensible things, both for <hi>Species</hi> and disclipine, but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane sense by the strength of memory, for that it remembers all things that it hath done: for divine reason and sense come down continually to man, and God would not that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and divine sense should be confounded with all Creatures, lest it should blush in being mixt with brutes. For the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of humane sense, of what sort, and how great it is, is wholly in the memory of things past: for by that strength of memory it is made govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the earth; but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Nature, and of the quality and sense of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42089:183"/>
world, may be perceived by all sensible things in the world; eternity, which is the second is known to be a sense and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity given of the sensible world, but the understanding of the quality, and quality of the sense of the high God, is the alone truth, the shaddow of which truth in the world is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known in the last line, for where is any thing known by the dimension of time, where there seem to be leasings gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and errors? You see therefore, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> in what things we are agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which we handle or which we dare to touch: but I give unto thee thankes, O great God, which hast illuminated me with the light of seeing thy divinity: and you O <hi>Latus, Asclepius,</hi> And <hi>Amnon,</hi> conceale secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within your breasts and keep

close these divine Mysteries. But in this differeth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing from sense, for that our understanding commeth by the intention, and diligence of the mind to understand and know the quality of the sense of the world, but the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the world reacheth to eternity, and to know God who is above it self, and so it happens unto us men, that as in a mist we see those things which are in Heaven, as much as it is possible through the condition of humane sense. And this intention or reach in perceiving so great good things is very narrow and weak, but is most large when it shall see it by knowledge, and the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a good conscience.</p>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42089:184"/>
of the world are most full parts, as the world it self is full of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies different in quality and form, having both their form and greatnesse, of which one is greater than another, and one lesse than another, different in strength and weaknesse: for some of these easily seem to be the stronger, as the greater: but the lesser and smaller can scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or not at all be seen, which things to be, we know onely by feeling, whereby it happeneth, that many beleeve that these are not bodies, or substances, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty places, which is impossible; for if any thing be named out of the world, if there be any thing (which I hardly beleeve) therein so full of intelligible things, that is, things like to the Divinity, as this place which is called the sensible world, is full of bodies and creatures, agreeing both in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42089:185"/>
nature and quality to it, all whose representations we see not; but some exceedingly great, some exceeding little, and short, which either through the length of distance, or that we are dull of eye-sight, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be such unto us, or to be short; for their exceeding smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse they are supposed of some not to be. I speak now of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which, I suppose, sojourn with us, and Spirits above us, which are betwixt the purest part of the air, and the earth, where there is neither place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>or Clouds, nor commotion by the motion of any Meteor, Comet, or Signe. In this respect, O <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sclepius,</hi> thou canst say nothing to be subject to Vacuity, unlesse thou vauntest there may be a Vacuity of what thou affirmest to be empty, as a Vacuity from the fire, from the water, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42089:185"/>
from the like, which although it happens to seem so (For that may be void of such things, which are great, or little, which makes it seem empty) yet there cannot be a Vacuity of Spirit, and Air. The like also we may speak of a place, for the word onely wants understanding; for a place appeareth what it is, from that of which it is: for when the principall name is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, the signification, or interpretation is imperfect. Wherefore the place of water, the place of fire, or such like, we truly say; for as it is impossible for any thing to be void, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty, so the place alone what it is cannot be known. For if you put the place without that of which it is, it shall seem to be an empty place, which I beleeve the world hath not: For if there be no Vacuity, neither a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42089:186"/>
place appeareth what it is by it self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unlesse you shall adde unto it, either longitudes, lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, or altitudes, as signes to the bodies of men. These things being so, <hi>Asclepius,</hi> and you that are present know, that the intelligible World that is God, who is known only by the sight of the soul, is incorporeal; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any thing corporall be mixed with his Nature, that is, which may be known by qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, quantity, and numbers, for no such thing abideth in him; therefore this world, which is called sensible, is the receptacle of all sensible <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> qualities, or bodies; all which without God, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Vegetation, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed; for all things are God, and from him and his will are all things: that which is wholly good, comely and wise, sensible
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42089:186"/>
and intelligible, belongs to him alone, and without this there neither is, hath, or shall be any thing; for all things are from him, in him, and by him, both qualities of many shapes, and great quantities, and greatnesse exceeding measure, and varieties of <hi>Species</hi> and Forms, which if you shall understand, O <hi>Ascle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> you will give God thanks, and if you shal wel observe the whole, you shal by true reason perfectly learn, that the world it self is sensible, and all things that are in it, to be covered (as with a garment) from that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per world; for every kinde of creature, O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> of what kind soever, as well mortal, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, or rational, whether it be a living creature, or be not, each of them retain the image and form of their kinde, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit every kind of creature pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42089:187"/>
the full form of his kind; yet in the same form of shews, they are all unlike one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the <hi>Genus</hi> of men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be uniform, that a man may naturally be known, yet all of them are in the same form unlike to themselves; for the <hi>Species,</hi> which is divine, is in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42089:187"/>
so different shapes, as the course of the world hath moments, which world is turned by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and changes, but the <hi>Species</hi> is neither turned, nor changed. So the Forms of each kind are permanent and stable, but unlike to themselves in the same Form.</p>

and not looking into divine worship, and religion, they found out an art whereby they might make them gods; to which invention they joyned the work of nature, and because they could not make souls, they called out the souls of Devils or Spirits, and put them into their Idols, and divine Mysteries, by which alone the Idols had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do either good or hurt.

                  <p>
                     <hi>ASclep.</hi> What part therefore of the world do the fates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in, O <hi>Trismegistus?</hi> If the Heavenly Gods beare universal rule, do the earthly Gods which we call Fortune and Fate inhabite in particular pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trism.</hi> O <hi>Asclepius,</hi> that is the necessity of all things that are governed, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes joyned and lincked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: this is therefore the efficient cause of things, or the most high God, or next unto God, which second effect is God, or the discipline, of all earthly and Heavenly things, stablished by divine
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42089:193"/>
lawes. These therefore, Fortune and Necessity, are both tyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by an individuall knot. The former of which, Fortune or Fate, begets the beginning of all things, but Necessity enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them to their effects, which depends from those beginnings. Order, followeth these, which is the continuance, and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time in bringing things to passe, for nothing is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the agreement of Order. In all these this world is perfit, for the world it self is carried by Order, or consisteth wholly of Order: wherefore these 3. Fate, Necessity, and Order, are brought to passe, especially by the will of God, who governeth the world by his own Law and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine reason. By these there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both will and nill are by a divine hand fully crossed; for they are neither moved by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42089:193"/>
nor bowed by favour, but serve the necessity of eternall reason, which Eternity is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, immoveable, and insoluble. Fate therefore is the first; which, the seed being as it were cast in, receives the encrease of all future things. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity follows, by which all things are enforced violently to their effects. The Third is Order, which preserveth the frame of those things which Fate and Necessity hath disposed of. This is therefore eternity, which neither hath beginning nor ending, which by a fixed immutable law of continuall motion is preserved. It riseth and falls oftentimes by course, so that when the times vary, it riseth again in those same parts in which it fell, for so is reason a voluble rotundity that all are so firmely joyned that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42089:194"/>
know what is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of volubility, when all things seem to go before, and follow themselves, for chance and fortune are mixed in all worldly things.</p>

                        <hi>be, follows; which lastly Order preserves, even as it is stablished by Divine and Eternall Law: So that the first Fate is Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination; the second, Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of things; and the third, Preservation. And these three, or the Divine Law, or those things that follow the course of Divine Law, contein the order both of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite causes, and those which are according to nature, but yet Fate admitteth in casuall things inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and indeterminate causes beyond nature: but of these let others judge.</hi>

and permit: It onely remaines that we praise God and pray unto him, and so return to the care of the body. For treating sufficiently of divine matters, we have satified our minds as it were with the food of the soul. But as they passed out of the cloyster, when they began to pray to God, they looked back towards the South; for when the Sun setteth, if any man will pray to God, he ought to look that way; as also when the Sun riseth, to look East: Now as they were saying their prayers, <hi>Asclepius</hi> said, with a low voice. O <hi>Tatius</hi> let us put the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in mind that he command that we should dedicate our prayers unto God, with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of frankincense, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense. <hi>Trismegistus</hi> hearing of it, and being moved, saith.

this is like unto theft when you pray unto God to burn frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and the like: for nothing is wanting unto him, who himself is all things, for in him are all things; but let us give thanks, and adore him, for these are the cheif sacrifices of God, when thankes are given of mortall men. We give thee thankes, O great and glorious God, for by thy grace only we have attained to the Light of thy knowledge. Thou Name, holy and worthy to be honoured, one name by which God as a Father is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly to be praised, because thou vouchsafest to give unto all fatherly piety religion and love, or whatsoever thing else is of most efficacy, when thou dost reward us with sense, reason, and understanding; with sense that we may know thee; with reason, that we may look up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42089:196"/>
thee, and search into thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature; with understanding that knowing thee we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in thee, and being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by thy Majesty, we may delight our selves in thee, that thou wast pleased to shew thy self wholly unto us: let us give thankes that thou hast vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to consecrate us, who are placed in these earthly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles to be heirs of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For this is only mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation and knowledge of thy Majesty.
