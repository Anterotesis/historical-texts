            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Readers,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>UPON the perusal of this Treatise, I finde the Subject of it to be needful and seasonable, the Design of it high and excellent, the Stile exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plain and pressing, purposely suited to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the Ignorant, for whom it is written: Concerning all which, I think it meet to inform you at the entrance, as foreseeing that in all these it is not unlike to be much mistaken.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some think that a <hi>Sacrament</hi> is a <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> and not very necessary Subject to be treated of: But such understand not, that it is the most great and noble Subject, as being the very <hi>Summary</hi> and <hi>kernel</hi> of all our Religion: for it containeth in it the whole Covenant between God and Man, wherein he giveth himself to us as our <hi>GOD,</hi> our reconciled <hi>Father,</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and our <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> and we give up our selves answerably to him, and thankfully accept his gift upon his terms. For the two Sacraments are the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing of this sacred Covenant, wherein we profess with seriousness, resolvedness, and fidelity, to dedicate and devote our selves entirely to God our Father, our Redeemer, and our Regeneratour: Which if we do sincerely, the saving benefits of the Covenant are ours: In which sense the Ancients truly taught, That Baptism certainly washeth away all sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Therefore this Doctrine must needs be <hi>seasonable,</hi> at a time when our lamentable differences about Sacraments, have, with great numbers both of the consciencious and the careless,


<pb facs="tcp:107818:3"/>
brought them under abuses, omission, or contempt. Many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whose desires are to worship God according to his will, beleive that it is their duty, to hold the communion of Saints, in Churches which have a more holy constitution, guidance, Discipline and administration, than most of our publick Churches have; from which, because the Law restrains them, some of them communicate now here but in secret, and some so seldome there, as is next to a total omission. The more ignorant people seeing these shun the publick communion, encour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge themselves the more in their careless omission and contempt of it: Some of them think that it is but a thing indifferent, and a Ceremony which may well enough be spared without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Soul. And others have some reverence for it, and think that it is not to be approached without Repentance and great Preparation: But they do the more negligently and quietly omit this preparation and the Sacrament it self, when they see it omitted by so many, whom they esteem above them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But what? Is it the <hi>design</hi> of this Treatise to drive all these men in their impenitency and ignorance to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred work? And to draw them to imitate such of the same Herd, as do it only to avoid the penalty of the Law? I know many that read but the Title of this Book will say, Is it now a time to draw the ignorant multitude to the Sacrament? Were it not fitter to seek that stricter discipline might keep them from it, till they are prepared and know what they do?</p>
            <p n="3">3. To this I answer, That the design of this Treatise is not to perswade any to eat the <hi>Body of Christ and drink his Blood,</hi> in an undiscerning, profane, or unworthy manner: Nor doth it tempt men to Covenant with their lips, and leave their hearts behinde them: But it teacheth men to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what the Sacrament is, and what a holy and solemn Covenant is there to be renewed with God: And how essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially knowledge, Faith and Repentance, and resolutions for a holy life, are necessary for that Covenant. And because most ignorant ungodly people, are so strange to their own


<pb facs="tcp:107818:3"/>
hearts, that we cannot convince them of their sottish contempt of Christ and holiness, by any proof but what is palpable and past denial; therefore the Authour taketh advantage of their profane neglect of this Ordinance to convince them. And while a superficial Reader will think he is but drawing them to the Lords Table, the truth is he taketh this but as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to draw them to the Lord himself.</p>
            <p>The main design of the Book is to convince poor, impenitent, unholy souls, of the absolute necessity of a speedy, resolute, faithful consent to the Covenant of Grace, and a sincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting of themselves to God, through Jesus Christ; and then that they will solemnize and seal this Covenant, in this holy Sacrament. No one that Readeth the Book will think that there is any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of sufficient warning, against the profanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament: Blame him not for drawing men to Christ and to Conversion, and you will finde here no cause to blame him, for immethodical drawing them to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And the great plainness and largeness of the style (which to some will seem tedious) must be imputed to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours earnest desire to save mens souls, which makes him stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously condiscend to their capacities. The more men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand already, the fewer words will serve their turns: and to such an accurate and sententious stile wil be most acceptable But the Ignorant must not only have plainness, but copious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and much Repetition and inculcating of the same things. They understand not that which is briefly and accurately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, though the terms be never so common and familiar: and those that have due compassion on the Ignorant, will best like that stile which most promoteth their information and conversion; and will judge of the means by its aptitude to its proper end.</p>
            <p>The Lord give the Reader the saving benefit, and the worthy and faithful Author the comfort, of these earnest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, in a plentiful success. And O that the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <head>CHAP. I. The Introduction, lamenting the Ignorant Vulgars contempt of their Salvation; and shewing the design of this Treatise</head>
               <p>THe blessed God who in these last daies hath spoken to us by his Son, and more fully and clearly reveal'd the way to life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, which Christ hath brought to light; hath abundantly manifested his infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodness, in suiting and accomodating his commands and institutions, to the meaness of our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities; and, as a God who knows our frame, hath so fitted himself and the revelations of his will, with a respect to our weakness, that nothing but affected ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and meer wilfulness, can keep out the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of what he hath taught us, or hinder the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of what he commands us.</p>
               <p>The Doctrines of the Gospel, which are of necessity to be believ'd in order to Salvation, and upon which an holy life is built, are few and plain, which we may finde sum'd up in our common Creeds. As for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which are given to bee the rule of our life; how easie are they to be known and remembred, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding reasonable in themselves, and most agreeable to our rectified natures, and apparently tending to the unspeakable advantage of particular Persons, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, Towns, and Common-wealths: the Gospel being design'd, not only to bring men to glory and pleasure hereafter, but to better the world at present, and to make this earth a kinde of type and shadow of heaven; and so it would bee, if men were but more generally brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

sins which are destructive to the happiness of societies and single persons, as the Laws and Religion of the Heathens might also do: but strikes at the very heart of wickedness, and gives the surest directions and best helps, for the utter removal of the cause and root of all disorders in the world, which it would be beside my purpose at present to speak of. None have cause now to complain, that they know not what to do to obtain eternal life, since he that runs may read his duty, To love God above all, and our neighbour as selves, to do as we would bee done unto, to repent of all our sins, and betake our selves to the mercies of God through his Son Christ Jesus for a pardon, to be humble, holy, chaste, and temperate; is any of this difficult to be understood? Have we not a plain word, directing us how to lead the whole course of our life? And have we not a monitour within us, the Spirit of God by our Consciences in most cases, telling us how wee should behave our selves? The sum of all is comprehended in our Baptismal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>to Renounce the Devil and all his works, the world with its pomp and vanities, the flesh and the lusts thereof, and to be devoted to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi> And as our duty is easie to be known, so is it not difficult to be done, where there is first a willing minde: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in this is comprehended all, to bee unfeignedly willing to be such as God would have us, and to do all that he bids us. So that none can excuse himself for his disobedience, which is nothing else but obstinacy or gross negligence. And though of our selves wee are poor weak creatures, yet through the almighty grace that is offered to our assistance, we may be inabled to do all things needful for our happiness; and those weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that cleave to us, which we allow not our selves in, but strive against and bewail, wee are assured, through the merits of our precious Saviour, shall never be laid to our charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:107818:7"/>And as the great truths and duties of our Religion are thus plain and easie, so the positive institutions, whereby I mean the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Supper, are few and clear: being neither bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome to be practised, nor the meaning of them hard to be understood. Doth not that form of words, which Christ hath enjoyned to be used in Baptism, whereby we are solemlny received into the number of professed Christians, sufficiently shew the meaning of it? name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we are hereby consecrated and given up to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And doth not our being Baptized with Water, very plainly hold forth our washing and cleansing from the stains and pollutions of defiled nature, and from the guilt of sin, by the blood and Spirit of Christ. And who knows not, that the Lords Supper is for remembrance of Jesus Christ that Died for us? The breaking of the Bread, and pouring forth of the Wine, how fitly and evidently do they represent to us, that his body was broken, and his blood shed for us? And the Elements of Bread and Wine, which we commonly use to nourish and refresh us, do naturally signifie that strength and comfort which we receive from Christ, as I shall hereafter shew at large.</p>
               <p>Since then the truths of our Religion are so evident, the Duties so reasonable and excellent, the Ritual part the Sacraments so easie, so few, and so exceeding profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, may it not well be expected, that all who profess themselves owners of that Religion which Jesus Christ hath taught and established, should be well acquainted with these weighty truths; diligent in the practise of Duty to their Maker and Saviour, and to one another; and most devout and serious in the observation and use of these holy Sacraments, &amp; constant in their attendance upon all Ordinances, as publick Prayer and Preaching whereby they may be instructed &amp; enabled to know and


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107818:8"/>
do the will of him that sent them into the world. But alas, alas, to the dishonour of God and our profession, and to the grief of all that long after the advancement of true goodness in the world, by sad experience wee finde the quite contrarary even in this our Nation, that we look no further. God forbid that I should go about to disparage the glorious fruits of our Reformation from Popish ignorance and superstition; no, blessed and for ever praised be our God, for that unspeakable mercy to this unworthy Land, for the happy effects whereof, doubtless thousands of souls are praising him in glory, and thousands more yet on earth have cause to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely thankful for that clear light which visited this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the earth, when sunk into little less than an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Darkness: So that I verily beleive there is no Nation under the Sun, where there are greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of knowing hearty Christians, who walk agreeable to the Gospel rule, such that would be owned and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Christ himself and his Apostles, were they now amongst us and will be at the day of their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before him. But having said this to prevent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and mistake, give me leave to resume my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that still there are so many that are in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the midst of Light, and that walk <hi>as in darkness, not as children of the light.</hi> Notwithstanding the means of knowledge, multitudes remain in gross ignorance, and are unacquainted even with the great foundation-truths of the Gospel; and can it then be otherwise, but that they should bee vicious, careless, and worldly? And many who have a superficial knowledge of their Duty, and confess its best to be careful in doing of it, yet are themselves wilful and gross neglecters of it, and live in open violation of Gods holy Laws. Many there are that can talk religiously, and are ready in the Scripture, that yet will not by any means bee brought


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107818:8"/>
to forsake those sins, which they finde Gods Word every where condemns, nor will they set themselves to live such an holy serious life, which is again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain so expresly and earnestly urged upon them. As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or the Sacraments, though most are careful to bring their Children to be Baptized, yet I pray God it be not more out of Custome than Conscience, for some of these can give no tolerable account of the Reason of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, nor why they would have their Children par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it, only as they see their neighbours do, so do they. But yet there are far fewer, who make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of enforming their Children what a strict Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they are entred into, how they are related and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engaged to God: for alas, can we expect Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents should teach their Children to walk as becomes those that are in Covenant with God, when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves live rather like Rebels to his Majesty, than faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects?</p>
               <p>And as for the Lords Supper (which I intend to make the subject of my following discourse) how sadly is it neglected in many places; or else rusht upon inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately and carelesly, as if it was but a matter of course, and no such a dangerous thing to receive it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, as Scripture assures us that it is. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds, yea, thousands are there in both City and Country, who make no conscience at all of coming to the Table of the Lord? perhaps they may come once a year, and scarce that. Nay, many go from one year to another and never appear there: as if they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd not they had a Saviour died for them, or as if he had not bid them thus to remember his Death, or as if his Death were not worth the remembring. Oh care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, stupid sinners, what have you got to take up your thoughts and mindes, that Christ himself is thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by you? You can think well enough of your


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107818:9"/>
Children and Friends, yea, of your Cows and Sheep, and your very Swine, and must Christ have no room in your thoughts or memory? Do these indeed deserve more love than hee? Have they done more for you, than he hath done? Or can they do more than he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble farther to do, and willing also if your wretched ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy did not prevent him. I know you can say ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you, that he deserves not to live who can forget Christ, and that you do indeed remember him, and take him for your only Saviour: and will pretend that you have God alwaies in your minde, when you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your work, or upon the way, and you think wee must take your word for't, because wee know not your hearts, and cannot disprove you, but if one may judge by your carriage, you manifest nothing less. If one follow you from morning to night, he shall scarce hear one serious word come out of your mouths; you spend not half an hour in a day in Prayer, either with your familys or alone; plain enough we can hear you swear and cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What ever company you light into, you are still talking foolishly and vainly, or else only of your own worldly affairs, but nothing that concerns the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and the salvation of your souls. But for m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

such a small thing as he enjoyns thee to do in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him? never taking care to prepare thy self and come to his holy Table. Canst thou remember him, and yet forget his command? and absent thy self from those who meet together to celebrate his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, at an ordinance appointed by Christ himself for that very purpose? Ah poor creatures, that you did but well know your selves, and your own necessities and concernments, then could you never bee soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of Jesus Christ, you would as soon forget your daily bread. Oh did you well know what he hath done for you, and under what engagements you stand to him, you would sooner forget your dearest friend who had sav'd you from death, and daily fed you, and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, and kept you alive: for indeed this, and much more than this, do you owe to the Redeemer of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. Oh that you would but beleive and consider, what glorious unspeakable treasures of love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he hath purchast for, and will bestow upon you, if you will accept them upon his terms, and then you would no more forget him, than you could forget your Prince or Landlord, from whose bounty you were in daily expectations of a plentiful estate. And if you would but see to get your selves well informed of the nature of this holy Ordinance, distinctly and clearly to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the reason and use of it, and what priviledges and blessings are contained in, represented and sealed by it; I dare say you would more long to partake of it, than of the most delicious banquet, or sumptuous feast that ever was prepar'd. But what do I talk of? who can perswade carnal, sensual, stupid creatures, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive that there is any substance, any worth in those things that their senses cannot reach to? what care they for that which no way tends to the pampering and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of their flesh? Give me leave before I come to


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107818:10"/>
what I principally design, a little to lay open the wretched carelesnesses of the generality of men, and briefly hint at the cause; that they may be ashamed of themselves when they see their picture and descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and seek out for the cure of their distempers.</p>
               <p>Who would not, by the lives of most, conjecture that they thought themselves sent into the world, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to get food and raiment, and to make provision for the flesh; and that they had reason given them for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but to be more witty and politick in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their worldly designs? And how well would it be for them at the last, if those souls should have the greatest reward, which were most loving to the body, most solicitous for its welfare, and did toil most in its service. But what an heavy doom will light on them, if they must hereafter fare (as for certain they must) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they employed themselves in seeking their own proper happiness, in the pleasing and serving of the great God. Oh the strange folly and bruitishness of these men, who are so forward of themselves, to seek out after any thing which they believe makes for their temporal good, and yet will not by any means be drawn or driven to that, which is indeed for their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and eternal good, yea, and their temporal too, so far as may consist with these. As if when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving and working for the body, then only they were about their own business, but when they are minding the matters of their souls, they were employ'd for some body else, in works that will be of no use or advantage to them: when yet God himself hath told us, that in the matters of Religion, <hi>If we are wise we are wise for our selves.</hi> But this comes to pass, by reason of that sottishness which inclines poor creatures to judge of all things by their sense, and to measure their goodness by their suitableness to the flesh. This makes the whole


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107818:10"/>
Gospel to be a meer riddle to them, and little more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded than a strange story: for it treats of spiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible things, wherein immortal souls are concerned, and they forget that they have such souls. To hear of spiritual food and raiment, <hi>to put on Christ and to feed upon him,</hi> all which we meet with in the word, are my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of which they are willing to be ignorant. To be <hi>made glad with the light of Gods countenance, to have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with the Father and the Son, to be beautified, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and enricht with graces and good works</hi>; and the like expressions are so dark and knotty, that they know not what to make of them: They account nothing beauty but what they can look on, nor bravery, which makes not a noise and show in the world: They know no Rayment they need, but what they wear on their backs, nor any food but that which they put into their bellies. That only do they account pleasure, which they feel in their throats, or which is so gross, that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and dogs have a share in it as well as they; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing must pass for honour with them, but having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect in the world; and that they count their chiefest riches, which they put in their purses, and lay up in their bags. And this same blindness and carnality, amongst all other mischiefs that it does, occasions the contempt of that sacred appointment of Christ, the commemoration of his death, by partaking of his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: For here's nothing provided to give that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to greedy raging Sensualists which they covet and hunt after. It is indeed very well worthy our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, that so far as our senses might be helpful to us in the service of God, he hath graciously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discended to use such means as might work upon and affect them, that thereby faith it self, our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those things which we see not, may be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and advanced: which, as in some other instances,


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107818:11"/>
so in this Sacrament especially is made manifest: for here we have a crucified Christ plainly held forth to us, and the benefits we receive by him, are signified by those material things, bread and wine, which we eat and drink. And thus far God hath made provision for sense it self, the more to excite and stir up our dull spirits; but so far as the pleasing and humouring the senses might bee an hindrance to the soul, God hath made no provision for them. Here's no such pomp, and gaudiness, and outward splendour, as may gratifie wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton carnal minds. Papists may devise such things (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Christs Institutions which they steal away from the people) to the quenching of all true zeal and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual affection in Gods service, but the Gospel war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants not any such hurtful devices, and our Church doth justly reject them. Nor is here a feast of dainties to satisfie a luxurious appetite, or feed an hungry bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Here's food for the soul indeed represented, and convey'd by these Elements to the worthy receiver, but the most are so ignorant of their concernments, that they never yet found such a thing within them as a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual hunger. What, a soul be hungry? how can that be? Alas, they have so much to do to supply the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of their bodies, that they can't have while to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their souls. No, they may sink or swim, starve and damn for them; for they have other matters to mind which they hold more necessary. Is it not a wonder what we read <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. at the beginning, that when the King had made a Marriage for his Son, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a feast, and sent forth his servants to invite the guests, they should make light of it, and begin to frame excuses, that they had other business to do, and this and that way to go, and therefore could not come? What, not come to a feast, to a sumptuous Marriage-feast? to a feast made for the Kings Son?


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107818:11"/>
And when servants were sent on purpose to invite them to it? Were not these a strange sort of stubborn foolish men that would disobey their own King, sending them such a courteous message as this? Reader, dost thou not condemn them in thy own thoughts? Dost thou not think thou wouldst never have been so silly and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as they, if thou hadst been so sent unto? But for all thy thoughts, its well if thou prove not guilty of the very same fault thy self. For what was the matter, think'st thou, that these people would not come when they were invited? Why alas, there was no such fare made ready as they had a mind to, Be sure had there been but such good chear as would have fill'd their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, they would have made hast enough, and would have invented excuses how to get in, rather than to stay away.</p>
               <p>But this is a Parable, shewing what entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the most do give to the Gospel, whereby we are invited not only to a wedding feast, but to be even married our selves to the Lord Jesus Christ, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Son of the Father: And yet this message, the matchless mercy whereof may astonish men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, I say this message is sleighted: <hi>Men will not come to Christ that they may have life.</hi> Adulterous souls go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other Lovers, and will not be espoused to the Lord of glory: <hi>They see no form nor comeliness in him why they should desire him.</hi> They hear great commendations of him indeed, what an excellent glorious person he is, no less than the Son of God made man, whose love was so great to mankind, that he laid down his life for them: but in the mean time, <hi>What has he?</hi> what's to be got by him? what estates will he settle on them? what honours will he advance them to? what? why they shall through him have their sins pardoned and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, their hearts sanctified, and at length shall be


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107818:12"/>
receiv'd into everlasting glory.— Nay, if this be all, they have no mind to come on; but when their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is desired, they have some excuse or other ready at hand; and either they will not come at all, or else not yet, or not so thorowly and heartily as they are commanded, and in such a wilful refusal of grace do thousands persist and perish. And though I suppose this fore-mentioned Parable doth not directly and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily belong to the Lords Supper, yet it may by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be very well applied thereto: Since here is a Marriage-feast of the Kings Son, here are the great blessings and mercies of the Gospel held forth and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and all who come duly prepar'd and sincerely dispos'd to accept the same, shall be assur'd of them; and hither do Gods Ministers exhort all to come in the appointed regular way. And what's the effect of their Message? <hi>why the most make light of it.</hi> Hither to this holy Table are people call'd to give up themselves to God, to testifie the truth of their sorrow for sin, and to renew their resolutions against it, and so to receive a sealed pardon, and a title to life everlasting; but for their parts they have no such liking to these spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al good things which are so freely tendered them. The truth is, their sins as yet they are loath to leave; for they see no great hurt in them, nay, they think they find much good at present, and do not use to trouble themselves much with the thoughts of that mischief they may hereafter do them, and therefore they have no such high thoughts of Christ for his being able to mortifie and remove their lusts, and so to save them from the misery these would bring them to: They can very hardly be perswaded that there is any such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in an holy life, that they should so speedily and solemnly resolve upon it. And though they can like well enough to go to heaven when they must needs


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107818:12"/>
leave this world, yet they look upon that day so far off, that they are in no great haste of making sure their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happiness, but think it may bee time enough to do that a great while hence. And can any man wonder if those who are no more sensible of any benefit they have by Christ, are very slack and negligent in a thankful remembrance of his death, and of those benefits which thereby we enjoy and hope for, which is the great end of Celebrating this Sacrament? No marvel if such as these alwaies finde one excuse or other, to keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from that which they have no more love to, and the necessity and advantage whereof, they are no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. If there was but any matter of gain to be got by it, any thing which made for the flesh, wee should need no such ado to get them thither: We may be sure, if the King should but proclaim that he would give six pence a piece, to all the poor throughout <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that would repair to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> there would need nothing but the knowledge of it to get them together. Oh what running and crowding and craving would there be: He need not send any Messengers to beseech and perswade them to receive his Charity. But when the Soveraign Majesty of Heaven and Earth by his Heraulds Proclaims to all: <hi>Ho every one that is willing let him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himself, and come hither to receive an earnest of infinite and everlasting treasures,</hi> there are few will accept the offer, as if it was of no value; and as if the Apostle was mistaken, when hee prefers the blood of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such corruptible things as silver and gold. Nay, I'le warrant you, in those Parishes where you shall find so few at a Communion, did but any rich man amongst them make a feast, and invite the whole Town to it, you should finde but few stay at home. But now when God himself calls them to his Table, and there hath provided them food which came from Heaven, true Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107818:13"/>
Manna, even the Body and Blood of Christ which is meat and drink indeed, they finde no great appetite to this Banquet. All the great words they hear of it work not with them: For in all such cases 'tis not other mens words and opinions that we judge by, but our own relish and feeling. And whilst men have got such corrupt dispositions, and carnal affections that they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour onely those things which are grosse and earthly like themselves, What wonder is it if they underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue that which is so unsuitable to them and in which they can feel no more taste than in the white of an Egge. A Swine prefers his own swill before the greatest dainties that can be provided; And a voluptuous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that is wallowing in the mud of fleshly pleasures, would not willingly exchange conditions with the glorious Angels, that alwaies behold the face of God.</p>
               <p>Oh whither is the Soul of man degenerated? Into what a low and sad estate is it faln, that it findes sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in any thing rather than in that which is truly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant? How chearfully and contentedly can people set themselves to any thing rather than to that only work which God hath appointed them, even the working out of their Salvation? From morning to night they can follow their worldly business without complaining, and yet know not how to spend one day in seven, nor one half hour in a day in the service of God, for the saving of their own Souls. Oh what pains do many poor men take only to get a livelihood in the world, and yet think everlasting life worth no regard or care at all. They can bee content to spend their thoughts, and strength, and time upon vanity, to <hi>lay out their money for that which is not bread,</hi> and to labour for the wind; but when God saith, but <hi>give me your hearts,</hi> he is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If this careless generation had but Houses and


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107818:13"/>
Lands, Money and Goods, proffered them on the same terms that Heaven is, how greedily would they lay hold on them? If a rich man should say to them, <hi>Love but this Gold more than the Dirt under your feet, and you shall have it</hi>; Oh how quickly would they purchase it, and never think the condition hard? If the poor man was enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prefer bread bfore a stone, and to desire it more, and then it should be given him, do you think he would ever bee without it? And yet when the blessed God offers them ten thousand times greater mercies upon such terms as these, they refuse them, as if they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to do some great thing, for that which was not worth their labour. What doth God command us, but to love himself more than empty creatures? To value an everlasting Kingdome, before the frail comforts of this short life? And yet we will not do it. He bids us but love our best part, even our Souls, more than these vile bodies; and to take most care for that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves most, as being the more excellent. When hee enjoyns us to fly from sin and embrace holiness, it is as if he should say, Beware of that which will do you the greatest mischief, and close with that which will do you the most good; Accept of Liberty and freedome, and do not lye in Prison and Fetters; bee in Health and not in Sickness; and yet men will not bee perswaded. When God saith, prefer my pleasant service, before the bondage of the Devil, and thou shalt be happy for ever; he doth as it were say, Be but heartily willing to accept of happiness here, and thou shalt have it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, but the most are unwilling. And upon this it is, that not only God, but all the world, yea, themselves, will for ever lay the blame of their destruction, by their resolvedness and willfulness in the waies of sin, they are merciless murderers of their own Souls. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil may tempt, and the world may allure, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

not force them to sin. There is not one of all those millions that perish, who can truly say, that hee was unfeignedly willing to have sav'd himself, but could not. But as for those that perish from amongst Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they have least of all to plead in their own excuse. For they have been exhorted and besought again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to put away their evil-doings, to renounce their lusts and turn to the good waies of God, and yet they would not hearken. What though the Devil entic'd them to wickedness, did not Gods Spirit also move up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts, to have drawn them to holiness? But they who knew not how to <hi>resist the Devil</hi> as they were commanded, could <hi>resist and grieve and offer despight to the Spirit of Grace.</hi> Whilst they knew not how to reject nor get away from a sinful Companion, they could put off their Ministers and godly Friends with flat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials if not with contempt and jeers. What though the flesh was craving for forbidden fruit, unlawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and satisfaction? Yet did not Conscience contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and check it? Why then should flesh which had no reason for its desires be hearkned to, and obeyed, whilst Conscience which is the voice of God, must be slighted and silenced? Tell me whoever thou art, that makest a Trade of sin, and livest in the neglect of thy Duty to God that made thee, and keeps thee alive, not accounting it the business of thy life to serve and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, but goest from one day to another without the serious thoughts of his glorious Majesty and all his wonderful works and mercies, thou who seest no need of hearing or reading Gods Word, of constant Prayer, or receiving Sacraments, that puttest off the thoughts of Death and Judgement, and art careless of making preparations for the same: Tell me I beseech thee, what's the reason, of such a wretched, sinful course as this? Is it because thou knowest no better? Was't thou


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107818:15"/>
never told how thou oughtest to behave thy self? Didst thou never hear who it is puts men upon sin, and what wages they have for it at length? Didst thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read nor hear of a Saviour that came to call men to repentance and holiness, and laid down his life to save all that will be his faithful followers and Servants? It's very strange indeed if thou hast lived in any such dark corner, that thou wert never acquainted with these matters. But it is most likely thou hast heard them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, but all hath been to no purpose. What dost thou not know who made thee, and why thou wast made? There's few Children but can answer such que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions as these, and yet how few men that consider them or that live as if they knew them.</p>
               <p>There are indeed many to be found, especially of the meaner sort, who tell you they cannot read, nor are Book-learned, and therefore they hope God will hold them excused and not require much of them, but yet these people have learning enough to look to their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness in the world, and if they be sick, they'l seek for help, or if they are wronged they'l look out for rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ef. And what have they not learning enough to know, what they must do to be saved? Have they been idle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to learn so much as to read plain English, and do they think this will serve their turn to plead for their ignorance and neglect of Duty, and wilful Rebellions against God? What were they taught or commanded such difficult things, that none but Scholars can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand or do them? They can tell as simple as they are, that the light of the Sun is greater than the light of a Candle; that Gold is better than Brasse, that a King is above a Constable; that its better to have an estate of their own, which they shal enjoy as long as they live, than to be Tenants to another, to be turned out when he will. Do they know these things, and is it any harder


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107818:16"/>
to know that God who made all things, and put that goodness into them which they have, is better than all those things which he made, and therefore should be preferred before all Creatures; That he who is Lord of all should be obeyed above all; that to be like him is better than to be like the Beasts; that a certain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Glory is more worth than short, uncertain comforts here below. Again, these men knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough how to eat and drink, and to take heed of what might hurt their bodies; they could avoid the persons and places that were infected; if the house was on fire they would run out of it, and call neighbours to help to quench it; if they are upon the way, and are told of quicksands and quagmires, they can avoid them. And yet have they not learning enough to do good to their souls, and to take heed of that which will destroy them for ever, and hearken to others that warn them of their danger? They can be diligent enough to please those that do them good turns, and to beware of offending such as can undoe them. And yet do they account it such an hard matter to love and please that God who hath given them all the mercies they ever enjoyed, and to take heed of provoking him to anger <hi>who can kill both body and soul, and cast them into Hell?</hi> Yea, further, let those very people that cannot read, have a paper gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them that tells them how to cure any disease they are troubled with, they can go to a Neighbour, and get him to read it to them, and they can mark it so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently as to follow its directions. Or if they be in any trouble about their estates, they can carry their Deeds and evidences to a Lawyer, and pray him to peruse them, and tell them how the case stands with them. And what could they get no body to read the Bible or some good book to them, that might direct them in the way to salvation? Or could they not have hearkened


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107818:16"/>
carefully to their Minister, whilst he was telling them what they must do? Or might they not have gone to him in private and desired particular instructions for their souls? Nay there are few Families of the poorest, but one or other amongst them can read; and might they not have taken some spare time, and have read together, and discoursed one with another about the state of their souls, and what was to be done in order to everlasting happiness. The plain truth is, there are few but can shew diligence and skill enough in any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trifle that they think does at all concern them; But (as I hinted before) they are so insensible of any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that's to be got by minding the things of Religion, that they disregard them as matters of no worth or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. For I cannot imagine whence this strange and damnable carelesness should come, but that first of all, men forget that they have souls which will never die, but must live for ever in another world either in joy or torment according as they behaved themselves in this: For certainly the sound belief, and frequent so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber consideration of the true nature of the soul, is the great foundation and support of seriousness in Religion, the great design whereof is to help this immortal soul to an happiness suited to its Nature. Wherefore, if the soul it self be forgotten, how can it otherwise bee but God will be forgotten also, and the Duty we owe to him neglected? For though if we were ingenuous, his mercies to our bodies might engage us to love and serve him; and the most carnal men may so far remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber God as to look for health and wealth, and outward comforts from him, yet this cannot bring them to any heartiness in Religion, which consists very much in denying the flesh, and thinking meanly of all things here below; and therefore no man can serve God as he ought, but he who believes that he rewards his diligent


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107818:17"/>
Servants with an everlasting happiness in the fruition of himself: for nothing but the hopes of this can bear out men in those difficulties of suffering and obedience which they may be call'd to. But if men have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their souls neither will they take any heed to please God, nor make it their business to get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hereafter, which is nothing else but a state of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness principally prepared for a reasonable soul in the full enjoyment of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither will they take care to prevent their falling into Hell, which is that state of misery whereinto <hi>they that forget God are turned,</hi> and chiefly appointed for the punishment of the Soul. And hence it will unavoidably follow that they will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the work of redemption, and disregard the Lord Jesus, who wrought this work in behalf of the Sons of men, to recover their souls to God, to purchase the pardon of sin and enable them sincerely to please God, and so to prevent their damnation and bring them to eternal Glory. And if they have no esteem for Christ then needs must they sleight the Word and Sacraments whereby they should be brought to acquaintance with him to be interested in, and related to him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the communications of grace from him.</p>
               <p>Now though there are few that will acknowledge themselves guilty of such ignorance of themselves, such contempt of God and glory, and of Christ the way thereto, yet their actions do to plainly shew it. For certainly if they had any true knowledge of their own souls, they could not but take more pains to save them than they do, even out of love to themselves; when as now they never in all their l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107818:17"/>
they stand related to God, whether as friends or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and whether they must go when they depart out of this life. And tell me then do these people indeed remember to any purpose that they have souls that must either be saved or damned for ever? What though they may sometimes hear Sermons, or read the Bible, yet do they use when they come home, or when they have laid aside their Books, soberly to think of what they have read or heard? Do they consider how it concerns them? Do they examine themselves by the Word, and apply it home to their own consciences and guide their lives by it? Do they regard it as that by which they must shortly be judged? And though they may sometimes put up a prayer to God; yet do they perform this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as seeing any need of it, taking any delight in it, or as expecting any good from it? Do they before hand think what they stand in need of, and so pray to God for a supply of their wants, not onely of their Bodies but Souls, in as good earnest as they can ask their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for any thing they lack. And in the very act of praying, have they any awe and sense of God upon their Spirits, as they would have if they were putting up a Petition to a Prince or Judge? And do they minde w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at they have been about when they come from the Duty? Do they carefully wait for an answer of their Prayers, and patiently expect those blessings which they desired from God, such as strength against sin, and grace to serve him? And do they do what is in their Power to procure what they pray for? Thus you may be sure it would be with them if they were in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in their Prayers. For when they go to any great man to request a favour from him, they attend what answer he makes, and their thoughts are much upon it, and they are deeply concerned for the successe of their request. Though they have been Baptized into the


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107818:18"/>
Name of Christ, yet do they ever use to think what they are thereby engaged to, and see to answer that engagement? And suppose they do sometimes come to the Communion, yet did they ever come to it with such a kinde of Spiritual appetite and expectation of strength and benefit as they go to an ordinary meal? Or are they careful before hand to fit themselves for the Duty so as to profit by it? What-ever they may pretend, it is most manifest that Religion is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them, for the great work of their lives. They are far from spending their time, and busying their mindes like men that were sent into the world on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to serve God, which they can say is the reason why God made them. It is not their chief study and work so to know and please their Maker, and to get their Peace made with him through the Lord Jesus, that they may live with him hereafter in Glory for ever. No, no, to the Consciences of these men I dare appeal, this is the least matter of a thousand with them, and there's scarce any thing which they lesse regard. They hear their Minister about these things as if he was tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them a story of no concernment, or spoke in a strange Language, which they understood not. Was he but telling them the way to thrive in the world, and get store of riches, they would hear him more attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and remember better what he said to them, and not think they had done enough when they had stood in the Church for an hour as now they do. He that hath made any trial may easily see that this sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do not give the same heed to one that discourseth to them about the matters of their own souls, as they do to him that speaks of earthly things. If you talk with a Citizen about his trade, or with a Country-man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Corn, or Cattel, or the weather, or any the like subjects, they can hold discourse with you well


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107818:18"/>
enough, but if you come to speak of the unseen King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the way thereto; What need we have to search into our souls to see that we have got, a good sound Title to that Glory; If you do but tell them of the shorness and uncertainty of life, exhorting them therefore to get well prepared for death and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; How strange is such language as this to the ears of many? Some laugh at it as babling; others give you a bare hearing, but are little affected with the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest matters delivered in the most piercing words that a man knows how to speak. Nay many times they'l be taken up with other things so much as not to minde or understand what is said to them, nor do they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards remember it, but are as much moved with the barking of a Dog, or blowing of the winde, as with the most serious affectionate exhortations you can give them. And indeed how can men take any great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to hear of things that are not in their own ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but as it were, out of their reach? Would not the plain Country-man be ready to laugh and wonder at a Scholar that should talk to him in Latin, or make him tedious discourses of any point in Philosophy though he spoke in plain English? What's all this to him? He understands it not; or if he did, he may think, what should he be the better for it. And does not the Word of God tell us that <hi>the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit, but they seem foolishness to him, because they are Spiritually discerned.</hi> The Doctrine of Regeneration by the Spirit, to those that never felt it, is still as strange as it was to <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> And except we have before-hand got some inward apprehension of the things that we hear of, all talk of them is but as an empty sound, that signifies nothing. Wherefore no marvel, if they who think so seldome, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand so little of God, and Christ, and a work of grace,


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107818:19"/>
to be wrought on their hearts, are no more affected nor stirred when they hear of them. And whilst they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no profit they should get by these things, what should they hearken to them for? They cannot by all you say, get one penny more in their purse, nor a meals meat, nor a suit of cloaths; and these are the most desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enjoyments they are acquainted with. And it's no great wonder when we consider the education of the common sort, if they be of such a wretched temper. For perhaps they were born and brought up by Parents like themselves that knew not how to acquaint them what they were made for, in any such manner as was likely to do them good; and it may be never so much as se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I know all this while in every state and time through which they pass, the most have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for learn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng their duty, if they had any heart to it: but their mindes are still possessed with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else.</p>
               <p>And though they may be somewhat constant in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Church, yet this being a thing they have always


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107818:19"/>
been wont to before they knew what they did, they still hold on in a customary manner, without duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering what they come thither for; not thinking that the Minister speaks to them and about matters that are for life or death: the discourses also which they hear being upon particular subjects they are like to profit the lesse by them, in that they have not such a sound and clear knowledge of the chief points of Religion, as may enable them to understand and profit by Sermons. And though from Children they may some of them be able to repeat their Creed, and Commandments, and Lords Prayer, yet truly its very easie to say these over a thousand times without being much affected with them, or well understanding them, onely pattering them over by rote: especially if they never had these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples clearly laid open and explained to them. It may be also many of these never had any particular close counsel given them, tending to awaken them to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of their condition to convince them of their sin and misery by nature, and put them upon searching in good earnest after the way to escape damnation, and be truly happy for ever. Or if they have been so exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet they will not be brought to think of these things soundly by themselves, and to seek to God by prayer for direction and assistance. It is no easie nor trifling matter for a man wholly to change his thoughts, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, affections, and manner of life, as all must doe that turn from sin to true godlinesse. Such a change as this is not likely to be wrought without much conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and sober setled resolutions on mans part, to which the grace of God would not be wanting to make them effectuall. I know it is also the grace of God that puts upon them, but yet it is Man himself that by the assistance of this grace must thus Consider, and thus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve. But now when should people set upon this work


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107818:20"/>
of considering what they should doe to be saved? Something or other still happens in the way that keeps them from the work, or takes them off before it comes to any good issue. Either they are sleeping or working, eating or drinking, or playing and idling, dressing or undressing; or have some whether to go, or somebody to speak to; or in some company that they cannot leave; or have some businesse in their heads which they are contriving, or else are in sicknesse that unfits them for action, or some trouble hath befaln them which puts their minds out of order, or some happinesse and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity which puffs them up with a foolish flashy joy; or they have some brave things in expectation which they are musing on, and pleasing themselves with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand. Some such matters as these, I dare say, fill the heads and hearts of most from one years end to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther throughout their whole lives. These and such like are the things that come into their minds as soon as they are awake, and then presently they are set about one thing or other, or light into some company that takes them up for that day, and the like happens to morrow and the next day; and whilst the present time never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears convenient for the solemn performance of this great work of Repentance, it is by the most posted off till it is too late, and then in vain doe they repent to all <hi>Eternity</hi> that they did not repent in <hi>Time.</hi> Now it could not be that they should never have a spare day or hour for the consideration of, and setting upon the work they were sent into the world for, but that they are guided in the course of their lives by this practicall deep-rooted opinion, that their onely businesse hereis to make this life as comfortable as they can; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that to get food and raiment and riches for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their children, to enjoy pleasures and be well accounted of in the world are the best things which can


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107818:20"/>
be imagined; whereupon they wholly bend themselves to the attainment of these things; and on they go in a giddy heedlesse manner, never well examining whether this <hi>their way be not their folly,</hi> nor taking much notice what the principles and opinions are which have the greatest power upon their lives, and whence their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons flow; which principles may be so wrought into their natures, that they shall lead and rule them whilst they are secret and not distinctly known and weighed. And indeed this conceit, that the good things of this life are most to be set by and sought after, hath its first rise from our corrupted natures, which being faln off from God and contrary to him, incline us to seek happinesse any where rather than in returning to his love. And then in Childhood, and for some years after we have very weak apprehensions of any thing but what's before us, being wholly rul'd by our senses. And when our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mistakes have once taken root, and are become naturall to us, its one of the hardest things in the world to be freed from them: for we are prone to be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of our own ways, that we are by no means wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be contradicted, much lesse to call our selves fools for all we have done, and begin the world anew, as if we had never set one step forward in the right way. And it must needs be the more difficult to convince men of the folly and basenesse of such a carnall worldly life, because they observe it to be the custome of the most about them, high and low, even of such as are counted wise and judicious, worshipfull and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble persons. And what, may they think, can they be so foully mistaken, who did but follow the course which they saw such men lead before them? And this indeed is one great cause of the mistakes and destruction of men, that when they come into the world they chuse rather to follow the examples of their neighbours than


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107818:21"/>
the rules of right reason which they should gather from Gods holy word, and a due examination of things; and therefore they take to those actions, and that manner of life which they see others follow, without well think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether they doe wisely or not: just as if a man should see a company of people upon the way running as for their lives, pretending that they are in pursuit of some great matters, and thereupon should presently set in with them, and run along as fast as they, without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiring what they look for; till at length when they are all tired, he perceives they had no other design but perhaps to catch flies, which when they have they know not what to doe with, or to lay hold on some pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bird which they could not overtake: even thus when a man sees those about him running and riding, striving and swea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing to get houses and lands, and all outward enjoyments, he thinks it needlesse to enquire whether these things be worthy all their labour; no, that's taken for granted: for sure, may he think, these men are no fools, but know well enough what they doe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without deliberation upon the matter, he joyns with the rest in labouring and contriving for these worldly things, taking all the pleasure in them that they will possibly yield. And whatever help is afforded them for the carrying on of this design, they will readily and thankfully comply with. If you supply them with what they were seeking for, they will greedily receive it, or if you will give them sure directions how to get it, they will hearken to you and diligently follow your advice. But whatever is presented that no way conduceth to these their carnall ends, that which makes them no richer nor higher in the world, nor gives their senses any delight is like to be altogether sleighted by them. What mean thoughts therefore must they needs have of Sermons, Sacraments, and all spirituall advantages


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107818:21"/>
which are onely means for the getting of an happinesse quite of another nature from that they are seekin after?</p>
               <p>I hope this large preface (which indeed I did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign) will not be altogether uselesse, nor seem imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; since they who so little care for hearing or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods word, for prayer or receiving Sacraments, who are listlesse to all duties, and feel no sweetnesse in them, all such may hence learn what is the root and ground of this distemper, what it is that makes them out of tast with these rich and savoury provisions which all healthfull souls doe so dearly love, even because their secret, but most powerfull, thoughts are, that they have nothing better than their Bodies to provide for, and that to doe this is the chiefest businesse they have, and that nothing is of any great use which makes not for this end. But it would be quite otherwise with them if they were indeed clearly convinced, and soundly perswaded that they have souls which will never die, and that these are their best part, and deserve most care, and are as much to be preferred before the body as a man before the horse which he rides on; and that these their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall souls can onely be made happy by the favour of God, out of which they are faln by sinning against him, and that the great work of this life is to get all breaches made up betwixt God and them, that so when they leave this world, they may be restored to perfect happinesse in the enjoyment of God; and that they can no way be thus reconciled to God but by Jesus Christ, by whose merits and mediation their sins may be pardoned, and by whose holy Spirit (which is given by the Father through him) they can onely be so changed and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that they may be made meet for the inheritance of the Saints in the heavenly light of Gods presence and love. Was the sound belief of these plain, great and


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107818:22"/>
commonly acknowledged truths but well rooted in the hearts of men, so as to overpower and change their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, we should soon perceive them to be other kind of persons in all their behaviour. If they took it for the business of their lives to work out their salvation, being convinced that they had nothing in the world to doe but this, and what is in order to it, then would they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently labour after a saving knowledge of a crucified Christ, which comprehends in it the whole of religion. And then they would highly prize and diligently attend upon those means which Christ hath appointed for the manifesting himself, and conveying his saving benefits to the soul. They would take care to be found in those ways wherein Christ is like to be found. Whatever had relation to him would be very much esteemed by them; and they would never be at quiet till they had done their best to make it sure that they had got an interest in him, and through him a title to the Fathers everlasting love. They would then rightly inform themselves what's required, of all that must be saved by Christ, and these conditions they would endeavour to come up to, and perform. They would be willing to enter into the most solemn Covenant with him, to take him for their Saviour in all his Offices, by him to be brought to that glory which God hath prepared for true Believers: and the keeping of this Covenant would be their study and care through the whole course of their life. Now though considering these things, it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a very fit method for the curing of mens mistakes, and direct them in the way to blessedness, first to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present and demonstrate to them that they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal souls, and that the love of God is their onely portion, and that this can no way be obtained but by the Lord Jesus, and then to shew what is required to make us partakers of happinesse by him; yet since these


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107818:22"/>
things are in some sort known, and readily confest by the most, I shall at present wave this method, and chuse rather to drive at the last of these, which will be found to contain all, namely to direct and exhort poor souls to enter into Covenant, and make a thorow closure with Jesus Christ, that through him their sins may be subdued and pardoned, their persons and natures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd to God, that they may be blessed for ever in communion with him. And even this is my chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in laying down the following Directions to a due preparation for, and a right receiving of the Lords Supper, and in giving Motives to the serious and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent performance of that duty, which I look upon principally as a solemnizing and ratifying our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God by Jesus Christ, and the sincerity of the heart in making this Covenant, and our faithfulnesse in keeping it, is the very heart and scope of Christianity. For my intention in treating of this subject is not meerly to perswade people to come to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (alas what a poor thing is that to be rested in!) but to instruct them for a right coming to, and hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Christ himself, then to come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there to make and renew their Covenant with him in a more formall and expresse manner, the more to affect, and deeplier to engage themselves. For this being a sensible and solemn thing, will be apt to make the stronger impression upon mens spirits; and perhaps they will be sooner perswaded to this work because it is so much fitted to sense it self. But the great danger is least they should rush upon that which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not the reason of; and think they have done enough by bare receiving the Sacrament, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering to what purpose they doe it: which would be greater madnesse, and of worse consequence than for a man to run and lay his hands upon the book and kisse


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107818:23"/>
it, and use the like ceremonies of an oath, and never mind what he swears to, nor afterwards think what he hath done, though it was about a matter of life and death. And therefore I shall endeavour by Gods as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to prevent this miscarriage by shewing what is the nature and design of this Ordinance, in a right par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation whereof consists so much of religion: since hereby a man professeth and engageth himself to be a sincere obedient Christian, which may be understood by this comparison before I come to speak to it more fully, that more ignorant Reader may the sooner have the notion fixt on his mind. It is much what, as if the Governour of a City after there had been a sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous insurrection of the Citizens, should offer pardon to all that would acknowledge their fault, beg his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and return to their former subjection and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble behaviour; and moreover should enjoyn all that were thus affected to come take a piece of money which he would give abroad, or to partake of a feast which he would make on purpose for the entertainment of such; now would it not be madnesse, and grosse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, and dissembling for any to receive this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or go sit at this Table, who were resolved yet to continue their rebellion, and would imploy that very money, and the strength they received from his meat against him that gave them, whenas hereby they were to testifie their resolutions to be faithfull and obedient?

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107818:23"/>
are visibly entred amongst the number of professing Christians, and afterwards they who were baptized in infancy are to come to this Sacramental Feast, and there to joyn with their fellow-believers in a personall profession of their willingness and resolution to stand to that Covenant whereinto they were engaged by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme, in testimony whereof they eat the Bread and drink the Wine, whereby the Body and Blood of Christ is represented, as I shall further shew anon. Now would it not in like manner be a strange piece of folly and monstrous hypocrisie for any man to rest satisfied with his having been baptized, or his receiving the Lords Supper, and think himself therefore a Christian good enough without taking care to perform those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises which he then made, but rather encourage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in sin by the consideration of what he had done, as if he might the more safely rebell against God; because he had expresly vowed against all such rebellion. Could there be a more desperate, dangerous wickedness than to make such a wilfull mistake? And yet I wish there be not thousands guilty of it. Alas, alas! how few that have taken the earnest-peny, and wear Christs Colours, that ever think to any purpose what they are hereby bound to? How many in effect renounce their Baptisme by their ungodly lives, and either neglect the Lords Supper, or come to it to pacifie their Consciences that they may sin the more freely, rather than to strengthen and engage themselves against every sin? As for Bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>AND being desirous to contribute some assistance to those that need it, to bring them (through Gods blessing) to a conscientious performance of this great duty, I observe there are two sorts of persons faulty herein; either such as neglect it, or that miscarry and fail in the manner of doing it. Those that neglect it are either such that doe it out of meer wilfulness, as the grossely vicious, that will not come to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment because they think this would lay an obligation upon them to forsake those sins which they never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to part with whatever come on't, and the stupid sensless ones, that know not the worth, nor see the need of this Ordinance, or any other duties of Religion, who live as heathenishly as if they had never heard of God and Christ, and another world, nor doe they care to be instructed in these points, as if they were not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them; or else they are such that abstain from it out of doubting and fear, not thinking themselves worthy, or not knowing whether they are worthy or not. Of this sort there are many excellent Christians, who too much indulge to their own melancholy and despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent apprehensions; and also many weaker, but, I hope, honest well-meaning people, who seem to have a great esteem for this Sacrament; but having always heard what a dangerous thing it is to receive it unworthily, dare not venture upon it, not being well acquainted w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th the nature and reason of it, and being doubtful


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107818:24"/>
whether they are fit to come or not, being also, I fear, too languid and heartless in desiring after it, or in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king preparation for it, and for such as these principally doe I intend my Directions. By those that are guilty of miscarriage in the doing of this duty, I mean such as rush upon it ignorantly and rashly, not well weighing what they doe, and who, notwithstanding their custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary attendance at the Lords Table, continue their old sinfull course of life. These also, I hope, may receive some benefit from the following Discourse, together with the most profane and ignorant, whilst I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour plainly to shew the intention of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perswade them to attend thereupon in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular manner. For since, in behalf of those for whom especially I write this, my great business is to shew who it is that is worthy to partake of this Ordinance, and wherein this worthiness doth consist; the method I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ake shall be this, namely to shew for what purpose it was appointed by Jesus Christ, and thence to discover those qualifications and graces which are required in the Communicants, that they may receive it aright to those purposes for which it was appointed: and after I have done this I shall lay down some arguments or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to quicken all to come to, and celebrate it in this due manner, and then briefly direct those that intend to come. As to the first what was the reason and end why this Sacrament was appointed, I know not whence we should be better informed than by looking back to the time of its first appointment, and to see what Christ tells us he did ordain it for, and this we may find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly set down, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. when he had broke the Bread and distributed, he addes, <hi>This doe in remembrance of me.</hi> And the same words he used also after the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Wine, as appears by the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s relation, <hi>who delivered unto them what he had received of


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107818:25"/>
the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25. where after the giving of the Cup is added, <hi>This doe ye, as oft as ye drink it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me,</hi> and so again <hi>ver.</hi> 26. saith the Apostle, <hi>As often as ye eat th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Bread, and drink this Cup, ye doe shew the Lords Death till he come,</hi> that is, you publish and represent it to the world, you acknowledge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate it. So that by this it is plain that the great end of this Sacrament to which all others may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced is, <hi>that by the celebrating thereof we may remember Jesus Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st, and especially that we may keep up the memory of that inestimable mercy to mankind, his dying for us</hi>; a mercy which <hi>should</hi> never be forgotten by those on earth, and <hi>shall</hi> never be forgotten by those in heaven. Now hence it follows, that they who are in a capacity and fitness rightly to remember Christ and his Death, are worthy to partake of this Sacrament which was set apart for that purpose: wherefore without going any farther I shall shew what is necessarily required to, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in, or immediately flows from this remembrance of Christ, that so we may the more distinctly apprehend w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> findest in thee these qualifications or not; whether thou findest those graces wrought in thy heart, which may enable thee so to remember thy Redeemer as may be acceptable to him; that so if thou findest thy self such a one as is described<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou maist give God the praise, and take to thy self the comfort of so great a mercy, and be encouraged to proceed in this and all other holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but if thou findest the contrary, that thou maist

with all speed and earnestness see to get thy heart chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and thy wants supplied. And to this end (since I intend no other Application) I shall under every Head endeavour to help thee in thy enquiry into the state of thy soul, and in thy seeking after those graces which thou maist be convinced thou art destitute of, and hast hitherto been content without them; and in this part I shall be the larger, as taking it to be most necessary, though having so large a field before me I shall labour to confine my self.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First then in order to a right remembrance of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, there is necessarily supposed <hi>a knowledge of him</hi>: for our memory contains onely those persons or things which we before have known. How could he keep the <hi>Fifth of November</hi> as a Thanksgiving for our deliverance from the Popish Powder plot, who hath not some knowledge beforehand that such a Plot there was laid by the <hi>Papists,</hi> and that by divine providence we were delivered from it? No more can any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Christ as he ought at the Sacrament, except he knows who this Christ is, in his Person, and Natures, and what his Offices are, what he came into the world for, what he hath done and will doe for us. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this right knowledge of Christ necessarily requires and contains a knowledge of all the chief points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; of which I hope thou art not ignorant who ownest the name of a Christian. It's a shame for thee if thou art, having such means and opportunities to inform thy self as thou enjoyest: having liberty to read thy Bible, plain Catechismes, and other good Books, and to hear Gods Word publickly Preacht. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all which advantages I doubt there are many to be found, who are very dark, even in the first principles of Christianity, as not accounting it any part of their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to trouble their heads with such matters. And that


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107818:26"/>
which a man makes no great reckoning of, nor thinks himself much concerned in, though he may hear it an hundred times over, he'l scarce have so clear an insight into it as he that hath heard it but once or twice with diligence and attention, applying his mind to it, as to a matter that is for his life. He that hears a Physician di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting him to a medicine that will recover him from some desperate disease, is far likelier (if he have the use of his reason) to take notice of, and fix in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So surely if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thought it any great matter to save their souls for ever, they would soon see to get acquainted wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lp of such I shall run over those Heads of Religion, which more especially are required to enable us a right to remember Christ at this Commemoration-Feast, which he hath establisht in his Church.

                  <hi>conceived in sin, and brought forth in iniquity</hi>: for <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> and beside that corruption of nature which did cleave to their Children, the guilt of their sin might also most justly be imputed to them, they being as common persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting all mankind, who had stood with them if they had stood, and fell with them when they fell. But their Children as they grew up became guilty of actuall sins in their own persons, to which their wicked natures did incline them, which did more expose them to the wrath of God. This condition was the world brought into by sin, become ignorant of God, prone to all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse, and deserving the greatest misery, even ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting torment; and in this estate God might justly have left us, he might have <hi>given us up to our own hearts lusts,</hi> and so one by one as we came into the world and rebell'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, might have destroy'd us for ever without any remedy. Yet he did not thus, but was pleased out of his own infinite wisdome to provide for us a Saviour when we had thus un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>one but could not help our selves. And who was this Saviour but his own eternal onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, very God of very God, who in fulnesse of time became Man, and by the power of the Holy Ghost was conceived in the womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and born of her without the least stain of sin, and was God and Man in a wonderfull manner united in one person. This was that Jesus Christ of whom we read in the Gospel, who after he had some time preacht his Gospel to the <hi>Jews,</hi> laid down his life as a Sacrifice to make satisfaction for the sins of the world, and rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain on the third day, and after fourty days continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on earth he ascended into heaven, and there is exalted to sit at the right hand of God in that humane nature which he assumed, and there he lives for ever to make intercession for us, that the benefits he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107818:27"/>
may be given out to the sons of men. And these benefits are such that shew him to be a perfect Saviour every way fitted to our necessities. For by his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this work of our Redemption, he did as it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve the world, and kept us from being suddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by divine justice, which otherwise would have laid hold on us, and did obtain for us that we should be tried once again for our lives, so that our first fall should not be our damnation, if we would accept of that way of Salvation which he had procured for, and revealed to us. Now since our first happinesse did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in our being like to God, being righteous and holy and obedient to him, that it might appear that Christ consulted for his Fathers honour, as well as our interest; the way to salvation which he appointed was this, That we should love God above all, and count it our greatest happinesse to be reconcil'd to him, that we should humbly acknowledge and repent of all our sins, of nature and practice whereby we had provoked his anger against us, and be sincerely willing to live in obedience to his Laws, and that we should own him the Lord Jesus as our onely Redeemer, and depend upon him onely for ability to perform these conditions, and to obtain the pardon of sin and the favour of God upon performance of them. And then that we might have this ability who by the fall were become weak and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for good, but strongly bent to evil; Christ by his death obtained of the Father, that the Holy Ghost, the third person of the Trinity, should be employ'd to bring men to the performance of those conditions which Christ required of all whom he would save: And accordingly the Holy Ghost, in pursuance of this work, did inspire the Apostles and their fellowers to write and preach the Gospel, and sealed to the truth of it with miracles, for the conviction of all that should hear it.


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107818:27"/>
And in some places in all ages hath enabled men to make it known; and moreover this Holy Spirit doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Word to the hearts of the Hearers, and where he is received doth enlighten the mind, and soften the heart, and heal, and change, and sanctifie the nature of man, and restores him to the image of his Maker, and begets in him a strong love to God and a willingnesse to please him in all things, and brings him to an hearty sorrow for, and an hatred of all his sins, and enclines and enables him to come to Christ, to believe in him, to love and highly to esteem him for this work of Redemption which he hath wrought, ascribing it wholly to his merit that he hath hopes of mercy from God and any power to please him. And then for all those who by this assistance of the Spirit are made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thus to come to Christ and to God by him, for these Christ hath purchast that their sins should be forgiven them, and greater measures of the Spirit bestowed on them; in a word, that they should have all things good for them here, and be received into everlasting glory hereafter. But all they who reject these offers of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and salvation, shall die in their sins, and be everlastingly in torment with the Devil and his Angels. And this same Jesus Christ will be the Judge of all men, and at the end of the world shall come with great glory and power, and raise up the bodies of all that were dead and change those that are alive, and shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and cause to be executed the sentence of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and glorification upon the righteous, and the sentence of condemnation upon the wicked. This is that Jesus the Redeemer of the faln world, whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory ought to be so precious to you. And these were the weighty causes, and the glorious effects of that death which you shew forth, and keep up the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of, in celebrating the Sacrament. I suppose it


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107818:28"/>
needlesse to turn you to the particular Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture proving these things, they being so common and well known; and the truth of them so plain that they cannot well be doubted of by any that own the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion. And I hope they are neither so many nor so difficult, that you should pretend you want time, or learning, or wit to get well acquainted with them. I dare say you could learn other kind of matters than these, if you could get any worldly advantage by it. If Books were Printed that should teach you how to be rich and honourable, to live in ease and pleasure to enjoy health, long life, and all kind of prosperity, you would pore sufficiently upon such Books, and beat your brains day and night, but you would get to understand and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them. But if indeed you have so little regard to your souls, that you will perish for lack of knowing those things which might easily be known, your damnation is just. And as for you that think the most sottish igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is excusable because you are no Schollars, and yet take your selves for as good Christians as the best, let me tell you plainly, if you be without the knowledge of these principal Heads of Religion, you are not fit to be so much, as called Christians. Are you Disciples of Christ that are so blockish and stupid that you have not yet learnt the first principles which he teacheth his Schollars? Nay if you refuse to learn them, you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by renounce Jesus Christ, to wit, as he is your Prophet and Teacher; which if you doe, expect not salvation from him. And as without being acquainted with these fundamentall truths you are able to perform no duty aright; so especially not this of receiving the Lords Supper: for, I say, can he remember Christ as he should that knows not who he is, what he has done for him, or what need he stands in of him? And they who being in this wilfull blindnesse venture upon this Ordinance,


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107818:28"/>
must needs doe it to their own hurt, coming to it as a common meal, or meerly for custome and fashion sake; and so are guilty of the very same miscarriage which the Apostle represents as so dangerous, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. <hi>They eat the Bread and drink the Wine, not discerning the Lords Body,</hi> not having that knowledge of Christ who is there represented, whereby they might be enabled to give him that reverence and honour which is required of all that are admitted to these mysteries.</p>
               <p>I need not sure spend time in examining the Reader whether he know these truths before laid down or not. If thou hast the use of thy reason thou canst tell, I hope, what it is thou knowest, and what thou doest not, wherefore take thy self to task, and go over the severall points of Religion, as I have before briefly mentioned them, if thou thinkst fit, and take account of thy own apprehension and understanding, and where thou findst thou art most wanting, be diligent to inform and satisfie thy self: and to this purpose make conscience of hearing the word Preacht, and of reading the holy Scriptures in private. And get well acquainted with the grounds of Religion, as you may find them in Catechismes, or the pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inest Books that treat of them. But think it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be able to say the bare words, to repeat your Creed without book, or the like, but labour well to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them, and fix them deeply upon your minds, as those things which are of greatest necessity to be known and remembred of any in the world. But yet barely to know and remember them will not profit you, except you so digest and improve them, that they move your affections, and guide you in your conversation. Its a most lamentable mistake to think that the meer saying of what you believe, and what you are to doe, will save your souls: as if there was some strange force in the very words, which would make them usefull to all that


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107818:29"/>
should patter them over: for by this means a <hi>Parrot</hi> might passe for a good Christian. If you had a Receipt given you directing you how to cure the Toothache, doe you think it would take away the pain to get it without book, and say it over by rote? would you not rather see to read it and make use of the medicine which it should appoint? Even thus must you read Gods Word and good Books, to know what is your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that you may set with all your might to the doing of it. And indeed your knowledge is defective till it come thus to affect your heart: wherefore let that be the mark by which you may judge of its truth and sincerity, if it raise your affections and leads you forth to action, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.3, 4. For if you know that God hath in himself all fulnesse of goodnesse, and know that you are needy and indigent, and can onely receive supply and satisfaction from him, you cannot but desire after him, and seek how to get a part in his love. If you know that you are in your selves lost undone creatures, and that Jesus Christ and he alone, is able and willing also to recover and save you, you will then betake your selves to him for healing and saving mercy. If you know that sin is your disease, bondage and dishonour, and holinesse your glory, liberty and health, you will readily comply with the Spirit of God to be freed from sin, and to be made as holy as your nature is capable. This then is true and saving knowledge which must be in all that can affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately remember Christ at the Communion. Of this knowledge Christ speaks, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17, 3. <hi>This is life eternal to know thee, the onely true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi> And of this the Prophet speaks, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.11, <hi>By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justifie many,</hi> that is, he shall justifie those who have such a sound and working knowledge of him as leads them to the performance of what he requires of them. For if


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107818:29"/>
men once come indeed to know that Christ is the Son of God, who earnestly desires their good, and enjoyns them nothing but what makes thereto, surely they will readily then hearken to and obey him. All this I adde to <hi>knowledge,</hi> because it is very imperfect till it become thus fruitfull; and will not vindicate those in whom it is, from the imputation of ignorance.</p>
               <p>Now to get your knowledge to be thus powerfull up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your hearts and lives, I cannot advise you to any more necessary course than these two, 1. <hi>Humbly to beg of God to work the truth with power upon your souls,</hi> that you may <hi>receive it in the love thereof.</hi> When you go to hear or sit down to read, beseech God to accompany the Word by his mighty Spirit that it may sink into your minds and not become unprofitable; but that it may enlighten and awaken you, and reach to the very inwards of your souls, and give you such insight into your selves, and such a discovery of your duty, that you may vigorously be carried on to the performance of it. And then 2. <hi>You must often consider of those truths that you know</hi>; you must dwell upon them in your minds till you are moulded, changed and wrought upon by them. For want of this Consideration chiefly it is, that so many remain in ignorance: and that many others who have some sleight knowledge are no more bettered by it: for you must meditate upon what you read or hear, that you may more clearly and distinctly understand it, which you cannot doe if words slip out of your thoughts as soon as they are out of your ears. And then after the doctrines of the Gospel are well understood, you must farther consider wherein they concern your particular case, and what use you are to make of them: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise how is it possible they should profit you? Though you have never so much book-learning, and brain-knowledge, what are you the better for all, if you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107818:30"/>
it not your own good, by this serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Can you think ever to have a profitable saving knowledge of Christ, if you use not seriously to think of him, what need you stand in of him, and what benefit he will be to you, and what must be done to make him yours; Can you get your sins mortified and pardoned, if you will not so much as bethink your self what an evil thing sin is, and what your particular sins are? Can you be move with the hopes of glory if you have it not in your thoughts? Can you escape your danger if you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, and so are out of fear? If then you would ever have any profit by your knowledge, follow the Apostles advice to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Consider what is said</hi> to thee at at any time, and that's the next way to obtain from the Lord <hi>understanding in all things</hi>; so likewise 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Meditate on these things, give thy self whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all.</hi> If you have not time to spare purposely for meditation, yet take time as you are upon the way, or about any businesse which will permit you. And let this be the chief sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your thoughts, which I am sure deserves them most, even <hi>how you should doe to obtain salvation by Jesus Christ</hi>; and never leave following on this enquiry, till you be fully resolved, to set about what's required of you to that purpose.</p>
               <p>As there must be this sound knowledge of Christ and of the chief points of Christian Religion in all that can duely remember Christ at a Sacrament, so it will be readily granted, that this Jesus Christ must be believed to be indeed the Saviour of the world as is declared in the Scriptures: and all that is there laid down of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, Life, Death Resurrection, Ascension Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession and coming again to Judgement must be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be true. I will not make a distinct Head of this, because its necessarily supposed in the former as I have


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107818:30"/>
explained it: for our knowledge of these truths is never like to be effectuall with us, if we are not first of all perswaded that they are truths. And the Reader might be offended if I should make any question whether he believes the Christian Religion, and takes Scripture to be the word of God, and acknowledges that Christ is the Son of God, and the promised Messiah of whom the Prophets all along in the old Testament foretold. But though there are few who openly deny or seem to doubt of these things, yet I fear there is a great defect, and too common even in this part of Faith which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in an assent to the truth of the Gospel. For many there are who take little pains to settle their belief up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sure foundations, which would bear a shaking if any assault should be made; and can give little reason why they are of this Religion or opinion rather than any other, except because this is that they learn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of their parents, and is profest by their neighbours, and set up and countenanced by the Laws of the Land: and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly these are but weak arguments. But here let me adde as before, that granting you doe believe all that the Gospel reveals, yet this is not enough except your belief prevail with you to doe what the Gospel requires in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to your salvation. And this is indeed the surest way to get your Faith well strengthned and confirmed even by yielding obedience to the truth, and trying by your own experience, what benefit comes by conforming your selves to the will of God revealed in his Gospel, whether you can find the promises made to such obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ones in any measure fulfilled to you; and when you have found this, you will say with the Apostle, <hi>You are not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, because you have</hi> begun <hi>to find it to be the power of God to salvation.</hi> Our Lord himselfe tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.17. <hi>That if any man will doe his will, he shall know of his doctrine whether it be of God or


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107818:31"/>
not:</hi> This is like a mans tasting of Honey, which will give him more assurance of its sweetnesse than all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could doe: and this will make him confidently to affirm it, though the cunning'st Sophister should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by subtle arguments to perswade him to the contrary; his experience will confute them all. This is the reason why great Wits and profound Schollars some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turn Atheists and Infidels; whilst the honest weak Christian that hath relisht and well digested the truths of Religion, holds them so firmly in his heart, rather than brain, that he can die for that which he cannot so well dispute for. Thus far then I hope you see its manifest, that to your right remembrance of Christ, &amp; so to make you worthy Communicants, its necessary that you know who this Christ is, and what you have to doe with him, and to believe that he is indeed the Redeemer of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and that all that Scripture speaks of him is true.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>II.</hi> A right remembring Sin, the occasion of his death. Of Repentance, with Considerations to work and promote it.</head>
               <p>IT may as easily be understood, that if at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you keep up a Remembrance of Christ, and in an especiall manner <hi>shew forth his death till he come,</hi> then you must needs Remember what was the occasion of his dying, and that was the sins of the world. Had there been no Sin we had needed no Saviour. Had we continued in our first estate, we had needed no Restorer, Now hence it will naturally follow, that no man can duely celebrate the Sacrament, <hi>whose eyes have not been opened to see the exceeding great evil that is in sin, and to be convinced of his own sins so as to lament and hate, and


<pb facs="tcp:107818:31"/>


                     <pb facs="tcp:107818:32"/>


                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:107818:32"/>
resolve against them.</hi> For is it possible for that man to to Remember Christs Death as he ought, that sees no hurt in that which put him to death? Nay, that loves the very Nails and Spear that were thrust into his hands and feet and sides, and intends to <hi>crucifie him afresh</hi> when he is gone away? And all this doth he that never yet saw the odiousnesse of Sin, and that is not heartily set against it, but secretly retains and cherishes it. Can he rightly Remember Christs death, who sees no great need he stood in of it, nor is sensible of any great advantage that comes to him by it, but rather thinks Christ might have kept his bloud to himself, and that it would be a disadvantage to him to attain the ends and benefits of his bloodshed? And such wretched blasphemous thoughts in effect hath he that sees not his sad estate by reason of Sin, and that thinks it would be to his losse to part with it. Wherefore since it evidently appears that true Repentance is so absolutely necessary to qualifie and fit a man for this Ordinance, where it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and to which he must come with an humble broken heart, let me desire thee to put the question to thy own heart, whether thou know'st by experience what it is to repent of, and be truly humbled for Sin? And that thou maist the better know what I mean, let me ask thee, Didst thou ever yet seriously consider what thy condition is by nature, and by reason of thy care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse sinfull life? And hast thou found thy self sensibly affected and stirred with this consideration, so that thou hast been verily perswaded, that thou art in thy self a lost creature, and except there be a way for mercy, art like to perish for ever? And hast thou been convinc'd that Sin is the cause of all this misery and danger which thou art liable to? And hast thou hereupon heartily griev'd for, and bewail'd thy wretched miserable state? Hast thou been humbled for the Sin thou broughtst into


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107818:33"/>
the world with thee, and for all the sins which thou know'st by thy self and canst remember thou hast at any time committed? Hast thou been carefull to search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy heart, and to look back upon thy life past, that thou might'st find out what thy particular sins are, that thou maist confesse them before God, and forsake them? And hast thou indeed been so sensible of the evil of Sin, chiefly as it is rebellion against that God who made thee, and hath sent his Son to Redeem, and Spirit to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie thee, and hath daily given thee so many mercies to engage thee to please him, hast thou, I say, seen so much vilenesse and basenesse in thy dishonouring and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so good a God, that this consideration hath melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and broke thy heart, and wrought thee into a bitter hatred and loathing of every known sin, so that thou hast earnestly desired to be delivered from it which is so odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in its self, and so mischievous to thee? And hast thou been therefore deliberately resolved by the help of God without any more delay, to put away far from thee whatever is displeasing to God, and to return to him from whom thou hast faln, and to an obedience to those Laws which thou hast violated and contemned. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy self faithfully, whether thou hast ever experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd such a change of thy mind as this I have descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, which may well be call'd <hi>Repentance unto life.</hi> Or rather on the other hand, dost thou not find that thou art such a one still as ever thou wast; as earthly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall as ever, as hard-hearted and stupid, and as mad of Sin as ever, and know'st not what it means to have thy heart broken for thy offences committed against the great God of Heaven and Earth? Nay, it may be thou prid'st thy self in being of the very same mind and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position that thou art now, ever since thou canst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. Thou art one that hast always lov'd God, and believed in Christ, and bore a good conscience towards

all men; and then I fear all's little better than stark naught with thee: for though there may be multitudes of good people in times of light and having good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that cannot distinctly tell, when they were in a more especiall manner wrought upon, and brought home to God, yet few, if any, but can remember that once they were much worse than they are; even that they were too like the rest of the world, but now they find they are washed and cleansed. Perhaps when thou hast sworn, or been drunk, or committed any the like wickednesse, thou could'st cry, <hi>God forgive me,</hi> and say thou art a great sinner, but still goest on, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainest as bad as thou wast.

               </p>
               <p>Now (that I may proceed in the method I promised, by directing to the attainment of those graces which are wanting) in order to the breaking of thy hard heart, and humbling thy soul for Sin, I might advise thee in the first place to look back into thy heart and life, to find out thy particular sins, not being content in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to confesse thy self a sinner, as all men are: for this is not so likely much to work upon thee, but to fasten upon thy most remarkable sins, and dwell upon and bewail them: and so all lesser evils, and that <hi>body of death</hi> which thou carriest about thee continually, which was born with thee, and is the ground of all the rest. In this method partly may you find <hi>David</hi>'s confession, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. at the beginning to the 5. verse. Further I might direct thee earnestly to beg of God to open thy eyes, and shew thee what thy estate is, and discover to thee more of the evil of Sin, before thou feel its sad


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107818:34"/>
effects when repentance will come too late. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou art to use all other means appointed for the working of a true and saving sorrow for Sin, as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what God speaks against it in his Word, and to attend diligently to the most searching and awakening Preaching; and to be much employ'd in those conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that have a special tendency to the begetting of this frame; and of this sort I might name severall, as for instance, to think frequently how great and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a God sin is committed against, and what particular reasons thou hast to serve and please him, from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and means thou enjoyest; think how he stands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to thee as thy Creator, Preserver and Ruler, and therefore disobedience to him is most odious, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and undutifull. Withall its good to consider how much hurt Sin doth to the soul, which is so excellent a Being, how it defiles, debaseth and disquiets it, how it exposeth the whole man to all kind of evils and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings here on earth, and to everlasting torments here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and deprives men of those unspeakable joys which are to be had with and from God. But to avoid tediousnesse I shall passe over these and many the like considerations, and keeping to the Subject in hand shall rather direct thee to fetch matter for humiliation and repentance from the Crosse of Christ, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whereof at the Sacrament should still keep up and renew thy godly sorrow. If then thou art one who never yet sawest any great hurt in Sin, but for all the ill language which is given it, canst quietly and lovingly entertain it, let me beseech thee a while to fix thy thoughts upon a crucified Saviour, and then remain of this wretched opinion if thou canst. Behold the Son of God become Man, a most innocent holy person, whose whole life was spent in doing good, who heal'd Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, cast out Devils, pitied all that were afflicted, taught

the ignorant, pray'd and wept for poor Sinners: after all, behold this blessed Jesus, who had never in all his life been guilty of the least sin in thought word or deed, nor ever gave just cause of offence to any man living, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him I say, in the Garden a little before his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, sorrowfull even to the death, in such a bitter ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that he sweat great drops or clots of bloud; and what inward pains and sorrows dost thou think must those needs be, which put him into such an unnaturall sweat as this, though his patience was as much greater than any mortall mans, as his sufferings themselves were: for we cannot imagine that he who so calmly bore all those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities and cruelties which were offered and inflicted by insolent men, should be lesse patient in regard of those sufferings which he underwent immediately from God, but we may conclude that these were infinitely the greater. Then after this beginning of sorrows, and after he had been most vilely abused and set at nought by the Rulers, the chief Priests, the Souldiers and common people; after he had in a jeer been cloathed in a purple Robe, with a Crown of Thorns on his Head, and a Reed in his Hand; after he had been laught at, spit on, whipt and buffeted, behold him brought forth to be stretcht upon the Crosse, where his enemies stood gazing, shouting and wagging their heads at him; whilst his tender hands and feet are struck through with nails that fasten him to the wood, and in his soul he felt that pain which wrung from him that doleful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Now let me beg thee to dwell a while upon this Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

put his own dearly beloved Son to all this smart for an inconsiderable thing? Certainly if thou art a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an thou canst not harbour any such base thoughts. Well then, what was it that put Christ to all this sorrow and shame and smart? Ah friend, it was thy sin and mine, and the rest of the worlds that was the cause, and canst thou then imagine it an harmlesse thing? If thou doubt of what I say, hear the plain word of God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.4, 5, 6. <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes are we healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21. <hi>Christ also suffered for us.</hi> ver. 24. <hi>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree.</hi>— Gal. 3.13. And at the institution of his Supper he acquaints us that his <hi>blood was shed for the remission of sins,</hi> Mat. 26.28. When Man had rebell'd against his Maker, and broke that Law which threatned destruction to him that should break it, there was no other way that we are told of, but either he himself must undergoe the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had deserved, or some one else on his behalf. And therefore Man being spared, there was found no way for the satisfaction and honour of offended justice, but by these sufferings which the Lord Jesus our Surety underwent: who being so glorious a person, even the Son of God made Man, he onely <hi>being made a sacrifice for sin could condemn sin in the flesh,</hi> discovering to all the world that sin was a most hainous evil, so hateful and displeasing to the blessed Majesty, that he would not forgive to any man the least iniquity without satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made, and no other satisfaction would he accept but the Death of Christ, <hi>who is become our propitiation,

for me, but for your selves and your children</hi>; so say I, poor sinners, weep not for Christ out of a kind of pity to him, that he should unjustly (as to men) be put to so great smart, but weep for your selves and your sins that were the cause. And this is that I chiefly intend under this Head, that seeing Christ hath bore such an heavy load upon thy account, amongst the rest, thou maist hence learn the true nature and desert of sin, of thy own sins which thou art wont to make so light of. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the very torments of the damned doe not more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discover the evil of sin, and Gods hatred of it, than the sufferings of Christ doe. For it is evident, that the greatnesse of the punishment, where the Judge is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and upright, is a plain argument of the greatnesse of the offence; if you should see a man by the way hung up alive in chains, you would soon conclude it was for murther, or some the most horrid wickednesse, that he was so dealt with. And as evident it is, that the worth and eminency of the person who is punisht speaks the offence proportionably of an higher nature. If we should hear that a King who is both just and mercifull, had caused his own Son's right hand to be cut off, we might well conclude there was some more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cause; but especially if he, being guiltlesse himself, had suffered this for another mans sake, we should rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably inferre, that it was a crime of the highest na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for which was made so dear satisfaction. Now what must we think when we see the Lord Jesus upon the Crosse, who though he felt pain and sorrow onely as he was in our nature, yet was that nature so nearly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Divine, that its said, <hi>God purchased his Church with his own blood,</hi> Acts 20.28. so 1 Joh. 3.16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us,</hi> that is, Christ who was God as well as Man, laid, &amp;c. the like, to mention no more, we find, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.

6, 7, 8. If then we consider one so far advanced above men, laid so low; one <hi>holy, harmlesse, undefiled, separate from sinners,</hi> suffering such grievous things, may we not in all reason conclude, that the sin which caused this was out of measure sinfull, for that's the worst word that can be given it; its nature being so odious that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be said of it sufficient to expresse its vilenesse. Good Reader then let me perswade thee to judge of sin by this evidence, and never more to hearken to thy own flesh, or to the subtle Tempter, or thy foolish Companions, that would make the believe there's no such hurt in those sins that please thee, that thou need'st not be so carefull to avoid them, or so deeply humbled for them: That Devil who would perswade thee that it is such a matter of nothing to provoke God to anger, knows and feels the contrary in himself. So much hurt as there is in a Devil compared to an Angel, in hell compared to heaven, so much hurt he hath learnt there is in sin. Beware least thou come to learn it by such sad experience thy self. But that I may finish this, let me once again ask thee, whether thou dar'st say, that Christ underwent greater sufferings than he needed to have done, in order to make satisfaction for our sins, or that God laid on him more then in justice he ought when he was become our Surety? If thou dar'st not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm either of these, beware how thou mincest and les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senest thy sins when thou should'st repent of, and bewail them: for by so doing thou dost in effect thus blaspheme God. Oh then let sin be call'd to the barre; indict it for a murtherer, as well thou mayst, accuse it as guilty of the bloody death of the Lord of Life, shew all the wounds and stabs that it gave him; and see that thou pronounce sentence against it, even utter death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any pity or remorse; and heartily lament thy own basenesse, in having so long given loving entertainment


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107818:37"/>
to such a monstrous murtherer and traitour. And when ever thou find'st any favourable thoughts of sin arising in thy breast, call to mind what it did against Christ, and let that make thy heart rise against it, and even boil with an holy hatred and desire of revenge. And let the frequent remembrance of those streams of blood which thy sins fetcht from him, open thy eyes to shed streams of tears, or however work thy heart to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned sorrow for all thy iniquities, for which thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was thus wounded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next thing I would have have thee to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large thy meditations upon in the sufferings of Christ, in order to the bringing of thee to a kindly repentance, is <hi>that unspeakable love which is hereby manifested to the lost sons of men</hi>: when I speak of Repentance, I mean not meerly thy shedding of a few tears, but an inward change of thy mind, as I before shewed, that thou should'st turn from Sin to the love of God; and I know not what can be more likely to produce this, than to shew thee the intolerable evil and mischief of sin, that thou maist turn from it, and the infinite goodnesse of God, that thou maist be drawn to him. Both these the Crosse of Christ most admirably holds forth, so that well might the Apostle call <hi>Christ crucified, the wisdome of God, and the powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.23, 24. How it shews the evil of sin to bring us to loath and leave it, I have already shown, and shall doe more in two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars. That which I would now set thy thoughts upon, is, the inconceivable love of God in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Christ for us, and of Christ in being willing to lay down his life, <hi>that as many as believe in him might not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> Consider seriously how the great God hath sent after thee a poor worm, the God whom thou hadst sinn'd against makes thee offers of peace, the God who needs thee not, yet appears de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107818:37"/>
of thy happinesse, when he might have poured out everlasting wrath upon thee, he was willing to shew his compassion. And see what he hath done in order to thy recovery. He hath sent his own Son made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, made under the Law, and delivered him to death for our offences, and accepted of the satisfaction he hath made on the behalf of all, that shall by him come to that God from whom they are faln: and by his death not onely pardon of sin, and deliverance from hell, but a glorious Kingdome that shall never fade is purchast for all true Believers. So that here</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Thou seest plainly there is hope of pardon and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance upon thy hearty sorrow for, and resolutions against sin.</hi> And whom would not this encourage to come in, freely acknowledging and protesting against their former back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings and rebellions. If indeed thou wast past hope, it were as good keep thy sins while thou maist, and make thy best of them. But this is not yet thy case; and if it hereafter should be, thou maist thank thy own wilfulnesse. For Jesus Christ hath <hi>brought in a better hope</hi>: there is by him liberty proclaim'd to the captive, freedome to all that are bound, ease and rest to all that are burdened, a pardon to all that are penitent. And what? will not this make thee stirre? Is a golden Scepter held forth, and wilt thou not lay hold of the opportunitie? Is God willing to put up all the affronts he hath received from thee, if thou wilt now come and submit thy self, and will not this bring thee in? Is he ready to be reconcil'd, and art thou backward? what? dost thou rather hold off, because he doth so invite and importune thee to him? Because he is pleased with so much earnestnesse and compassion to call thee off from sin to himself, dost thou the more securely run on in wickednesse? Oh base ingratitude, and meer mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse! Because there is hope of pardon discovered by


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107818:38"/>
the Gospel, as procured by Christ, therefore, even there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doe wretched sinners harden their hearts, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden themselves to continue at a distance from God, as if it was a matter of nothing to get their peace made with him, or as if he must of necessity pardon and save them, let them live as they list. Thus vilely doe they pervert the very design of the Gospel. Whereas were they ingenuous and reasonable, they would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be a most forcible motive and engagement to cast away sin, to hear that there was hopes of having forgivenesse and favour from God. If a company of Subjects should rebell against their Prince, what course would be more effectuall in all probability to reclaim them, than to assure pardon to all that would throw down their arms? But if they should be so base as to abuse the mercy of their Prince, and think, because he was so compassionate, they might the safelier persist in their rebellion, it is but just they should be destroy'd. If thou love thy soul, then beware how thou abusest the grace of God. Wilt thou put away from thee the evil of thy doings, wash thee and make the clean, and so with humility and submission flie to God for mercy? if so, this mercy through Christ shall be assuredly thine. But otherwise, know there is not a word of comfort for thee in the whole Gospel, nothing but what may strike thee with terrour. For remember well, that the death of Christ gives all the encouragement in the world to Repentance, but not the least to Sin. Yea, it hath done more to destroy sin than all the terrours and threatnings of the Law. Well then, though thou art a lost sinner, departed from God, once without hope, yet behold the God of heaven and earth takes pity on thee, he would not have thee utterly perish, though thou hast done so much to destroy thy self. He calls thee back to him, if thou wilt hearken and obey, and humble thy


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107818:38"/>
self before him for thy departure from him, and for all the dishonours done to his holy Name, and wilt now at length devote thy self to his fear, thou need'st not doubt of his favour. So then here's hope of mercy that may encourage all that hear it to Repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in the next place <hi>there is so much love and goodnesse manifested in that way whereby this mercy is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and tendered,</hi> that may serve to work upon the hearts of all but flat Infidels, or bruitish sinners that will not be brought so much as once to consider of it, or seriously regard it. Here is love that passeth the full comprehension of Men or Angels. Here are mysteries and unsearchable treasures of goodnesse. Wherein could God commend his love more to the faln World, than in giving his Son to die for us when we were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help? And what greater love can be shewn than that which Christ hath manifested in laying down his life for his friends? nay for enemies, that they might be made friends; for the ungodly that he might reconcile them to God. Vile wretches that we are, no more to be affected with this amazing discovery of divine bounty! Its true indeed, there are many things we are yet igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, which makes this love the lesse apprehended in its due dimensions. Did we know more the infinite Majesty of God, and our meannesse compared to him, and how provoking a thing Sin is, and how contrary to his nature; did we know more what strange condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion there was in God's manifesting himself in flesh, what bitter things our blessed Saviour endured for our sakes; did we know the greatnesse of that misery he hath sav'd Believers from, and of the glory he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for them, did we clearly know these and all other heightning circumstances, our admiration and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be unexpressible, as it will be when they are more fully reveal'd to us. But though at present we

And more than so, when thou might'st have had a Pursuivant speedily dispatcht to hurry thee to deserved torment, behold a Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing to prevent thy ruine. Instead of an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able doom, behold an Act of oblivion, assuring pardon upon easie conditions. Doe but deliberately weigh these things with that seriousnesse which becomes a man, and see if there be nothing in them that may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade thee to a sound repentance for sin, and a speedy return to the God of love. What dost thou think, if thou wast a mean Tenant, and hadst wilfully, in some discontended fit, pluckt down the House thou liv'st in, &amp; so wast in danger to lie in the open fields, and to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely punisht as thou hadst deserved; what now if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, thy Landlord, pitying the misery thou hadst brought thy self to, should courteously come to thee, and offer to build up thy House again in a more sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner than ever, and set it at a lower Rent, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiring thee to confesse thy former folly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to be so guilty no more, but to live thy new-built House, and doe thy best to keep it in repair, and to accept of his help for what thou could'st not doe thy self; and suppose he should even impoverish his own children through this courtesie to thee, what dost thou think thou should'st now doe in this case? is it any hard

And would indeed the gentlenesse and liberality of a man, thy fellow-creature, thus affect thee, and shall not the loving kindnesse of God, which hath appeared in Jesus Christ, have much more power upon thee? Dost thou not believe that our God hath done as much to engage his creatures to himself as this comes to? Hath not he shewn as much pity and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse to the souls of men as that would be to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?

And except thou be an unreasonable Infidel, thou canst not but believe it; for it is plainly revealed in Gods holy Word; where also we find the greatnesse of this love inculcated, in Gods having regard to us, and first looking after us, when we took no thought for our selves how to get his favour, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our sins.</hi> Rom. 5.6, 8. <hi>For when we were yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.

If thou canst, certainly thou hast banisht all gratitude, and hast scarce one spark of common ingenuity left in thee, yea, thou hast put off thy manhood, and art become little better than a senslesse bruit: for what should sooner


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107818:40"/>
work upon a reasonable creature to love another, than extraordinary and undeserved-kindnesse which he hath received from him? Nay, I might go farther, and tell thee, and that justly too, the very beasts themselves have more good nature than such a stupid, unthankfull sinner as thou: For they have some sense of a good turn, and some love to those that doe it: they know those that feed them and keep them, and use not to doe them any mischief. The Dog does not use to bite his Master, nor the Horse to kick at him that looks to him. And so indeed God himself complains of ungratefull men, that when <hi>the Ox knows his owner, and the Asse his masters crib, yet they did not know their Maker and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server.</hi> But to be short, let me tell the plainly, if thou find'st thy heart nothing mov'd with all this love that God hath revealed, in sending Christ <hi>to save us from wrath to come,</hi> by his own sharp sufferings, I can no way see but that thy case is full as bad, yea rather worse than his, who believes not a word of all I have said. Nay, how indeed can it be imagined that thou believest these things, if they make no impression upon thee? except thou never use to think of them after thou hast read or heard them: but there's the wonder if thou dost believe them, how thou canst chuse but think on them, and think again, till at length they work some good effect upon thee. But if thou hast hitherto been so strangely carelesse, let me once again desire thee now at length to set upon the sober thoughts of this unconceivable mercy manifested in the Gospel, that when thou hadst even destroy'd thy self, God should make haste to thy help; that he should send his own Son to undertake for thee, who was also willing to this work, and should up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him punish thy sins, and now after all onely calls thee to cast away thy sin, and to return to his love; which if thou wilt doe, he is willing to be reconcil'd


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107818:41"/>
to thee. And see if there be not good cause that thou should'st hearken to these invitations, and whether there can be given any just or tolerable excuse for thy disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. If the bitterest enemy thou hadst in the world should but save thy life when it was in his hands, much more if he should endanger himself, or undergo any losse for thy safety, I am confident this would soon take off thy spleen against him, and make thee very ready to be restored to his friendship. And why the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God should not be as prevalent with thee I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine, if it be but soundly believed, and well thought on.</p>

                  </gap>t faln, another argument drawn also from the goodnesse of God, shewn in the death of Christ, as hereby it is most clearly discoverd, <hi>That there is some unspeakable happinesse which was purchast by the Lord Jesus for those that come to God by him,</hi> and to which he invites empty miserable creatures. Thou canst not imagine that God makes all this adoe with men for nothing. It was not upon any triviall errand that he sent his Son into the world; nor are they any sleight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable things which he offers to as many as will receive him. Its true, the mercy had been rich and glorious, if Christ had onely died to save us from mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, and to have procured of God, that we might have been reduced to nothing rather, than to frie in everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnings: and no tongue can tell what a priviledge the damned in hell would account this. But over and above we read of a Kingdome of glory which Christ will give to his followers. And how great this is, judge by the price that was paid for it; not silver or gold, or any such corruptible trifles, but the precious Blood of the Son of God without price, whose utmost value can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be exprest by Men or Angels; and no more can the


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107818:41"/>
glory hereby obtained. For if the Merchant be wise, the worth of his Jewel may be guest at by the price that he paid for it. Precious is the Soul of Man, and full dear did the redemption thereof cost, more than the the whole world, or ten thousand such worlds as this: And is not, think you, the souls portion answerable to its own excellency? And the purchased Possession an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the greatnesse of that cost that was laid out for it? When a common Slave may be freed for a few shillings, half a Kingdome will be thought little enough to redeem a captive Prince: and we afterward see there is as much difference betwixt them when they have got their liberty, the one sits on a dunghill, the other on a throne. For certain then Christ Jesus came into the world, and laid down his life to exalt those that heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to him, to the highest joy and blisse of which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is capable, in delivering them from all sin, rendring them exactly conformable to God, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them in constant full communion with him. He that so <hi>loved his Church that he gave himself for it, to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and cleanse it,</hi> by all this design'd to <hi>present it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh little doe any, even the best and wisest on earth, conceive what are the full fruits of Christs blood; what miracles of divine love those are, which through endlesse millions of ages will keep alive the admiration, joy and praise of Angels and Saints; and fill the mouths of Christs Redeemed ones with continuall thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for that wisdome and mercy which contriv'd and wrought their delivery and exaltation. So that you see,


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107818:42"/>
laying these things together, the death of Christ, as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the mercy of God, lays the greatest engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can be upon the sons of men, to break off their sins, and return to the obedience and love of God: in that there is so much mercy procured and tendred as may beget hope, and encourage to repentance, which is not like to be rejected; and as there is so great love exprest, as may well call for the return of love, and even soften the most stony heart; and as it discovers so great a blessednesse to be had in God through Christ, as may prevail with all that love themselves, to make out after it, and depart from sin, which alone can keep them from it. And that's the second Consideration which the Death of Christ helps us to, in order to the working of a kindly Repentance, namely the great goodnesse of God hereby revealed to poor sinners.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From all that hath been said, will more clearly appear the hainous nature of sin, as a farther motive to Repentance, <hi>in that it is a contradiction to all this love of God, and an undervaluing of the greatest mercy that was ever bestow'd upon the world,</hi> being in effect, a trampling under foot of the blood of the Lord Jesus, whereby we should be sanctified. And hereby I mean those sins which have been committed since men heard of the Gospel. For as the evil of sin did appear in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of those sufferings which Christ underwent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a pardon, so these his sufferings doe exceedingly aggravate their sins, who have continued in them, after they have been told again and again what their Saviour hath done to make satisfaction for them, if they would not undervalue and despise it. Oh how have you made a shift so often to hear and read of the life and death of Christ and yet have done all that in you lies to crosse the end of his coming into the world, and to make his Death of none effect to you, whilst yet you


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107818:42"/>
pretend to believe that his design was wholly for your good? Oh unthankfull wretches, to make such a requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall for such unvaluable love! As if you studied how you might most dishonour and displease him, who thought not his own life too dear to lay down for you. Could you see him upon the Crosse wounded, torn, and bruised for your sakes, and could you think of no other recompence but to give him fresh wounds by your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sins? Did he once <hi>despise the shame and endure the crosse</hi> for you, and could you find in your hearts again to <hi>put him to an open shame,</hi> and as it were <hi>crucifie him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh?</hi> Did he indeed deserve such dealing as this at your hands? Bethink thy self, Reader, whether this hath not been thy case. Hast thou not liv'd in those sins which Christ died to deliver thee from. And what hast thou thereby done lesse than proclaim, That there is more to be got by thy lusts than by thy Saviour, that its better to remain in thy polluted corrupt estate, than to be washt in the blood of Christ, <hi>whereby our consciences are purged from dead works to serve the living God?</hi> And did they vilifie Christ more, that contemn'd him, jeer'd him, and put him to death? If thou take thy fleshly pleasures, and worldly profits, to be of greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage than any thing that can accrue to thee by Christs Death, dost thou not think as basely of him as any of his Crucifiers did: And hadst thou been there with this frame of heart, is is not most likely thou would'st have joyn'd with them, what ever thou maist now think? As they hated Christ because he told them the truth, and reprov'd them for sin, and therefore did all they could, to rid themselves of one whose preaching and presence was such a burden to them, so dost thou appear in effect an hater of Christ, his life and doctrine, whilst thou walkest so flatly contrary thereto. And what's this lesse than desiring that there was no God


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107818:43"/>
nor Christ to govern and judge thee, no such Rule as the Gospel to be thy guide. Nay, let me tell thee, thou who hast profest thy self a Christian, and yet hast behav'd thy self thus unworthily toward Christ, thou art herein more guilty than the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves: for what they did was very much out of ignorance, but thou, after thou hast known that he is the Son of God, and that he laid down his life for our sins, hast manifested all thy contempt of him, and rejected him from being thy Saviour, whilst thou would'st not be saved by him from thy reigning lusts, which thou hast loved more than him, as <hi>Judas</hi> loved the money for which he was hired to betray him. After thou hast known of that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which by the Crosse of Christ was shewn to the ruined world, yet thou hast been an <hi>enemy to this crosse,</hi> whilst thou hast <hi>made thy belly thy God, and minded earthly things</hi>; whilst thou hast delightfully liv'd in the practice of any known sin. What then, were the <hi>Jews prickt to the heart</hi> when they were convinc'd that they had <hi>crucified, that Jesus, whom God had made Lord and Christ?</hi> and shall it not have the same effect on thee, to consider thou hast been guilty in some sort of the same wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and hast shewn forth the very same spirit that was in them? For think not thy self more blamelesse, because thou never saw'st Christ, nor hadst any hand in his Death, nor didst joyn with his enemies in accusing, condemning and reproaching him, but criest out against them as monsters of men, that persecuted the most spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Innocence with such savage fierceness: for all this while, thy guilt may be as great as theirs, whilst thou hast as great an enmity against the image of Christ, and the Law of Christ as they had against his person. And that thou dost not wound him, and spit in his face, is not from the goodnesse of thy nature, but because he is out of thy reach: for were he now before thee, and could it


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107818:43"/>
gratifie thy lusts so to deal with him, its much to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thou would'st not stick at it. Whilst the <hi>Pharisees</hi> condemned their fore-fathers for killing the Prophets, they followed them in the very same sin. And suppose a Father had two Sons, the one at mans estate, the other an infant, and the elder of these by following wicked courses should break his Fathers heart, and occasion his death: and the younger when he was grown up should lead the very same life that the other did, but yet should take on him very much to condemn his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for being so disobedient and hard-hearted; as to bring his Father to the grave: is it not plain for all this, that had he been in his Brothers stead he would have done the same that he did? since he also takes those courses which were so grievous to his Father. Thus it is to be remembred that <hi>Sin</hi> was that which put Christ to death as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> and this <hi>Sin</hi> is it thou lovest, though thou seemest to hate <hi>them.</hi> And as those <hi>Jews</hi> put his body to pain by their cruelties, so dost thou grieve his Spirit by thy wickednesse. And know, he takes it as hainously from thee, that thou should'st thus displease him, as he did from them that they should persecute him to the death. Nor art thou like to get a pardon at any easier rates than they, even no other way, than looking on him whom thou by thy sins hast pierced, and bitterly mourning for this thy bloodinesse and ingratitude. What saist thou then after all this? canst thou without tears and groans look back upon all the disorders of thy life, whereby thou hast done all that in thee lay, to make those wounds of thy tender compassionate Saviour bleed afresh, which he first receiv'd upon thy account? I believe thou thought'st not of this: no, if thou hadst, one would think thou could'st never have done it. Thy design was onely to please thy flesh by all thy sensuall courses; thou wast


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107818:44"/>
onely full of projects to maintain and raise thy self and thy posterity by all thy worldly designs and businesses, wherewith through thy whole life though hast been so swallowed up. But thou seest how the case stands; that this while thou hast been most viley rejecting, and even trampling upon the Lord Jesus, who would have have brought thee off from thy vain conversation, from all thy ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, and hath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee with his Word and Spirit to that end, and hath prest thee with arguments drawn from his matchlesse love, discovered by his Death, and hath besought thee to regard him, yea to take pity on thy self, but thou hast made light of all, and hast gone on as securely and quietly in the ways of sin, as if thou hadst never heard what sin did upon Christ. And what? art thou resolv'd to doe so still? shall nothing stop thee in thy career? wilt thou not stay to hearken what a way it is thou walkest in? nor think what unvaluable mercies thou all this while treadest under feet? Hast thou not yet suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently abused thy Redeemers love and patience? hast thou not made him wait long enough in vain? wilt thou still make shew of deafnesse to all those messages he sends thee? If so, yet be thou sure of this, thou shalt not be able to say at thy appearance before him, that thou never knewest that sin was such an evil thing, and so provoking to him: for beside all other warnings that thou hast had, I now declare to thee who readest or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest these words, that if thou still continuest in thy loose ungodly life, living in swearing, cursing, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, whoredome, covetousnesse, cozening, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or any other known sin, and wilfully neglectest thy duty to God, going whole days without prayer or reading Gods Word, profaning the Lords Day, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting Sacraments, if thou hold on this course, thou dost no better than <hi>again crucifie and deny the Lord that


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107818:44"/>
bought thee,</hi> and so hast no reason to complain, if thou fall under the same condemnation, which thou thy self wilt acknowledge, <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the rest of Christs enemies deserve: and therefore that thou maist not be found amongst them, loaded with the same guilt at Judgement, I doe once again in the name of Christ beseech thee with all speed to change thy heart and life, and use all means appointed to that end, and after all thy wandrings, now at length <hi>return to him the good Shepherd of souls, who laid down his life for his sheep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly, the Death of Christ may powerfully move thee to repent of, and forsake all sin, as it holds forth this weighty, but sad truth, <hi>That all those who are despisers of this Death, and by living and dying in their sins reap no saving benefit by it, shall in their own persons undergo insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable torments for this their unbelief and wilfull impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</hi> If thou believest the Gospel, thou canst not but acknowledge, that all men had been in a most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition if Christ had not died; and thou wilt grant that sin is a most perilous mischievous thing, and an unspeakable provocation to the most holy God, since nothing could appease his wrath but the Death of Christ, without whose bloodshed we had obtain'd no remission: And what then dost thou think is like to be thy case, if through thy own fault, thou art never the better for all Christ hath done, but must thy self answer for thy sins, and bear the punishment they have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Let the Death of Christ, I say, instruct thee what thou art like to expect if this be thy condition. <hi>If,</hi> as he himself speaks, <hi>such things were done to the green tree, what shall be done to the dry?</hi> If he who was without the least stain of originall or actuall sin drank such a bitter cup, when he stood in our stead, what will be the portion of their cup, who, being poor frail creatures, must make satisfaction for their own sins? How will they ever

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:107818:45"/>
up under all the load of Gods hottest wrath, when he shall meet them in judgement, and cause his fury to rest upon them? And above all, thy impenitent, obstinate continuance in sin, and contempt of Christ, will lie heaviest upon thee in the day of vengeance. These sins aganst the Gospel, against mercy, the greatest and freest mercy are most provoking to God, most inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable in themselves, and will therefore prove most pernicious to sinners. Methinks then, if thou hadst but any regard to thy self, to thy own ease and comfort, this should make thee out of love with sin, to consider how dear its like to cost thee, how pleasant soever it may now seem. It was not for nothing that Christ felt so much sorrow and pain, as thou shalt know to thy ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting woe, if thou pluck the heavy judgements of God on thy own head, by sleighting him who would have kept them from off thee. Assure thy self, poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as bold and confident as now thou art, thou wilt never be able to contest with that wrath, which exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed even the strength of Christ to bear it; thou art ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like to go away lightly with that which he felt so heavy. For shame at length leave thy foolish plea, that God will be more mercifull than to torment his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for hast thou not seen how he bruised his own Son, who never offended him, how he bruised him, I say, for our iniquities, and will he then spare thee, who in thy own person hast been a most stubborn, hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rebel, and hast cast away with loathing the mercies that were again and again even prest upon thee? Thou hast no reason for such fond expectations. What? wilt thou tell Christ at Judgement, that thou didst not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ever God would be so severe, as to punish thee so dreadfully and everlastingly as his Word threatned? and that therefore thou took'st somewhat more liberty in thy life than he allowed thee? Darest


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107818:45"/>
thou come with such a plea as this? But if thou should'st, what wilt thou answer to Christ; when he shall lay open, what he underwent for thy sake, and how thou madest light of his love? will not this soon silence thee? If he ask thee whether thou hadst not evidence and proof enough of the evil and danger that was in sin, by his suffering so much for others transgressions, wilt thou have any pretence left to justifie thy self? I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps urge this consideration, but I mention it now as offered to us by the sufferings of Christ, which doe most plainly declare, that dolefull are the miseries prepared for those who get no good by him, but die in their sins: which may bring all that are not in love with damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, out of love with that sin which will at length plunge them into it. And thus you see how many motives to true Repentance are afforded us from the serious medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the Cross and Passion of Christ: as this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to us the hainous nature of sin; and as there is such mercy and love hereby reveal'd, as may work upon, and reclaim all that are ingenuous, gratefull, or wise for themselves; and as this makes sin more mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously vile which shall be committed against such mercy; and as it shews that all men living in sin, dying out of Christ, are like to undergo unsufferable torments for their obstinacy. And thus I have finisht the second qualification which is necessary to all worthy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, to wit, True Repentance, an unfeigned sorrow for, a detestation of, and a turning from all wilfull sin in heart and life.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>III.</hi> A right remembring the great end of the Death of Christ to Redeem us from all iniquity and sanctifie us. Of Faith and Covenanting with Christ.</head>
               <p>IT must needs be, that if we rightly Remember the Death of Christ in the Sacrament, we must then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to what end and purpose this was: and this we shall plainly find in Scripture to be, that he might Redeem man from that sinfull miserable state he was faln into, and restore him to a state of holinesse and happinesse in the enjoyment of God from whom he was faln. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>For Christ also hath once suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.</hi> Ephes. 2.16, 17, 18. Heb. 7.25. And this is the meaning of all those places which speak of the <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> we have obtain'd by Christ, if we take it in its largest signification. And to this purpose he offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to men to be their Redeemer, to conferre upon them the pardon of their sin, and give them victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all their corruptions, and the temptations of Satan, and to lead them by his Spirit through this dangerous world, till he shall bring them with triumph into the <hi>kingdome of the Father.</hi> Now hence it follows, <hi>that no man can Remember Christ as he ought, who will not receive him to these ends and purposes for which he offers himself,</hi> which is our believing in him. For is he a fit man to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate Christs Remembrance who hath no love for him, nor any liking to his undertaking, nor will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to comply therewith? And such are all they who reject him and the tenders of his mercy, except they might have them in their own way, and that doe flatly contradict his design in becoming our Mediatour by


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107818:46"/>
continuing still in their naturall corrupt estate, aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God, and liable to his wrath: that is, who are unbelievers. So that here I mean no more than, <hi>That without Faith in Christ we cannot rightly Remember him,</hi> without we so believe that he is the onely Saviour of mankind, that we resolve he, and none but he, shall be our Saviour in the way that he himself thinks fit. But to make it yet plainer, how unfit all such rejecters of Christ are to come to this holy Supper, consider that our receiving of the Sacrament is appointed to be on our part, as a token and sign of our making and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Covenant with God in Christ, in which if we be sincere, then it is a seal on Gods part, of his being in Covenant with us; a confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mation of our belief, that he will be our God, and fulfill all his promises to us; and herein he gives us an earnest and pledge of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture blessings which we shall receive from him through his Son, as I shall shew under the next Head. Does it not then hence appear, that all those who will not be held in any such Covenant, are most unfit persons to come to this Sacrament; the very design of our coming to which, is to shew that we are a people in Covenant with God: and by this solemn action, taking and eating the Bread, and drinking the Wine, we are to testifie that we are so, and doe hereby bind our selves so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. What would this be, but with much formality to mock that God who will not be mocked, and even to run upon our own damnation, provoking the Lord to destroy those, who so impudently take his name in vain. By this practice men are guilty of a down-right lye, yea, of grossest perjury: for Christ in effect sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h, <hi>All you, and you onely that take me for your Lord and Saviour, come and partake of this Feast which I have appointed in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Redemption I have wrought for you,</hi> and yet multitudes who will not take him for their <hi>Lord to rule


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107818:47"/>
over them,</hi> nor <hi>will be saved from their sins</hi> by him, thrust in and partake of this Supper. This is just, as if a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of an Army, having a mind to single out some of his Souldiers for some design, should say, <hi>All you that are willing to go along with me, hold up your hands,</hi> and yet many should hold up their hands who refuse to go: what would this be but to befool themselves and abuse their Leader? Or, as if at the first appointment of the Passeover it had been commanded that they, and they only should eat of the Paschal Lamb who would go out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:</hi> and yet many of the <hi>Israelites</hi> should prepare and eat it, either because they were hungry, or because they would do as the rest did, without ever thinking what was the meaning of this action, or what they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by engag'd themselves to, being resolv'd still to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in <hi>Egypt,</hi> neither caring for <hi>Moses,</hi> nor the <hi>Canaan</hi> which he should lead them to. Thus when Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that all those who will depart out of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> bondage they are in to sin and Satan, and be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him through the wilderness of this World till they come to the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> that they should appear at a Feast which he hath made on purpose to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them, there throng in others to this Table who have no right to eat thereat, as having no resolutions to leave their sin, and thus to follow Christ, who would lead them to glory. These are the men that are found without their <hi>wedding garment,</hi> whom the Master of the Feast will draw out from amongst the rest, and dispose of them to a place and company more suitable for them, as you may read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.10, 11, 12, 13. So that I hope you see that its a most unsuitable and unlawfull thing for any man to addresse himself to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, who is not heartily in Covenant with God, since herein he professeth himself to be so, and therefore if


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107818:47"/>
he be not, he will be found a lyar both to God and Man.</p>
               <p>But since this is made by some the very nature and design of the Lord's Supper to be a Foederal rite, or an action testifying and confirming a Covenant betwixt God and man, as in the Eastern and other Countries they were wont to ratifie their Leagues by feasting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and as they who eat of the sacrifices offered to Devils, therereby had fellowship with Devils, as the <hi>Jews</hi> by eating of their sacrifices held communion with, and profest subjection to God, as you may see them paralleld, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17, 18, 19, 20. since I say, this is on mans part a sign of his being in covenant with God; I shall somewhat fuller explain what this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is, that you may understand whether you are cordially entred thereinto, and are willing to continue in it, that so you may know whether you are like to be entertained as worthy guests at the Lords Table, which is proper to his Covenant-people.</p>
               <p>In a word then, the Covenant which wee renew at the Lords Supper, is the very same with that you were entred into in Baptism, when you were baptiz'd in the Name of, and thereby engaged to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and therefore to those duties which wee owe to God in the several relations wherein he stands to us, which are denoted by the Persons of the sacred Trinity: That is, we are hereby oblig'd to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God the Father to be our Creator and Preserver, and therefore to behave our selves as his creatures ought, submitting our selves to his Commands and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, and placing our happiness in pleasing him and enjoying his love; God the Son made man, that is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, we are hereby bound to take for our onely Saviour, through whom alone we hope for the pardon of our offences, and for ability to serve and please God, and for acceptance and happinesse with him; And


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107818:48"/>
God the Holy Ghost wee promise to take for our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier; to have our souls by him renewed after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, and those graces given into us which were purchast for us by Christ, and the evidences of Gods love, and of our title to the future blessedness to bee clear'd up, and assur'd to our consciences; the Holy Word also which he inspir'd the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to write, wee are hereby engag'd to take for the Rule of our faith and life.

All you then who have been baptiz'd into the Christian Faith, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bound to take God for your Supream Governor and chief Happiness, and Jesus Christ for your Mediatour and way to the Father, and the Holy Spirit for your Sanctifier and Guide. And since you were Infants when you thus were first dedicated to God, it behooves you that are now come to the use of reason, and are resolv'd by the grace of God to be stedfast in this holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to come to the Lords Table and there professe these resolutions, and by the receiving of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107818:48"/>
in the presence of the heart-searching God, and all your fellow-Christians, to renew your engagement that you will take God for your God, and that you will be his people. Since then it is so plain that they, and they only are worthy Communicants, who have in heart made this covenant with God in Christ, which they are to profess, solemnize and confirm, by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacramental bread and wine; it remains that all, who would not venture upon damnation by doing this unworthily, ought to enter into a faithful exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of themselves, whether indeed this be their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and frame of heart, or not. And let me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, Reader, faithfully to set upon this Work, as a businesse of the greatest concernment that ever thou hadst to do in thy life, namely, to see that thou art sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely in covenant with God through his Son; for this is the very heart and substance of Religion, the sum of all Christianity, and that upon which thy everlasting happiness wholly depends; Know but this once, and thou maiest know that Heaven will be thy portion shouldst thou dye at this hour.</p>
               <p>And here that I may do what in me lies to help thee to the true knowledge of thy self, let me first advise thee to look carefully into thy own heart, for that's thy su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest way, if thou art but well acquainted with the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thereof, and wilt deal impartially. And in this searching into the state and temper of thy Soul, I would wish thee to put these questions to thy self which I shall ask thee, and to give in a true answer.</p>
               <p>I demand of thee then, what is that great good on which thou hast plac't thy highest love? the obtaining of which thou hast made the great business of thy life, and which if thou couldst but attain to, thou believest thou shouldst be satisfied and made perfectly happy? Canst thou say, and that truly, that God hath the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107818:49"/>
place in thy heart, that his Authority swaies thee most, and that, for the main, all things that concern thee are regarded but in order to him? Dost thou make it thy principal study and trade to please him? And dost thou count of nothing as fit to make thee a portion but his everlasting love? If it be thus with thee, then thou maist safely conclude that indeed thou hast made God thy chief end. But enquire diligently whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not quite otherwise, and whether thou hast not set up thy <hi>self</hi> in a distinction from God, becoming thy own Idol? Art thou not possest with high thoughts of thy <hi>self?</hi> loving and admiring thy <hi>self</hi> separate from him who gave thee thy being? Its true, the man who is most heartily devoted to God hath the greatest love and veneration of himself, but it is as he is Gods creature; and it is his soul which hath his highest esteem; and he seeks his happinesse by subjecting himself to God, and therefore preferres, adores and admires God infinitely above himself, regarding himself in and for God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it the end of his being to serve his Makers will, &amp; desiring no other felicity, than the feeling of that love of God which he manifests to all such humble o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient ones. But the carnall man, though he may have some reverence for God; and may yield him some tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of service, some prayers, some praises, and some subjection, yet all this is but in order to his <hi>carnal self,</hi> for the procuring for it, such things as cannot be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God; so that God is regarded but as a means to <hi>Self,</hi> and with a respect hereto is all his service of God, for the manner and measures of it, fram'd and limited. Thus may the covetous man, whose chief end is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich <hi>himself,</hi> pray to God for riches, praise him for riches, be so far just and charitable as he thinks may forward his thriving; yea he may be in all things so far religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as hinders not his chief end, but let this once come


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107818:49"/>
in competition with any duty to God, so that by ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him he should impoverish himself, you shall soon perceive what is his God, and what rules him most, as you have an example in the young man that came to Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.21, 22. wherefore examine, I say, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art not a lover of thy <hi>self</hi> more than God. Does not thy own will and fancy ordinarily guide thee in thy actions and affairs? and is not that course taken which most conduceth to the interest of thy flesh? should'st thou not then account thy self well enough provided for, if thou wast but compleatly furnisht with all that in the world, which tends to the accomplishing and gratifying of man as he is an inhabitant of the earth? And is not thy labour most for, thy desire after, thy delight in such things as tend to the pleasing and advancing thy self in the world? Hast thou not been most taken up in making provisions for thy flesh, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thy self, that to be happy, was to live a merry life, and take thy ease and pleasure; or else to get more money than thy neighbours, and to have more respect and esteem, that wherever thou goest thou maist be praised and admired? Hast thou not taken those for the happiest men that have the greatest share of these things? and hast thou not therefore envied them? and hated them if they have stood in thy way and kept thee from the like? Reader, what saith thy conscience to this? Doe but hearken and it will speak plain, and tell the truth. Sure thou canst not but know what thou makest the great end of thy life, what it is for that thou desirest to stay in the world; what thou risest for every morning, and for what thou goest into this company and that, and takest all thy journeys, and wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployest thy hands and head. All this is either for God or for carnall Self principally: for there cannot be two chief ends. And if thou art one that livest to, and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizest


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107818:50"/>
thy self, for shame take not on thee to love God above all as thou usest to doe: for indeed thou dost not truly and properly take him to be God, nor thy God.</p>
               <p>Again, let me ask thee, hast thou ever found in thy soul powerfull and prevalent convictions, that thou hast no way to attain true happinesse, nor to escape misery but by the Lord Jesus Christ? And hast thou thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heartily consented to his offers, and to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he hath appointed for the saving of thy soul, being willing to be taught and govern'd by him, onely hoping for pardon of sin, grace and glory, to be given to thee by God through him, and for his sake? Put the question to thy own heart, didst thou ever yet see an absolute necessity of Christ, so that thou took'st thy self for an undone creature without him? And hath thy soul been kindly and thankfully affected with this amazing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of love, that God hath shown to poor helplesse sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners through his Son? Hath it warmed and rejoyced thy heart to consider it? Thus in some good measure will it be with thee, if thou art a true believer in Christ. And this depends upon the former: for if thou hast taken the everlasting enjoyment of God for thy chief happinesse, thou wilt then be ready to comply with that way which leads to this end: and that's onely shew'd to us in and by Christ, who is himself the <hi>way to the Father,</hi> and <hi>none can come to God but by him.</hi> And when thou art once thoroughly perswaded of this, thou canst not but willingly resign thy self to him, consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be sav'd by him on what terms, and in what way he shall appoint and prescribe to thee: and this firm and prevalent consent of thy soul is true and saving faith, to which the pardon of sins and everlasting life is promised. This is <hi>coming to Christ, receiving him</hi>; and severall other way it's exprest in Scripture, but most commonly call'd our <hi>believing in him,</hi> which includes


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107818:50"/>
in it, our trusting to him for all mercy, our hearkning to his teachings, and our resolution sincerely to obey his commands, and imitate his example. Examine thy self well then, whether thou hast such a sound faith wrought in thee or not. Hast thou not rather contented thy self with a sluggish, unfruitfull belief, that Christ is the Saviour of the world, without ever minding thy own particular need which thou stand'st in of him? nor ever making enquiry what he would have thee doe to be saved? Have not thy eyes been so far blinded, that thou never yet saw'st so much evil in sin as should make thee look out for a deliverer, and prize him who hath done so much to redeem thee? but canst make shift well enough to live without Christ, so thou canst but get those things which thou now takest to be more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for thee, in order to thy happinesse. Thus will it be with thee if thou hast set thy heart upon the pleasing, and advancing of thy carnall self; thou art not then like to see any great need of Christ, or any excellency in him that should make him desirable: for he came not into the world to help carnall wretches to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their idols, but to turn their hearts off them, to the living and true God. And therefore as they who have chose this God for their portion, doe make it their great work to get an interest in Christ the Mediatour, and doe live upon, and make use of him to bring them to their portion, so they that have made the pleasing of their flesh with any worldly thing their ultimate end, they are diligent in the using of all means that may help on this their base end. The voluptuous, bruitish sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hunt after sensuall pleasures in their meat and drink, wantonnesse, sloth, excessive sports, and merry joviall company. The covetous man who hath a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy insatiable fancy to gratifie, wholly spends himself in treasuring up wealth, and he tasts sweetnesse in nothing


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107818:51"/>
but his gains. His Bonds and Bills, and Leases are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things to him than the Covenant of Grace; and his Houses, and Lands, and Money, more precious than the Blood of Christ. And so the proud and ambitious that would fain have much esteem and honour in the world, (which is the most naturall vice to almost every man) they pursue their design by labouring to get into high places, to make great men their friends; recommending themselves to the world, by their sumptuous Houses, great Retinues, rich Cloathes, gentile deportment, and the like braveries; others by their strength, beauty, wit, learning, and the like accomplishments of body or mind. Thus you see, according to the nature of mens happinesse, they make use of means to reach it. Search well therefore, whether some of these or the like empty trifles have not been more set by, and laboured for, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore I beseech you to remember, that nothing will prove you sincerely in


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107818:51"/>
Covenant with Christ, as one of his living members, but a thorow, stedfast willingnesse to be brought to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse by him in his own way, and let it be your care to examine whether you are thus heartily willing.</p>
               <p>And then lastly, hast thou submitted thy soul to the powerfull workings of the Holy-Ghost, to renew and regenerate thee? Hast thou faithfully rendred up thy self to him, to be transformed into the divine likenesse, to have thy corruptions purged away, and all saving gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces implanted in thee? It is the office of the Holy Ghost to carry on Christs interest in the souls of men, to <hi>fulfill all the pleasure of his goodnesse, and the work of faith with power,</hi> to bring them to the Father by the Son. No man can <hi>cry Abba Father,</hi> and be fill'd with a child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like disposition and nature, but he who hath received this Spirit of Adoption, and no man can <hi>call Jesus Lord,</hi> and be heartily subject to him, but by the help of this almighty Spirit. He shews men the vanity of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the goodnesse, the fulnesse, and all sufficiency of God, and enables the heart firmly to cleave to him; He convinces men of sin, and shews them the odious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and danger of it, and discovers to them a Saviour, by whom they may be Redeemed from all their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, from the dominion, and from the condemnation of sin: and he begets in the soul a saving faith, making men not onely willing but earnestly desirous to accept of Christ to both these ends. Reflect upon thy self then, whether thou hast experienc'd any such workings in thy soul or not, whether thou art changed by this divine power into a new and heavenly nature, and art hereby become <hi>a new creature, as all in Christ are, old things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done away.</hi> Hast thou ever found the vigorous and warm movings of this holy Spirit upon thy heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying light and life to thy dark soul, <hi>dead in trespasses and sins?</hi> Hast thou carefully cherisht these motions,


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107818:52"/>
and complied with this sanctifying work, which spread<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it self through the whole man? And art thou willing to be governed by him, to hearken to his voyce within thee, and to that word which was inspired by him to be a lamp to thy feet? If these things be so, then indeed thou hast performed the engagement that was laid upon thee, by being baptized into the name of the Holy Ghost. But call thy self to account, whether it hath not been quite otherwise with thee. Dost thou not still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the carnall selfish state, alienated from the life of God through a blind mind, and a wicked stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born will, being still at enmity with him? Hast thou not quenched the Spirit, and stifled convictions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted his operations upon thy soul? Art thou not rather guided by the seducing spirit and thy own unmortified lusts? Doe not these still remain in strength and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, so that whatever they draw thee to, must be done, let the Word and Conscience say what they will? If it be thus, never boast of having God to be thy Maker, nor Christ thy Redeemer: for if thou art not sanctified by the Holy Ghost, God will never own thee for his, who accepts of none but an holy people.</p>
               <p>Thus by looking carefully into your hearts, you may discern whether you are truly in covenant with God or not. And if this seem any matter of difficulty, to know what your hearts are: or rather, least you should pretend your hearts are thus right when it is no such thing, I shall give one instance more whereby you may know how you stand related to God, and that is by the consideration of your lives and conversations: for, if you are sincerely devoted to God in your hearts, then you must needs shew it in the holinesse of your lives, which is nothing else but the keeping of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which is made betw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107818:52"/>
it your chief happiness to <hi>see God.</hi> If you are patient and unwearied in well-doing, it's a sign you seek for honour and glory with God. And if you keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Christ <hi>endeavouring to walk as he walk't,</hi> it's manifest that you love him and believe in him. <hi>If you bring forth much fruit, hereby you and all men may know that you are Christs Disciples, that you are living branches of him, the true Vine; then have you received Christ if you walk in him.</hi> And if you shew forth the fruits of the Spirit in your lives, it's a sure token that his graces are sown in your hearts. <hi>If you are led by and walk after the Spirit,</hi> then indeed the Spirit is with and in you, and <hi>you live in him, Gal.</hi> 5.25. But on the other hand, it's as certain thou art a stranger and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liene from this Covenant I have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore described, if thou be one that servest the Devil rather than the true God. Make what profession thou wilt to love God and believe in Christ, if thou allowest thy self in any one known sin, all thy great pretences will at length come to nothing. What, doth that man <hi>love the Lord,</hi> who <hi>doth not hate evil?</hi> Nay, who delights in that which the Lord abhorrs, and wherewith he is griev'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokt to fury? Doth hee take Christ for his Lord who will not be obedient to him? Doth he take him for his Physitian who would not be heal'd, but had rather keep his diseases? Beware as thou lovest thy soul of that dangerous mistake, that thy belief in Christ may serve turn well enough for thy salvation without an holy life: for if thou leadst not an holy life, it's most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thou dost not truly believe in Christ. For it is not enough to prove thee such a Believer as shall be saved, to trust in Christs merits and hope God will be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to thee for his sake, but it is also of absolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity that thou believe in him as Prophet, and King, and accept of him to teach and govern thee, if ever thou


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107818:53"/>
hope for any saving benefit by him: and therefore thou must believe his Promises and threatnings, and faithfully endeavour to yield an universal obedience to his Commands, and to follow his footsteps; So that to say thou hast a good faith in Christ whilst thou livest an ungodly life, is as flat a contradiction as to say, thou art faithfull to thy Prince whilst thou risest up in arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: and so much as an oath of Allegiance and fidelity to their Soveraign doth tye men from Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so much doth saving faith bind them against wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse. And to talk of keeping thy faith firm whilst thou livest in disobedience to thy Lord, is as if a Wife should say, she was carefull in keeping her Marriage-covenant whilst she liv'd in open adultery. Thus much here I was willing to speak of this, that thou maist be the more plainly convinc't, that if thou livest in or lovest any sin, and wilt not leave it, though Gods Word and thy own conscience condemn thee for it, that then thou art not sincerely in covenant with God. Wherefore look well into thy life, consider thy ways, how thou behavest thy self towards God &amp; man, and in all thy carriage in the World. Art thou not a wilfull neglecter of thy duty to thy Maker, living without a sense or acknowledgment of him in all thy wayes, not so much as once in a day, or perhaps in a whole week setling thy self seriously to pray to him in thy Family or Closer, nor taking any pleasure in reading his word, or in thinking and speaking of him to thy own and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers advantage? Dost thou profane the Lords day, and turn thy back with contempt upon the Ordinances of God? Art thou not us'd to swearing, cursing, and taking the holy Name of God in vain in thy common discourse? Or, art thou not guilty of lying, cozenage, injustice in thy trading and dealing with men, of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and unmercifulnesse to the poor? Dost thou


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107818:53"/>
not live in envy and mallice, allowing thy self in rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, back-biting and slandering? Or, dost thou not rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously abuse the good creatures of God, eating and drinking to excess, unfitting thy self for Gods service and studying only to please thy pallat? Dost thou not pollute thy soul with wanton thoughts, discourses, and unclean practices? Dost thou not mis-spend thy time in idlenesse and vanity, carelesly wasting precious hours that should be improv'd for Gods honour, by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or doing good? Dost thou not give way to thy pride in thy discourse, carriage or attire, lavishing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and time for the gratifying of this base lust? Put such questions as these to thy soul, and answer them impartially and truly. And if thou livest in any of these or the like wilfull sins, be assur'd thou hast been false to the Covenant which thou wast entred to in Baptism: But if thy conscience can truly witnesse for thee, that thou <hi>hatest every false way, hast a respect to all Gods Commandments,</hi> earnestly desiring and diligently endeavouring in all thy waies to approve thy self to the most righteous God, longing after nothing more than that thou maist walk unblameably before him, then thou maist safely conclude that thou art one of Gods Covenant-people: and as such he will own thee, and to thee belong the priuiledges and benefits of the Covenant, and therefore the Seals of it too, so that thou hast very good warrant to addresse thy self to this Sacrament, whereby all the Promises of God are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to his people, and whereby they professe the hearty rendring up of themselves to him.</p>
               <p>By this time I hope thou seest what it is to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially in covenant with God the Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, which all are engaged to by Baptism, and which Covenant they renew at the Lords Supper, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to love God above all, and to account his love thy


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107818:54"/>
chiefest happiness; to accept of Jesus Christ as thy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saviour to bring thee to this happinesse; and to be willing to be sanctified by the Holy Ghost, and led by him in the waies of holinesse. Now, if thou findst thy self strange to all this, and didst never yet feel thy soul brought under the bond of this Covenant: my next work is to perswade thee to it, even to beseech thee deliberately &amp; seriously, but yet speedily, to make a firm and everlasting Covenant with God to be his upon his own terms, to be absolutely devoted to him in heart and life, as thou wast in Baptism. Something I shall say to prevail with thee if possible for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this weighty indispensable Duty. But by the way take notice that all I am exhorting thee to, may well be included in this one word, even <hi>Believing in Jesus Christ,</hi> which is that qualification I am now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, discovering the necessity of it in all Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants. And this I would have thee to observe, that thou maist the better understand what I mean when I presse thee to faith in Christ, as making it all one with the Covenant now mentioned: For, as I have before intimated, He that truly believes in Christ receives him in the quality and office of a Mediatiour by him to attain to that happiness which he offers to men; &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to be brought to in that way which he thinks fit to direct. Now the happinesse he offers is the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in glory, and this he hath procured for Believers by his satisfaction and intercession, and fits them for it by his Spirit, which cures all their distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and raiseth them to a perfect love of God and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to him, and so makes them capable of full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, which is their blessednesse. So that to receive Christ as he offers himself to us (which is our faith in him) not onely signifies our dependance on his merits for the pardon of sin, but also includes in it our


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107818:54"/>
love to God above all, to whom we hope to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled and brought nigh by Christ, and contains in it our resolution to submit to the working and guidance of the Holy Ghost, who purifies the heart, &amp; enables us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after holinesse till we are brought to the sight and fruition of God. I shall attempt to make it as plain as may be by an easie comparison. Suppose a King had banisht a great company of Subjects for rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him into a forreign Countrey, where they stay so long, that they have even forgot the manners and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of their own Nation, &amp; are become wild and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous like the people they converst with; and after some time this King, taking pity on his banish'd Subjects, should agree with his onely Son, that if he would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the hazards and troubles of so long a journey, he should take a chief Officer along with him, and go to these rebels, with proclamation of pardon to all such who should acknowledge their crime, and were willing to return into their own land, there to live in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and favour of their Soveraign; and in order hereto would come to this Officer to be taught by him the language of their Countrey, and how to behave themselves so as they might please their King, and be fit to be in his presence; when now the King's Son should come to these men, and shew them his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and perswade them to be ruled by him, who is come so tedious and dangerous a journey to free them from the miseries of banishment, proposing the terms on which he will deliver them, all those that believe he speaks true, and hath power to help them, and being willing to be delivered upon his conditions, doe put their trust in him, by his means to be restored to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their Prince and their former habitations, they doe by this very action manifest their love to their native Countrey, and their willingnesse to live in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107818:55"/>
to their King whom they had displeased: and doe hereby also engage to accept of this Officer that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the Prince, to teach them the language and manners of the Countrey they are about to return to. The application of this to the matter in hand is very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie: for in the same manner doth Faith in Christ, and our acceptance of him, implie our love to God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to live for ever in his favour, which is that Christ of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us, and by his death hath purchased for true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; and it implies also our willingnesse to be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by his Spirit, that we may be made meet to live for ever in the love of God.</p>
               <p>Oh hearken then and give ear, all you lost sinners, (somewhat to pursue the former comparison) all you that are the posterity of sinfull <hi>Adam,</hi> who by his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression banish'd himself out of Paradise; you that are wandring up and down in this wildernesse, and have even forgot the heavenly Countrey, as if you were made onely to be inhabitants of this lower world, here to live with the Beasts a miserable life for a while, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to die like Beasts that perish; and accordingly make it your onely work to run, and ride, to labour, and toil for such things as are needfull for this present life, without regarding that which is to come: whilst you are thus estranged from God, forgetfull of, and daily running farther and farther from him, behold a message of glad tidings, and great joy is dispatch'd to you from heaven. The great God that made you, takes pity on you, and is even grieved to see what a misery you have plunged your selves into, when he made you so happy. He is by no means pleased, that such noble Creatures, lately raised out of nothing for such glorious ends, should, through their own folly, and the subtlety of the tempter, be debased into such a wretched, sordid slavery.

Accordingly all this is done, the Son of God is come into the world, and hath abundantly evidenced his Commission from the Father, to treat with lost man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind about their reconciliation to him; for the procuring of which reconciliation he laid down his life, and being risen again, he furnished his Ambassadors with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to assure all, that <hi>life was given to the world, and this life was in the Son, so that he who hath the Son, hath life.</hi> And this is that message which the Ministers of the Gospel at this day, and to the end of the world, are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to the sons of men.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107818:56"/>
be maintained, but cashier'd and punished; and if you are but such kind of Christians, you will acknowledge it was as good you were open Infidels. Will you think it enough to prove a man your friend, that he calls you so, and gives you many good words, and promiseth you great matters, and in the mean time secretly does all he can to hurt and displease you? Even thus hath Christ decided the case, and told us who are his friends, not they that onely speak honourably of him, and pretend great esteem for him, no, but they who doe what he commands them, <hi>John</hi> 15.14. And if you will not doe thus, and yet will needs please your selves with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that you are Christians, notwithstanding, you may easily be convinced, that if your Christianity will not bring you to be listed with the friends of Christ, but leaves you amongst his enemies, its like to doe you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little service. Wherefore he is onely the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, who takes Christ in all those relations in which he is represented in the Gospel, and is willing to perform the duties that these relations bind him to. And to such a receiving of Christ I am urging you. Can you be Christians without taking Christ for your Lord? And can you doe this without you are willing to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him? Is he a Disciple of Christ that will not learn of him, and that will not believe what he speaks to be truth? To give an instance or two, Christ bids you <hi>learn of him to be meek and lowly,</hi> and if you will not doe thus, are you indeed any of his Disciples? He tells you <hi>his yoke is easie, and his burden light,</hi> and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires you to take them on you; if now you think them hard and heavy, and therefore reject them, doe you not in effect give him the Lye? He tells you he is <hi>the author of eternall salvation to those that obey him,</hi> and if you refuse obedience to him, and yet pretend you hope to be sav'd by him, can you count this believing


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107818:57"/>
in him? When he would redeem you from your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities and you will not part with them, doe you take him for your Redeemer? So that its evident you are not really, and in Gods account Christians, except you are willing to be guided by Christ to happinesse in the way which he hath revealed; wherefore you must see to come up to this, or be reckoned as Heathens and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and accordingly dealt with: and chuse you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if indeed you find any difficulty in the choice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider seriously <hi>what a kind of design it is that Christ comes to you upon,</hi> and see whether it be not most reasonable you should comply with him. He offers himself to be your Saviour, and what can you say why you should not close with this offer? Examine what hurt there is in that work of Christ upon your souls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which you are most prejudiced. He would take off your affections from earthly things that cannot sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them, and set them on things above, which will prove a durable portion. He would cure the blindness, bruitishnesse and deadnesse of your souls, and raise you to the greatest liberty and freedome of mind, and to the most reasonable excellent life whereof you are capable. He would bring you out of darknesse into light, from pain and grief to the most manly joys; he would deliver you out of the noise and tumult of your lusts and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and settle you in a sweet and steady peace. Instead of being unserviceable to God and Man, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of your selves, he would make you fruitfull and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in your generation, and your own truest friends. I speak of the present effects of his operation upon your souls, which would receive an unspeakable advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by being freed from the dominion of Sin and Satan, wherein Christ finds you. For certainly to be thus enslaved is the greatest misery that can at present befall you, as it debases and defiles you, and puts you


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107818:57"/>
out of that order in the Creation which God placed you in. Nothing in all the world can be so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to you as this: for of reasonable creatures, you are hereby become like bruits, yea in some sense worse, and instead of the image of God, you bear the image of the Devil, through your love of sin and enmity to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And doe you think there is no hurt in all this? No? not in becoming ideots and fools, living contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to, and below your reason? nor in being like the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, whom you cry out upon, and pretend to abhorre? Is it no dishonour to you to have him to be your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whilst you doe his works? Well then, I hope you have nothing to say against Christ, who comes to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you to your selves, to bring you into your right wits; to shew you your former folly, and make you ashamed of, and humbled for it, that you may forsake it: whose design is, to raise you to the priviledge and dignity of your natures, by repairing Gods image upon you which you had lost, bringing you to love that which is best for you, to beware of what would hurt you, and to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from those things that will leave you, and cannot make you happy. And if you have nothing to object against all this, much lesse can you speak against his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to keep you from misery, and make you bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for ever, if you will hearken to him, of which I shall speak by it self. Where then does the matter stick? what can hinder you from coming to Christ, who onely calls you to him to take off your load, and lighten your burden, and to give you ease and rest.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider <hi>what Christ hath undergone in order to the making of your peace with God on condition of your acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance of him.</hi> He became poor to make you rich; He became the Son of man that you might be the Sons of God; he came down from heaven to raise you thither; He entred into combats with the Devil that you might


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107818:58"/>
be enabled to conquer him. He bore the worst the world could doe, and overcame all its assaults, that you by him might overcome the world. He drank the bitter cup, the dregs whereof you had otherwise been drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eternally. When the sword of justice was even rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to sheath it self in your bowels, he came betwixt &amp; received it into his own. He willingly gave up himself to the death, that bitter, cruell, shameful death, that your souls might live for ever. He bore your sins that they might not lie on you as an heavy load, to sink you into the lowest hell. He was made a curse that you might escape it and obtain a blessing. And after all this that he that he hath done and suffered shall he be rejected? Hath he done thus much in order to your deliverance, and shall all be lost as to you, as if it had never been done? What? hath the Son of God, <hi>manifest in the flesh,</hi> shed his warmest hearts-blood to be as a Balsome for your wounded souls, and are you not willing it should be applied? Methinks common ingenuity should tell you that such matchlesse love as this should not be so sleighted. If you was taken captive by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and a dear friend should venture his own life to free you thence, sure you would be willing to return with him, though you might have great offers to stay behind, if it was for nothing else but to gratifie your friend who had ventured so hardly for you, that you might not give him cause to repent of his labour. And what? shall the blood of Christ be as it were spilt on the ground, and have no effect on thee? How hard is that rock whom this will not soften? I beseech thee, Reader, again and again, to think what Christ hath gone through to deliver thy soul from the jaws of death, and then think whether it be just and reasonable that he should reurn without his errand. I know I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned this before, but I shall not stick to inculcate it

Christ himself, <hi>Ho! every that thirsteth, let him come to me and drink; and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely,</hi> Isa. 55.1. Joh. 7.37. Rev. 22.17. Give not Christ cause to complain over thee, that <hi>thou wouldest not come to him that thou mightest have life</hi>; that <hi>he would have gathered thee as a Hen gathereth her chickens under her wings but thou wouldest not.</hi> Oh what a cutting thought will this be in hell, to remember at what cheap rates thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est have escaped that misery, but wouldest not! how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily, how certainly thou mightest have been happy for ever, but thou <hi>wouldest not!</hi> The way was shewn thee, and thou wast exhorted and besought again and again to walk in that way, but <hi>wouldest not</hi> hearken. Christ would have been thy Saviour as well others, but thou <hi>wouldest have none of him,</hi> being in the number of those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ones, who <hi>would not that he should reign over them.</hi> And how utterly inexcusable wilt thou be at the day of accounts, when it shall be askt thee, what reason thou hadst for thy not closing with Christ, when he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to have sav'd thee? what answer canst thou then make, except this may go for an answer, that thou wast fully resolv'd against it? What though thou hadst not wit or learning to improve for Christ, nor an estate to lay out for him, yet hadst thou not a will to embrace him and his tenders? Couldst thou not have loved him, and have given up thy self to him? Could men or Devils, or any thing but thy own wretched obstinacy and perversnesse have hindred this? Thou who art now reading this, who hast heard the Gospel, again and again, canst not pretend ignorance: for thou hast been many times informed, and once more let me assure thee, that if thou art willing Christ is willing, yea he is earnestly desirous of thy happinesse, and had rather thou wouldest turn and live, than go on and die: yea, he hath set himself full in the way to prevent thy damnation,


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107818:60"/>
so that thou canst not get to hell, but thou must tread him under thy feet, who stands betwixt to keep thee thence. If now at this very moment thou wilt comply with the design of Christ, to save thee in the way he hath establish'd, he will surely perform all his promises to thee. But beware of deceiving thy self, pretending that thou art willing to have Christ, and that thy heart is wholly set on him, whilst yet in thy actions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation thou art not subject to him: for the tenour of thy life will be sure to follow the bent of thy heart. If the temptations of Satan doe ordinarily prevail with thee against the commands of Christ, doth not he possess thy heart who can thus put thee upon action? If thou followest thy pleasures or worldly businesse to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Gods service, is it not plain thou lovest the world and thy flesh more than God and holinesse. Canst thou be diligent to please those whom thou hatest, and to injure and provoke, such as thou lovest best? These are too grosse pretences to passe for currant, and thy own conscience cannot but be convinced of their vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and falshood. If thou consentest that Christ alone shall be thy Saviour, thou wilt depend upon him onely for thy salvation; if thou art willing he should govern thee, thou wilt in the course of thy life yield obedience to him. If thou saist thou hast not power to be willing, prethee examine what this means but that thou art ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely unwilling, and then whose fault is that? Who is it, I would fain know, hinders thee from being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? or whom dost thou think to lay the blame on? Be assured the holy God will clear himself, if thou should'st lay the cause of thy damnation on him, as if he did not give thee grace enough to change thy heart: since thou didst not improve that measure of grace which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee, and didst by thy wilfullnesse keep out what was farther offered to thee: And thou wilt have small


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107818:61"/>
comfort in laying the fault on the Devil or thy wicked companions: thy accusations of them will be far from acquitting thy self. They shall dearly answer for what they have done, but yet thou wilt still be left liable to justice: yea thou wilt be found to belye the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if thou saist he was the chief cause of thy ruine: for he could never have deceived and undone thee, if thou hadst not been willing to hearken to him and be deluded by him. Nor could thy companions have drawn thee to sin, if thou hadst not first been in love with it: for neither they, nor the tempter, whose instruments they were, could thus prevail with them whose hearts were against it. Neither will it excuse thy rejection of Christ, to say thou never hadst sufficient reason given to draw thee to him, and that thou never heardest of any such advantages to be had by him as might allure thee: for thou shalt then be made to acknowledge, that in the thing it self there was reason, abundant reason for thy acceptance of him. But if it did not prove suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to work upon thee, why was this? Was the Gospel unreasonable, or wast not thou unreasonable in sleighting it? Was it hid from thee? If so, was it not because thou didst permit the <hi>God of this world to blind thy mind,</hi> and keep thee from the knowledge of the truth? If thou art still in the dark, is it not because <hi>thou lovest darknesse more than light?</hi> Art thou not so fully bent upon the satisfaction of thy lusts, that thou wilt hear of nothing that should draw thee from them? Art thou not slothfull and negligent, and wilt not mind things, nor consider seriously of thy sin and danger, of the love of Christ and thy need of him, and the like subjects, the meditation whereof, through the blessing of God, might have softened thy heart, and bowed thy will to a thorough compliance with the Lord Jesus.

If thou say yes, and art sincere in this resolution, then doubt not but it will be accepted and ratified in heaven: what thou hast done this hour will be recorded by God himself, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred for ever. And doe thou make hast to thy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate chamber, there more expresly and solemnly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse this thy engagement to Christ; and come to the Lords Table there to seal to and confirm this Marriage-Covenant; and let it be thy care all thy days to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue stedfast therein, and then doubt not but Christ will perform his part to a tittle.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That I may be yet the more likely to bring thee to this saving faith in Christ, which is nothing else but thy consent to be married to him, to receive him for thy Lord and Saviour, as I have before explained it, let me

entreat thee to consider <hi>the advantages thou shalt hereby receive from him.</hi> If thou ask me what these are, I may answer, they are so great that I cannot tell thee; they are such as thou must not, thou canst not fully know till thou art possest of them. He that was perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them all, might be to all eternity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing them: for so long shall the true Christian be in enjoying them. But yet least thou should'st think these were but words to draw thee on and deceive, thee, know, that I am able out of the Book of God, to tell the so much of thy gains by Christ, in a line or two, as will certainly bring thee to him, if thou wilt be rul'd by the truest reason, and perswaded to chuse what is best for thee. In one word then be assured, thou shalt have all that may make thee truly happy in this world &amp; the next for ever. <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. And what can thy heart wish for more? That very day wherein thy soul is thoroughly brought over to Christ, thou hast right by virtue of his rich promise, to all that is in heaven and earth that may be for thy good, and accordingly shalt enjoy it, as thou com'st to need it, and art made meet to receive it. So soon as by faith thou art united to Christ, the guilt of all former sins is done away, and for the future thy services shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and thine imperfections forgiven: for God is become thy reconciled Father, and will love, own and blesse thee as his Child. And canst thou want any thing who hast God to be thy Father, who owneth all things? yea, who hast him to be thy portion who is better than all things? All his attributes, his wisdome, power, truth and goodnesse will be engag'd on thy behalf, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd for thee; his works, his word and all providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces shall help forward thy happinesse. All thy outward affairs thy heavenly Father, who knows what thou hast need of, will see to and regard; at all times he will so


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107818:63"/>
dispose of and provide for thee, as shall be most for thy advantage; no affliction shall befall thee, but will prove as Physick to thy soul; in all estates and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he will be near to thee to direct and preserve thee, if thou retain thy integrity, so that neither men nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils shall prevail against thee to thy ruine. And the Holy Ghost will be thine to enlighten; sanctifie, guide and comfort thee, to assist thee in duties, and to seal thee up to everlasting happinesse. When thou diest the Lord Jesus will receive thy Spirit, and preserve thee from the roaring Lion, and the pit of destruction; and vouchsafe thee the beginnings of happinesse with himself, which shall be compleated and perfected at the great Resurrection day, when thou shalt be raised up by his power and brought into appearance, not in wrath but in mercy, and shalt be publickly owned by that Christ, whose person and cause thou didst here embrace and own; and by him thou shalt be openly justified from all accusations of Satan or the Law; and shalt be presented pure and holy into the presence of the Father, and shalt be eternally blessed in the enjoyment of all those treasures of infinite love and goodnesse, which God hath laid up in store for believers. This, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance which we come to by Christ: we are made <hi>heirs of God, yea coheirs with his own Son; we enter upon the joy of our Lord; with him we shall abide in the mansions that are in our Fathers house.</hi> Then at length we shall know all the designs of Divine wisdome and love, when they shall be accomplish'd in us and for us; and by the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we shall understand, what is that <hi>exceeding and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall weight of glory,</hi> for which there were made such wonderfull contrivances, such solemn preparations by that God who doth all things like himself, being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wise and good, Then shall we reach to, and find those <hi>glorious things that are spoken of the City of God</hi>;


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107818:64"/>
yea those things which it was neither lawfull nor possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Angels or Men to utter. To be short, thou shalt then be advanced to the utmost possible perfection of thy nature; thy soul shall be fitted for those actions and employments which are most suitable to it, even the loving and praising thy Maker, Saviour and Sanctifier; and shalt be made capable of tasting the most ravishing, satisfying sweetnesse and joy in these employments; in pleasing the blessing God, and in feeling thy self encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with the warm embraces of his dearest love. And as this thy blessedness shall be infinite and unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, so shall the continuance of it be eternall. Nor shall thy delight be once abated or interrupted through all this eternity, but be ever exalted to the highest pitch; it shall always flow, yea overflow, but never ebbe. This is the joy which hath no end, no measures or decay. This is the glory which Christ will give his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: <hi>not as the world gives, gives he unto them. This,</hi> he tells us, <hi>is the will of him that sent him, that every one that sees the Son and believes on him, may have everlasting life.</hi> Joh. 6.40. <hi>The water which he gives us to drink shall be,</hi> in those who partake of it, <hi>a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</hi> And some beginnings of this divine life now, there are brought into the soul, whilst it is made in its measure conformable to God, and is carried out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him with the strong workings of love and desire; and feels the shedding abroad of his love in it self, and lives in the joyfull expectations of an advancement to the abundance of life, the perfection of blisse which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned. And now, Reader, if thou believest all this, which I think thou must needs, except thou take the Gospel for a cheat, if then thou believest it to be true, I would know of thee, whether the invitations Christ makes thee to come to him, be not backt with sufficient motives, to prevail with all that are not quite

What is all for, in the result but this. That thou would'st make thy self blessed for ever. This he commands thee, this he beseeches thee to. And shall such commands be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey'd? shall such requests be denied? Good Lord! How strange a thing is this? That man, a reasonable Being, whose wisdome sets him above all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on earth, should be thus woo'd, thus call'd upon and entreated to be happy, and yet that he should stand dallying and deliberating whether he had best be so or not; yea, that he should peremptorily refuse to be so. Which should I most admire in this case, the distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and base ingratitude of man, or the inconceivable mercy and patience of God, so long to bear with such unworthy creatures, and so frequently to renew the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of blessednesse, and even presse it upon them? Well then, dost thou think there is any gain in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? Is there enough to be had with Christ to make him and his gifts worth the accepting? For that I tell thee still is all that is expected from thee: be but cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally willing to take him and all his benefits together, and for certain all shall be thine. Thou shalt find every promise of the book of God made good to thy comfort; yea thou shalt find ten thousand times more than ever thou could'st understand or conceive from the fullest promises, the highest expressions that ever thou mett'st with concerning the priviledges of Believers. Shall all that is said then bring thee to be one of that number or not? Dost thou know where to make a better bargain for thy self? If so, take thy own course and make thy best on't: for be assured, Jesus Christ needs not thee. His glory doth not so depend on thy subjection to him that it should be lessened in case of thy disobedience.

But before thou conclude there is any such person or thing, examine matters well on both sides, and then doe as thou seest meet, Indeed the case is so plain that the veriest child or fool almost may know how to decide it.

For thou canst not shew any true title, by virtue of a promise from God, to the least of all thy comforts: But thou standest always exposed to that wrath which thou art treasuring up for thy self against the day of wrath. Thou liest wholly at his mercy whom thou art daily provoking to fury. In all thy ways which are so defiled, the holy God beholds thee in anger, and even loathes thee for thy filthinesse. And he alone knows how short a while he is determined to wait on thee: thy glasse is running, his patience is expiring, death and judgement are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,

Whilst thou art sleeping or waking, eating or working, talking and laughing, the heavy doom hangs over thy head, and thou hast every day reason to expect the dreadfull vengeance of the Lord to seize upon thee, nothing but meer mercy hath kept it off this while, which will not always last. At night when thou goest to bed, its a great hazard but thou maist awake in flames, and never more see the comfortable light; or when thou goest out of doors, it's a question whether thou maist not with <hi>Judas,</hi> go to thy own place, the infernall mansions, before thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnest home.

Moreover in all the troubles thou maist meet with in the world, I know not what support, what comfort can be administred to thee: for there's none to be given thee from God, I am sure, whilst thou art a resolved enemy to him. What shift thou makest to get a little ease and relief at such a time I cannot but wonder: onely the remnants of thy carnall comforts, and the hopes thou hast of seeing things better, its like may help thee to some false peace.

comfort, who art a stranger to God and Jesus Christ? Into whose hands wilt thou commend thy departing soul, who would'st not whilst thou wast living resign thy self to the God who made thee, &amp; bought thee with his Sons blood? Canst thou expect Christ should now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee who would'st not be perswaded to receive him? What? receive a rebel into the kingdome of peace? A filthy Swine into the communion of Saints? No, never expect it. And if he will not receive thee who must? If heaven may not hold thee what place, will? Thou canst easily answer these questions. And when, by a resurrection to condemnation, thou art made, with all the rest, to stand in the presence of thy Judge, how wilt thou then appear before him? For the Lord's, sake, yea for thy own sake, poor sinner, thou that canst not be brought to like of Christ, nor his holy Laws and ways, not the sanctifying work of his holy Spirit, put these questions, as thou readest them, close to thy heart, What wilt thou then say to Jesus Christ for this thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and dislike of his person and government? Darest thou then justifie thy unbelief and impenitence when he calls thee to answer for it? Or who wilt thou get to plead for thee, when the onely Advocate shall condemn thee? Who wilt thou make thy friend, when he, who alone could and would have been so, is, through thy own fault, become thy greatest enemy? Dare Angels or Saints speak a word for him against whom their Lord shall speak? Or would they if they durst? No, they will approve his righteous sentence. Will the Devil take thy part dost thou think? Hath he any power there to secure his followers? Why it's he that is thy accuser, and if need be, would rather aggravate those faults which he drew thee to.

Or dost thou expect relief from thy companions in torment? Ah poor creatures, they would rather help themselves if they could, but cannot: Oh then! with what an heart, with what a countenance wilt thou hear that last dolefull sentence, <hi>Depart from me ye cursed!</hi> when thou shalt look round about and see no help, no hope, but that down thou must lie in that burning lake, <hi>which the breath of the Lord's fury like a stream of brimstone doth kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,</hi> what a posture will thy soul be in? I can tremble to conceive it, easier than I can expresse it. And when thou hast lain some thousands of years in that place of torments, what then will the workings of thy heart be? when thou hast felt that <hi>tribulation and anguish which comes upon those that work evil,</hi> what thoughts wilt thou have of the ways that brought thee thither? what would'st thou not doe for the least dram of hope in that miserable despairing state, for the least glimmering of light in that gloomy darknesse? But there is none to be had, no nor ever will be through a whole eternity: the force of which word <hi>eternity,</hi> and the meaning of <hi>Hell,</hi> is now known and felt in another manner, than when care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less sinners could laugh at the mention of them, or sleep, whilst they were preacht on. But what? canst thou not perswade thy self that there are any such torments prepared for unbelievers? If not, its to be feared thou art one of those unbelievers for whom they are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: But if Scripture may convince thee, read amongst other places, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.46. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. and then tell me thy judgement. Now indeed all this is but talk; Hell's out of sight, and the most terrible words are but wind: and therefore it is there is so little care in the world to make sure his favour who can save

them from this misery, which, because it's neither seen nor felt, is sleighted and forgotten. Should a King take a company of men out of prison, who had committed some fault worthy of death, and offer pardon to those that would be sorry for their crime and promise never to be guilty of the like, but threaten Death to those that would not; and withall should shew them pardons rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy sealed, and great hopes of money to be given to the penitent, but racks, and gibbets, and fires ready kindled, for the execution of the obstinate: Doe you think this would not easily prevail with them, when they saw in good earnest what was like to betide them? And if Christ would take this course, and shew heaven and hell, if that were possible, plainly to their eye-sight, its, like the most stubborn sinners would be awakened: but he will not doe thus, nor is there any reason he should. Since we are made men to be ruled by reason, why should he deal with us like bruits that must be led by their senses? yet because he will not take this way with them, bruitish sinners disregard him, as if they needed him not. But ah Sirs! all you that could see no need of Christ, when he was so urged and prest upon you, when shortly you shall see all the world stand before him, and shall behold the devouring flames, into which all they must be cast, who have not a part in his love, then you will see what benefit comes by Christ, then you will no longer count them fools, that took it for their greatest businesse to get an interest in him. Then, if the most passionate wishes, that you had been so wise, would doe you any good, if the loudest roarings, and bitterest cries for mercy might preval, you would think them all well spent: but alas, all will be to no purpose. Cry <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> with never so much noise and earnestnesse, if thou wast here <hi>a worker of iniquity,</hi> no other answer shalt thou obtain, but, <hi>Depart from me, I know thee not.</hi> And

thou thy self shalt be forced to acknowledge, that this Sentence is as just as terrible. For didst not thou here hid Christ to <hi>depart from thee, thou desired'st not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his ways?</hi> and is it not just he should then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee to Depart from him, as one he will not know nor own? Heaven thou didst refuse, since it was to be had on no other terms than submission to Christ, and therefore thou must needs fall into Hell, since there is no third place provided. But perhaps thou wilt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy self with a conceit that none of these things shall come upon thee, in that as thou pretendest thou putst thy whole trust in God that he'll save thee, and reliest upon thy Saviour Jesus Christ alone, to be kept by him from hell and the power of the Devil. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, I beseech thee, how thou cheatest thy soul into that misery, whence no trick or wile can ever fetch thee. Dost thou put thy trust in God he'll take thee to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when thou diest, who now allowest thy self in those very sins for which he hath threatned to turn men into hell? If indeed thou dost so, then I hope it is some promise of his that thou bottom'st thy trust upon, or else it is a vain confidence: now shew me, if thou canst, one promise in the whole book of God, that gives thee the least ground to hope for happinesse, whilst thou continuest in an unregenerate naturall estate, in love with thy sins; take thy Bible, and turn it over from one end to the other, and see if thou canst find any such place: but I could shew thee an hundred Texts, where wrath is threatned to all unconverted sinners, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such. So that in plain English, thy trust in God is no more than a wretched presumption, that he will be so mercifull as to break his word to save thee; and if indeed this word prove false, than thy confidence will not deceive thee, but if it prove true, as for certain it will, then woe be to thee, for all this pretended trust.


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107818:69"/>
And of the very same stamp is thy reliance on Christ whilst thou rebellest against him. For tell me, prethee, does the Gospel say, <hi>that every man who shall believe that Christ will save him, shall be saved by him, let his heart and life be what it will.</hi> I am sure neither Christ nor his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles ever made known such a doctrine: and if thy faith be grounded upon any other Gospel than Christ hath revealed, thou art like to go seek another heaven than that he hath promised. For he hath told thee plainly, that <hi>without holinesse</hi> thou shalt <hi>never see the Lord</hi>; that he is the <hi>author of salvation,</hi> onely to <hi>those that obey him</hi>; and that he takes off <hi>condemnation</hi> from none but such <hi>who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.</hi> Now if thou dost truly believe in Christ, thou wilt set thy self to seek for happinesse in the way that he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not in one of thy own devising: for else it is a sign thou dost not depend upon him for salvation, but on thy own fancy or Satans delusions, or whoever it is whose directions thou followest rather than Christs. If thou wast in a place where two ways meet, and one man should bid thee follow him in this way, and another should bid thee follow him in the contrary way, if thou would'st come to thy journeys end: is it not plain that thou believest him whom thou followest? Or if thou hadst some dangerous disease, and an able Physician should tell thee, that if thou would'st depend upon him, by the help of God he would recover thee, and should leave with thee such and such Physick to take, if in the mean time thou should'st take a conceit, that thou mightest be well without following his advice, and some one else should direct thee to an easier and cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er way, whereupon thou throwest away his medicines, dost thou then depend upon this Physician for cure? Thus the Lord Jesus, the great Physician of souls, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures thee, if thou wilt depend on, and trust thy self


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107818:70"/>
with him, or believe in him, he will keep thee from that everlasting death whereof thou art in danger, and to this purpose he sends his Word and Spirit to cure thee of thy ignorance and wickednesse, which is the disease of thy soul, he would bring thee to Repentance, and thoroughly purifie and sanctifie thy heart: but thou think'st this a tedious course, and wilt by no means sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, come on it what will; but fanciest thou maist be saved without so much adoe, and that forsooth by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance on Christ. Is not this a very wise businesse, to rely on the Physician for health, and throw away the Physick that should procure it? I know well enough what thou would'st have, Christ shall keep thee from hell, but yet by all means he must give thee liberty to live in sin; that is, he must let thee carry fire in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, but yet he must keep thee from being burnt; he must let thee drink poison, but yet he must keep it from griping thy bowels. But believe it, Christ came not into the World for any such ends. This he hath purchast, That no sins, great or small, shall damn the man that's tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled for, and forsakes them, and depends upon him for a pardon, and is made holy in heart and life: but not, that he who lives and delights in sin should escape misery, which is indeed a kind of impossibility. For man is in bondage, and sin is his fetters; now the Son would make us free, he would set the captive at liberty, but must he not then take off his fetters? We are polluted, Sin is our filth, Christ is the fountain opened for our cleansing: and can we be clean if we will not be purged from our filthinesse? We are slaves to Satan through our lusts, by which he leads us whither he will, Christ would deliver us from this slavery: but must he not then break these chains? Sin is the spawn or seed, hell is the fruit and off-spring: and if the seed be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to grow, must there not needs be the fruit? And


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107818:70"/>
this shews how man plainly destroys him self, whilst he will hug his lusts which are a Serpent in his bosome, presuming that for all that, they will not sting him. Man by his sins had deserved everlasting wrath, Christ came to save him from sin, and so from wrath: and if men will not believe he came to this purpose, or will not improve him in order thereto, must they not needs <hi>die in their sins,</hi> and so <hi>abide under that wrath</hi> which was before upon them, and which still follows after sin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.24. and 3.36. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God is one part as well as cause of mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happinesse, and if men wilfully close their eyes, that the light which Christ brings to the world can have no entrance, must they not of necessity remain in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? Excessive love to our bodies, and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this life which we shall be stript of, and want of delight in God and his holy service is the great misery of a soul, and doth engage it in those strifes with it's Maker, that cast men into an hell upon earth, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the unquenchable fire: and if they will not give way to the Spirit of Christ, to turn the bent and inclination of their hearts from the world to God, doe they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own certain misery? Thus thou seest how impossible it is, even in the thing it self, for all rejecters of Christ to escape damnation, supposing they are but continued in being, and left to themselves, both which, Scripture assures us, will befall the impenitent in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture state. But know moreover, to the breaking of thy heart in time, thy condemnation is like to be much more heavy for thy rejecting of Christ, than it would have been, if he had never come into the world, or had never offered mercy to thee. Canst thou in thy own Conscience think, that thou who hast been so importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and begg'd by so many arguments, to accept of Christ, shalt escape as easily as they that never heard


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107818:71"/>
of him, or but very darkly? Shall not he that abuseth ten Talents be more severely dealt with, than he who hides but one? why else does Christ denounce such woes against <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> threatning them with worse punishments than <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah?</hi> was it not because they enjoy'd more mercies and greater means for Repentance? Doe we not read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. that they <hi>who refuse to hear the Son speaking from heaven, shall much lesse escape, than they who refused to hear the Prophets of old?</hi> And of a <hi>sorer punishment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are worthy?</hi> Heb. 10.29. Though I would not have thee neglect the means whilst there is any hope, yet let me tell thee, it had been better for thee to have never heard one word of the way to salvation by Jesus Christ, than having heard to fleight and disregard it. Every Sermon thou hast heard, every Book thou hast read, and every exhortation thou hast had and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, will sink thee so much the lower into hell. These very lines which thou art now reading, if they be not improved, will, without Repentance, be remembred to thy smart another day. Be thou well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, though God be the Father of mercies, and a God of bowels, yet he takes account of the mercies he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords his Creatures, and takes notice how they improve them: and if they be abused, they shall be severely reckoned for. God will not be mocked by rebellious Creatures, nor shall his precious gifts be trod under feet, and they that doe such things escape unpunished. Above all then, how will the love of Christ in dying for them make their doom more sad, if they be not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained</hi> by this love. What torments can be great enough for the ingratitude and perversenesse of such? If thou, Reader, be one of them, I dare appeal to thy self, whether thou deservest not, for thy unbelief and impenitency, greater sufferings than if Christ had never


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107818:71"/>
died. For suppose there was a traitor, who for his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son being condemned to die, the Kings own Son should be content to have his right hand cut off (to satisfie the Law, and terrifie the people from the like guilt hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) that he might obtain a pardon of his Father for this poor man, and when he had got it, should come and tell him what he had done, assuring him, that if he will but take him for his deliverer, relinquish all his traiterous designs, and become a good Subject, he shall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have a pardon, but be taken into the Court, and there live in the greatest favour and honour: but suppose he, when he hath heard all, instead of a thankfull acceptance of his pardon upon these conditions, should kick at the hand that offers it, and turn his back upon him with contempt, asking him who wisht him to trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for him; nay worse than this, suppose, whilst the Prince is holding forth his pardon, he should endeavour with a Knife that he had got to stab him to the heart, would'st thou not think that such a wretch deserved the greatest tortures that could be devised? And more for this his latter obstinacy than for his first treason? And if thou be found guilty of the very same, yea worse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiousnesse and ingratitude against God thy Maker, and Jesus Christ thy Redeemer, will not thy own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science conclude it most just, that the heaviest judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments should be thy portion? Wast thou not liable to death, to all kind of misery for thy sin? Did not the Son of God humble himself to take on him thy nature? and then to die a most shamefull cursed death to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase thy pardon? and yet when he offers it upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, of thy acceptance of him for thy Saviour, and becoming a faithfull subject to the Soveraign Majesty, thou art so farre from being brought to this, that thou rather takest encouragement from this mercy held forth by Christ in the Gospel, to continue in disobedience to


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107818:72"/>
God, than which thou could'st not offer a greater injury to thy Saviour, to make him as it were a patron of thy wickednesse, doing far worse than they that crucified him, whilst thou endeavourest quite to pervert and take away the end of his Death, which was to <hi>redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himself a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.14. And if indeed this be thy case, canst thou say one word in thy own excuse, why all the plagues that are prepared for rebellious sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners should not be poured out upon thee, who thus scornest and abusest thy compassionate Saviour?</p>
               <p>By this time, I hope, thou art convinced, that there is abundant reason why thou shouldest accept of the Lord Jesus Christ to bring thee to the salvation he hath prepared for his people, in that way which he himself hath prescribed. That thou mightest not want argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all sorts, I have plainly told thee what's like to come of thy obstinate refusall. And now after all I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain demand of thee, whether thy heart be brought thus thoroughly to consent, that Christ shall be thy Saviour, and take his own way with thee, to keep thee from mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, and bring thee to true blessednesse? Art thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to give up thy self to him, and follow his directions, or not? Shall all that hath been said, doe nothing to encline thee thereto? Dost thou think it better to be commanded to go from Christ hereafter, than to come to him at his command for salvation here? Canst thou bear his heaviest indignation rather than his <hi>easie yoke</hi> &amp; <hi>light burden?</hi> Is there any thing in becoming Christs faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full servant worse than being the Devils everlasting bondslave. Bethink thy self whilst thou hast leisure, and cease not these thoughts till thou arrivest to a true sense of the things that concern thee, and at length art firmly resolved, without any more baffling or dallying, to bind thy self over to Christ by a firm Covenant, to be wholly

his, never to depart from him, but in all things sincerely to comply with him, and be guided by him, that thou maist escape the vengeance thy sins have exposed thee to, and obtain that glory to which he will assuredly bring thee. This is that Covenant with Christ or faith in him, which I have been all this while perswading thee to: wherein I told thee is contained thy Covenant with God the Father, to love and honour him above all, as thy Maker, Ruler, and End; and with the Holy Ghost to be sanctified and led by him.

And this is third qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification which is requisite to all Communicants. And if I should name no more, hence it may sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear who is fit to come to this Ordinance; even he that being acquainted with the Doctrine of the Gospel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Jesus Christ, believes all that is there related to be true, and is sensible of, and deeply humbled for all his sins, being stedfastly resolved, by Gods assistance, presently from this time forward to forsake them, and is unfeignedly willing to receive the Lord Jesus, to be his Saviour upon the terms of the Gospel, that is (as I shall next speak particularly) he that relies upon him alone for the pardon of his sins, and is willing to be sanctified by his holy Spirit, that he may be made fit for an everlasting communion with God, upon whom he hath placed his highest love. This is the man whom Christ will bid welcome to his Table. Wherefore, Reader, if this be a description of the state of thy soul, let not Satan, or thy own fearfull misgiving heart per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade thee, that thou art unfit to partake of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges held forth to Believers: but with a chearfull

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 9.26. —<hi>But now hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</hi> Rom. 3.23, 24. <hi>For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; Being justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi>; with multitudes of the like places. And the Bread and Wine set apart for the Sacrament, do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Christs Body that was <hi>given</hi> and <hi>broken for us,</hi> Luk. 22.19. 1. Cor. 11.24. and his Blood which was shed to procure our pardon, as you may read expresly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.27, 28. <hi>And he took the Cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it: For this is my Blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</hi> That is, This Wine doth signifie and represent my Blood, in which the new Covenant betwixt God and man is founded and establisht, and by which remission of sins and all other consequent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of this New Testament or Covenant are purchast. And those Sacramentall actions of giving and receiving the Bread and Wine to eat and drink it, doe hold forth and confirm the mutuall Covenant betwixt God and man. As it seals to the Covenant on mans part, (that he will receive Christ as he is offered, and be devoted to him, and to God by him,) I have spoken to it under the foregoing Head; and to all who sincerely doe thus, God hereby seals to them, that he will be their God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to them through his Son; and that Christ with


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107818:74"/>
all his benefits shall be theirs; and therefore as one principall benefit, that all their iniquities for Christs sake shall be forgiven them. Even as the Minister, who is here in Gods stead, offers them the Bread and Wine, whereby a crucified Christ, with the blessings he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast, are signified, so doth God make over all these to a believing soul, which doth as really and truly, though in a spirituall manner, receive Jesus Christ, by consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take him for his Lord and Saviour, as with his hand he takes, and with his mouth eats, and drinks the Bread and Wine. Now in answer to that particular priviledge, pardon of sin, which hereby is assured to us, there is required in us a dependance upon Christ for this pardon; that is, an expectation and hope, that God for his Sons sake will pardon our sins, that they shall not be charged upon us, to condemn us at the great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day, but that we shall then be cleared from all accusations, and secured from those miseries into which the ungodly shall be sentenced; and this we are to look upon as sealed to us by the Sacrament. And it is to be considered, that this dependance upon Christ for a pardon, is one part, or an effect of our saving faith in him: for they who believe that he is the Redeemer of the world, and are willing to be saved by him from their wickednesse, and so from hell, they will rely on him to obtain forgivenesse by him; and according to the knowledge they have of their Repentance and Faith, the conditions of this mercy, they will the more confidently expect it. But as it is oftentimes difficult to bring the truest Believers to this act of faith, in that measure as may give them comfort, so is it more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to beat the most negligent out of this refuge, who would cheat themselves with a conceit, that to hope for mercy through Christ is all that's required of them. But know, the pardon which God offers is not barely upon


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107818:74"/>
condition of our willingnesse to accept of Christ to teach and guide, to sanctifie and save us, which I have oft mentioned, as that believing in Christ which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel calls for, and entails salvation upon: and then they in whom this willingnesse is wrought, are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that all Gods promises, made to such as by his grace they find themselves to be, shall be fulfill'd: and therefore particularly they ought to believe, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promise, he will blot out all their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, for his sake who was bruised for them; and upon the strength or weaknesse of this perswasion doth their comfort very much depend, though not their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so much, since the want of it commonly proceeds from an ignorance of themselves, rather than an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the promises: to which I shall say something hereafter, least any should think they must not come to the Sacrament, because they have not a confident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion that their sins shall be pardoned, and therefore think they have no Faith. Now from what hath been said it farther appears, <hi>That none but penitent Believers are worthy Receivers:</hi> for to such, and none but such, doth God in the Covenant of Grace promise pardon, and therefore to them onely it is that he conveys and assures it by the Sacrament, which is a seal of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and ratifies no more than what that promiseth. And indeed none but such doe in good earnest desire or seek after a pardon: for none but they are soundly convinced of their need of it, by reason of their breach of that Law which doth accuse and condemn them. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant sencelesse sinners, that run on desperately in their wicked courses, without any thought or fear of those judgements that are ready to be executed upon them, and never take to heart how they have incensed the Divine Majesty against them, doe not use much to busie their thoughts how they should turn away this


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107818:75"/>
wrath, and prevent this misery. The fear of sicknesse, poverty, disgrace, or the like temporall evils, doth much more take them up than the fears of hell, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly their daily care is to avoid those rather than this. He that is sick prizes the Physician, whilst he that is in health, or thinks that he is so, cares little for him or his medicines. A poor prisoner that hath newly heard the sentence of condemnation from the Judge's mouth, and knows he's a dead man in Law, what would not he doe to get a pardon from the King? Or oh how thankfull would he be to the man that should doe it for him? Whilst another that knows not himself to be guilty (though he may really be so) would take himself little beholden to any one that should make him such an offer, to wit, of the Kings pardon. Even thus should you come to a stupid sinner, and be able to assure him, that God was reconciled to him, he would be very little moved with the tidings, for this is not a matter whereof he used to make much doubt, or greatly concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self one way or other: but could you surprize him with the news of a great Estate being faln to him, oh what an extasie of joy would you cast the poor man into? I confesse when these carelesse ones come to be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a death-bed, or by a fit of sicknesse, then they doe indeed earnestly desire, that their sins may be forgiven them. Notwithstanding the great affection they had to the Devils drudgery, they have no mind to receive the wages which he affords them. Though they have loved sin so well, that they would never part with it whilst they could keep it, yet since now they can keep it no longer, by no means are they willing to go to that Hell to which their sins directly led them. Loth they are to take leave of their lusts till they come to the very mouth of the grave, but then fain they would rid their hands of them: for they know, if they go together one


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107818:75"/>
step farther they are like to rue it for ever. Whilst they could cast the pleasures of sin they wallowed securely in it, but now sicknesse hath spoil'd their tast, and put them out of temper, they seem somewhat more indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to it: but especially fearing, least they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had all the sweetnesse, and that nothing but bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dregs are at the bottom of the cup, therefore now at length they would throw it out of their hand. And this I fear is ordinarily the best of a Death-bed Repentance which many build their hopes so much upon. They may be in good earnest afraid of being damned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are sorry that they have brought themselves into such danger: but what's this to an ingenuous sorrow for having offended a good and gracious God, and to a loathing of sin for its own vilenesse? which are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to make our Repentance right. And not onely at death, its like, but in time of health also, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who would be very willing to have their sins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, if it might be upon any other condition than forsaking them. If bare confession and begging of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy might serve turn, or if coming to the Sacrament might serve turn, and yet still they might live as they list, few would go without a pardon. But remember God nowhere assures pardon to any man absolutely, but upon a certain condition, which except we perform we cannot look for the promised mercy. What this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is, I have before told you, even that you should repent of, and give diligence to forsake all sin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ to be your perfect Saviour: upon no other terms therefore expect to have a pardon confirmed to you by the Sacrament, which will no farther avail you than as it receives power and efficacy from the promise, without which it is a seal to a blank paper that will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you to claim nothing. Suppose a Landlord should make you a Lease of an House, upon condition that


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107818:76"/>
you would own your self his Tenant, &amp; yearly pay him some small quit-rent &amp; should set his seal to this Lease, all this would stand you in no stead, if you denied that you was his Tenant, and refuse to pay the Rent he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Wherefore to know whether your hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don be upon good grounds, and such as will not fail you, examine whether you are such kind of persons as I have before described, whether you are humbled for, and brought out of love with every sin, and doe with firm purpose of heart cleave to the Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>To bring you thus to depend upon Christ for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, in a right manner, and upon sure grounds, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations I laid down under the last particular may be of use, since this is one part of that faith in Christ, which I there exhorted you to; that was an acceptance of him in all his Offices; this hath a peculiar respect to his Priestly Office, and is called <hi>Faith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 3.25. Onely to adde a word or two more, for the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all such who have not much laid it to heart, how to get their sins pardoned, as if they thought it was a thing of no great consequence: Consider I beseech you, whether the Incarnation, Life and Death of Christ was not a matter of huge importance to the world? and tell me, Reader, dost not think thou art as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned herein as any other man? Hadst not thou as much need of his Death as any? And therefore doth it not stand thee upon, to see whether thou sharest in the benefits of it as much as it doth any man breathing? And tell me farther, if all this preparation in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel had been made for thee onely, and Christ had come down from heaven, and suffered on the Crosse for thy sake alone, that thou mightest be saved by him on the same terms that now thou maist, and should have sent thee a message calling thee by thy particular name, assuring thee of all this, and beseeching thee to accept


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107818:76"/>
of these offers of life: dost thou think all this would have convinced thee of the greatnesse of Divine love, and of thy need of mercy? And would it have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened thee to make out after the same, and to doe all that was required to obtain it? If so, why then wilt thou not now be perswaded to the same care? Since the Gospel speaks to thee as particularly as if it named thee, and the mercy is as great, and thy need of it as much as if thou alone wast concerned in it; and thou shalt never have the lesse benefit, nay rather more, by having others to share with thee in it: but thy misery, if thou misse of a pardon, will be never the lesse, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many companions in the same sad case with thy self.</p>
               <p>Once again let me ask thee, thou who now art so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible of thy need of a pardon, that thou wilt not take pains to get it in the way thou art commanded, would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou be contented at any rates, absolutely and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly to part with all hopes and expectations of it? If thou might'st be hired with a thousand or ten thousand pounds, would'st thou for such a summe of money, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse thou didst renounce all right and title to Jesus Christ, and all hopes of mercy through him? Or would'st thou give this under thy hand in writing to the Devil, or to any man that would help thee to a great Estate? what would'st thou think of those who should doe thus? would'st thou not look upon them as most wretched forlorn creatures? Why, be it known to thee, if through negligence and stupidity thou seek not out after an interest in Christ, that thou maist be pardoned and saved by him, thy condition will at length be found as miserable as theirs. If there should be certain acres of ground in <hi>Ireland,</hi> promised to any one that would go thither to possesse them, he that would not take the pains to go over, would have no more advantage by

                  </gap> thereto: Even so by carelesnesse and sloth maist thou lose all benefit by Christ, as certainly as those poor creatures that are drawn to make compacts with the Devil, and sell away their souls for a thing of nought.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if nothing I have hitherto said will move thee, consider, I entreat thee, whether this thy undervaluing of pardoning mercy will remain always. Sins thou hast I know thou wilt acknowledge, yea, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great sins, such as would sink thee to the lowest hell if they be laid to thy charge: Dost thou not grant this? And thou canst not but know, that there will at length come a day of reckoning for these thy sins: and dost thou think when thou must stand before the Judge, and give up thy account, that thou shalt not earnestly desire a pardon then? will it then seem as indifferent a thing as now it does? Then, I say, when without it thou must be sentenced to keep company with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, in the midst of scorching flames, for ever and ever. And thou canst not sure be so ignorant as not to know, that none shall have a pardon <hi>then</hi> but those who got it <hi>now:</hi> that's a day for examining and declaring what our estates are, whether good or bad, that we may be dealt with accordingly, not a time for getting them made better, if they were naught before. Wherefore if thou beest not a very bruit, onely to mind what's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee; if thou hast any foresight, any belief of this Judgement-day that thou art going to, now rouze up thy self, and with all speed and industry labour to get that pardon, which within a while, to thy own most lively sense will be so needfull, and stand thee in so much stead. And when thou art wrought to such a sight of thy misery as makes thee desire after mercy, and to such a loathing of thy sins as fits thee for it, then thou maist be assured, that God for Christ sake will be


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107818:77"/>
gracious to thee, and thou maist comfortably addresse thy self to the Sacrament, and take it as a farther assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from God, that his promises of mercy shall be made good to thee.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. The second benefit is Sanctification.</head>
               <p n="2">2. THe second great benefit purchast by the Death of Christ, and held forth in the Sacrament, is <hi>Sanctifying, Saving Grace,</hi> for the enlivening and strengthning the souls of Believers. There is no truth more plain in the whole Gospel, than that one great end of Christ's Death was, to obtain from the Father, that the holy Spirit should accompany the proclaiming of the Gospel to enlighten the minds and soften the hearts of those who should not wilfully resist his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that they might entertain the truth in the love thereof; and that on these, greater measures of grace should be poured forth, to make them in all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to their Maker according to the capacity of their natures: which was the great design of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, even to restore apostate creatures to the image of God wherein they were created, that so they might be made meet for his service here, and the fruition of him hereafter. A most lamentable mistake it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Christs death onely to the procuring of a pardon, and keeping sinners out of Hell, since this was but in order to a work of grace on their hearts, and onely such who submit to this work shall at last have a share in the absolute pardon. For suppose a company of prisoners were taken in Warre, who being weak and wounded, cannot return into their own Countrey, but must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107818:78"/>
be put to death by the King that took them; and in the mean time comes their own Prince, and pays a great sum to obtain, that the execution of them may be put off for some time, and that his Physician may use me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and apply plaisters to as many as are willing, and that all such, when they are made whole, shall be sent to their own homes: and the rest who will not be ruled by the Physician, but spit out his potions because they are bitter, and throw away his plaisters, because they make them smart, they are to remain in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and be put to death as they were sentenced. Here we see the ransome that was paid, was first to stop the slaughter of the prisoners, and to get liberty to use means for their recovery to health and soundnesse, and secondly to obtain, that the recovered should be set free to return to their own Countrey; and not onely the contempt of the ransome, but of the Physician, would bring death. Thus had we by the Fall, both brought our selves into danger of present destruction, and disabled our souls, that we could not return to that state whence we fell; but the Son of God undertaking our Redemption, obtained for us, that the sentence of condemnation should not speedily be executed, and that there should be assured hopes of escaping destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and returning to happinesse, for all those who make not their condition desperate, by continuance in sin, and rejecting of the cure which his Spirit would work upon them: now the work of his Spirit is to plant and encrease grace in their hearts, to heal the diseases, and remove the weaknesse which sin hath caused, that they may be enabled to walk in the ways of holinesse to their everlasting rest; and the sending forth of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Spirit was the fruit of his blood: Now as it will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly damn men to despise the blood of Christ, as if it was of no force to be a ransome, nor to attain those


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107818:78"/>
ends for which the Gospel saith it was shed, so is it as dangerous and damnable to resist and sleight the Spirit of Christ, let them pretend what esteem they will for his blood. A like mistake also it is, flowing from the former, to limit the notion of <hi>free grace</hi> to meer pardoning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whenas it includes sanctifying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> so: for in the instance now given, the Physick I hope was as free a gift to the prisoners, as the ransome that was paid for them, notwithstanding this was without them, and the other to be taken into them. And in like manner is the giving of the Spirit into us, as purely from the grace and mercy of God (though merited by Christ) as the giving of his Son for us, &amp; accepting of us for his sake. This I was willing to hint, least any when they hear or read of being saved by <hi>Free grace,</hi> should dream of a salvation to be had by a meer pardon, without being sanctified by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>That the making men holy in their hearts and lives was a principall end of Christs Death, without which no happinesse is to be attained, is, I say, a truth so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the very tenour of the Gospel, that it may seem needlesse to produce particular proofs; yet amongst the rest read these few, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. —<hi>Christ loved the Church and gave himself for it, that he might sanctifie and cleanse it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that it might be holy and without blemish.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.8. <hi>The Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the Devil.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.24. <hi>Who bare our sins—that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousnesse.</hi> Tit. 3.4, 5, 6.—<hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.</hi> Read also <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.75. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Galat.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12, 13, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. Now though I acknowledge it is by the help of the Spirit, that we are brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107818:79"/>
for faith it self is the gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. yet I think we shall ordinarily find the promises of the Spirit, to be made to those who are already Believers, to advance and carry on the work of God upon their souls. And to this end, and of this nature is that Grace which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and given forth by the Sacrament; even to refresh and nourish the souls of Believers, to confirm and encrease those graces that are wrought in them. and to bring them forward to farther degrees of perfection. And this much the very elements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do teach us: for as Bread is the support and stay of life, and Wine that which makes glad the heart of man, and both are needfull for the maintaining of life and encreasing our strength, so are the Body and Blood of Christ alike necessary and usefull to our souls: for he himself hath told us, that his <hi>flesh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed, and that he who eats his flesh and drinks his blood dwelleth in him, and hath eternall life,</hi> with much more to the same purpose, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. The proper meaning whereof as will appear by the Context, and the occasion of that Discourse, I suppose, is, That they who believe in him, having the same expectations of spirituall life from him, that they have of temporall life from their food, and accordingly receive, digest and improve his doctrine, hoping for remission of sins through his Blood, giving entertainment to his Spirit, and are filled and fed with those graces which he gives out, that all such shall live forever. And then in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary sense, these words may be applied to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; so farre as this faith in Christ, whereby grace is expected and derived from him, is here particularly acted: for thus he who in the Sacrament eats the flesh and drinks the blood of Christ hath eternall life; that is, he who comes with that fitnesse of soul as to be made partaker of the blessings and mercies hereby presented,


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107818:79"/>
and earnestly desires, that of Christs fulnesse he may receive suitable supplies of grace. To the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose seems the Apostle to speak, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>The cup of blessing which we blesse, is it not the communion of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> blood of Christ? and the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are one body.</hi> As if he should have said, Hereby we have a communion with Christ himself, we professe our relation to, and interest in him; and the benefits which come by him are communicated to us who truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; his Spirit is diffused and shed abroad up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and thereby we, who make up one mysticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whereof he is the Head, being united and ingrafted into him, as members doe live by him, being acted and upheld by that life and vigour which he gives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to us.</p>
               <p>Since then here is spirituall food, sanctifying grace held forth and communicated to souls rightly disposed, this farther informs us what kind of persons Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants ought to be. The dispositions of soul particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly suited to this benefit are, 1. <hi>An earnest desire after grace to be given in,</hi> and 2. <hi>A resolution to improve this grace received.</hi> Hither Christians are to come, earnestly longing to have communion with Christ himself, who is not onely the Master of the Feast, but the very food whereupon the Believer lives; and this communion we have by his liberall communications of the graces of his Spirit to necessitous souls. This desire of grace is that which is signified by those expressions of <hi>hungring</hi> and <hi>thirsting,</hi> which we so often meet with in Scripture: answerable to which the spirituall things desired are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by things to be eaten and drank, as by Bread, Meat, Milk, Water and Wine.

                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:107818:80"/>
this Ordinance: which teacheth us, <hi>that none are fit to come, who have not already received such beginnings of grace, as may cause them to long for more</hi>; who have not such a spirituall life wrought in them, as may put them upon care to have this life supported and increast. None can feel hunger but they that live; none can desire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter greater measures of grace, who have not in some sort known and tasted the sweatnesse and excellency thereof. But no humble souls need therefore be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, as if they were not worthy to feast at this Table, where none are welcome but such as have true grace wrought in them, since they may be confident of their acceptance, if they can really find in themselves an appetite to the provisions made for them, an hearty and sincere desire that their spirituall wants may be supplied, their weaknesse strengthned, and all their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers healed: and what true Christian, whose grace is never so low, but finds in himself a love to, and a longing after more? But this indeed condemns those who feel no need of any nourishment for their souls, and therefore either wholly neglect Sacraments, and other means whereby it is to be had, or else come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Stomach at all, and content themselves with the shell and outside of the duty, which will never feed them. These full souls that loathe the honey combe are like to be sent empty away, whilst the hungry onely shall be filled with good things. Now to such sickly, listless souls, that even nauseate the most wholsome food, I would say something briefly in order to their cure, to bring them so farre into frame that they may come with quickened appetites, and enlarged desires to the Lords Table, as perceiving there are such good things here to be had, which they doe most of all stand in need of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In order hereto, labour <hi>to get sensible what needy


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107818:80"/>
empty creatures you are</hi>: for till then you are not like to seek out for a supply. Consider, I mean, chiefly how to destitute you are by nature, and to this very day, of that which is the true riches, the beauty and dignity of the soul, in that you are so unlike to God, so full of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and wickednesse, so empty of that Spirituall wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that holinesse, humility, heavenly-mindednesse, and the like excellencies, which alone can render you amiable in the sight of your Maker. You cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, if you have well studied your own hearts, that you brought into the world with you, all that grace which is of absolute necessity, to perfect and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish your natures; and it is too sad a sign you are still without it, whilst you have no more mind to those means which God hath ordained for the conveyance and increase of it. How happy a thing now was it, if you were but throughly convinced of your own wants! when you doe but perceive you need food, or rayment, or physick, how industrious and impatient are you till you have one way or other, got what you would have? And thus ardently desirous would you be after the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods Spirit, if you did rightly apprehend, that these are the food, and cloathing, and physick of the soul. But alas, how doe people generally labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the sottishnesse, and self-conceitednesse, which was charged upon the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Church, that <hi>thought her self rich, increast with goods, needing nothing, and knew not that she was wretched and miserable, poor and blind and naked,</hi> Revel. 3.17. 'Tis one of the greatest difficulties in the world to bring men to judge of their poverty or riches by the temper and frame of their souls; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that they are poor and needy whilst they are gracelesse, though they should overflow in wealth and abundance of all externall things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherefore in the next place, let me advise you


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107818:81"/>
to <hi>beware of a secret mistake which ruines millions, in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that outward comforts may serve well enough to make amends for all your necessities</hi>; that the husks of worldly enjoyments may serve, instead of the bread that is in the Fathers house. Oh take heed of inordinate thirsting after these puddles, or of wallowing in them. Doe not so eagerly pursue such unsatisfactory trifles as carnall profits and pleasures, which divert you from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of those things that most concern you; but examine well what there is in them to doe good to an immortall soul, which you cannot but account your best part. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware then of being so devoted to the pleasing of your flesh, that you should be thereby stupefied to a regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse of your soul. The luscious fare which the world affords, cloys the mind of man, and spoils his appetite, and puts him out of relish with his own most proper food. This is the undoing of the most, they are so full of the creature, if not in their hands, yet in their hearts, that they have no mind nor room, to entertain any thing of God there. Every man breathing finds himself a needy creature, that cannot live upon himself, but must have something from without brought in to give him satisfaction: but then the misery is, they think their wants are all of that nature, that things here below may supply them. The poor think, there is nothing they need so much as better food and raiment, more plenty and ease and esteem in the world; and they who abound in these things, because they see others excell them, think they want such and such greater Estates and Dignities to make them happy. Though they find after all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, that still they are restlesse, discontented, and wanting something else, they scarce know what: which might convince them, that it is onely from God they can receive satisfaction, by having their natures perfected with those graces which may fit them for that


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107818:81"/>
communion with him in love and delight, wherein the soul of man can onely find rest and contentment. This, I say, they might learn from those restlesse infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of their own hearts, if they would but heedfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the nature thereof: but being more cruell to themselves than any parent to his child, when the soul calls for bread they give it a stone; endeavouring to put it off, with those things that concern the body alone, whilst that within them, which is most needy still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains so, and is suffered to pine and starve. As if an hungry man should fill his mouth with meat, and let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing down into his stomach. Whilst you are fondly endeavouring to quiet your minds, and accomplish your selves with any thing that is without your souls, be it riches, pleasures, honours, friends, and all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations of the outward man which the world most dotes upon, you are as verily besotted and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as he that thinks to ease a violent pain at his heart with putting on a rich Suit of Clothes: or to supply the want of enlivening blood and spirits by painting his face. Your necessities and diseases are deep and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; your very souls are out of order, and nothing in the world will doe you any good but what gets within you, and changes your apprehensions, desires and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and makes you quite other persons than now you are. Wherefore I would beg you to fix this truth deep into your minds, <hi>That since you are become poor and naked through the losse of Gods image, which was the riches and beauty of the reasonable creature, it's never like to be well with you, till you be again restored to his image: which is by being brought to the knowledge and love of him, to an universall submission, and exact conformity to his will,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And when you are brought to this knowledge of your wants, and the nature of them, then consider well, <hi>that it is by Jesus Christ alone that you can be satisfied and


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107818:82"/>
supplied. The Law was given by</hi> Moses, but <hi>by him comes grace and truth,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.17. He is the Mediatour through whom, and for whose sake we receive from God whatever our souls stand in need of. He by his death hath purchast all things necessary for our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he is ascended on high, and hath received gifts for his people. As King and Head of his Church, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to his members those graces, that by his death and intercession he hath obtained for them, and they are replenisht with the fulnesse of him who filleth all in all. And then you are to take notice, that Christ hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed duties to be performed by us, and set up Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which we are diligently to attend upon, and by his Spirit accompanying them, he conveys grace to the hearts of those that are conscionable in the use of these means. Such are hearkning to, and meditating upon the word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them by thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. <hi>As new born babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby.</hi> And prayer to the Father in his name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. —<hi>How much more will your heavenly Father give the Spirit to those that ask him.</hi> Jam. 1.5. <hi>If any man lack wisdome let him ask of God, who gives to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.</hi> Such also is the Sacrament of Baptisme, being duly improved, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>For as many of you, as have been Baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</hi> Rom. 6.3, 4. 1 Pet. 3.21. And lastly this receiving of the Lords Supper, which is our feeding upon Christ who is the Paschal Lamb sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for us, and herein to believers in a spirituall sense, is afforded a communion of the body and blood of Christ, as we may find in the Apostles words before mentioned. And when you have but arrived to a sence of your own indigence and Christs fulnesse suitable thereto, there will necessarily arise in you, desires after


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107818:82"/>
a participation of that fulnesse, which will bring you to, and prepare you for those Ordinances wherein these desires may be gratified.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I would advise you to <hi>beware, of ever enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a conceit, that you are become so full now, that you need nothing:</hi> for that's a plain sign you are poor and know it not. Your stomachs are filled with wind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of solid meat. And whilst you are puft up with this self-conceit, you will be hindred from seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after what you really want. He that thinks his Barns full when they are empty, may through this mistake first lie in idlenesse, and after come to beggary. He that dreams of such a perfection, as makes all helps Christ hath appointed needlesse to him, neither knows himself, nor considers what a God he hath to serve, nor what a Law he hath given him to walk by. It's much to be feared, that he who thinks he hath grace enough, hath yet got no saving grace at all. He that knows enough is very ignorant, he that's humble enough is still excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding proud, and so of the rest. For <hi>he that hath tasted that the Lord is gracious,</hi> longs after fuller commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him. He that drinks of the water Christ gives, though his sickly thirst after creatures will be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet will such a thirst after more of Christ arise in him, as will never be quencht, till he be drencht into the ocean of grace and joy. Wherefore study thy self, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the duty of this whole present state, wherein we are enjoyn'd to grow in grace, and learn hence so much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, so much wisdome, as to own thy necessities, and not go about to cover them: for they will not always be hid, but rather use all means to supply them whilst they are afforded.</p>
               <p>And as there is required in all Receivers an earnest longing, after sanctifying grace which is here vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed; so the other qualification suitable hereto, I told


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107818:83"/>
you, is a <hi>Resolution to improve this grace</hi>; that is, to lay it out, and shew forth the fruit of it in an holy conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is an effect of the former, and indeed neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily flows from the nature of grace, which is no way desirable but for use and exercise: not is it possible that in should ordinarily lie still in the heart, and not be brought forth into act, and shewn in the life. He that desires patience, humility, purity, temperance, to what purpose is it but to overcome the temptations, which he meets with in the world to the contrary vices, and to shew forth these fruits of the Spirit in all his converse? Whence it appears, that no man is wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. VIII. The third benefit is eternall happinesse with God.</head>
               <p n="3">3. THE last of those benefits which I named, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for us by the death of Christ, and to be remembred at the Sacrament, is <hi>eternall happinesse.</hi> It is by his <hi>resurrection from the dead,</hi> and consequently by his death, that Believers have a <hi>lively hope of an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance incorruptible, undefiled, that fadeth not away, reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the heavens for them,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.4. It was his <hi>blood that redeemed them to be Kings and Priests to God,</hi> Rev. 5.9, 10. <hi>He gave his flesh for the life of the world,</hi> Joh. 6.51. By Jesus Christ God calls us to eternall glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. He opened the entrance into Paradise which sin had shut up. It was his will not onely that they who believe in him should be kept from the place where Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan was, but that they should also be with him where he is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24, This he pray'd for, this he died for; and is gone before to prepare a place for them, and keeps them here to prepare them for that place, and being ready they shall enter into the Kingdome. He receives their Spirits when they die, and will raise up their bodies at the last day. <hi>Now their life is hid with Christ in God, and when he appears, then shall they also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with him in glory,</hi> Coll. 3.3, 4. Be we sure then, this Death of Christ cannot be remembred as it ought, if the glory purchast thereby be forgotten. How can we remember a dying Christ, but withall we must call to, mind, that he vanguisht this death, is risen again and ascended into glory, whither in due time he will exalt his people. Moreover that Covenant which is sealed to by this Sacrament, promiseth an everlasting Kingdome to Believers: and can any man forget such a benefit, even whilst he is receiving a confirmation of his right


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107818:84"/>
to it? Again here is that grace given out which is the pledge, the seed, the beginning and forecast of glory; here is the meat which endures to everlasting life: and who can forget his Journeys end whilst he is taking food to strengthen him for his travell? To conclude, here's a communion of Saints, which does in some measure shadow out and signifie that perfect communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they shall have one with another, when all the Elect shall be gathered from the four corners of the earth, and with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> shall sit down, and for ever remain in the Kingdome of God. Now hence it appears, that the worthy Receiver must be <hi>one, who hath taken the heavenly glory for his portion</hi>; who hath got a treasure above, and there placed his heart and his hopes: for none but such a one can with any life and raisednesse remember this glory which is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. He that is wont to solace himself, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation thereof, will rejoyce in every thing that hath a relation to it, much more in the remembrance of that price that was paid for it. But how can the earthworm, whose soul lies groveling upon the dust, bring himself to any affectionate thoughts of hidden treasures, which cannot be got into his bags not coffers, which he cannot so much as get a sight of. Nor can the swinish volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous sinners, that feed upon none but the muddy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of sense, take any comfort in the forethoughts of pure and spirituall pleasures, such as are prepared for exalted purified souls.

Ignorant, narrow souls have no heart to think of what shall be thousands and millions of years to come. These poor sordid spirits are so glewed to the


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107818:84"/>
little trifles of the world, that they look not so high as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Crowns and Scepters, which Christ hath in store for his faithfull followers. And they who never took much pains to secure or clear up their evidences for heaven, but have taken it for granted, that they must needs go thither at last, or counted it an indifferent thing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they doe or not, will be farre from those lively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of the greatnesse of that love which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast it, and of the excellency of the blisse it self, which are necessary for him who can rightly remember either. Now to bring those who are yet strangers hereto, to such an apprehension of the glory to come by Christ, that they may chuse it as their portion, and so be joyfully ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in the expectations thereof: in one word, I would desire thee, whoever thou art, that hast but so much common reason as to distinguish between good and evil, to consider well whether thou hast not a sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> as well as a body, and whether this soul must not remain in being and alive, when thy body is rotting in the earth, and whether then it doth not as much, yea infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely much more, concern thee to seek out for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, that may at that time make thy soul happy, than for what may now please thy senses. Yea, since thou must live somewhere for ever, think whether it is not more worthy thy care, to provide for an everlasting well-being, than for the comforts of a frail short life. If thou art thus farre convinced, then make an imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all search, whether there be any thing here below, that's able to make thee perfectly happy. Thy houses and lands, thy pleasures and honours, will any, or all of these give in all that felicity which thou desirest or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est? Are they of the same nature with thy soul? or will they last as long as it will last? must not all thy merry days at length come to an end? And wilt thou be ever the better for all thou hast enjoy'd when once


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107818:85"/>
it's over? will the remembrance give thee any satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? In that night wherein thy soul will be required of thee, what advantage wilt thou have from the goods thou hadst laid up for many years? yea or from those goods thou hadst liv'd upon the years before? When the earth and all its works shall be burnt up, where will all thy possessions and treasures be? If thou hast no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to live on, but what will be turned into flames, what wilt thou then fix upon? At that day when there shall be no marrying or giving in marriage, no wives or children, no relations or friends, whose society will afford any such comfort as here it did; when the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of Princes and great ones, whose favour was here thy shelter and thy pride, shall all be vanisht, what will thy confidence in men avail thee? Examine these or any other outward prop whereon thou leanest, and see whether it be not a broken reed: And if so, except thou art resolv'd against thy own happinesse, methinks thou should'st now onely make choice of that which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give thee cause to repent what thou didst, as all things will, but the eternall glory which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to those that love him. But he that can once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good grounds say, <hi>This heaven is mine, I shall see the face of God with joy, and live in his love for ever,</hi> may now lead a serene and chearfull life in the midst of all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences; and need not be daunted at Death it self, but rather rejoyced, as it takes him to the possession of his treasure, wafts him to his own home. Wherefore, if thou love thy life, be perswaded to aim at this highest glory; let nothing short of it content thee, think no condition hard to get it; rest not till thou hast made it as sure as thou canst that it's thine; and then having thus fixt thy end, thou maist travell on with alacrity and speed, and take abundance of comfort in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts of thy future blisse, in using all helps afforded

How formall and hypocriticall are his thanks like to be for Christ, who never yet saw, what need he stood in of him? Will he thank you for a plaister who never felt himself wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Can he have any gratefull sense, of the love that plucks poor sinners as brands out of the fire, who never


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107818:86"/>
perceived himself in any such danger? Can he be thankfull for ease and rest, who never felt his strong lusts, nor the curse of the Law and wrath of God, as any load or burden upon him? Nor can he be thankfull for the grace that is given by Christ, who had farre ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keep his sins, than be renewed and sanctified. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thanks will he return for the light who is but distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and troubled with it, and so far shamed by it, that he cannot pursue his wicked designs with that freedome and eagernesse as he could before whilst he was more in the dark, where he had still rather remain. How can he thank God for grace who rejects and despiseth it? For being taken out of the snares of the Devil, who wilfully fastens himself into them? Will he praise God for liberty and ability to serve him, who saith of his service, <hi>what a wearinesse is it?</hi> and thinks it would be better for him if he might live as he list, and never be put upon so much trouble as godlinesse brings along with it? Nor can he be thankfull for the glory to be had by Christ, who hath not a sound perswasion of the certainty and excellency of it, and who hath not firmly resolved to take it for his portion. He that knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than bodily enjoyments, and would think himself undone was he stript of these, is like to be very cold in giving thanks for spirituall blessings. In a word, he that is sensible of no great benefit he shall have by Christ either here or hereafter, cannot be expected to have any great measure of thankfulnesse for this mercy which he so little understands. And this is the case of all unhumbled, unsanctified ones, to whom the Gospel is hid, their minds being darkned by the God of this world. And if these poor senslesse creatures should with a few feigned words pretend to give God thanks for Jesus Christ, yet would it be but the sacrifice of fools, a meer lip service, and therefore no way accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107818:86"/>
to the most holy God. Yea indeed they would hereby but very solemnly mock the Divine Majesty, whilst they thank him for those mercies which they will not accept at his hands; praising him for Jesus Christ and the benefits he brings, whilst they will have none of him or them, on the terms that God propoundeth. No, no, it is onely the broken-healed heart, the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble raised soul that can be feelingly and affectionately thankfull to God for a Saviour, who hath wrought so great works for them, and in them, and laid up such great provisions for the time to come. They that were lost but are found, they that were dead but are alive, in these will their heavenly Father take pleasure, and these will rejoyce in his love, and return praise to him who sent his Son, to seek and save that which was lost.</p>
               <p>To bring men into such a state and frame, that they may be disposed and enabled, from an inward sense of his goodnesse, to render such thanks to the Father of mercies, as may be well-pleasing to him; I should one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly onely need to repeat what was before laid down to bring them to accept of Christ, which when once they are brought to, and arrived to any hopes of their acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance with God through him, then both in heart and voice, with their lips and lives will they adore and praise him, who <hi>called them out of darknesse into his marvellous light.</hi> Wherefore study well your many and great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities which Christ alone can supply. Consider to what miseries by sin you stand exposed, from which he alone can keep you. Remember what he did and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how low he condescended for the sake of man, and remember your own utter unworthinesse, that ever the least love or regard should have been manifested to you; and yet consider what great things are done for you into how good a state matters are brought, what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant blessings are freely bestowed on the humble

and believing, what rich and precious promises are made them, what mercies are given for this life and that to come, grace and glory, and whatever is good for men, nothing is withheld from them. Let but the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of all the rich and precious priviledges which Christ gives to his servants sink into thy soul, and then thou wilt find it even impossible, not to magnifie the author and purchaser of such gifts; nor wilt thou be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to refrain from expressions of thy gratitude and love; and therefore maist worthily come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there to exercise and expresse those holy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

               <p>HE that rightly remembers the Death of Christ, and and well considers the infinite love herein shewn to mankind, cannot but be thereby wrought to <hi>an hearty love to all his fellow Christians.</hi> And that's the last quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication I shall mention, necessary for all Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, and which flows from their remembrance of Christ, to wit, <hi>that they be in charity with all men, and have an especiall endeared love to all true Christians,</hi> both those that communicate with them and others. To this great duty of brotherly love we have the most forcible engagement that ever could be imagined, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our blessed Lord laying down his life for us; and his behaviour at death, even praying for his persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, doth sufficiently tell us how we ought to behave our selves towards our bitterest adversaries. We see then what a spirit we shall have wrought in us by a right remembrance of our dying Saviour, not onely toward


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107818:87"/>
our friends but our enemies themselves. As for that love that ought to be amongst all true Christians, we find this is the new Command, that he hath inculcated upon us, and obliged us to by the great example of his unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell'd love, that we also should love one another, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.12, 13. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. And this he hath made the very badge of his true disciples, whereby they should be known from the rest of the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.34, 35. And one particular end of our meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Lords Table, is to testifie and strengthen our mutuall love. This we shew by our eating and drinking together, which is the custome of friends: and this is one reason why this Sacrament is called the <hi>Communion,</hi> in that Christians have here the most endearing fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with each other. For hereby is not onely represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their union with Christ their Head, and their spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all communion with him, but that nearnesse of relation they have amongst themselves, being mystically uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into one Body, whereof Christ is the Head, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. <hi>For we being many are one bread and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.</hi> Each Christian is so related to and joyned with the other, that they go to the making up of one body, as the severall grains com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted together make one bread; and by their joynt participation of this one bread, they declare themselves to be but one body, the Children of one Father, living in one Family, and feeding at the same Table, upon the very same food, even upon Christ himself, who is the <hi>true bread that came down from heaven</hi>; and upon their being united to Christ as Head is founded this their so near and intimate relation to each other, to be Fellow-members of the same body; as they that have the same Soveraign are fellow Subjects, they that have the same Parents are brethren: And by their feeding on this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall food, and Christ himself therein, <hi>from whom


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107818:88"/>
the whole body being fitly joyned together makes increase, unto the edifying of it self in love,</hi> Eph. 4.15, 16. having here a communion with him which fills and acts them with the same Spirit; hereby, I say, they receive a farther bond and disposition to the greatest unity of hearts and affections. So that we are especially engaged before our attendance upon this Ordinance, <hi>to go our way and be reconciled to our brother. The leaven of malice,</hi> amongst all other wickednesse, is to be <hi>purged out when we keep this Feast,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7, 8. And indeed we shall find this the generall sense of people, that they ought to be in charity with their neighbours before they come to the Sacrament, whilst they discover too little sense of the necessity of other graces that are equally needful; yea, whilst they remain destitute of this very charity it self, which they acknowledge to be so necessary: for alas! they are not so easily brought to the practice of their duty as to acknowledge and commend it. For the plain truth is, none can rise up, to this excellent temper of spirit, wherein one half of our Religion consists, but he who is engrafted into Christ, and transformed into his likenesse by the spirit of love; which may d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rect those who are yet void hereof what course to take for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the same, namely to get united to Christ by a living faith and fervent love, whereby they shall find kindled in their breasts a new affection to all that doe with them love the Lord Jesus. For certainly it is not enough for us, that we have no malice in our hearts against any, nor wish them any hurt; this is a poor description of Christian charity, and may be found in a <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Jew:</hi> but there ought to be in us, beside a general love to all mankind, which makes us desirous of their good, a peculiar tender love of all Christs faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, which causeth us to take delight in them, as such in whom we behold, the image of God shining forth in


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107818:88"/>
their holy conversations, and begets in us unfeigned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires for their good both of soul and body, and makes us willing to contribute our assistance thereto, according to our ability and their necessities, inward or outward, and it inclines us to rejoyce in their good in some measure as if it was our own; and hereby our hearts are so knit to them, that we hold greatest familiarity with them, and take pleasure in their society and conference, and more especially in joyning with them in the worship and service of God. This is a most sweet affection, and the exercise of it is exceeding pleasant to a gracious soul: which, was it more common in the world, would reform it from a wildernesse into a kind of Paradise, and the perfection of it, will be one great part of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happinesse. But this true Christian love can dwell in none but such in whom God dwells, who is love. Onely they who are recovered out of the selfish carnall state, and are brought home to God by Jesus Christ, are the men that are capable of this sincere love to their brethren, for which many clear reasons might be given, was it needfull and pertinent. But this may suffice for all, that this affection is grounded upon and follows our spirituall relation, and therefore a man must first be in Christ himself, before he can love another purely as his brother in Christ, as a fellow-member of the same body. He that hath not submitted himself to his Prince, cannot love another upon account of his being a fellow-subject with him to the same Soveraign. And hence it is we find this given in as a character of our Regeneration, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Hereby we know we are past from death to life because we love the brethren.</hi> Most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that they who find not in themselves a love to any people in the world upon account of their being made like to God in Holinesse, are destitute of true love to God himself. Wherefore I would advise you to try


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107818:89"/>
your selves by this note; look into your own hearts, and look abroad amongst those you hold your dearest friends, and examine what it is that draws out your love towards them. Are they therefore dear to you because they appear to you to be lovers of God, and such as have a great zeal for his glory, because they are of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exemplary lives, and therefore (so farre as you can discern) of gracious spirits? Doe you love them as those that are bought with the same blood, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the same Spirit with your selves? As such who are helpfull to your souls, or receive help from you, and walk in the same holy way, and with whom you hope to live for ever in the same glory? Or is not all your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction founded upon carnall reasons, and bestowed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon your kindred, or such that have done you cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies in worldly matters; but as for the rest, you see no reason, why you should love one more than another. Nay farther, doe you not find your hearts secretly rise against such holy persons, as I before mentioned, so that you had rather be in any company than theirs, and could even wish the world rid of them, because their blamelesse lives doe condemn and shame yours, and sometimes their loving admonitions check and disturb you, as <hi>Lot</hi> was a trouble to the <hi>Sodomites?</hi> Are you not so farre from a reverent esteem of godlinesse, that you can rather scoff at it, though pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

4.20. Wherefore see to get your hearts deeply affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the glories and excellencies of the blessed God, and you will find your selves carried out to a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of any shadows, and resemblances of these in his people. Let Christ be once the chiefest of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand to your souls altogether lovely and desirable, and then you will count those in whom he hath copied out himself, and shed abroad his own Spirit, to be the onely excellent ones upon earth, in whom you will take great delight. You will then so fall in love with his image wherever you discern it, that in comparison thereof you will even disdain all those worldly excellencies, which doe so dazle the eyes of short-sighted, mean-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited ones. That humility, purity, reverence of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty, gentlenesse, goodnesse, and all other fruits of the Spirit, which display themselves in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the truly sanctified, will make them appear more honourable in your eyes, and render them farre more dear to you than those, who have nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to your esteem, but that they have great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, wear brave clothes, and have high titles conferred upon them: Though you must not be wanting in those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects that are due to outward greatnesse, yet if you be Christians of a right stamp, you will be such as <hi>David</hi> mentions when he describes a Citizen of <hi>Zion,</hi> Psal. 15.4. <hi>One in whose eyes a vile person is contemned, but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.</hi> Yea farther, you will see more reason for your love to those that are holy, than to your brethren or nearest kindred in the flesh, or than to those that are onely of the same opinions and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that you your selves are of, which doe lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confine and regulate the affections of the most. But the right Christian temper is farre more generous and large; for being derived from the bowels of Christ, it begets the same disposition in the souls wherein it


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107818:90"/>
dwells, according to their capacity, that is in Christ himself. And therefore they hate none, they envy none: as for the wicked miserable ones, they pity, and even mourn over them, as we find Christ did, and with patience and meeknesse are ready to give them all the help they can, to bring them out of their uncomfortable dangerous estates; but all whom they have reason to believe Christ loves, that walk as he hath enjoyned all his friends to doe, these they dearly love; And such errours or infirmities, which will not cause Christ to withdraw his favour from them, will not take off their affections: for they dare not pretend to greater strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse than their Lord, least what they might call pure zeal for him, should be found pure selfishnesse. And therefore they dare not make their own private appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, which they find not in the Creed nor in the Gospel, the standard and measure of such as must passe for godly, and be thought worthy their regard and esteem, which is the constant note of one addicted to a party: but, I say, they would have their friendship as large as their Lord and Masters, since 'tis for his sake that they have any friends at all. Such is the affection which Gods Spirit works in his people, and with which they are possest so farre as they are fram'd and moulded by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>But moreover the charity requisite in Communicants, consists not onely in a cordiall love to the godly, whom they are to reckon upon as dearest friends, but also in forgivenesse of injuries to all that are their enemies, and have done or endeavoured to doe them wrong: which temper is of flat necessity to all that would come wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily to this Ordinance. Hither men come expecting a pardon; and can he look for a pardon of his many and hainous sins from the great God of heaven and earth, who will not forgive some small offence that he may


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107818:90"/>
have received from his fellow-creature? Small, I say, for the greatest injury that can be done us by another is exceeding small, and not worthy our notice so farre as we our selves onely are concerned therein. Selfish men will never believe this, but it's a certain truth, and so plain, that many sober heathens doe with great earnestnesse inculcate it. Alas, what can they doe but a little hinder out thriving in the world, or deny us that respect we would have by their carelesse carriage, or speak meanly or falsly of us to lessen our credit? Such like trifles as these are the worst that we shall ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily meet with, from our bitterest enemies: And are these such unsufferable injuries, that by all means we must seek to be revenged? Surely such a wicked spirit cannot enter into the breast of a Christian, that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers what he hath done against God, and yet what he expects from him, and what he hath already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>And indeed there is nothing more likely to bring us to the performance of this duty to our brother, than the serious consideration of the infinite mercy God hath shown to us in sending his Son, and freely tendering forgivenesse through him. This we find prest upon us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. <hi>And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christs sake hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you.</hi> Col. 3.13. <hi>Forbearing one another, and forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one another, if any man have a quarrell against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also doe ye.</hi> And to engage us the more, our forgiving of others is made a condition of being forgiven our selves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</hi> How hard-hearted must that Servant be, who, when his Lord hath forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him ten thousand talents, takes his brother by the

throat, and casts him into prison for an hundred pence? How just is it that all the former debt should be charged by his Lord upon such a servant? as you may find in the parable at large, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. from 23. to the end, where, after Christ had told, how terribly that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull cruell servant was dealt with, he addes ver. l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That composednesse of soul, that humility, self-abasement, and humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon free mercy, which are so absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for him that would profit by this Ordinance, do all call for a quiet, charitable frame of spirit toward our brethren, when we betake our selves thereto.</p>
               <p>And thus (by Gods assistance) have I in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure shewn, from the nature and design of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, (which is to keep up the Remembrance of Christ) how those persons must be qualified who can duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thereupon. To repeat their description once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: They who are furnisht with the knowledge of the necessary fundamentall truths of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and doe believe them to be indeed truths, being so verily perswaded that Christ is the Saviour of the world, that they heartily consent to take him for their Saviour; and therefore being humbled for, and resolved presently to turn from all their evil ways, doe humbly expect (or at least earnestly desire) the pardon of their sins from the mercy of God for his sake; and are truly willing to have their hearts sanctified by the Spirit of God given out through him, that they may lead an holy life; and doe depend upon him to bring them to everlasting glory in the enjoyment of God, upon whom they have set their dearest love, and chose him as their onely portion; being sincerely thankfull for the manifestations of his wonderfull love in Christ, and by the power of this love are in charity with all men, forgiving their enemies, and having a peculiar affection to the members of Christ: These, and onely these are fit to partake of the Lords Supper. Wherefore I entreat thee, whoever thou art, that would'st not wilfully delude thy own soul, and rush upon this duty to thy hurt, take thy self to task,


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107818:92"/>
and examine well whether thou art such a one as I have here described: yea, if thou hast any desire to escape everlasting misery, and be received into heaven when thou diest, examine thy self; for except thou beest or becomest such a one, as sure as God is true, thou art never like to be saved.</p>

So large is the commission which Christ hath granted, that in his name I dare confidently invite all, whoever they are, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have been, even the most profane and sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, drunkards and whoremonger, the proud and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, if now at last you will be perswaded to bid an everlasting farewell to all your ways of wickednesse, and for the time to come to walk in the holy path, see that you are sincere and you may come boldly to the Sacrament, there to manifest and confirm these purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. If at length you are weary of that miserable drudgery, wherein the enemy and tormentour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the Devil, hath imploied you, labouring to keep you in bondage to sin, than which there is not a more loathsome stinking dungeon, more intolerable chains in all the world; if, I say, you would fain be delivered from this slavery, and will <hi>take on you Christs easie yoke, that you may find rest for your souls,</hi> come hither and enter


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107818:93"/>
your, selves into his service, engaging to be subject to him all the days of your life. In a word, all you that have been baptized into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and understanding what that signifies, doe consent to the obligations thereby laid upon you, come to the Lords Supper, and manifest this consent, and renew this covenant to be the Lords.</p>
               <p>Some considerations I shall lay before you, to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you to the performance of this weighty duty, which I propose not so much to those who are already prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they would come to this Feast; but rather to all indifferently, that they would prepare themselves, and come away without any longer delay.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To that end, first consider, <hi>this is the expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Christ,</hi> as you may find at his first institution of this Sacrament before mentioned, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19. <hi>This do in remembrance of me.</hi> And to whom was this command given do you think? onely to the Apostles, or in them to all Christians? What reason can be given why it should be peculiar to them and not common to others? They were look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon and spoke to here, as Disciples, and therefore all Christs Disciples are concerned therein. And you cannot think this was an injunction that had reference to that time onely; the very phrase <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> speaks the contrary: for this implies something that's past or absent; which shews they were to do this after the Death of Christ should be past, and he ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them into heaven, in remembrance of him and his Death. But to put the matter past doubt, we have the practice of the Apostles after Christs Death and Ascension, telling us how they understood this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: and I hope we shall find none so impudent, as to say they misunderstood it. Now though it was always wont to be accounted profanenesse, to violate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Christ, yet there are a sort of men in the


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107818:94"/>
world, that would make it a piece of religion forsooth, to contemn this his injunction, and their disobedience to his Law must passe for a sign of their perfection. But if they stand condemned by all impartiall men, who, not onely in name but in deed, would bring more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments into the Church than Christ hath done, giving the same honour to, and pleading for the same efficacy and necessity of their inventions, as of Christs own insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, wherein the <hi>Papists</hi> are grosly guilty: what doe they better, who would cast forth of the Church of those Sacraments, which our Lord hath ordained, as if they were uselesse unnecessary things, which is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our <hi>Quakers.</hi> If there was nothing else to be said in answer to the unreasonable pretences of these men, is it not enough that we have a plain command of Christs to oppose to their Fancy? He saith to all his followers, <hi>Do this,</hi> and they say, <hi>Do it not:</hi> which should we rather hearken to? And hereby judge what spirit that is, which riseth up in such flat contradiction to the voice of Christ? But farther, can they or any man else shew, that this command is founded upon such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as makes it of lesse force and obligation to us, than to those whom it was first given to? Doe not all the grounds of this duty which were then, still remain the same? as I shall shew more afterward. Wherefore let them either shew where Christ hath repealed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept which he once gave, or let them beware of falling under the woe denounced against such, as not onely break his commands, but teach others so to do.</p>
               <p>And little lesse guilty than these are they, who, though they will grant Christs command in force, yet give not obedience to it; and though they will not say this Sacrament is unprofitable, yet by their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect receive no profit from it. All you that have been long since at years of discretion, and have had frequent


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107818:94"/>
opportunities to come to the Lords Table, and yet have not cared to inform your selves, what it is you should doe there, what good you should get by it, and so have taken no care to make preparations for this duty, but from year to year have neglected it; what think you of this course. I beseech you? Stay a while and reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. Did you never hear of a command given by the Lord Jesus, that all true Christians should meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at this Supper, and there in remembrance that his body was broken, and his blood shed for them, eat Bread and drink Wine set apart for that purpose? Hath he given a command to this purpose, or hath he not? That it was spoken to the Apostles, I have told you, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, but that it belongs as well to you, since if you be sincere Christians as they were, you have the same cause to doe this that they had. When Christ bids them deny themselves, love one another, and pray to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his name; doe not these precepts reach you and I, as well as those particular persons to whom he spake them? And tell me if you can, why the case is not the same, as to that command of his, which I have even now mentioned, that we should <hi>Do this,</hi> receive this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Supper, <hi>in remembrance of him.</hi> He that hath commanded you to mortifie your lusts, to love God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, he it is hath enjoyned you to do this; and if you think he ought to be obeyed in one thing, why not in all? So then since you cannot but grant, that such a command there is, what can you say for your selves who have diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed it? Are you not hereby guilty of contemning the Authority of the Law-giver? what say you? Doe you think you have herein behaved your selves as you ought? Can you imagine, that this your negligence and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is acceptable to the Lord Jesus? Or doe you not care whether it is or not? I hope it is not all one with you to please or to provoke him. Does not then


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107818:95"/>
your Conscience by this time smite you for your care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessnesse? If not, I doubt it is seared and sencelesse; if it does, then let me ask you what you intend for the time to come. Will you hold on that course which you dare not justifie, which your own Conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns you for? Dare you still persist in the breach of a known law? Have you any thing to say against the law it self, or against him that made it? Is it not the law of Christ the Son of God, your Redeemer? And hath not he power to enjoyn you what he pleaseth? Hath not he right to govern you upon account of his Redeeming you? And are not all things delivered into his hands by the Father? Yea, does not the Father himself speak to you in and by him? Does not he himself tell us, that the words which he spoke were the Fathers that sent him? <hi>John</hi> 14.10. and 24. Can you then gainsay Christs authority? If not, how dare you resist it? Doe you indeed take him for your Lord or not? Answer me one way or other. If you doe not, then call your selves no longer Christians: for this your subjection is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to your Christianity, as I have before shewed. If you doe, then pray tell me, how can this consist with wilfull violation of plain precepts? Doe you take him for your Master if you will yield him no reverence nor fear? Will you not be as subject to your Lord as the <hi>Centurions</hi> servants were to him? to whom if he said but, <hi>do this,</hi> they did it. Let this be the triall whether you will or not: Behold Christ saith to thee in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and now in his name, and with power from him, I charge thee, <hi>Do this,</hi> come and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107818:95"/>
that should carry himself thus towards thee. What thy usuall shifts and evasions are, I shall take notice anon and give thee an answer. Onely at present, let me make hast to entreat thee not to mistake me and deceive thy self, as if I was thus earnest and importunate with thee for nothing else, but to go with thy neighbours sometimes when a Sacrament is administred, and there take a bit of Bread and a sup of Wine with a little seeming reverence, without any due consideration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after to what purpose it is. Canst thou be so silly as to imagine, thou hast satisfied the will of Christ when thou hast done this? Or canst thou think thy soul ever the better for it? Wherefore remember what it was I first exhorted thee to, namely to examine and prepare thy self, and so to eat of this Bread and drink of this Cup; to repent of, and set thy self against all sin, and to devote thy self to Christ, and then to take the Sacrament as a testimony that thou dost so, and as a bond to oblige thee firmer to him. This I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently told thee; and that thou maist be sure to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand my meaning and remember it, take it once again in this plain comparison: If a Master was about to bargain with one to be his Servant, offering so much wages and a shilling in earnest, and another that stands by, having a mind to drive on the bargain, should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the Servant not to stand off, but to take his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, doe you not know what he meant by this? Doe you think he wisht the man onely to take the shilling, and go his way without any more adoe? surely no, but to agree with him to become his Servant, to do the work he should appoint him, and to shew his consent to this, should take the shilling that was to be given in earnest. Thus, Reader, being earnestly desirous to drive on a match betwixt Christ and thy soul, I would fain beg thee to take the Sacrament, as an evidence of


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107818:96"/>
thy consent to become his faithfull servant; but upon no other terms I'le assure thee. Wherefore if thou be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved against the diligent service of God, and yet ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turest upon this Ordinance, let the blame be upon thy own head. Doe not think to excuse thy self by saying, thou read'st a book that told thee it was Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to all, that they should receive the Sacrament, and that therefore thou didst as thou wast instructed: for again and again have I made known to thee, that none ought to do thus but true Christians, such as believe in, love and obey the Lord Jesus; and this is that to which thou art implicity urged by that very command which he hath given for thy frequenting his Supper. And this I would presse upon all that perform this duty rudely and negligently, as well as on those that altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omit it. Let not such carelesse ones imagine, they have hitherto rendred due obedience to this command. For consider, when a duty is enjoyned, all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in order thereto is thereby enjoyned, and the right manner of performing it also. Thus when we are commanded to pray to God, by that very command we are engaged to get the knowledge of God, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he can hear and help us; and also to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and serious in our prayers: for without these and the like qualifications we may say over a many words, but we cannot properly be said to pray. Thus when Christ commands us to eat Bread and drink Wine in remembrance of him, he hereby commands us to get our hearts into such a frame, that we may be fit and able to remember him with those affections, and in that manner that it beseems ransomed men to remember their Redeemer: And therefore we must know him, and be sensible of our own slavery, and be willing to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by him, and be thankfull for his love, with the other qualifications which I have before shewn to be


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107818:96"/>
necessary to, and included in our Remembrance of him. If you make a Feast on purpose to entertain a friend, you thereby suppose not onely that he should come to your Table, but that he should come with a stomach to eat of your provisions. And when Christ invites men to his Table, where he hath provided spirituall food un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the outward elements, doe you not think he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires all that come, that they should have an appetite to, and desire after what he hath provided for them? Thus then have I laid open to you the flat command of Christ, whereby you are required to put your selves in a right posture, and come to this Feast which he hath ordained in his Church, as a memoriall of the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption he wrought for it. Whether you will obey it or not I cannot tell, I leave that to your choice; if you have any reason that seems stronger, than the will of Christ, doe as you shall think fit; onely remember, the command I have been urging upon you, was given you by that Jesus who will be your Judge, and whose sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence will passe acccording to that word whereof this command is a part, and if you think you have got any such excuse, as will bring you off clear at that day, though you be found guilty of contemning his Law, I have no more to say, but at your own perill be it: Here I have given you faithfull warning.</p>
               <p>Here I may farther adde, that you have not onely Christs command, but the <hi>example of his Apostles, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, and the Primitive Christians</hi> to engage you to this duty, wherein they were all conscientious and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. They that were converted by the preaching of the Apostles <hi>continued stedfastly in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread and in prayers.</hi> And this you may find was the practice of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> (and by consequence of all other Churches then planted) in that the Apostle rectifies the abuses


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107818:97"/>
they were guilty of therein, as you may find at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.17. to the end. And are not we to walk as we have these for an example, and to be followers of them as they are of Christ. Moreover they that are skill'd in Church History tell us, that it is most certain, it was the custome of the primitive Christians, usually to celebrate this Sacrament every Lords Day at least. And by the way take notice, though we have no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular precept in Scripture how frequently we ought to doe it, yet from thence we are taught, that it ought to be done more than once, and the practice of those who best knew the mind of Christ may inform us, that it ought to be done often; though the particular times are left to the prudence of Church-governours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the next place I would wish you well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether you have not good reason to conclude, <hi>that you shall receive much advantage from the performance of that duty, which is recommended to you by the expresse command of Christ, and the example of his first followers.</hi> Was there nothing else to be shewed but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from him, whom you acknowledge your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, one would think it enough to silence all objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and bring you to obedience. But doe you not moreover believe, that Christ designed the good of his servants by the institution of this Sacrament in his Church? Are any of his commands grievous or unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable? Is not the whole design of Christian Religion evidently for our interest, if we believe we have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall souls? And can you imagine this one duty to be an exception from all the rest? as having nothing in it which may make it worthy our performance. Hath not he backt his commands with promises, that we might have all kind of encouragement to his service? Hath not he told us, that to those <hi>who keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he will manifest himself?</hi> Doe you think then, that


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107818:97"/>
when Christ first set up this Sacrament, he hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended any advantage to those who should celebrate it? If not, he appointed them a meer piece of drudgery, in some respect worse than the Jewish Ceremonies (for they had their use to the spirituall) and even as bad as tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m this, then I would know, whether the same advantages doe not still continue to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which were first intended to be communicated by it to the worthy Receiver? Again, did the Apostles and their companions get any good by it think you? if not, it's strange they should be so exact and frequent in it; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they did, fain would I know, why the same good is not still to be got by serious diligent Christians. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Gods treasures of grace are not spent, his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is not drawn dry, no nor ever will be. He that will be the everlasting portion of his people when this world is ended, hath enough sure in himself for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of all their necessities, whilst they are travelling through the world. When millions of Saints have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that grace which leads them to glory, there is not a jot the lesse for those that come after. And as his graces are not exhausted, so neither is the way of giving them forth changed; in the same manner that his Spirit accompanied the word and Sacraments, at any time since the Gospel was publisht, in the same manner it accompanies them still, for ought that any man living can shew to the contrary. Christ is the same yesterday, to day, and for ever. He who will be with his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters till the end of the world, will be with his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances till then, &amp; with his people in the conscientious use of them. Why should the first Christians be tied to that which we in after-ages may neglect? Is not our case the same with theirs? Are not our necessities as


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107818:98"/>
great? And may not our profitings also, if the fault be not our own? To prosecute this a little farther, as I promised. Is not the Death of Christ as great a mercy to us in these latter days of his Church, as it was to them in the first? Have not we the same pardon offered to us, the same promises given, the same heaven prepared, and the same sanctifying Spirit to bring us thereto? Have we not then the same cause to be frequently mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of, and thankfull for these mercies, and the Death that purchast them, in all ways prescribed to that purpose? Are not we still of the same nature that men were then? Such whose affections are much raised and quickened by sensible things, by the help whereof we can with greater clearnesse and power conceive of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ngs spirituall; and can more affectionately remember what's past, when we see it represented and acted afresh before our eyes. Is it not therefore our wisdome and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to accept of such assistances as our Lord himself, in his care of us, hath afforded? whereof the Sacrament of his Supper is a principall one, every way fitted for that end. Were they more dull than we, that they should need such quickning means which we judge our selves past the use of? Had not we as much need as they to be frequently renewing our more solemn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for sin, and covenantings with God, that so the consideration of those renewed engagements we lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, may the more overpower us to faithfulnesse and perseverance in his service? Are not our wants of grace as great as theirs? And therefore ought we not to wait in all those ways whereby these wants may be supplied? which are the same now as formerly. Is it not as rich a mercy now as ever, to have all the blessings and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Covenant of grace, whether temporall, spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107818:98"/>
not the exercise and strengthning of mutuall brotherly love, by the maintaining of the most endearing Christian communion, still a most pleasant and profitable duty? now especially, when all men have learnt to cry out, how cold charity is grown! Thus you see there are very many, and those no small advantages that accrue to such as carefully manage this weighty duty, and all of them continue still the same that they were in the time of the Apostles. And let there be any other ground of their practice assigned, or any other benefits which they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by enjoyed, and I question not to prove, that we have the same, or the like grounds, and are capable of the same benefits with them. Thus have I shewn you, that to come in a due manner to the Lords Table is both your duty and your interest; there is a command given by your Lord, obliging you to what is good for your selves, (and indeed so doe all other his commands if well weighed.) And what more can be said to work upon men, that have any Conscience, or any self love, to give obedience? Wherefore if you be Christians, yea, if you be Men; if you have any sense of Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or of your own necessities, make all possible hast out of that dangerous woefull estate, which makes you unfit for, and unwilling to this so profitable a duty; and your souls being made ready, let them bring your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies hither. Having been larger in these, I shall be brief in those that follow.</p>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107818:99"/>
their Estates from his bounty, and to live there accor-to his Laws: is it not a sign, that they who will not doe thus much, doe very little care for the Estates that are offered them? And doe not they manifest as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of heaven it self, and all the promises of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, who are loath to be at so much pains, as to go to the Sacrament, there to have all these confirmed to them? being unwilling to bind themselves hereby to thankfulnesse and obedience to that God, who makes them such large and bounteous offers. He that refuseth a cheap and easie medicine, which being duly taken may recover him from his sicknesse, may well be said to undervalue his health. Thus is it too apparent, that thou little regardest the health of thy soul, whilst thou sleightest those means, which, through the blessing of the great Physician upon thy carefull use of them, might tend so much to thy healing and strengthning. If a shilling be offered me in earnest of a thousand pound to be given upon some certain conditions, if I refuse to take it, it is not so much the Earnest as the greater summe that I thereby reject. Thus Heaven is assured to thee upon condition of thy faith and obedience, and if thou likest it upon these terms, the Sacrament shall be given thee in earnest, but if thou wilt not take the Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, thou putt'st away from thee everlasting life. If a condemned man tear in pieces the Kings pardon, which is brought to him, his fault is not so much the tearing of a piece of paper as his contempt of the Pardon. Thus shall it be laid thy charge, not meerly thy despising a bit of Bread and sup of Wine, but thy sleighting all those rich and unvaluable blessings which hereby were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; assured to Believers. If indeed thou prizest these, shew it by thy setting a due esteem upon that which hath so near a relation to them; but if thou value them not, think not much if thou go without them for ever:

for whom canst thou blame if thou misse of those things which thou caredst not for?</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Is not this neglect a sad sign, that thou performest no duty as thou oughtest, nor to those ends thou shouldest?</hi> For if thou didst rightly improve any, why should'st thou not be glad of all? Art thou not ready to try all courses, &amp; use all means for the continuance and encrease of thy outward welfare? and yet thou thinkest every thing too much that's enjoyned thee for thy spirituall advantage, and therefore comest not to this Ordinance, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou maist doe well enough without it. They that are in health use not to say, if they have one sort of food what should they doe with another; or if they eat one meal in a day, why need they eat another: and yet this is thy language in reference to thy soul. So long as thou hast been baptized, and comest to Church, and saist thy prayers (and it's well if thou doe thus much) why may not this serve thy turn without coming to the Sacrament? Why tell mee, pray thee, what's thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in these duties? Is it to get good to thy soul? That thou maist grow in grace, and get fitter for glory? If it be, why then is not every duty acceptable to thee which would help on this design? But is it not rather to be feared, that these are done out of custome, without expecting, and therefore without finding any great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from them? And because the neglect of that duty I am urging thee to, is too too common, and so no great matter of disgrace, therefore thou makest so light of it. And withall, perhaps there is somewhat more pains requisite to prepare thee for it, and therefore out of meer sloth and lazinesse thou holdest off. Oh that thou wast but set in as good earnest, to inrich thy soul with grace, as the most of men, and it's like thou thy self art, to grow rich in the world! How many ways will they wind and turn to get a little gain? If one

course will not serve they'l take another; and if that fail, they'l try a third; what they misse in one bargain, they'l seek to make amends for in the next. Thus would it be with thee, wast thou a diligent Christian: thou would'st turn every stone, seek every corner for the pearl of price. Didst thou once by experience know the worth and excellency of true Grace, and the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying sweetnesse of conversing with God, thou would'st be very diligent in the use of all those means whereby these advantages are to be attained: what thou hadst g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If thou found'st thy self at a distance from God, or under fears of his displeasure, thou would'st never be at rest with thy self till thou hadst found him whom thy soul loved, and hadst got a renewed sense of his love to thy soul: in all those ways wherein he gives a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meeting to his people would'st thou give constant attendance, ever earnestly waiting for the gracious and comfortable manifestations of himself in thy soul. But since thou canst so contentedly misse one Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, and that of so great importance, it's a shrewd sign that thou improvest not any as thou oughtest; and what a wretched starven case then must thy soul needs be in?</p>

he hath lately appeared in judgement against us, and shewn that he hath a sore controversie with us: and shall not we, the surviving inhabitants of the Land, learn righteousnesse hereby? Shall not we be so wise, as to meet him in the way, before his anger be kindled against us in particular? It is to be feared, the neglect of this very duty, and the grosse miscarriages in the manner of performing it, have done much toward the hastening of those judgements we have lain under. And shall not this teach thee what to doe for the future? Wilt thou go on to provoke the Lord to jealousie? so that his anger should not be turned away, but his hand stretched out still. And if thou art one, who hast lately been preserved from the very graves mouth whereinto thou wast ready to fall, being in continuall expectation of death, through the <hi>Visitation,</hi> or any other Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I would with thee to look back, and consider what were the thoughts of thy heart at that time, thou, I mean, who hadst lived a loose and carelesse life? Did not thy Conscience fly in thy face for all thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? And didst thou not resolve, that if God should spare thee, thou would'st become a new man, and lead another kind of life than thou hadst done? Did it not terrifie thee to remember how thou hadst neglected praying, hearing, and receiving Sacraments? And didst thou not, make promises within thy self, that, if God would try thee once again, it should be no more thus? But that thou would'st be as diligent and constant therein for the time to come, as thou hadst been slack and negligent before. Well now, God hath tried thee according to thy desire: thou who might'st have been sent to the place where Repentance will do no good, art yet kept upon earth, to see what will be the fruit of thy afflictions, where yet thou art within the reach of mercy, if thou throw not thy self out of it. What then

Yet be thou sure God will remember them: and fain would I perswade thee to remember them too; and now in particular, having prepared thy soul, to addresse thy self to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and there renew all those vows and resolutions which thou madest in the time of sicknesse and danger; and humbly implore mercy and pardon for thy former carelesnesse, and all thy transgressions, and help from God to walk more closely with him for the future. Let me now in season be thy Remembrancer from the Lord, and bring to mind what engagements thou hast made to him, and see thou be faithfull to them: But if they be sleighted, and all that I have said to thee sleighted, because now thou art lusty and well, and seest no death near thee, and hast something else to do, than to trouble thy self with being so religious, as dying men use to be, yet let it sink into thy thoughts, that there is just such another time coming upon thee; very shortly thou wilt be sick again, and cast upon thy death-bed; and dost thou not think the very same thoughts will then come into thy mind again? When thou shalt consider thy self just lanching forth into eternity, &amp; shalt look back upon all thy ungodly deeds, and thy undervaluing the means of grace, by an improvement of which thou mightest have been made ready for such an hour as this, wilt thou not then begin again to fall to wishing that it had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Could you possibly do thus if you bore him upon your minds, and were sensibly affected with the frequent thoughts of all his love towards you? Would you not then take all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to expresse this your thankfull sense of his kindnesse. The Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> we read, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to keep the Feast of the Passeover, as a memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of their deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and if, when they were come into <hi>Canaan,</hi> they should after a few years have left it off, might not God justly have taxt them with forgetting their deliverance it self? And is not the case much what the same here? So we find, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.26, 27. that when their Children should see them keep this Feast, and ask what the meaning was, they were to answer, <hi>It is the sacrifice of the Lords Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, who passed over the houses of the Children of Israel in Aegypt, in that night when he smote the Aegyptians, and delivered our houses.</hi> If now these Children, when they were of capacity, should refuse to keep this Feast, as they were commanded, is it not a sign, that either they believed not what their parents told them, or else thought there was nothing in it worth the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance? Thus if any of you should demand what's the meaning of our assembling together at certain times, to eat and drink Bread and Wine in so serious a manner, it may be answered you, <hi>This is the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which he appointed in the night wherein he was betrayed, for a memoriall of that Death whereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the kingdome of Satan, and delivered his people.</hi> If you now take this to be true, and think it deserves so solemn a Remembrance, come as you have been direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and joyn with the rest in this work; if you refuse this, you can never sure have the face to say, that you

If one that had bestowed some great matters upon the Town he lived in, should order at his death, that the inhabitants of that Town should, upon a certain day in the year, meet together at a Feast, to keep up the memory of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if they neglected this, might it not well be said they forgot their Benefactour? And does not your neglect of this Sacramentall Feast, as plainly shew a forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your great Benefactour who ordained it? Oh wonderfull! that ever men who have heard, who Jesus Christ is, and what he hath done, should be thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of him. Ah Sirs, read the history of his Life, think soundly of his Death, and consider then, whether he thus deserve to be forgotten by you. Had he had no more thought of us, where had we now been, and what had become of us for ever? Hath he done so much for you, even without your seeking, and when he requires so little of you, is he denied? If but a dying friend should take his Ring off his Finger, and put it on yours, and bid you look on that Ring, and remember him, should you not easily do it? But much more, if this friend had upon any account given up himself to die for your preservation, and should onely engage you by remembring him, to beware of that fault whereby your life was endangered and his was lost; would not the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of such a friend be ever fresh, and precious with you, if you had any humanity, any sense of friendship and kindnesse? And would not your bowels be even turned within you, whenever you beheld his Ring? But alas, how farre comes this short of the kindnesse which Christ hath shewn to poor sinners, in many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, as might easily be shewn? And yet how is all disregarded with the most? How few obey this, that was one of his last injunctions to his followers before he offered up himself on their behalf, that they should

I know it is not thy coming hither on any fashion that will sufficiently prove thee a good Christian, but yet thy totall forbearance may rather make thee suspected to be none at all. For what hast thou to plead on thy own behalf? The greatest argument of thy Christianity is thy being baptized: but this was done in thy infancy, and who knows, whether thou stand'st to it or not, if thou wilt not publickly own that thou dost so? If it was the custome amongst us, that when a Father is list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into an Army, he should set down the names of his Sons also, there to stand till they came to sixteen years of age, at which time they were to go in and write their own names, or else to be cashiered; if they, when they are come to these years, should refuse to give in their names, doe they not hereby shew that they have no mind to be Soldiers? And is it not a question whether thou ownest Christ Jesus for thy Captain, if thou wilt not make thy appearance with the rest, at times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the acknowledgement of thy relation to him? If the King should command all that were of age in a Town, to come to the Market-place, and there take the Oath of Allegiance, if they would be held for good Subjects, how would they be lookt upon, who should stay away and refuse to do it? Now have I not before shewn, how expresse the command of Christ is to all his Disciples, that, beside all other duties, being rightly prepared, they should celebrate this Sacrament in remembrance of him, as an evidence and symbol of their relation to, and communion with him? How then can we hold them for true Disciples that reject and sleight it? But here give me leave, according to my promise, to meet with two or three Objections against the performance of this duty, before I come to give Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. And first I would demand of you, who is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to be Judge in this case, what you ought to do, and what not? Are you Servants, or are you your own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,? <hi>Came the word of God forth from you</hi>? Was Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion something of your devising, that you may frame it, and appoint the duties of it as you shall see best? <hi>Or came this word to you onely?</hi> Did he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it to the world priviledge you, to pick and chuse some duties &amp; omit others, as you saw good? If you say, yes pray produce your license and let us see it; for we find no such thing recorded in that Word which we all acknowledge to come from God. And if you have got any private orders contrary thereto, give us sufficient evidence to prove them of divine authority, and then we shall be silent. But till then it must needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nge impudence, for silly worms to quarrel with the institutions of infinite wisdome. For if God's authority may be regarded, rather than the fond opinion of proud and giddy men, we need not be to seek what to


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107818:106"/>
do in this matter, Christ having so plainly commanded us, to <hi>do this in remembrance of him,</hi> as I have before shewed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And since there is such a command, I wonder how it can be accounted an unprofitable thing to obey it? Is there no profit in pleasing God? And can we please him any other way, than by obeying his commands? Let the matter of the command be what it will, if we know it be given us by God, that's warrant enough for our practice, &amp; ground for our expectation of benefit by it, though we could not much see the reason of the thing in it self abstracted from the command, (though here the case is otherwise, as I have also before manifested.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any should say we now lie under no obligation to this duty, let them shew where Christ's command to his Disciples is repealed, or where there is the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation given, that there was a time to come when it should be out of date, and cease to oblige our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Nay, are we not taught there was no such time to come? For do we not find the reason and end of this Ordinance assigned to be such, as will make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the last day? And this to prevent all exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption plainly exprest; <hi>Hereby you shew forth Christs death till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Do not they who tell us the Sacraments are but shadows, and therefore now to cease, hereby pretend a new dispensation of the Gospel, purer and higher, than that which was set up by Christ and his Apostles, after the ceasing of the Leviticall worship? For long after this we find Baptisme and the Lords Supper in use. Wherefore if they are now to be laid aside, is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that was but an infant-state of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in such ceremonies were requisite, which are now need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, it being grown to greater maturity, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers engaged to be more spirituall, and taken off from


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107818:107"/>
those carnall services, wherein such mean persons as the Apostles and their followers were conversant? But do not they notoriously violate truth, as well as mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, who tell us this? Do we either in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or New, meet with any Prophesies, that intimate to us a new dispensation, or different way of ordering the Christian Church, after Christ had fully establisht it? We find such frequently as to the Jewish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but no where, that I know, relating to any Laws or Orders that Christ hath appointed. And none, I hope, will say our Sacraments were like them, of a typicall nature, and so to cease by the coming in, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of somewhat which they signified. Though the first Dispensation under <hi>Moses</hi> was imperfect, yet where are we allowed to find fault with the second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by Christ? Is not this Gospel-state the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that cannot be moved, in opposition to the Jewish state of things, which was shaken and removed? as we may probably interpret, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26, 27. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who would make us believe, that in these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days the Church is to be reformed, not onely from the corruptions men brought in, but from the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which Christ set up, what do they but trouble us, by endeavouring to pervert the Gospel of Christ? ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching too near to those, whom the Apostle so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently pronounceth accursed. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.9. Those indeed would have brought in customes which Christ had abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and these would abrogate such as he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; and when we remember who ordained them, it may sufficiently awe us from sleighting them, though they may seem but lesser matters, and, as it were, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages to Religion. And it should make all sober Christians the more afraid, of hearkning after any new and more spirituall Dispensations of the Gospel, when we remember the unspeakable mischief, which this


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107818:107"/>
groundlesse pretence hath done, and may do to the Church. Under this notion the <hi>Familists</hi> vent their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid fancies; and even <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself made use of this pretence, when he first set up in the world: And so any man that hath a mind to advance some new way, which he can find no ground for in the Gospel, may pretend that it is something higher and more excellent than Christ thought fit at first to reveal, but now in these last days he hath sent him as his Messenger to publish it to the world. And as well may we hearken to any such Impostour, as to those who tell us, that though, it's true, Christians at the first were Baptized, and received the Lord's Supper, yet now we have nothing to doe with these things, being arrived to a more perfect state than they were acquainted with.</p>
               <p n="5">5. How unreasonable is it, that they should oppose those things which so well agree together, and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally promote each other? whilst they say they believe in Christ, and therefore regard not this piece of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward service. But I wonder where they find, that faith in Christ may excuse a man from receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I should think it rather engaged him to it. Farre be it from me to presse this duty, as that which will give men the least dispensation to neglect any other, nay, I hope, I have sufficiently shewed all along, that I presse it as a strong obligation, motive, and help to holinesse, both of heart and life. Hither should men come pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to exercise and strengthen their graces; and therefore it's a most foolish thing to say they have got grace in their hearts, and will thereupon stay away. If you believe in Christ, come hither and professe that you do so: for so he hath bidden you to do; and be not so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous as to say, because you have faith therefore you will not in this manner professe it. If a King should command all his Subjects that would go to such a


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:107818:108"/>

And is it not much what the same, for any to pretend they'l keep covenant with Christ, and therefore will not make or renew it in that solemn manner he hath commanded?

And yet no better is to be found in thy obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Might not the Apostles farre better have said, they needed not the help of this Sacrament, to put them in mind of Christ, who was ever fresh in their thoughts? But on the contrary, because he was so much in their thoughts, therefore were they so frequent in this duty.

And let me tell thee farther, it's much to be feared, thou hast little or no grace at all, who sleightest any way that Christ hath ordained, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of grace. A wise man useth not to say, I enjoy my health well, and therefore I care not for my food, since this is the means for continuance of his health. But it seem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. In the next place let me ask thee, Do'st thou imagine thy self arrived to the utmost pitch of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so that thou lookest upon all means and Ordinances as things below thee? If so, I cannot now stand to shew thee, the pride and ignorance of this conceit, which are both so great, that it's danger thou wilt not be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of either. But wast thou indeed so excellent a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107818:108"/>
as thou takest thy self to be, yet methinks thou should'st not imagine, that thou art above the exercise of grace, or returning thanks for what thou hast recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and even these reasons may bring thee to the duty I am now pleading for. Or if this be none of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, do'st thou imagine that the soul can get no good by externall means, which work upon the senses? If this be thy opinion, thou seemest not to consider, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and frame of man in this present state, wherein bodily things do so mightily affect him, and he is beholden to his senses for all, or almost all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which he hath. By this reason men could profit nothing by reading or hearing, which is contrary to all experience. And by this reason in the time of the Law no good was to be got by those Ceremonies, that typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Christ to come, which is a very bold assertion, and most unreasonable; and I hope the clearer representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him, and his benefits in our Sacraments, have much the advantage of those darker shadows.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Is it not very great impudence and ingratitude, when Christ hath chosen to deal with us in such a sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, as he saw most suitable to our natures, for us thereupon to call his wisdome and goodnesse in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, when he calls us to offer our bodies, as well as souls to him, and to glorifie him both with soul &amp; body, shall we say he cares not for bodily service, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon neglect all those services, wherein the body is employed? And when he out of indulgence to our weaknesse, hath provided externall helps meet for us, shall we think our selves too high for them? Is not this most vile pride and ingratitude? And consider, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we dare to speak in disparagement of Christs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, as if they were empty uselesse things, will be found to reflect foully upon the honour of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Law-giver.</p>

Where do we finde any of the pious <hi>Jews</hi> before Christs time, complaining of their Ceremonies as bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome, unprofitable things? Afterwards indeed when they were maintained in opposition to Christ, whom they led to, and ended in, they are call'd beggarly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and carnall Ordinances; but we hear not of this language before. Though then God frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest his very little regard to them, compared to the more substantial duties of the moral Law, yet where read we of any of the godly in those daies that rejected or disused them? And what is our bondage sorer than theirs? Hath Christ put a yoke upon his Disciples hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than that he took off? and what do they better than say thus, who throw off his gracious institutions, as a burden too heavy for them to bear?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Methinks this is so like the language of Infidels that all who have any minde to be thought Christians should abhor it. What wonder would it be for an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del to laugh at Baptisme, or the Lords Supper, if he should see them administred, and ask what good was to be got from washing with water, or receiving a little Bread and Wine? But for one who pretends to ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the authority of Christ, to speak after the same manner, seems something strange.

               <p n="10">10, I would fain know of these Men, whether Christ had power to appoint an Ordinance of this kinde, to the use of which, Christians in all succeeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions should be oblig'd? if they grant he had, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107818:109"/>
they dare not denie it, then let them lay what he should have said or done more to lay this obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, than he hath done in the present case. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain they finde fault with the nature of this Ordinance, as if it was not suited to be pertual, because of its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableness, let them tell when it begun to be so: Was it from the first institution? or after a certain time? If from the beginning, what was it ordained for? why would Christ set up an Ordinance that was good for nothing? And why were the Disciples so frequent in it? If afterwards, let them name the time, and give the reason of its degeneracy. But farther, was Christ able to make this Sacrament profitable to those, who should conscienciouslie attend upon it? They who say he was not, must not take it ill to be thought Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels: but if they yield he was, then let them alledge some reason why he would not, or rather let them shew wherein he hath been wanting to it to make it so profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: If these fault-finders might have been at the first appointment hereof, what a kinde of one would they have had it, that it might have been more usefull than now they judge it is? Is it not the death of Christ here set out before our eies? and may not that in some sort affect us, supposing we know the design of it, as well as discourses that reach our eares? may not this awake us to livelie thoughts of Christ, of the reason and ends of his death, and so quicken us to the exercise of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith, and stir us up to desire after him, and to thankfulnesse for his love? and when our souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are wrought into so good a frame, may we not reasonably expect larger communications of grace from that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing Fountain of goodnesse, who requires nothing more than a right disposition in us, that we may be made partakers of his bounty. Not to mention how fit a way this is, for the conferring a right to, and giving assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107818:110"/>
of relative and future priviledges.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Besides the Example of those in the first ages of the Church, me thinks the daily experience of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of sober Christians, may abundantly confute this conceit, that there is no good to be got by frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords Table; were these demanded one by one whether they had not found the contrary, I believe the most of them would professe they had; though through their own fault they would acknowledge, they had not hereby profited so much as they might. How many poor souls have come hither heavy and dull, and have gone away enlivened? How many have come dejected and sad, and have gone away refresht, and chear'd, and have long after enjoyed the benefit of this duty? But if they who make this objection, never found any such thing, it would speak more modesty and justice too, to lay the blame on themselves, rather than on the means which Christ hath afforded them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Lastly, I would desire all that are impartial to consider, how plainly God hath witnest against this sort of Men, who are the chief Patrons of that opinion I oppose, in suffering them to be so infatuated and besot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their own minds; that, whilst they have impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently dar'd to reject the Ordinances of Christ as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse things, they themselves have doted upon the most ridiculous inconsiderable trifles, as if they were matters of some huge consequence. Have not those very men, who cry down the Lords Supper and Baptisme, of one sort or other, beside many other duties, as formal things; yet with a great deal of earnestnesse call'd upon us to say, <hi>thou</hi> rather than <hi>you,</hi> to a single person, not to call Men <hi>Master,</hi> nor to put off our Hats one to another, with a multitude the like fopperies? These it seems are substantial things which they have devised, whilst Christs own appointments are empty and carnal.


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107818:110"/>
What's this but a mark set upon them, (and few Sects are without one) to let the World know they came not from God, that none who are considerative might be endangered by their delusions? And let this suffice for answer to the first Objection, whereon I have been the larger, in that it is of such ill consequence, and hath too farre spread it self amongst giddy unstable people.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Obj.</hi> IN the next place some may say, <hi>We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received the Sacrament, and so have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the command of Christ, and therefore may be excused from it for the future.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I should scarce have dreamt of such an Objection, had I not heard it us'd; but to dispatch it in two words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I have before acknowledg'd that Christ hath not told us how frequently, or how oft in our lives we must perform this duty, but yet we may learn from the words of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. That it is to be done more than once: for saith he, <hi>As often as yee eat, &amp;c. i. e.</hi> every time that you eat. And then I have shew'd you what was the practise of the first Christians, which may well hold the place of a rule in this case. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ought to obey the Injunction of your Pastour, so oft as he shall in prudence, think meet to call you to the Lords Table, since you have so much reason for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and none to alledge for your refusal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in the next place, pray tell me, had you any reason for this duty when you first perform'd it? you'l scarce say no, I suppose, and if you had any, then I ask, whether the same reason does not still continue? If it


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107818:111"/>
does, why should not your practise be continued agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably thereto? Have you not still some necessities of soul which may here be supplied, as well as you had then? Is not the death of Christ as well worthy your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance now as formerly? and if you heretofore receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any advantage by what you did, me thinks you should be the more inclin'd to hold on therein. But here perhaps some may reply, putting the objection in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother shape, that they have often attended on this Ordinance, and yet have found no advantage by it, and therefore being out of heart and hope, are readie to throw it quite off. To whom I answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be thus indeed, you have great reason to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the fault is your own. Either you have not been so diligent in your preparations as you ought; or else you have been carelesse afterward, thinking you had done when the work was over, as if no more was required to make a Sacrament strengthning to your souls, than to make food nourishing to your bodies, barely to receive it, and there's an end; when as there is a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous consideration of what you have done, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant watchfulness afterwards, necessary to make it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficical to you, as I may have occasion to shew a non. And especially see that you give not, a kinde of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to some pleasant sin or o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her, which you are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie willing to be quite delivered from; such a secret partial cherishing of any lust whatever, will be sure to keep you low and barren, and render all means unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. And thus is it also like to be with you, if you are swallowed up in wordly businesses, or do too sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie relish any sensible enjoyment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You who complain you can get nothing by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, will say the same, I suppose, by other means and duties; and will you therefore cast off these two? will you lay aside hearing and praying upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence?


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:107818:111"/>
you may as well: for the reason holds as good for one as the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But farther, I would have you beware of mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your selves, imagining that you profit not when you do. And therefore consider what your expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been, and what you have found. Perhaps you have expected great joys, and as it were, sensible assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Gods Love, and to be afterward freed from all troubles and doubtings? or you have expected a perfect freedome from some troublesome temptations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you use to be haunted, and from the very first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of sin in your selves, and because you have found none of this in those measures you lookt for, therefore you conclude you have met with nothing? But this is no right arguing: for these are priviledges that you may go without al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> your days, and yet thrive under the means too; and therefore by them you cannot judge of your profiting: But if you can find the strength of sin broken, and your heart more set against it, and you are more thoroughly perswaded to comply with the whole will of God, being firmly resolved to keep close to him to the last, discovering more and more the emptinesse of all creatures, and his alsufficiency, being more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valently and steadily bent to chuse him as your onely portion, if it be so, you may be sure you grow in grace, and are bettered by the means you enjoy, and may be therefore encouraged to continue in the use of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But lastly, however it be with you, yet be you patient and constant in doing your work, and then leave the event to God. Wherein upon examination you find you have been wanting to your selves, be more carefull for the future, in the due preparing and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of your own hearts, and so wait upon God in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed way. Let your desires be carried out after that


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107818:112"/>
which is most needfull for you, and which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to give, chiefly after grace, and secondarily after comfort, remembring all you have is to come from the free mercy of a wise God, to whom you must referre it what measures of these you shall receive, and how soon it shall be. Onely, I say, let it be your businesse quietly to wait his leisure, in the use of those means he hath prescribed you, for which I might give many reasons; but I shall wave all, onely demanding of you, whether those spirituall blessings you so earnestly long after are worth the waiting for? If you say, no, you deserve to go for ever without them: but if you grant they are, then pray tell me, whether is it more likely to attain them, by waiting in that way wherein they are to be found, or by turning out of it? This, I hope, is no difficult case to resolve. If your friend be gone a journey, and you have a mind to meet him upon his return, are you not more likely to meet with him, by holding on still in that road which he'll be sure to come, than by going back again, or turning to some by path, meerly to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie your lazinesse or impatience? Wherefore, when your hopes are at the lowest ebbe, it is most unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and foolish, to cry with that wicked King, <hi>Why should we wait on the Lord any longer; there is no hope, wherefore let us leave our duties, and cast aside all.</hi> Be sure there is no hope in such a course as this, but rather a certainty of perishing, whereas if there be safety in any way, it is in an obedient patient dependance upon God, yea, in this way there is certain safety; embrace it therefore as your wisest, your onely course. Do but see that you wait for the Lord, and assure your selves you shall not be ashamed, your eyes shall not always fail. Get into the Psalmists frame, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130.5, 6. <hi>To wait for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning,</hi> and at length shall the Lord manifest himself to the joy of

your souls, as sure as the morning light will appear to those who watch for it.</p>

To these I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to say.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Why is it, you judge your selves unfit for this Ordinance? Is it because you are not so qualified as I have before shewn all Communicants ought to be? I am confident, upon a true enquiry, you will find the contrary: Wherefore be not hasty and rash in passing a censure upon your selves, as if you were resolved to comply with, the design of Satan to keep you in sorrow; but examine things soberly, and without passion, and then give judgement upon your state according to true evidence. If you be found faithfull Disciples, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned lovers of Christ, you will grant your selves meet to come to that Feast which is made for such. Tell me then in one word; Are you not from your very souls, willing that Christ should be your Saviour, and take his own course with you, to bring you to God in glory? Is


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107818:113"/>
there any thing in all the world that your heart is se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more upon than this, even that you may be saved by Jesus Christ? would you not account the assurance of this a richer mercy, than to be made owners of the whole world? Yea, would you not give a thousand such worlds as this, if you had them, for the love of God in Christ? Is not this it which lies heaviest upon your spirits, and makes you walk so sadly, even the fears least you are without true grace, and should go without God and Christ for ever? And yet can the Devil so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool you, as to perswade you all this while that you love not God? Have you got any thing here below more dear to you than his favour? Do you take delight in any course that you know is displeasing to him? Do you not long to be made more conformable to him? To know and love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and enjoy him more, and do him better service in the world? Would it not be the great joy of your souls always to walk closely with him, and retain a strong sense of his presence and all his excellencies upon your minds? To converse with him more feelingly and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully, and in all your approaches to him, to be filled with a suitable reverence, humility, seriousnesse, and all holy affections? Would any thing please you more than to please your God? Are you not then best at ease when you find your hearts most enlarged, and carried out after him? Had you not rather be following after God in the ways of holinesse, and the duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than to enjoy all the pleasures and merriments of sensuall ones? Is there any duty from which you would be dispensed with? Any command that you would have abolisht? Had not you infinitely rather your heart was brought up to the fullest compliance with it? Have you any lust which you would fain be allowed to keep? Is it a trouble to you, that you must part with your sins or else be damned for them? Or rather, is it not your


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107818:113"/>
greatest trouble, that you lived so long without God, and did so much against him in the daies of your unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie? And if you had that time to passe over again, would you not prefer a life of the greatest suffering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such a life of sinning; And is not your soul really burdened with those remnants of corruption which you yet feel in your selves? Do you not strive against them, and earnestlie desire to be rid of them? Would you not account it a blessed priviledge, to be more free from ignorance, pride, earthlinesse, distrust, self-will, dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and distractions in holy duties? Would not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from these be more welcome, than to be freed from any outward afflictions you may lie under? All you that are sincere (and to such only I am now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) cannot but acknowledge that the frame of your soul is such, as I have been enquiring after, how harshlie soever, you may conclude of your selves not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding. And if such as you, that love God and holinesse, hate sin, and are humbled for it, have not right to the promises of mercy through Christ, I wonder who have? Why therefore will you not come to receive the seal to those promises which do so evidentlie belong to you or none? But after all perhaps you'l crie, you cannot <hi>believe,</hi> and therefore dare not come hither, since this is a Sacrament provided for <hi>believers</hi> only.</p>
               <p>This objection, I suppose, ariseth principallie from your mistake of the nature of saving faith. Wherefore tell me, I pray, what do you mean when you say, you cannot believe. Do you not reallie believe, that the witnesse which the Scripture gives of Christ is true? Whatever temptations you may have to infidelitie, yet is not this the prevalent perswasion of your mindes, that Jesus Christ is the true Messiah, by whom the fallen World is to be recovered out of its ruines? Do you not believe him furnisht with full power and authority


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:107818:114"/>
to accomplish this design. Do you not believe that his death was sufficient for the ransome of the World, and all other truths concerning him that you finde revealed in the Gospel? And then are you not resolved that this Jesus shall be your Saviour, and none but he? Doe you not from your hearts acknowledge your selves mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, lost creatures, altogether unable to restore your selves, or to do any thing that may satisfie Gods justice, or in it self deserve recompence or acceptance? So that you are convinc'd, if ever you are sav'd it must be through Christ; And are you not earnestlie desirous of this above all things, that God for his Son's sake would pardon and save you? Yea, more than that, are you not sincerelie willing that Christ should rule in your hearts, and guide you by his spirit, and frame you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will? Do you not accompt his commands holy, just and good? And do you not desire strength from him your head to obey them, and to conquer all temptations from within and without that would draw you aside? Do you not believe the promises which he hath made, and the threatnings which he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd, to be certainly true? And do you not desire more, that you may have a share in these promises, than enjoy any created good? And do you not fear his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wrath, more than any outward sufferings? Is it thus with you, as I am confident it is, and yet will you cry out, that you cannot believe? What can you not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? Why, alas! you cannot believe you shall ever be sav'd by Jesus Christ. Is that it then which your belief onlie sticks at? But suppose it does, you are not therefore presently Unbelievers in Scripture-stile or in God's account.

absolute perswasion of thy own salvation is not so much enjoyned thee, however not in the first place, but rather thy acceptance of Christ, that thou mayest be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him. And yet methinks, if thou weigh things well, thou maist be rais'd to such well grounded hopes of thy own particular happinesse, as may very much conquer these doubtings and fears, which thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainest of under the name of unbelief. For let me ask thee seriouslie, why is it thou canst not believe thou shalt be saved by Christ? It is not, I know, because thou doubtest of the sufficiencie of his satisfaction, or of the truth of his promises, or the graciousnesse of his nature. For art thou not fullie perswaded, that he will save all those who trulie believe in him? I make no doubt but thou art: wherefore hence it is plain, that thy fears of perishing arise from an opinion, that thou art not a true Believer. But this from thy own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, I have made evident that thou art, whilst thou believest that Christ is the only Saviour of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and art as willing he should take away thy sins from thee, as prevent wrath from falling upon thee. So that it is rather for want of a clear knowledge of thy self, than for want of faith in the promises, that thou canst so hardly believe thou shalt be saved. Wherefore once again I ask thee, art thou not willing, that Christ should deliver thee, both from the dominion and condemnation of sin? If thou art, and wilt shew it, by using the means he hath afforded for this end, then be assured, thou art a true believer, and as such shalt be own'd and crown'd by the Lord that bought thee. And therefore with great alacritie come along with thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, to the thankful remembrance of that eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption obtain'd for you, by the blood which ratified the everlasting covenant betwixt God and his people.</p>

                  </gap> certain truth, whilst you have no sin, but what is the burden of your soul, and which you labour and long to be freed from, you have no sin that makes you unfit for the Sacrament: nay more, this your sense of sin makes you rightly fitted for it. And then there is lesse ground of doubt, as to the fears and sadnesse you may labour under, or any temptations with which you are troubled: You cannot sure be so weak, as to think your selves upon any of these accounts, unmeet for your Lords Table: For you must remember he never made this the qualification of his guests, that they should come wanting nothing, but he calls hither the necessitous to supplie their wants. You come not hither only to be thankfull for what you have received, but to receive far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what your souls stand in need of. You would think he argued at a very silly rate that should tell you, you must not go to a feast till your hunger was satisfied, nor come to the Fire till you are warm: and yet no better is the sophistry of Satan whereby he would perswade you, that whilst you feel so many imperfections cleave to you, and lie under such great doubtings, you must stay away from the Sacrament; when as this is one means appointed by God for your relief: here's both physick and food administered to the sick and fainting. And God may take this season of revealing himself to you, and satisfying those doubts which you could no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way get rid of. Thus hath it been with many a soul, why may it not be so with you also?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Pray tell me, notwithstanding all these faults which you finde with your selves, yet do you not hold on in the performance of other duties? To instance in


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107818:115"/>
one, do you not use to pray constantly? If you doe, why then will you not be brought to this work also? For assure your selves, if you be such whose prayers are acceptable to God, your receiving will be acceptable also. Without a dependance upon Christ the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and a resolution to conform your selves to the will of God, your very prayers will be loathsome, but if these things be in you, all your services will be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to him. Wherefore beware of pretending so much reverence for this Ordinance, and so much neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of preparation, that least you should not demean your selves as you ought, you will wholly neglect it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for sure you cannot think this according to your Masters will, that you should run away from your work, for fear of miscarrying in it. Nor pretend that this is of a nature so much different from all other duties, that whilst you may do them you may not be admitted to this, since, if you be sincere and hearty in one as well as another, endeavouring to improve them to the end for which they were appointed, even to get neerer to God thereby, be sure you shall be accepted in all. Moreover bethink your selves what you would have done, had you liv'd in the first ages of the Church, when the Christians were wont for the most part, at every time of their assembling, to have a Sacrament. Would you then have ordinarily with-drawn from them? Or would you not rather, have contented your selves with that measure of preparation, that you had then been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making. Though, think not that I am this while encouraging you to lazinesse, or to rush heedlesly and inconsiderately hereupon: no, be as diligent as ever you are able, to prepare your selves for so near an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the great God; but yet be not so over-scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as to keep back from the Ordinance, or make your coming lesse profitable, through excessive fears.


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:107818:116"/>
And remember still, that the habitual devotednesse of the soul to God, without any hypocritical reserve, is the best qualification for this and every other perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly, one would think you of all persons, should not be guilty of refusing your presence here, where there is a commemoration made of the love of your dearest Lord. I speak to you that are serious Christians; well may others slight this duty, if you that lie under so great engagements to it, will be kept back by any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary pretences. You are such that are somewhat acquain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You are persons tender of your Master's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and sensible of your own duty: shew then that you are so, by obeying his command, and preserving the esteem due to his sacred Ordinances, by your constant reverent attending upon them.</p>
               <p>Others there are, that may complain of their unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, who finde themselves at a losse in their prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for this duty, which yet they are very willing to set about, and are desirous of instructions for their right performance of it. For these especially I have reserved some Directions to which I shall come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlie.</p>
               <p>But there are a third sort, those the worst, and I fear the most, who will confess they are unfit for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore will by no means be drawn to it, but will tell you, though they are not fit now, yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they hope they shall be; whilst in the mean time there are no s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gns of any preparation they make: for come to them one Moneth, or Year after another, still they are in the same posture, and use the same excuses. Now the very plain case of these persons, I take to be


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107818:116"/>
this; So much knowledge they have, that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't no man ought to come to the Sacrament, who is not firmly resolved to forsake his sins, and to become a new man, if before he have been a carelesse liver, and yet their Consciences tell them, that such and such sins they are guiltie of, which they cannot endure to think of parting with, and such and such duties they believe, they ought to set upon, which yet they have no mind to; and therefore so much modesty they have, that they will not come to bind themselves, to that which they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to do; and this while they fancy to themselves, that their case is something better, than if they should go and make promises of amendment, and soon after break them; and are apt to conceit, that they may as yet safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take somewhat more liberty, than will be lawfull for them, when once they have taken the Sacrament, whereby they imagine they should be strangely ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, and tied to a strictnesse which they have no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to: But yet hereafter, when they have tasted a little more of the pleasures of the world, they intend to be take themselves to such a course, and then they'l be constant at Sacraments, and as devout as may be, this they promise to themselves. I dare appeal to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of many, whether such as these have not been their thoughts. Reader, have they not been thy own? And commonlie it is either tipling or wantonnesse, or love to an idle and jolly life, and a listlesnesse to all pains and diligence in spirituall affairs, and a misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of serious holinesse, as if it was a most trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some rigid thing, that are the ordinarie causes of these, and most mens continuance at a distance from godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and make them so backward to devote themselves entirely to God. Now these I confesse are not to be called immediately to the Sacrament, but seriously to be dealt with in order to their recoverie, from those sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:107818:117"/>
inclinations, and wretched delusions, which render them so unfit for, and averse from it, to which purpose serve the former exhortations to Repentance and Faith, whereon I staid so long. Onely I shall here discover to them, two dangerous mistakes, wherewith they seem willing to impose upon themselves, and which chiefly hinder the performance of their duty.</p>
               <p>The first is, A conceit that they may take some kind of liberty, for a loose conversation, before they have bound themselves to the contrary by the Sacrament, which thereupon they are much more backward to.</p>
               <p>Now first I shall grant, that hereby a farther obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is laid upon them, to the greatest watchfulnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin, and to a faithfull discharge of their duty to God, in the whole of their lives: and the wilfull viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of solemn engagements renders sin much more hainous: Wherefore it hath been my care all along, to make you understand, that it is not so much the bare Receiving, that I would perswade you to, as to get your souls into a fitnesse for the work, and to do it in a right manner. And once again let me warn you; as you love your souls, not to come hither in love with your sins, or without resolutions to turn from every evil way. Be it known to you, <hi>God will be sanctified in those that draw nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him,</hi> and will severely punish irreverence and profane rudenesse, in those that pretend to his solemn worship and service, as you may see in that terrible instance of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> Levit. 10.1, 2, 3. And for unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receiving of the Lords Supper, the Apostle tells the <hi>Corinthians, For this very cause many were weak and sickly amongst them, and many faln asleep,</hi> and because they would not judge themselves, therefore God judged them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30, 31. He's an holy God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all those to be holy, that hope for acceptance in their approaches to him. And he's a God that searches


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:107818:117"/>
the heart, so that there's no hope of deceiving him. Wherefore stand off, all you that have design'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist one moneth or week longer, in your rebellions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Soveraign Majesty. Dare not to offer so great an affront to him, as to thrust in amongst his subjects whilst thou art a resolved traitour, as if thou would'st make a triall, whether he could discern thee in that croud. He's a jealous God, and will not endure to be so tempted; And sooner or later be sure, thy sin shall find thee out. If then thou dislikest the holy Laws and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Christ, take not an oath in a mockery, that thou wilt be subject to him, which beforehand thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest not to keep. Here's no jesting or dallying; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how thou playest with edge-tools. These are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things, wherefore either be serious and sincere in thy medling with them, or keep at a distance. Avoid, I say, all you loathsom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> defiled sinners, that are in love with your filth, and will not be washed and cleansed; whilst this is your posture, you are no way fit to fit at the Table of the King of Glory, there to Feast with his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved friends, whom he hath purified and made meet for his fellowship and favour. But perhaps you'l pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently reply, you like all this well enough, this is that you would have, and you agree with me to stay away, as perceiving your own unfitnesse. And are you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed resolved to stay away, and to continue in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared posture, as thinking you have hereby some more dispensation for a carelesse ungodly life than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have? Alas! poor wretches, how willing you are to be cheated into misery? And how desirous do you seem of a freedome to do your selves the greatest mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief? But a little to undeceive you. Let me assure all you that live upon this earth and are endued with reason, whether you will bind your selves to God by this Sacrament or not; there lie so many other indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107818:118"/>
engagements on you to his service, that you have not the least liberty more than others to rebell against him: and that will sufficiently appear, if you do but consider these two things.</p>

                  </gap>e your Maker? And is he not the upholder of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the lengthner of your lives, and the giver of all your mercies? Is he not therefore your owner and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Do you not owe your selves, and all you have to him? And is it not your duty to serve and obey him, whether you have promised you will do so or not? Do you think he hath no title to you, till in some solemn manner you have profest subjection to him? Do you think the service you owe to God, is so purely a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will offering, that if you will render it you may, and if not, you are in no fault? By this reason God must be much beholden to you for it. What, do not his Laws bind, till you have given your consent? Must he ask you leave to govern you? Do you think it is with you in this case, as with a Servant, that owes this man or that no duty, till he hath hired himself into his service? Sure you cannot be so stupid. But rather, will you not yield, that from your very birth you are at least as much obliged to obedience to your Maker, as any Child to his Parent? And pray tell me, what would you think of that Child, who, when his Father bad him do any thing, should stubbornly refuse, and tell him he never promised him any such obedience? Would you think this a satisfactory answer? Do you not easilie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that Children are bound to obey their Parents, even by virtue of that relation they stand in to them, though they never enter into any formall engagement


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:107818:118"/>
to be dutifull? Even thus do you stand absolutelie bound to obey God, the Father of Spirits, before ever you professe you selves to be his people: And all your professions, though they are as so many farther ties upon you to obedience, yet they give not God any new right to you which before he had not, onelie hereby you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his right, and promise to render him what is his due. Hence then you may see what an absurd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit it is, that you may any whit more freelie sin against God before you have taken the Sacrament, than after. Can you be so sottish, as to imagine, that such excuses as these will serve your turn at that day, when you must be called to render a reason of your doing? When the Gospel first came to the Heathens, I hope, you'll grant they were bound to receive it, and yet they had never before given their consent to be rul'd by Christ, nor had made any Covenant with him. But why stand I so long on a case so plain?</p>
               <p>And then take notice farther; that by virtue of this subjection which you owe to God as his creatures, you are bound to expresse your resolutions to serve him, by what signs, and in what manner he shall appoint you; now he hath commanded you, to expresse these resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by receiving the Lords Supper, as I have before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: And will you disobey this particular command, and then think, this will excuse you from obedience to the rest? To make the case plain by a like instance: Suppose when the King had commanded all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to repair to severall places in the Kingdome, there to take the Oath of Allegiance, many amongst them should absent themselves, and refuse to take it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards should conspire together, and rise up in arms against him, do you think it would excuse them, to plead that they never swore Allegiance to him? Why, first it was their fault that they did not, since they were


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:107818:119"/>
commanded to do it; and then however, they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to peace and faithfulnesse by living in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and receiving protection from their Prince. Even thus will your neglect of Sacraments be charged on you as a fault, for which you had no reason, but will be farre from being admitted as an excuse of any other sins, against which you were sufficientlie tied, by your living meerly upon God, and receiving all you had from him.</p>
               <p>But then in the second place consider, <hi>you are already obliged by your own promises and professions, to walk in the fear of the Lord,</hi> and therefore have not the least ground to al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds Supper as an engagement against it. For bethink you a little, do you not profess your selves to be Christians? And what's the meaning of that, but that you worship God by Jesus Christ, and acknowledge him to be your Maker and Ruler, and Christ to be your Saviour? And accordinglie, are you not devoted to God by Baptisme, whereby you stand bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Devill, the World and the Flesh, and to be Christs faithfull servant to your lives end? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, you were thus consecrated to God by your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in you infancy, when, according to the Law of God and Nature, they had full power thus to dispose of you: but now you are come to years of discretion, do you consent to what they have done or not? In plain English, Doe you renounce your Baptisme, wherby you stand obliged to be the Servants of God and his Son Christ Jesus? You that I am now speaking to, will, I know, deny this with great earnestnesse, and cry, God forbid, that you should be such apostate wretches, from Christians to turn Heathens and Infidels. Well then, if you acknowledge your selves under the bond of your Baptisme, assure your selves, you are hereby as much


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:107818:119"/>
tied from the least sin in thought, word or deed, as you can be by the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. What will you do then in this case? will you dare to run on in those sins from which your Baptisme doth bind you, and so renounce it in your practise, whilst you own it in profession? Or will you hereafter be so silly as to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from the communion, for fear of engaging your selves to an holie life, to which you stand engag'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by your own consent. If you continue in this mind, it's too plain a sign that in your hearts you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own your Baptisme it self: and what a case are you in then? For let me ask you, if you had been born of Heathen Parents, and were but just now come to the understanding of the Christian Religion, and were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted what kind of Persons they must be that own'd it, would you be baptiz'd into this Faith, and hereby professe your resolutions to lead such an holy life, as all Christians are commanded? If you say you would not, hence then it follows that you dislike your Baptisme, since if it was to be done again you would none of it. And if indeed you wish your selves, in the case of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized Heathens now, you are reallie worse than they, and shall be in a worse condition shortlie. But if you say, you would readilie be baptized if it was yet to do, then fain would I know, why you are so backward to receive the Lords Supper, wherein you do but renew the Covenant that is made at Baptisme, acknowledging your selves to be true Christians, and promising that you will remain so: what possible reason can you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise for this unwillingness?</p>
               <p>Withall take notice, all you that are baptized into the name and Church of Christ, and do stand to your Baptisme, you have hereby bound your selves to be his faithfull servants, to obey his commands, and to behave your selves in his Church, as he directs you: Now he


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:107818:120"/>
hath commanded all Christians, that are of capacitie to prepare themselves, and so to receive the Sacrament of his Supper: Do you not clearlie perceive then, how your Baptisme bindes you to this dutie, you being now come to the use of your reason? How is it then that you dare neglect it, whilst you are so straitlie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to it?</p>
               <p>And further, beside your own Baptisme, you Fathers that have Children, every time you bring them to be baptized, do professe, before God and the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that you renounce the Devil, the World, and the sinfull lusts of the flesh, that you believe the Articles of the Christian faith, and will keep Gods holy will and commandments, &amp; walk in the same all the days of your life. And are you sincere in all this? If you are, why should you stay away from the Sacrament, where you are required to professe and promise no more? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I hope, hence you may be convinc't, that before you partake of the Lords Supper, you are so far bound to an holie life, that you have no allowance for the least sin any more, than you have afterward, which is that I am proving.</p>
               <p>And this is farther evident by all other duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which you perform to God, every one of which ties you to the most exact obedience to him. I suppose you are not so Atheistical but that sometimes you pray to God, and when you pray, do you not beg of him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sin and grace to do him faithful service? When you say the Lords Prayer, do you not therein beseech God to forgive you your trespasses, and not to lead you into temptation, but deliver you from evil? And what, dare you ask of him forgivenesse of sin, whilst you are resolved to continue in it still; I presume you hope to obtain what you ask, and can you so much as flatter your selves with any hope that God will pardon your

sins whilst y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rom sin and the power of Satan, is it not to be suppos'd that you desire these things? and doth not the expression of your desires engage you to do what you can to obtain what you pray for? and are you not therefore bound to take heed of sin, to watch against and resist temptations? except you take God for an Idol, and make your prayers in a mockerie, as if your servant should come and entreat you to help him do his work, and then run away, and never set his hand to't; or as if your Childe should pray you to keep him from falling into the water, and should throw himself into it as soon as he had done; dare you venture thus to play and dally with the All-mightie. And when you desire him to save your souls, and keep you from Hell, it speaks you resolv'd not wilfully to destroy and damn your selves, or else you are horrid mockers of God. Methinks you should never have the impudence to come neer him, or speak a word to him, whilst you are fully bent to go on in those waies that are so contrary and provoking to him. The like I might say of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word, you are thereby engaged to give obedience to it: for you cannot think sure you serve God suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently by hearing your duty, whilst you set not about it. And for you to come to hear what God shall say by his Minister, with a secret purpose to hold on in such and such courses, whatever shall be told you to the contrary, is little lesse dangerous and damnable, than to come to the Sacramnent with such wicked purposes. Let this then suffice to remove your first mistake, that you may take liberty in some sinful waies you have a minde to, before you have taken the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>The second gross mistake which I finde in your obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is, that you think, though at present you have no


<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107818:121"/>
great minde to be so serious, as to set upon preparation for the Sacrament, yet that hereafter you shall, when you have had your swinge a while longer, and have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a little more pleasure, being as yet perhaps but in the prime of your youth, and thereupon you hope that God will bear with you yet a while, since you have such good purposes to become his servants for the time to come.</p>
               <p>Should I go about fully to shew you the vanity of this conceit, and your folly in delaying to return to God, I might fill many sheets: wherefore that I may not be tedious, I shall do little more than represent to you, the very true language and import, of this pretence of yours, that so you may be ashamed of ever using it more, or harbouring it any longer. When you talk of staying yet a while, before you cast off your old compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and courses, and bind your selves to a godly life at the Sacrament, what do you in effect but say? That when you have contemn'd Gods mercy, and griev'd his spirit a little longer, and done somewhat more to dishonour his name, then you will betake your selves to him, and become his people; when you have done Satan yet a little more service, then you'l shake him off, and take Christ for your Master; when you have a while longer trod under foot his precious blood, then it shall wash you from all your sins; when you have run deeper on the score, and added something more both to the number and hainousness of your trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, then you'l come for a pardon; when you have done somewhat more to make God your enemie, then you'l seek reconciliation; when you have let your lusts take deeper rooting, then you'l pluck them up; when you have made them a little stronger, then you'l subdue them; when the sore is festered then you'l apply the Plaister; when the gangrene is almost got to


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107818:121"/>
your vitals, then you'l seek a remedy; thus foolishly, thus presumptuouslie and baselie do they argue, who think it is too soon yet to come home to God, and be religious in good earnest. I know you would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd to speak thus, and will scarce be perswaded there lodges so much wickednesse in your hearts, but for certain there does, whil'st you retain secret purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to go on in any way of known sin. Ah poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner! that thou didst but a little know what thou doest, whilst thou standst thus unresolv'd whither thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est yet bid farewell to thy lusts, and come over hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to God by Jesus Christ. Oh disingenuous creature! dost thou think thou hast not provokt and dishonour'd thy Maker enough yet? Hast thou not yet sufficientlie abused thy Redeemers grace and patience? Hast thou not yet thrown away time enough? and sinn'd away mercies and offers enough? Is sin so sweet and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a thing that it should be so hard to determine whether it was best be forsaken or not? Is God so hard a Master, and his service such a burdensome thing, that sinners must be wooed to him with so much earnestness, and all prove too little with the most? Is it so safe and desirable a state to remain still in the gall of bitterness and under the wrath of God? Can you keep off this wrath which you are plucking upon you? Have you both repentance and time at your own beck? And are you sure of acceptance, how long so ever you stay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you seek it? will holinesse be good for you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and is it not now? Or are you afraid of being happie too soon? wherefore weigh things well, Sirs, and then resolve whether there be any wisdome, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying that work which may be put off too long, but cannot be too quickly done: that work to which in all reason and conscience you stand engag'd every hour, even to be divorc't from sin and Satan, and firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:107818:122"/>
to the Lord Jesus. How long must he seek and sue for thy consent? Why should not he have thy youth as well as any other? Doth Satan deserve it better than he? Did not he die for thee in the prime of his years, and why should'st not thou live to him whilst thou art young? When wilt thou have put away that wretched disobedient answer, that it's yet <hi>too soon</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him? Hath he stood knocking for entrance till his locks are wet with the dew of the night, and is it still <hi>too soon</hi> to open to him and let him in? Oh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, least thy continued stubbornnesse should even wear out his patience; least thy perverse carriage should provoke him for ever to leave thee; and least if still thou think'st it not <hi>time</hi> yet to break off thy sins, and set upon a godly life, he should think it <hi>time</hi> to cut thee off, and sentence thee to everlasting death. In the mean time know, that all thy good designs, what thou wilt do, and be hereafter, will not be the least excuse of thy present wickednesse, nor make thy case any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with God; nay rather they make it worse, since it appears thou art convinced in thy Conscience, that thou oughtest to live after another fashion than thou do'st, and yet wilfully neglectest thy acknowledged du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I hope then I have said enough, to shew that thou hast no refuge, no excuse that will hold, whilst thou ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentest thy self from the Sacrament, out of a lothnesse as yet to reform thy life, and do the duties to which this would bind thee. Wherefore to conclude. If it be thy purpose to continue in any sinfull course, come to the Lords Table if thou darest: for farre be it from me to speak one word to encourage thee to forswear thy self. But yet on the other hand, Go on in thy sins, and stay away if thou darest: for thou art in danger every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of dropping into Hell, whilst thou remainest in such a state. Thou seest then to what a strait sin brings


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:107818:122"/>
thee, so that turn thee which way thou wilt, whilst thou willingly carriest it about thee, an Angel with a flaming sword stands full in thy way, threatning destruction; whether thou comest or comest not, whilst thou conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuest a resolved sinner, thy case is sad and deplorable. But yet one way remains, and but one that I know for thy safety, even with all speed to cast away thy sins, and change thy heart and life: and then come as soon as thou wilt to the Lords Table, there to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse this blessed change, and to confirm thy self therein. And for thy encouragement take notice of two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is not an absolute sinlesse perfection that here thou bindest thy self to</hi>; even this thou should'st thirst and aspire after, but yet thou art not to be discouraged, if thou never attain it, till thou art taken into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>the Spirits of just men made perfect.</hi> Mistake me not, as if I was indulging thee an allowance in any the least sin, no, this is it I warn thee of, and against this thou must covenant in the Sacrament, to wit, against a willing, loving entertainment of any sin whatever. And thou shalt be accounted true to this Covenant, if thou hate and strive against all, and art humbled under the sense of thy remaining imperfections, being farre more desirous to be rid of them, than to retain them, and if upon knowledge of any slip or stumble thou risest again by true repentance, and recourse to the blood of Christ for mercy, and to his Spirit for fresh strength, being resolved to take more heed to thy ways for the time to come. It is here as if thou should'st promise thy P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lfully bring diseases upon thy self, but wilt use the means that are appointed to preserve thy health; and whatever


<pb n="230" facs="tcp:107818:123"/>
sicknesse cleaves to thee will be thy trouble, and thou wilt desire and endeavour to be freed from it. Even thus art thou bound to regard the health of thy soul, and to look upon sin as a spirituall sicknesse, and therefore never to fall in love with it, but to do thy best toward its utter removall: Even those infirmities, to which the best are liable, are not to be cherisht and pleaded for, no more than thou would'st plead for the keeping of a little head-ach, or any bodily pain. Thou should'st not by thy good will be guilty so much as of a vain thought, an idle word, or the least motion to any sin; but yet it is not required of thee, to promise abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely never more to be guilty of any of these; nor art thou to judge thy self unfit for the Sacrament, because thou find'st such imperfections cleave to thee, so long as from thy heart thou abhorrest them, and do'st ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily overcome all temptations to more grosse and wilfull sins. Whilst thou art in the flesh, thy state is like to be so farre imperfect, that it will be thy daily duty <hi>to grow in grace,</hi> and to pray for the <hi>forgivenesse of thy trespasses</hi>; to improve Christ both as a treasurie of grace, whence thou art to be supplied, and as an Advocate with the Father, through whom thou maist be pardoned. This I mention, that thou maist not say, I discourage thee from the Sacrament, by making it an engagement to greater strictnesse, than it's possible for man in this life to come up to, since, I do assure thee thou maist safely come hither, if thou art but sincerely resolved to doe what in thee lies to please God, and not to run wilfully into those actions, which thou know'st are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his will. And this also may take away that fond opinion of some ignorant people, <hi>that it's best ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to receive the Sacrament, till they come to their death-bed,</hi> as thinking that every sin afterward will damn them; but remember what I have told you, that we do


<pb n="231" facs="tcp:107818:123"/>
not promise never to sin more, but not to allow our selves in sin; and to this sincere endeavour to keep all Gods commands, we are before as strictly tied by our Baptisme, and therefore by your reason this should be deferred till we come to die, as some of the ancients did, partly through this mistake; and thinking this washt away all the sins before committed. And if you should be of this opinion also, that the Sacrament gives you a pardon of all your former sins, and therefore it's good to put it off to your death-bed, consider well, that it's by virtue of Gods promises that you have any ground to expect pardon of sin; and by those promises, to which the Sacraments are seals, this pardon is assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to all penitent believing ones; so that Baptisme and the Lords Supper do seal your pardon, even of sins that may hereafter be committed, if you truly repent of them, and betake your selves to Gods mercy in Christ for forgivenesse: But if you think, when you have liv'd an ungodly life, to make up all by taking the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when you are sick, know, to your timely convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this will not do the work, as you shall know to your terrour, if you depend upon't: for remember what I told you, that if you do not truly repent of sin, it is not the Sacrament that will give you a pardon, and this true repentance, few upon a death-bed have, that put it off till then. Moreover, you that are for deferring this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty till you come to die, I might ask you how you know, whether you shall not die suddenly, or have the use of your reason taken away by your distemper, or be visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Plague, that no Minister dare come near you? and farther, you seem not to consider, that this Ordinance is exceeding helpfull to us, for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of lusts, and leading our lives as we ought, and this brings me to the second thing which I would have you take notice of.</p>

Little do'st thou think what a mightie blow thou mightest give to thy strong lusts, and to the kingdome of Satan within thee, by such a firm resolution as this, made with an humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon Gods grace, bound upon, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by taking the Sacrament. Oh! if thou wast but brought into so ingenuous and good a frame, as to be truly grieved, that Sin and Satan should have so much interest in thee, and didst heartily desire, that God would cast them forth, and take possession of thee for himself, in how good a way wast thou then to a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?

Wherefore sit not down in a faint dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; say not, <hi>there is no hope of ever getting up such strong lusts, which are so deep rooted in my nature, and so confirmed by long custome, it's to no purpose to attempt it.</hi> Why man, must not this work be done, or thou perish for ever?

his help; oh how soon can he bring down all high imaginations, and every thought that rebells against him, and subdue all things to himself. He hath healed and cleansed as vile sinners as thou, and conquered as stubborn hearts as thine. He can so change thy nature, and the very temper and bent of thy soul, that thou shalt abhorre those sins, which now thou think'st thou canst not live without, so that thou wilt chuse rather to be torn limb from limb, or to take Toads and Serpents into thy bosome, than to meddle, with what was once so pleasant; and wilt wonder that ever thou should'st be such a beast, such a Devil, as to take delight in that which was so hurtfull to thy self, and so displeasing to God. Oh let not then the seeming sweetness of any lust bewitch thee any longer, or betray thee into a slothfull neglect of thy duty: If sin would have made thee hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, thou hadst found it long since, and yet what hast thou ever got from it, that comforts thee to look back upon it? Or that would do thee any good if thou wast to die at this hour? And put it on thy account, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better wilt thou get at the last.

Bind thy self by the most solemn vow to forsake thy wicked waies, and to become Gods faithfull servant, and come to the Sacrament with this design; and if thou be sincere, thou maist be confident of receiving help from God, to keep this Covenant, which by his Word and Spirit, thou art drawn to make with him.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Obj.</hi> THE fourth and last that I shall take notice of, is very common in the mouths of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to wit, <hi>That they are at variance with their neighbours, and therefore cannot with a good Conscience come to the Communion, whither none are to come, but they that are in perfect charity with all men;</hi> and commonlie they alledge, that they have Law-suits, or some kind of quarrellings one with another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> In answer hereto, let me ask you, who put this objection, whose fault is it, that you are not at peace with your neighbours? I question not but you'll pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently tell me, that the fault is theirs. But then farther, have you no enmitie in your minds against them? But are you willing to be reconciled to them, and to do what on your part may conduce thereto? And though they be crosse and perverse, yet do you from your heart forgive them? so that you would not take revenge on them, if it were in your power, but would do them good, if they should need your help? It's very like you'll be ready to reply, that you are thus well-affected toward them, and that the malice is onely on their part: and for the present I shall suppose you speak true; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I demand, whether you can be so weak, as to think that another mans sin, shall be laid to your charge? If your neighbour be malicious, is that any fault of yours? Or doth his malice make you any more unfit for the Sacrament, than his drunkennesse or covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? What a sad case might the best Christian be in, if it was in the power of every wicked man, that owes


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:107818:125"/>
him a spite to make it unlawfull for him to go to the Sacrament? as by your arguing it would be. Suppose any malicious Man should without reason pick a quarrel with me, and after I had used all means to pacifie him, should utterly refuse to be at peace, what's to be done in this case? Must I stay away from the Sacrament till I can perswade him to be friends with me? perhaps that may never be, and must I be bound to a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible? or be so great a loser through another Mans wickednesse, which I cannot help? Is it not enough for me to be reconcil'd to him in my own minde, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to forgive him what injuries he hath done me? how else would those blessed Saints in the Primitive times have done, whilst they were maligned and persecuted by almost all Men? we never finde that they made this any pretence to keep away from the Lords Table, at which they did so frequently attend. They thought themselves guiltlesse (as well they might) whilst they praied for their Persecutors, blest them that curst them, not avenging themselves, but giving place unto wrath, and not giving to any Man just cause of offence. And do you but labour thus to behave your selves, and then never trouble your mindes with other Mens enmitie against you. Yea, do but thus, and you will fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the command God hath given us, to live in peace and quietnesse. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. <hi>If it be possible, as much as in you lies, live peaceably with all men.</hi> Which words plainly insinuate that it is not alwaies possible to have the good will of all Men, but yet we must labour for this, and do nothing that may hinder it, and therefore above all must not bear, or discover ill will to them.</p>
               <p>But here perhaps some will reply that they are forc't to vindicate their wrongs, and to go to Law with those that would abuse them, or that sue them without cause; and therefore can they with a safe conscience receive


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:107818:126"/>
the Sacrament before the contention is ended? why, to this you must even ask your own hearts for an answer. For (as I said before) if you this while have no malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous design against them, but seek only to defend o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> right your selves in a just and lawfull manner, there's nothing that need trouble you in this case. For in the thing it self, its not a sin to go to Law, if the cause and design be good, no more than it was for the <hi>Jews</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to their Judges, to determine matters betwixt man and man. And therefore when the Apostle condemns the Christians, for going to Law one with another, before the Heathen Judges, which made it <hi>utterly a fault,</hi> he yet adviseth them to set some in the Church to judge betwixt the brethren, in controversies that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen touching their worldly concernment. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4, 5. And these suits may possibly be lawfull on both sides, as when such a difficult case shall happen that cannot otherwise be decided, and then both parties might main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain charity to each other, if they were but such as they ought. But if without cause you are vext by men of contention, beware of acting out of wrath, spleen or revenge; yea, or of doing any thing out of meer self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness: for even in your temporal concerns, about your estate, credit, &amp;c. Gods interest should be more aimed at than your own; and you should not so much endeavour to secure or recover these, for your own sake, as that you may hereby be more capable of honouring God: and if you saw that, through some circumstances, it might tend more to Gods honour, to neglect a vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of your right than to prosecute it, in such a case it would be your duty to sit still. (They that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted themselves, and all they have to God, will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this and none else.) Hence you finde the Apostle expostulating with the Christians, why they would not take wrong, and even suffer themselves to be defrauded


<pb n="237" facs="tcp:107818:126"/>
rather than contend, whereby they did then so much disgrace Religion. <hi>Vers.</hi> 7. Of that forequoted Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But yet I say, when it is your duty to maintain your right, against those that would abuse you, you may do this, and yet have no spight against their persons, nor any desire of their hurt, if your own hearts be right; and may really forgive them, whilst you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoid the injury which they would offer you. And let this suffice on supposition, that you are thus well-affected towards those, that make themselves your adversaries; which if you indeed be, I hope I need use no more words to perswade you, that other Mens mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious behaviour toward you, need be no hindrance to your coming to the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>But on the other side, give me leave to deal plainly with you, all you that insist upon this reason for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting your duty, <hi>because there's difference betwixt you and your neighbours,</hi> I strongly suspect that you your selves, are very much in fault: and indeed you confesse as much by your practice, whilst in your words you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own it; for why is it you make this a ground of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining from the Sacrament; but that your conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces tell you, you bear so much ill will to your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that its a dangerous thing for you to receive it? Oh look back upon your waies, and see whether instead of bearing wrongs, you have not wrong'd and defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others. Have you not opprest, or needlesly vext them, through eager designes of raising your selves by their ruines, not caring whom you have injured and trampled upon, so you might but get your own ends? Of if you will not own this, yet look faithfully into the temper of your souls. Do you not stand vilely affected towards some that have done you injuries, and whom you take for your enemies? Are you not backward to any thorow reconciliation with them? Do you not


<pb n="238" facs="tcp:107818:127"/>
stand upon your terms? &amp; expect that they should come first and humble themselves, and stoop to you, before you'l seek after any peace with them? your great spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits scorn to be first in this work; nay its well if you are not resolv'd against it, let them do what they will? Oh proud wretches! Is this like Gods dealing with the World? when we had given him the offence, yet who was it began first to treat of a peace? Hath the great God given you this example, and yet are you <hi>too good,</hi> forsooth, to seek to your fellow-creatures to be at peace with you? If this be your <hi>goodnesse,</hi> may not the Devil himself passe for <hi>good</hi>? for he hath pride enough, and what's yours better? But further, do you not cherish a secret spleen against them, which fills you with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable desires of being reveng'd on them, and makes you griev'd to see them do well in the World? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you could heartily wish their ruine, and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to be in a capacity of doing them a mischief; and long to bring them under you, that you might insult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and make them repent that ever they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd such as you, Oh divellish and monstrous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit! that ever it should dwell in the breasts of any that call themselves Christians!

For did not the fear of Man restrain them, you should quickly see their envenom'd rancour break out into as bad effects. But suppose your malice be not boild up to such an height, yet if you harbour so much as makes you unfit for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as according to your own acknowledgment you do, whilst it keeps you from it) it's a plain sign your souls are yet under miserable distempers, far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly sanctifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:107818:127"/>
the secret cause of this your discord with others. And alas! though these present differences were ended, you would be farre from a fitnesse for the Sacrament, whilst you abide in the condition you are yet in, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your peace made with God, but being in enmitie against him, through a subjection to your reigning lusts. And therefore you might more trulie say, you are not fit for this dutie, because you are proud, and covetous, and envious, than because you are at variance with any one; onely you hope for some kind of excuse, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fault on others, but that I have taken off before. And furthermore, is it not a plain discoverie, how little love you have to Christ and your own souls, that you can willingly be so long absent from this Ordinance, upon such a silly pretence as this, that your neighbours and you are not agreed. It's a sign of an ill stomach, when people are glad of an excuse to save them from eating. What, could not you, if you had been so mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have got an agreement before now? Or at least, could not you have done so much towards it, as might have satisfied your Consciences, that you were not in fault? Was there but any worldly advantage to be got by doing thus much, you would soon set about it, I'le warrant you. But being, I doubt, very indifferent to Sacraments, or to any thing that concerns your souls, a very little reason serves to keep you from them, since you find no want of them, nor can imagine how you should be much bettered by them. And whilst you are in this wretched frame, be sure you shall never want one thing or other to hinder you.

you may safely persist in such and such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or in such a temper of mind, which ought to be changed before you go thither: for thus you seem to think, whilst you stay away, because there are fallings out betwixt you and others; being, it seems resolved to continue in your enmitie, and think your selves secure enough, if you come not hither in this evil mind. If these be your thoughts, pray answer me these two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How can you desire of God the forgivenesse of your sins whilst you refuse to forgive others?</hi> Have you the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to doe it? Or the ignorance and presumption, to think such desires would be granted? See where the contrarie is expresly told you, in that forementioned place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.15. Nay, tell me plainlie, How dare you so much as say the Lords Prayer, wherein you beg of God to forgive your trespasses, as you forgive those that trespasse against you? What, do you pray that he would remember your iniquities, and charge them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and take vengeance of you? For thus it seems you deal with those that offend you. Or do you think to make your case somewhat the better, by never saying this Prayer, or by leaving out this Petition? Can you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine this will hinder God from dealing with you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenour thereof? Methinks you should not be so weak: No, be you sure God will make good his word, that if you forgive not, you shall not be forgiven, whether you give your consent or not. If you say you do forgive your enemies, then I ask you again, why upon account of any differences you should neglect the Sacrament? But if you dare not forgive them, you see it's as dangerous to say your Prayers, whilst you are in this mind, as to come to the Communion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But again, If through these differences with your neighbours you are unfit for the Sacrament, pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think


<pb n="241" facs="tcp:107818:128"/>
you well, <hi>whether upon the same account you are not as unfit for death</hi>? And dare you continue in such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate condition as this? Do you not believe, that the charity which is required to make you fit, for the Communion of imperfect Saints here on earth, is as necessary for your admission into the communion of Saints in glory? Are you not fit to go to the Lords Table? and are you then fit to appear before his Tribunall? Take this for an undoubted truth, that if you so farre allow your self in malice or any other sin, that you are (according to the Gospel rule) unworthy of the Sacrament, if you die in this condition, you will be thought unworthy of everlasting life. Methinks then you should never dare to live in such an estate, wherein you dare not die. You take it to be a dangerous thing to die out of charity with any, and is it safe think you, to live out of charity, or in any other sin, for those that are liable to death every moment? Wherefore, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, my advice to you is, that you would without any longer delay go to your brother, and if you have wrong'd him, acknowledge it, and make all due reparation, and do what in you lies to be reconciled to him: but if he prove obstinate, or have wrong'd you, see that you heartily forgive, and clear your breast of all spight, or desire of revenge; so being carefull in all other respects duly to prepare your selves, come to the Lords Table, there to receive a confirmation of peace betwixt God and your own souls. And thus I have done with the severall objections that are made against this duty.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Directions for a due Preparation, and right Receiving.</head>
               <p>IN the last place, according to my promise, I come to give some Direction to those who are willing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse themselves to this work; to instruct them for their immediate preparation to, their behaviour in and after the same. And though I have already at large shewn what the design of this Ordinance is, that so we might the better know how to behave our selves thereat, and have thence discovered what kind of persons Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants ought to be, yet I shall in a few words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise a repetition of the same, that you may the better apprehend and remember it.</p>
               <p>Know then, that it pleased our blessed Lord Jesus, in the evening of that night wherein he was betrayed, to appoint this Sacrament of his Supper, partly for the present comfort of his Apostles (who began to be cast down upon the knowledge of his sufferings, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall from amongst them) but principally for the benefit of them, and all other Christians, in the times that were to follow, even till he should come to Judgement, till which time it never ought to be laid down in the Church. The great end of it was (as I have said) to preserve fresh in the minds of all Christians, the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of their Lord and Master, and especially of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable mercy shewn in his dying for them, his Death being very clearly held forth by the breaking of the Bread, and pouring out of the Wine. But we must not think, that it was for an idle uneffectuall Remembrance of him, that he commanded this duty, but for such a Remembrance, as might tend to the great advantage of our souls; even that by Remembring our Redemption,


<pb n="243" facs="tcp:107818:129"/>
we might be brought to have low mean thoughts of our selves, who were lost and undone, but recovered by Free-grace; that we might keep up a sence of the exceeding great evil of sin, which made us liable to those miseries, whence onely his Death can deliver us, and so might be stirr'd up to a greater sorrow for, hatred of, and resolutions against sin, the occasion of his Death; and that by the Remembrance of his love, we might be the stronglier engaged to him, and here in a visible and expresse manner, might solemnize our Covenant with him, and frequently renew our promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of faithfulnesse. Moreover, here Christ hath made a familiar representation of the blessings he hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for Believers, that hereby we might be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to earnest desires after them, and so being at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent fitted, for the communications of grace to our souls, might receive the same; and might here also receive a confirmation of our faith, that we shall in due time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy those priviledges that are invisible, and yet to come. And farther, he hath ordained, that his Death should in this lively manner, at set times be represented to us, that having it fresh in our thoughts, we may be the more powerfully moved at such seasons as these, to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate and adore that wisdome and goodnesse, which hath so wonderfully appeared in the contrivance, and accomplishment of our Redemption; and that Fellow-Christians meeting together for this work, may be the more endeared to one another, and quickned to long after a perfect communion in the praises and love of God and their Redeemer, in that future glory whereof they have here a shadow and forecast.</p>
               <p>Now as the ends for which this Ordinance was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed inform us, what kind of persons they that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent it ought to be, as to their habituall qualifications, so do they also teach us, what ought to be the workings


<pb n="244" facs="tcp:107818:130"/>
of our soul in our approches to it; since here we are to exercise and put forth those graces, which are before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be wrought in us: but yet for your plainer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, I shall tell you more particularly how you ought then to behave your selves; and lastly shall shew, how you may improve it afterwards to your greatest advantage.</p>
               <p>But by the way take notice, that I suppose you, to whom I now speak, to be such as are heartily willing to come to the Sacrament, in that manner, and to those ends which Christ hath commanded: and therefore I suppose you to be already so farre convinc't of the evil of sin, that you are resolved to forsake it; and so farre convinc't of the greatnesse of those benefits that come by a Saviour, and of your need of him, that you are firmly purposed to accept of him, as he offers himself to you, that you may be his, and he may be yours for ever. And upon this account, I shall say little to put you upon, or help you in that self-examination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may come to the knowledge of your own estates, whether you have a true work of grace wrought in your hearts or not, since I have before said so much to this purpose; but shall now rather direct you, how to to exercise and expresse your Repentance, Faith and other graces. Onely as you go along, if you find your selves willing to perform the duties I shall mention, you have reason to believe that your condition is good, but if you refuse these you have too much ground to suspect, that all is not well with you. And though it be usuall to distinguish betwixt dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for an immediate preparation to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and those that are for a right demeanour in the act of Receiving, yet I shall chuse rather to speak of both under the same Head, since it hath been my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse all along, to bring souls to a fitnesse for this work,


<pb n="245" facs="tcp:107818:130"/>
and since in our performance of the duty, our hearts ought to be kept, in the same disposition and frame that they were brought into, by our preparations for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First then, I would advise you who intend to come to the Lords Table, to set apart some convenient time, for the preparing of your souls for this weighty work. It is a most serious businesse, and ought to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously taken in hand. Let nothing here be done cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorily or rashly. Not that I would have you daunted, as if it was a work of that nature, that you must either come trembling, or else stay away for fear: no, but onely see you be very serious; for so you ought to be whenever you have any thing to do with God, even when you so much as mention his name, or open a Bible, or come to hear his Word; &amp; therefore being now in a more especiall manner to draw near to him, in a duty wherein a miscarriage is more dangerous, it's very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that you make more solemn preparation for it, since upon this, the right performance of it, doth very much depend. And therefore it is, that I would have you set some time apart for that purpose, which will be most convenient in the week, or on the day before you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: though I would have you be employed in this work more than once or twice. But if you are Servants, and so are straitned of time, or through poverty are constrained to daily labour, you must watch for the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test opportunities you can get. And it is no doubt, but you will find time enough, if you will but be watchfull to redeem time from idlenesse, and vain ways of spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it. However, it's better to spare some time from your working, or sleeping, yea, or eating, than to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect those works, for which you had your life it self: for it's of farre more consequence, I hope, to save your souls for ever, than to keep your bodies alive a little while, though you may very well do both, if you be willing.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:107818:131"/>2. Having set apart some time, see that you be not onely got alone, and your hands taken off your busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but let your hearts be withdrawn from off all worldly things, and set, as in the presence of God, upon an employment of no small consequence; and humbly beg of God, that he would vouchsafe you his presence and assistance in these your preparations, and in the work you are preparing for; that he would set and keep your minds in a frame suitable thereto; and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously own, accept and blesse you, who in obedience to him have set upon this duty. And beg of him, that he would help you in the searching of your heart, and reviewing of your life, that you may not onely have a sight of sin, but a right sense of its vilenesse, that you may not onely think of it, but grieve for it; and that all your meditations may be attended with suitable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and that in all, you may be sincere and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, that so upon, good grounds, you may take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the review of what you shall have done, and by this present opportunity may be advanc't one step forward toward your eternall rest.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And when you have done thus, Let your first work be, <hi>to enter into such a serious consideration of your own estate, both by nature and practice, as may be most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall to bring you to a sound repentance.</hi> The reason why I advise you to this first, is, because you being now about to celebrate the remembrance of the greatest mercy that ever was manifested to man-kind, wherein especially love &amp; thankfulness are to be exercised, it is not possible you should feelingly acknowledge it as so great a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if you be not very sensible of your own misery, &amp; of that absolute need you stand in of it. Should you offer money to one, who thinks he has no great want of it, he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght take it perhaps, but not with that thankfulness that another would, who is ready to starve for lack of relief.


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:107818:131"/>
A man that perceives himself sinking and drowning, with what readinesse will he lay hold on an hand that's held out to save him? Thus, the deeper sense you have of your own vilenesse, the more will you admire Gods goodnesse, in having any regard to such a worthlesse wretch as you. The greater you perceive your sins to be, the more need you will see of pardoning mercie, the more you will prize, and the closer you will cleave to Christ, and the more readilie will you come hither to receive the seal of your pardon. The lower your humilations are, the higher ordinarily will you rise in praise and joy. Wherefore it will be very needfull, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if this be the first time of thy receiving, or though it should not, yet I say, it will be needfull and profitable for thee to take an impartiall view of thy self, what a vile unworthy sinner thou art, that so thou maist think meanly of thy self as thou oughtest to think and maist be sincerely humbled in the remembrance of all thy miscarriages. And for thy help herein I shall run over a few particulars.</p>
               <p>Consider what a sinfull nature thou brought'st into the World with thee, being <hi>conceived in sin, and shapen in iniquity,</hi> and being hereby a <hi>Childe of wrath.</hi> Think how ignorant thou art of God, how much at enmitie with him naturallie; how exceeding prone to all sin and how averse from goodnesse, as by experience thou hast sadly found, and didst soon begin to finde, so that thou maist well acknowledge, that <hi>in thy flesh dwells no good thing.</hi> And then remember with brokennesse of heart, how early thou didst set upon a trade of actual sinning, wherein thou hast been so constant all thy days. And call to minde the several ages of thy life which thou hast past through, and the particular sins of those times; the sensuality and pride, and all the follies of thy youth; thy mispence of precious time in idlenesse


<pb n="248" facs="tcp:107818:132"/>
and foolish sports and pastimes. Reflect also upon the sins of thy riper years, if thou art yet come to them, such commonly as company-keeping, drunkennesse and wantonnesse; or on the other hand, covetounesse, over-eager following of the World, to the neglect of Gods service, injuring and over-reaching your neighbours, uncharitableness to the poor. Call to mind also the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and relations you have lived in, and the sins you were therein guilty of, as whilst you were at home with your Parents, at School, or in service, or any other way dispos'd of: think whether you were not guilty of tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lies, of disobedience, slothfulnesse and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, which are the usual sins of those times. You will finde it very profitable and affecting, to be as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and punctual as you can in this review, as to think at such a place, in such company, I was guilty of such and such sins. And then fetch in matter for your humiliation, by considering the several aggravations of your sins, as your being devoted to God by Baptisme, and yet revolting from him, when you came to the use of your reason; receiving all you had from him, and yet rebelling against him, abusing your mercies to the dishonour of the giver. Moreover <hi>your</hi> sins are much the more hainous, who have had good education, and been brought up to hear and read the word of God, and have been plainly told what is your duty, and yet have neglected it; who have had many a time convictions of the sinfulnesse and danger of your courses, and yet have gone on in them, and have had some purposes of a reformation, and yet have soon lost them; or it may be under some pangs of conscience, or in a fit of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, you have made promises of amendment, and yet all came to nothing, but after that you went on in a carelesse course of life. You whom I now suppose to be thorowly converted to God, let it grieve your hearts


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:107818:132"/>
thus to remember the sins of your unregenerate state, that you should live so long estrang'd from God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain such unworthy thoughts of him, and do so much to provoke him, whom you have since found so good and gracious. How can you with dry eies think of that time, when you were like others, <hi>foolish, disobedient, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures?</hi> Me thinks you should be fil'd with a kinde of horrour when you do but reflect upon that dismall state: when you think how neer you were to the burning Lake, and yet how secure; and when you consider what a meer sink of loathsome sins your hearts once were. Oh sirs! was not that a sad time, when you could take delight in nothing but in doing your selves mischief? when nothing tasted sweet but draughts of poison? when the very bent of your souls was contrary to God and godlinesse? so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had a tendencie hereto, was nauseated by you? Prayer was a burden, hearing a burden, holy confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence strange and troublesome, and a godly life was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the greatest toil and slavery in the World; so that you could go whole daies and weeks without any thought of God, and never feel any hurt in it. Oh can you without shame remember, how you have many a time hearkned to Satan's temptations, whilst the good spirit of God hath been resisted and griev'd? How did your loving Saviour follow you from time to time, and by his spirit and Ministers beseech you that you would be reconcil'd to God? and yet you did stubbornly and unkindly put him off, when he had laid open to you what he had done for you, and what advantages he came to bring you, yet you slighted his offers, as if they were inconsiderable things. Are you not amazed at your own daring impudence and presumption, to make the great God wait on you so long in vain? He who in a moment could have stopt that breath which he gave you,


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:107818:133"/>
and thrown you into the Hell you deserved, that yet you durst disobey his commands, yea, even reject the suit he made to you, to save your own souls. But to proceed, you are also to call to minde your miscarriages, since God by the power of his grace brought you home to himself, and shew'd you so much of the evil of sin, that you acknowledged your former behaviour, to be full as vile as I have been representing it, and did ingage your selves to him, to become his obedient people. Now consider how you have answered this engagement. And though since that time, your sins may not have been so gross nor so frequent as before they were, yet they are now of another nature, and capable of greater aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, as being committed against greater light and experienced love, even against that God who hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardoned you and received you into his favour. Think then how unsuitably you have walkt to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession you have made, and the means you have enjoy'd, how unthankfull you have been for mercies, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull and unserviceable since you became the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, though heretofore you had done so much against him; think how little you have done as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Masters, and Neighbours to advance his glorie, and consider and bewail all other failings, in the duties of your Relations. Oh think what folly it was in you so much as to venture upon the least sin, who have been convinced that its your own greatest hurt; or to start aside from the holy path, to walk in which you have found to be infinitelie most for your own ease and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Let it grieve you to finde such remnants of sin yet in your selves, any inclination to evil and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse to good. With sorrow look back upon all your slips and haltings, and partial backslidings, that you have made no more progresse in holinesse, nor got more good by the priv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107818:133"/>
in the remembrance of your dullnesse, hypocrisie, formality in religious duties, being either prone to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them, or slubber them over in a cold and drowsie manner, or else to rest in them. Call to minde also your unfaithfulnesse to the many promises, you have made of better obedience, in your Prayers, or at the Lords Table; and especially review your carriage since the last Sacrament, you who have formerly received it. And having by such like considerations as these affected your hearts with a sense of your iniquities, humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take your selves to God, and lay open all before him by a free and full confession: acknowledge what wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hainou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> sinners you are, and how unworthy of the least favour, and beg of him to work and increase in you that true and kindly sorrow for sin, which may fit you for mercy. And cease not by your good will from this confession, till you finde your souls even melted within you, in the apprehension of your own vilenesse, but however cease not, till you finde in your hearts a loathing of every sin, and of your selves by reason of it. And if you have but an inward sense of your sores and pollutions, you will not want such words to expresse it, as will be acceptable to God; only see that you be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and let your heart make your confessions rather than your tongue. Labour to be as sensible of your case, as you would be if now you stood before a King whom you had offended, from whom except you could beg a pardon, you must presently be put to death, of which pardon there was good hope, if he did but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you to be really sorry for your fault. Oh how affectionate and earnest would you be in this case! and would have words at will to expresse your self. How passionately would you acknowledge and bewail the offence you had committed? and with what vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence professe against ever being guilty of the like?


<pb n="252" facs="tcp:107818:134"/>
And how importunately would you beg for mercie, when you saw no other way but present death, if your importunitie did not prevaile? Thus behave your selves towards God, and believe that he stands over you now in your Closet, and hearkens to your Prayers, and observes whether you be heartie in them or not. But remember all this while, it is an inward-dislike and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of sin, wherein the truth of your Repentance consists, more than in bare confessing it, and speaking against it with the greatest fervour: these are required too, but beware of taking up with these; Beware I say, as ever you hope for mercie, of retaining any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret liking to sin, or the least thoughts of continuing in it still, whilst with a great deal of stir you revile it as such an abominable thing. But rather, if you finde in your souls a kinde of hankering after some old lust, not yet thorowlie mortified, betake your selves to those considerations which may bring you out of love with it, as how little its like to do for you, what an happinesse it doth now, and will hereafter deprive you of, what a miserie it leads to, with other the like formerlie laid down; and quit not these thoughts, till you finde your selves turned against it. For once again let me assure you, then, and never till then, is your Repentance right, when you are not only brought to grieve for sin, but to hate it; when your hearts are not only broken in the remembrance of it, but are broken off from, and thorowlie bent against it.</p>
               <p>Though this exercise of Repentance seems most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly preparative to the work you are going about, yet in such a penitent humble frame would I have you be, even when you are at the Lords Table. If you eat this bread and mingle the Wine with tears, it will be never the worse for your souls. And must it not needs affect thee to behold Christs body broken, and his


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:107818:134"/>
blood poured out here in a figure, and then to think with thy self, [This was sin, my sin; even my pride and earthlinesse, and all the wickednesse of my heart and life, was part of that load, which he bare on his own bodie on the Cross, when he cried out, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Might not the Lord call to me, and even shew me the Print of my many grievous sins, in his hands and feet, and the deep stabs they gave him? and yet ungratefull wretch that I am, how little have I valued this his love? how little hath my heart been affected herewith? where had I been, and what had become of me, if he had not thus underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for me? Oh what had my sins brought upon me, if he had not interpos'd and kept it off? how mad and senslesse have I been, in venturing upon sin, harbouring and delighting in sin? Sin, which is so hainous a thing, that without shedding of blood it will never be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and for which no blood, but that of Christs could obtain a remission. How more especially hainous then is my guilt in undervaluing this blood so much and so long, as I have done? How base was my heart to give entertainment to sin after I had heard what it had done against Christ? and to deny entertainment to him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had heard how much he had done for me? Was his kindnesse such as to bleed for my sins, and shall not I weep for them, especially for the unkindnesse I have shewn to him?] As God never shew'd greater love to Man, than in delivering up his Son for our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, so he never shew'd greater hatred of sin than by this action; and therefore conformably as we ought hereby to be brought to the greatest love of God, so to the deepest hatred of sin and humiliation for it. But I have formerly more fully shewn how the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs death, may bring us to true Repentance, and what I there spoke chiefly of a change of state


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:107818:135"/>
may be applied to the particular exercise of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, wherefore I shall insist no more on this. Onely let me meet with an Objection, that may perhaps be in the minds of some, namely, <hi>That sorrow for sin at this time, scarce seems consistent with, that hope of mercy, that joy and thankfulnesse, which are chiefly required in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant.</hi> Know therefore, that I presse no sorrow, but what is a preparation to joy, and doth even animate and exalt it, whilst the humble Christian reflects upon his own nothingnesse and unworthinesse, and thence is carried forth to the greater admiration of that mercy that hath so favourably regarded him. And take notice farther, that I would have the sense of Divine bounty, chiefly to raise and keep up this humiliation, whilst we think with our selves, <hi>Oh what wretched creatures are we, thus to offend so loving a Father, who notwithstanding all our provocations, is yet compassionate towards us, and upon our return to him is so readily reconciled.</hi> To retain this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of love in the midst of our mournings, will make them most ingenuous, and even pleasant to our souls; and though it will make us sincere and deep in our repentance, yet it will so mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our spirits, that we shall not <hi>sorrow as those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope</hi>; and I could wish, that Christians in all their sorrowings would observe this rule. But then, that such an ingenuous shame and sorrow as this, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the greatest confidence of mercy, there is not the least doubt, for which (to omit all further proof of a matter so plain) see that very apposite Text, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.62, 63. <hi>And I will establish my Covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, That thou maist re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee, for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.</hi> It is to be considered moreover, that the promises of joy are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally

made to this frame. The spirit of the humble and contrite, God hath promised to revive; They that mourn shall be comforted. And they who come to the Table of the Lord weeping, are most likely to return from thence rejoycing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And when you are wrought to this humiliation for, and hatred of sin, you will easily be brought to the next part of your work, which is, <hi>stedfastly to resolve by the grace of God, never more to give willing entertainment to the same, but to be entirely devoted to God by Jesus Christ, to love, please, and serve him all your days.</hi> I have told you how at the Lords Supper you renew your Covenant, to perform those duties which you were engaged to, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Baptized into the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Renouncing carnall self, you professe to place your happinesse in the love of God, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to regard or please your selves, than is consistent with his pleasure; Renouncing the world, your own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, righteousnesse and worthinesse, and all ways to to happinesse, which are set up against Christ, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to take him alone for your Redeemer, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign up your selves to him, that he may bring you to the fruition of God; and therefore Renouncing the Devill, who would draw you from God and Christ, to gratifie your lusts with earthly things, you professe your reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to be led by the Holy Spirit of God, in those ways that lead to his everlasting kingdome. You who are truly willing to all this, (for to such I speak) I would have you in the most serious manner, to professe the same before God, and especially in the prayers that you make, in preparation for the Sacrament. Bind your selves over to him by the strictest vow, that he shall be your God, and you will be his people.

nothing on earth in comparison of him, that if he will but vouchsafe you his saving love in Jesus Christ, you shall be indifferent to all things here below, as knowing that in his favour alone you are abundantly provided for. Acknowledge his right to govern you and dispose of you, being your Maker and Preserver, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wise and good; and engage to take him for your Soveraign and Lord, to render a sincere, unlimited o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his commands, and quietly to submit to his dispensations. Professe to him, that you relinquish all right to your selves, and give up all into his hands, to do with you what he pleaseth; consecrating all to his glory, whatever he doth or shall afford you, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, through his assistance, so to improve and employ it. Promise to him, that neither your own will, nor the will of any mortall man, shall be obey'd in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his. And bethink your selves of those sins, whereof you have been more especially guilty, in thought, word, or deed; and of the duties you have omitted: and engage your selves particularly against those sins, and to the performance of those duties. And then Remember under what notion you enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, and what kind of creatures you are, even poor lost sinners, loaded with much guilt, which you could never, by any satisfaction of your own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, take off from your selves; and also exceeding weak, so that you cannot by your own strength give that obedience to God which he requires, nor vanquish the difficulties which you will meet with; wherefore it is of absolute necessity that you accept of Jesus Christ, as your <hi>Deliverer</hi> and your <hi>Strength: for he onely who hath the Son, hath the Father also.</hi> Professe then before God, your unfeigned willingnesse to close with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, to all those ends for which he offers himself to the world. Acknowledge to him, that you neither expect

mercy for any merit of your own, nor set upon duty in your own might, nor look for acceptance of any service for its own worth, but that you humbly depend upon Christ the Mediatour for all that you stand in need of: Acknowledge his right to rule over and in you, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bought you out of slavery with his own most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, to whose mild and gracious government you will therefore submit your selves. Professe your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse and earnest desire, to have your hearts pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and sanctified by his Holy Spirit, and your lives thereby directed according to the precepts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. Thus professe your acceptance of Christ, and submission to the Spirit, that you may be brought into the favour of God, and be enabled to please and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him by your holy conversation: for all tends to this, even to make you holy in heart and life.

Let this be remembred I beseech you, whatever you forget, That <hi>hereby you do most straitly engage your selves to live a Righteous, Sober, and Godly life, from this very day, and to the end of your days.</hi> This some give as the reason, why the Name <hi>Sacrament</hi> is put upon Baptisme and the Lords Supper, because they are of a like nature with that Oath, which Souldiers were wont to take, to be obedient to their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and rather to die than to forsake their Colours, which military Oath was called a Sacrament; and thus both by Baptisme and the Lords Supper are we conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the service of God. A very Heathen ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he gave an account of the practice of the Christians, said of them, that they did sometimes in their assemblies, by eating and drinking together, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage one another to abstain from, theft, murder, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and all kind of wickednesse; so right a notion he had of the design of this duty. Imagine then you heard Christ saying, <hi>All that will hearken to me, and become such as I would have them, both in their hearts and lives, let them come and take this Sacrament, as a witnesse of their resolutions to cleave to me.</hi> And let the voice of your souls in answer be, <hi>Lord, I am willing to hearken to thee, to take thee for my Redeemer and Lord, and it is my unfeigned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be holy as thou would'st have me, and it is my resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from this time forward, by the help of thy Spirit, to yield a sincere obedience to all thy commands, and not allow my self in any known sin whilst life shall last, and in witnesse hereof I take this holy Sacrament which thou hast call'd me to.</hi> And thus thou do'st plight thy troth to Jesus Christ, by partaking of these consecrated Elements, as friends are wont to break a piece of silver betwixt them, to bind each other the faster to the promises they make; or as

the Man and Woman expresse their consent to a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, by their use of the Ring. And hereby thou do'st in effect professe, that thou expectest salvation by Christ upon no other terms, than as thou shalt be found faithfull in making and keeping this Covenant with him. Thou maist easily perceive this is no trifling mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore good reason there is, I should advise thee to be serious and deliberate in it, least by thy hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie thou should'st even bind over thy self to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: for if thy heart will not consent to such a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as I have described, think not I go about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade thee to dissemble with God. But yet remember, there is nothing in all this, that may afford any ground of hesitation or doubting, whether thou should'st do it or not, unlesse thou art in a doubt, whether thou hadst best be sav'd or damn'd: for except thy heart be brought to such a subjection to, and closure with Christ, it's impossible thou should'st ever be sav'd by him. This Wedding-garment of Faith and Obedience, which I would have thee put on, is as necessary for thy being received into Heaven, as for thy being a welcome guest at this Table. And by the way, consider how you have endangered your souls, you who have from time to time received Sacraments, and never thought of any such engagement as this, which yet the very action it self lays upon you, nor ever took care to be faithfull thereto. In what a daring manner have you laid your selves open to vengeance? And how great is that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, which hath hitherto born with you? even whilst you have been wilfully guilty of most horrid perjury. I mention not this to drive you to despair, no, there is yet hope of mercy concerning this thing, if now at length you are but sensible of your miscarriage, and will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reform it for the future.</p>
               <p>Whoever you are, that do now from your very

from all accusations, and set with the sheep on his right hand, and with that little Flock be received into the Kingdome, which he hath promised to all that love him. And since you are as yet in the body, which stands in need of outward comforts and supplies, and are in a World where you have relations, friends and affairs wherein you are concern'd, you have promises touching these also; and may therefore confidently beg your heavenly Father, who knows what you need, to take care of you and yours, and furnish you with what he sees convenient for you; to direct you in all difficulties, and by his providence so to order all your affairs as may tend most to his glory and your good. Ask these things of God, and what ever you perceive necessary, and doubt not but they shall be given into you more abundantly than you can ask or think, and look upon them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to you by the Sacrament. But remember al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, that it is for Christs sake that these mercies are confer'd upon you, so that you are to acknowledge your selves unworthy of the least of them, and confesse if you had your own desert, you should be stript of all comforts, and be laid under the greatest miseries. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse therefore that all you hope for, is on the account of Jesus Christ, who hath purchast all things needfull for the happinesse of his people, after a forfeiture was made of all by the fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> through him are these good things promised, and these promises fulfilled. In the new Covenant founded in his blood, they all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company his Person; and are ascertained to those that cordially receive him, as the Wife by taking a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to her Husband, is made partaker of his estate and honours. So that having Christ to be yours, all that is in Heaven or Earth to do you good is yours also, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Covenant which shall never fail: faithfull is he that hath promised, <hi>and will do it.</hi>

Here then you see is work for faith, if you would receive the comfort which this Ordinance holds forth. And more particularly I shall tell you in two words, what it is <hi>for</hi> principally, and in what manner you are here to exercise faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Look upon the Sacrament as sealing to you, a full and free pardon of all the sins you stand guilty of, whether by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or practice,</hi> so that none of them shall be laid to your charge, so as to condemn you at judgment. And for your clearer proceeding herein, you are to apprehend the Sacrament as joyn'd to the promise of pardon in the Gospel, and so to look upon it as a <hi>Seal</hi> annext to a <hi>Writing,</hi> that promiseth mercie to Rebels that submit themselves: And if a King should send his Officers with many such <hi>Writings,</hi> to a Companie of Men that were risen up in Arms against him, and the Officer should tell them, <hi>Sirs, here's a gracious message sent you from the King; here are Papers under his own hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he assures a Pardon to such of you that will now come in, and here's also his own Seal put to them for your greater assurance, all which for your security, i'le put into your hand presently, if you submit your selves</hi>; They who upon this come in, and take these Papers, have a pardon thereby given them, which they may boldly produce, if afterward they should be accused. Even thus are you to conceive God's Embassadour, saying to you, <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:107818:139"/>
his Instrument of pardon; and here I stand by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to give out the same.</hi> You now who find your selves willing thus to receive Christ, are to take this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament as an assurance that this promise shall be made good to you; and so look upon it, and with this quiet your conscience when it is unjustly clamorous, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence Satan when he haunts you with temptations to despair: Then say within thy self, [Here's the word of God assuring forgivenesse to all that take Christ for their Lord and Saviour, which by his grace I finde my self inclined and enabled to do, and he hath bound this word with his oath, and to both he hath added his Sacraments as Seals, and shall this three-fold cord be broken? what should give me satisfaction, if this do not? wherefore, be gone Satan, shall I not rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thou art a liar, who tellest me, repent and believe, and do all that I can, my sins are so great they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgiven, than once suspect that the most true God, will ever revoke that which he hath said and sworn and sealed to?] And at the great Judgment Day of Christ will own his <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi>; and then solemnly acquit thee, whom he now pardons by his Gospel. Safely then maist thou triumph with the Apostle, <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It's God that justifieth: Who is he that condemneth? It's Christ that died, &amp;c.</hi> And this Christ with his whole purchase is made over to thee, oh believing soul. Even by this Sacrament is his blood as effectually made thine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wash off all the guilt that cleaves to thee, as if thou hadst been bath'd in his warm blood to that purpose, yea much more effectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:107818:140"/>
Here in like manner you are to look upon the Gospel, as a <hi>Deed of Gift,</hi> whereby, through Christ, an <hi>Inheritance</hi> in the Heavens is setled upon you, to which <hi>Deed</hi> also the Sacrament doth <hi>Seal.</hi> Even as an House is made over by the delivery of a Key, and Land by a <hi>Turf,</hi> so there is a kinde of conveyance of Heaven it self made to you, by the delivery of the Sacramental Bread and Wine into your hands. And when you receive them, imagine you heard God saying to you, <hi>Here, poor soul, take this in earnest of that eternal life, which I have prepared for, and will bestow upon thee.</hi> And if the heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be thus assured to you, on condition of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the love of God, you need not question, but all things needfull for your passage thither, are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in comprehended. If you shall have glory given you, then be sure you shall have that grace which may fit you for, and bring you to it, whereof I shall speak par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly under the next head. And if you are thus richly provided for, as to your souls, do you think your bodies shall be neglected? No, never fear it; whatever shall be found really good for you, shall be vouchsaft. What shall you have Christ and his spirit, grace and glory? And do you question whether you shall have food and raiment? Will the Father make his Son Heir of all when he comes to age, and will he not afford him a maintenance till then? only refer all your concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to God, to deal with you as he shall think fit, and question not but hee'l dispose of all to your content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if you be reasonable.

               <p>You may see then, I hope, by this time, that this is no common Bread and Wine which is appointed for so great purposes. If a <hi>tuig</hi> was given into your hands, whereby some great estate was conveyed to you, you would value it sure above a common stick. Wherefore if you would not be lamentably wanting to your selves, and Enemies to your own comforts, I beseech you, all you that love the Lord Jesus, know your own priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and fix these things firmly on your mindes; and let not the greatnesse of them hinder your belief, since they are as sure as great; but see that you apprehend a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in all that is done at this holy Table.

Wherefore, beg of God to clear up these things to your apprehensions, to remove doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to strengthen your faith, and to joyn the inward seal of his spirit, to the outward administration of his Ordinance. And do you take the boldnesse, though with the greatest humility, to professe to God, that you take this Sacrament as an <hi>earnest</hi> of all those mercies which you hope for from his bounty, as hereby you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

There being thus a sacred Covenant transacted betwixt God and your souls, see only that you be not treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and Heaven and Earth shall sooner fail, than God will depart from one tittle, of all that he hath said.

As if a King should call some of his poor subjects, to give them great pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions in another Country which he had conquered, and should also furnish them with store of money and provisions for the way, even thus bounteously wil God deal with you, oh Believers. Hee'l put strength into your feet, and revive your fainting spirits, that you may hold on in your way; you <hi>that wait upon the Lord,</hi> though you have no power or might in your selves, yet <hi>shall renew your strength, and run, and not be weary, and walk, and not faint,</hi> till you come to your journies end.</p>
               <p>By faith in Christ we are engrafted into him, as a branch into the Vine, and are related as a Member to the Head, so that he is become the root of our life, and from him shall sap and nourishment be communicated to our needy souls. He is the dispenser and fountain of Grace, and his Ordinances are as Conduit-pipes, and conveyances of the same. And of this nature is the Lords Supper. Here Believers are made to <hi>drink into the Spirit.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. Which words have a plain reference to this Sacrament, Baptisme being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at the beginning of the verse. Come hither

then, oh yee thirstie souls, and be refresht with the waters of life that shall flow in upon you in abundance. Open your mouths wide, and they shall be filled. Be not straitned in your selves: for the bowels of Christ are not straitned towards you. Bring hither capacious enlarged hearts, and you shall carry away accordingly. The anointing of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Spirit, which is shed abroad upon you, is like the Widdows Oyl. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 4.6. It will not stay running whilst there is room to receive it. Oh why is it then that we are so empty? The fault is not in Christ, we must needs acknowledge: But let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether we have not stuft our hearts with other things, that leave little or no room for grace to be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in there. Are we not fill'd with the love of earthly things? Is not our delight most of all in profits and pleasures? And our desires eagerly carried out after them? Do not Creature-comforts so possess and fill us, that they even thrust forth the Holy Spirit from his habitation? Do we not grieve him by our carnal joys and cause him to with-draw from us? Oh! for shame let it be no longer thus with us. Alas! how little can these narrow hearts of ours contain of the fullness of God, though they were widened to their utmost present capacity? And shall we pinch and straiten them yet more, by entertaining every trifle there? This is that room which the King of Heaven would have entire to himself, and shall every common guest, every Beggar be lodged there? Is it fit that Money-changers and Merchants should fill the house of God? That it should be a thorow-fare for every Vessel, every common and unclean thing? Oh let your hearts then be consecrated as Temples for the Holy-Ghost, not Dens of such Thieves as rob God of his due, and draw away those desires and affections which he claims as his own. And now let the gates of these Temples flie open, that the


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:107818:142"/>
King of Glory may come in. Now in an especiall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner let your hearts be emptied of all trash, that they may be fill'd with the good things which are here distributed. If you were set to an heap of Gold, and bidden to carry away as much as you could grasp, you would keep no dirt, nor stones in your hand, that would make them hold so much the lesse. Loosen your selves then from the inordinate love or thought of any created good, your Houses or Lands, your pleasures or employments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your minds as much as possible from all temporall concernments, with which whilst you are taken up, the edge of your desire after heavenly things is extreamly abated. And if you come not hither with great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you are like to be little the better. If you have no higher designs, but with a little seeming Devotion to eat Bread and drink Wine, then Bread and Wine are the best things that you are like to meet with: For is it probable you should find that which you never look after? But if thou comest hither with an holy greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse after greater measures of grace, thirsting for the living God, as the Hart pants after the water-brooks, and as the parched ground gapes for the refreshing showers, then fear it not, thy desires shall be gratified. Thou canst not please God better, than by looking for the greatest and best things from him, which bring most glory to himself, and do most good to thy soul. Beg earnestly then, that by the power of his Spirit accompanying this Ordinance, thou maist partake yet more of a new and divine nature; that thou maist find strength and vigour diffused through thy whole man; and maist now receive some communications of that light and life, which Christ came into the world that his people might have, and that they might have it more abundantly; now pray that, his Death and Resurrection may have their power and efficacy upon thee, that virtue may issue forth from him


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:107818:143"/>
for thy healing. Beg, that by this food thy lusts may be poisoned and destroy'd, and every grace strengthned and encreast. And be particular in thy desires. [Oh that something may be done this day against my pride and passion, my worldlinesse and sensuality, my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfull fears and discontents. Oh that I may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that listlesnesse, dulnesse and distractions, wherewith I am haunted in holy duties. Oh that I may find my heart hereby drawn nearer to God, and carried out with more unweariednesse and cheerfulnesse in his service; that I may be better enabled for a conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous discharge of my duty, in every place and relation that I do stand in, and in the whole course of my life. Blessed God, thou who knowest the state of my soul, give in to me, I beseech thee, what thou seest I need most. I have an hard heart, Lord soften it; a dead heart, Lord enliven it; I am much in the dark, Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me. Make me more humble, holy and heavenly; Oh take this sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for coming in upon my soul, and bestowing more of thy self upon me, that I may become more like to thee. These, oh God, are the mercies thou hast promised to thy people, and bidden them to ask; these thou art wont to convey by thine ordinances; for these things therefore do I wait upon thee this day, with no lower aims do I come to thy Table; with such precious things is the Lord Jesus wont to feast his guests, and of his infinite fulnesse it is, that I hope to participate; through him it is I hope to be strengthned with might in my inner man, even to be made strong by the Grace that is in Christ Jesus, Oh, will the Head let a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber perish? Shall a branch wither for want of succour and juyce? Blessed Saviour, thou who wast so willing to shed thy blood for us, art thou not as willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow the fruits of it upon us? Art thou not still as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:107818:143"/>
and tender as ever thou wast? Thou who didst once so readily heal diseases, and cure all that came to thee, hast thou not as much mercy to souls as to bodies? Lord, I believe thou art as able and ready to help as ever? <hi>If thou wilt thou canst make me clean,</hi> and it is my hope that thou wilt: Outward means without thee cannot do it, yet here thou hast bid us attend, and thus I do, waiting for the descent of thy Holy Spirit. Oh grant the requests of thy poor creature; Say to me, <hi>Be it unto thee even as thou wilt</hi>: yea, even as thou wilt, oh Lord, let it be unto me, who art ever readily and strongly inclined to do thy people good.] Thus stirre up your selves, and actuate Faith in such holy brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things as these, and be assured, such additions of Grace as you are fitted for, and God in his infinite wisdome sees meet at present to deal out, shall be conferr'd upon you; and being refresht and strengthned with this ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, you may cheerfully walk on your way to glory.</p>
               <p n="7">7. From all that hath been said of the greatnesse of the mercies here commemorated, bestow'd and sealed to, it will appear most reasonable and just, <hi>that the hearts of all Gods faithfull servants should here be raised to the greatest height of divine love, thankfulnesse, and joy.</hi> I put these together, because, though in the notion they are different, yet in the workings of the soul they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally go together. That same goodnesse which works love and thankfulnesse, causeth joy too, as it's begun to be enjoy'd, or strongly hop'd for. And this is a frame most proper to a Communicant, all his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being much in order to it: Therefore should he get sensible of his misery, and humbled for his sin, that he may have the more affectionate thankfull sense of the mercy that pitied and pardoned him. Wherefore labour much with your selves, even beforehand, to rise up to this ingenuous and pleasant temper, which will


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:107818:144"/>
prove so acceptable both to God and your selves. Dwell intently upon that amazing mercy, which God hath revealed to mankind in Jesus Christ, which thing the <hi>Angels themselves desire to look into</hi>: Ponder well the severall heightning circumstances thereof; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, sinfulnesse and misery of man, the Majesty of God, the dignity of Christ, the greatnesse of his conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension and sufferings, the fulnesse and freenesse of his purchase and offers. Study all his dealings with your selves in particular, whereby he hath accomplisht in you the designs of his love; and continue these musings, till you feel a fire of love and joy kindled within you. Let not Satan so farre have his will of you, as to cast you into these dejections, and groundlesse perplexities, which will rob God of his praise, and you of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Let him not be able to perswade you that God is cruell and unmercifull, and hardly reconciled to return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinners: Have you not the strongest, and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable demonstration at hand, to confute him? would you desire, or can you have a greater evidence of the graciousness of his nature, than that very mercy which you are going to remember? even his giving his only Son to die for us, whilst we were yet <hi>ungodly</hi> and <hi>enemies.</hi> And did he of his own free grace, without our asking, and against our deserving, provide a Saviour for us, and is he yet unwilling to save us? did he find out a means for our reconciliation to himself, and is he now backward to be reconciled? Does he importune us to take that, which he is unwilling to give us? Be not, I beseech you, of such an easie belief of the Devil's grosse fallacies, and so hardly drawn to believe what God hath not onely said, but done, so much to make it past all doubting. See the Apostle arguing much after the same manner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Oh let your hearts then be fill'd with admiration of that love, which God hath herein


<pb n="273" facs="tcp:107818:144"/>
exprest to men, the wondrous greatnesse whereof is such, that it almost surpasseth our Faith, and doth farre surpasse our full comprehension. That there should be a way for the recovery of self-destroying sinners, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by him whom they had offended, and brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by the death of his own Son, that they might be raised to the highest happinesse, even an eternity of the most ravishing joys, in nearest communion with the Divine Majesty, and all this to be had for a cordiall thankfull acceptance: <hi>This is the Lords doing,</hi> and well may it <hi>be marvellous in our eyes; Great things hath the Lord done for us, whereof let our souls be glad.</hi> If an host of Angels came from heaven to proclaim these good tidings of great joy to all people, shall not the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Christians eccho back their <hi>Glory be to God in the highest,</hi> who hath sent <hi>on earth peace,</hi> and shewn such <hi>good will to men? Oh give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, and his mercy endureth for ever, Let the Redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy. Oh do you praise the Lord for his goodnesse, and for his wonderfull works to the children of men; who hath shewn mercy to such as sate in darknesse, and in the shadow of death, and hath broken the gates of brasse, and cut the barres of iron in sunder; and hath sent his word and healed you, and delivered you from destruction. Oh do you sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoycing.</hi> Psal. 107. Call upon your souls with the Psalmist in another place, <hi>Blesse the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me blesse his holy name; Blesse the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefits, who fogiveth thine iniquities, and healeth all thy diseases; who redeems thy life from destruction, and who crowns thee with loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and tender mercies,</hi> Psal. 103. at the beginning. Oh think what a deplorable condition we had been in, if God had left us in the hands of Satan, to whom we had


<pb n="274" facs="tcp:107818:145"/>
enslaved our selves, and had never lookt after us more. Oh what a dungeon had this world then been! where we should have lived in darknesse and fetters, in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and torments, and all as but an inlet and passage to miseries infinitely worse, and altogether unavoidable. But oh blessed, and for ever praised be his Name, who hath visited the earth with his goodnesse, and caused the rejoycing light to shine in dark and disconsolate places; and hath proclaimed liberty to the captive, and shewn a strong hold, to which he hath called the <hi>Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is that blood which by the Wine in the Sacrament is represented to you, yea, which is thereby put into your hands, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you to drink in remembrance of that which was once shed for you. And shall not the hearts-blood of your dearest Lord warm and revive your souls, enflame and advance your love? Will you not now begin that <hi>new song</hi> of the heavenly Chore, <hi>ascribing blessing, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, glory and power to him that sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever, who by his blood redeemed us, and makes us kings and priests unto God,</hi> Rev. 5. This is that blood to which you owe all that you have or hope for; This quencht those flames, which else had fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you for ever; This satisfied that justice, which else had laid hold on you for your disobedience; This pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast an inheritance, which silver and gold could not buy; This <hi>purgeth the conscience from dead works,</hi> and makes the soul fruitfull unto God; This pacifies the Conscience, and appeaseth the disturbances that sense of guilt is apt to raise; By this <hi>blood of the Lamb,</hi> it is, <hi>that the Saints</hi> in all their conflicts <hi>do overcome.</hi> And can you withhold the most affectionate hearty thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for this precious all-healing blood? Methinks we


<pb n="275" facs="tcp:107818:145"/>
should even be pained in our selves, as not knowing how to give vent enough to our affections, especially when our bleeding Lord is set before us. Oh let him wholly possesse your thoughts, and do you view that transcendent love which he manifested in his whole course, but chiefly in the close of it, that all may beget in you some answerable returns of love. Read, as you have leisure, those heavenly discourses which were his Farewell Sermons to his Disciples, and his last prayer for them, which you may find in the 14, 15, 16, 17. Chapters of <hi>John,</hi> and see there how love breathes in every line. Follow him to the Garden, and there hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his groans, and behold his bloody sweat, which proclaims him to be <hi>sick of love,</hi> of a love that would not be quencht by those crimson streams. No, still he goes on, and go thou after him with the Women that followed him to his Crosse; and weep not, if thou canst forbear, whilst there thou seest him <hi>die for love</hi>; even for love of thee, poor soul, who do'st sincerely love him. Art thou not astonisht at the thoughts of it? What could the Lord Jesus see in such miserable worms as we, that should incline him to undergo all this on our behalf? Nay, there's the wonder, he saw nothing, and therefore he underwent it. Nothing did I say? yes, he saw our guilt and defilement; for which he might have justly loathed us: But he seeing all this our misery, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moved to a compassion for us; Such a compassion as never dwelt in a mortall's breast, that he should pity those who pittied not themselves, and die to recover those who had even murdred themselves, yea, that he should die to make them happy, whose sins were the cause of his Death, and even merit mercy for such as had no mercy on him, and give <hi>life</hi> to them who took <hi>his</hi> away. All this was voluntarily done by the Son of God, who became Man, on purpose that he might die,


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:107818:146"/>
and do all this for the sons of men. Let Plays and Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be hist off the Stage, let Romantick follies be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into obscurity: for here is that which alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the name of <hi>Love</hi>; here's such Truth, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our belief; such worth and weight, as calls for our regard; and such stupendious greatnesse, as may raise our wonder. Here behold the power of love in the fairest display of it, that ever was made to the world, since its foundations were first laid, beyond which imagination it self cannot ascend, nay, which falls vastly short of it; how vastly short then doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression fall? but yet oh that we could feel as much as that little which we speak! Was it ever before known, that the Shepherd should lay down his life for his sheep? not for innocent sheep, but to reduce wilfull straglers to his Fold; that he who was Lord of all, should die for his Subjects? not for obedient Subjects, but for Rebels appointed to the slaughter.

It was the minde of Christ, that his Resurrection, rather than his birth or death, should consecrate a weekly thanksgiving, to be observed by the Churh in all ages, which should be call'd the Lords own day, and be spent in his praise and service. This being the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his labours, his finall victory over death, and the grave and all Enemies that did assault his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the memorial whereof must therefore needs be most rejoycing to his servants: And as his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be remembred without his birth and death, which must of necessity precede it, no more can his death be here rightly remembred, without we also bear in mind his Resurrection and Ascension to Glory. Can we remember what he was, and not think what he is? Sad meetings had we made indeed, if our Lord had been held under the power of death, if such a thing may be imagined. All the World then might well be in the disconsolate posture of the two Disciples, that were tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing to <hi>Emaus,</hi> crying out <hi>We trusted this had been, He who should have redeemed Israel.</hi> Luk. 24.21. Then would our <hi>faith be vain, we should be yet in our sins.</hi> But we may now comfort our selves, and use the Apostles gradation, <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It's Christ that died, yea rather that's risen again, and is even at the right hand of God.</hi> And now with joy let this Resurrection and Glory be remembred as being the fore-runner of yours. When in your thoughts you have descended as low as his Grave, and there stand weeping to think how your sins have slain him, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine you heard some Angel bespeaking you, in almost the same language that he did the Women at his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,

That full view of our blessed Lord will for ever cure us of all coldnesse and unbelief, and ravish us into one eternall, affectionate admiration of divine love. If that joy which arose from faith and love, whilst he was not seen, was <hi>unspeakable and full of glory,</hi> how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable, how transcendently glorious must that be which shall arise from his immediate sight: If it be such a precious priviledge to have a right to Heaven here solemnly given us, what will it be to enter upon actual possession? Oh then, Christians, whilst you are remembring Christ at his Table, let it rejoyce your hearts to consider, that he is remembring you at his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right hand, and thither will shortly exalt you. All you whom the King of Glory now espouseth to himself as it were by Proxie, as Princes take Wives by their Embassadours, remember that the day is hastening, when your marriage shall be more publickly and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly solemnized: when all you blessed ones shall be call'd to the great Marriage-Supper of the Lamb.

                  <hi>Yet a very little while, and he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry:</hi> And do you now get your souls mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as high as you can climbe, by all the means that are afforded you, and stand ever wishly looking, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently preparing for his appeearance; and never flack your watch, nor let your expectations cool, till either you see him comming in the clouds, or shall be taken up beyond them.</p>
               <p>With some such Meditations as these, which I have suggested to you under each Head, let your thoughts be taken up whilst you are emploied in this duty, as you shall find your selves most inclined, and as Gods Spirit shall direct you: for you need not confine your self as to the method and form, but rather let your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections have their free course. Onely see that you watch narrowly over your hearts through the whole work, that deadnesse and distractions may not possesse you. Keep up a strong sense of God's presence with you, and often lift up your hearts to him for life and quickning. And let all the powers of your souls be summoned up, and engaged in this action, with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible vigour and closenesse. Let your minds be kept cleer from sadning and from impertinent thoughts, that you may <hi>attend upon the Lord without distraction,</hi> and be more capable of those sweet foretasts of his goodnesse, which may be as a certain pledge of your everlasting enjoyment of all that he hath in store for his people.</p>

                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:107818:150"/>And moreover, let your hearts be let out, with a sincere and strong affection, toward all your Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members of that body, whereof Christ is the Head. A pleasant sight it will be to your Master who is in heaven, to look down upon you his Disciples, and see you here feasting together in mutuall love and delight, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of all that love which he hath shewn to you, and in the joyfull expectation of what farther he hath promised. And whilst your love is stirred up to Christ himself, it cannot chuse but be imparted to his friends that are in sight; such who sincerely love him, &amp; on whom he hath set his heart, and hath shed on them his Spirit, whereby they are made like to him, and therefore must needs be lovely in your eyes to whom <hi>Christ is precious</hi>; as being also by this same Spirit made like to your selves; and when, in your joyning with them in this sacred acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you remember that these shall be your everlasting companions in the joy of your Lord, and shall there joyn with you in sounding forth his praises, this will farther engage you to them, as being heirs together of the grace of God, and will work in you the beginnings of that love which will hereafter be perfect and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. Whilst your love is built upon such right and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick principles as these, being placed upon a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an as a Christian, you hold a Communion in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with all true Christians throughout the world; though your affections will be most sensibly enlarged to those that you know, and with whom you hold a locall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the worship of God. And your joint assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at this Table is a badge of your mutuall love, and an engagement to the firm continuance of it. Here are you <hi>made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> by which you were <hi>Baptized into one body,</hi> according to that Text I named, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. This <hi>Sacrament</hi> is, if I may so call it, an <hi>Holy Philtre,</hi> whereby Believers are united in more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

love to their common Head, and to one another. The Blood of Christ is the onely cement and soder of souls. And this is that Christian love which they are taught of God, to which they are inclined by their new nature, and which will easily be brought into exercise, where the grace is first wrought in the heart; wherefore it's needlesse to stay longer hereon, having also spoke somewhat largely to it before. Onely one thing let me suggest before I conclude this, namely, that you take care to give a practicall demonstration of this love, by <hi>contributing, according to your abilities, to the necessities of the poor members of Christ.</hi> This is a sacrifice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God is well pleased; a work never out of season, but now most seasonable; being an evidence not onely of your compassion to the poor, but of the stedfastnesse of your belief in Christ and his promises, and of your thankfulnesse for his bounty; therefore you find both these mentioned together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15, 16. As <hi>we must offer thanks, so we must not forget to do good and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi> To quicken you to this charity, both now and any other time, when fit objects are presented; Let me one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire you to imagine to your selves, that the Lord Jesus, who was willing to part with his blood for you, and thinks not an infinite glory too great to give you upon most easie terms, that even he comes to you in one of his necessitous members, to see what you can find in your hearts to bestow upon him; If you that have Estates think he deserves nothing, let him have nothing; if he deserve but a little, give him but a little; if your lusts have more right to your riches than he, then let your lusts have them rather than he; Let Christ in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers starve, whilst pride and luxury are maintained, if you think this be just. If you can improve your Estates better some other way, take what you think the most gainfull course. For remember, Christ himself needs


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:107818:151"/>
not anything you have or can do, onely he'll try the kindnesse of your hearts. His is the earth and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof, and even his poor servants can he suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently provide for without you. Wherefore if you give notwillingly and cheerfully, you may keep your money to your self, for any good that an extorted charity is like to do you. But remember also, you will be sure to lose and leave all that, which God hath not, one way or other; but by giving it to him you send it before you, and when all things here below fail, you shall enjoy it with infinite advantage in the everlasting habitations. And let this suffice by way of Direction for your prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to, and carriage in Receiving. A few words for your behaviour afterwards, and I shall come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>

               <p n="1">1. WHen you come home, get alone, and blesse God for the liberty and opportunity of a Sacrament, which he hath afforded you, and for all the priviledges that are thereby conferr'd upon you. And let your souls chew the Cud, and retain the savour of those pleasant things you have been entertained with; keep them still lifted up, and exceedingly gladded, in the sence of that love which you have this day been ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating and tasting, in the belief of that pardon which you have received, in the hopes of that grace and glory which have been assured to you. Meditations of heaven and the exercise of Thankfulnesse, are now ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper works. Consider also what you have done, what an obligation you have laid upon your self, how


<pb n="287" facs="tcp:107818:151"/>
you are no longer your own Man, having made a resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of your self to God by Jesus Christ: And beg the assistance of his Holy Spirit, to enable you to sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse and perseverance in this holy Covenant whilst life shall last; and beseech him, that the Ordinance you have been made partaker of, may become effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to your souls to all those ends that it was designed for, and which are attainable by it. <hi>Think it not enough to read over these things, I entreat thee, but do accordingly, and now betake thy self to Consideration and Prayer to those ends I have exprest.</hi> Review moreover, what your mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages have been, and humbly beg of God to forgive either want of due preparation, or coldnesse and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; that your hearts have not been affected suitably to the importance and excellency of the duty, and the Majesty of him with whom you have herein had to do. And be heartily thankfull for any measure of life and affection, any raisednesse and comfort that God hath been pleased to vouchsafe you. And here by the way, let me caution all humble Christians, to beware of a mistake to which they are too prone: to wit, To judge of their profiting in this or other duties, by their present feeling, and so to think they get no good, except their souls are as it were lift up and ravisht with sensible joys; and these onely they take for evidences of Gods acceptance, and the having of communion with him. But by this means you will often plunge your selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to needlesse sorrows, and load your selves with unjust censures; and which is worse, you will hereby become lesse thankfull to God, as thinking you have received little advantage, because you found not those delights you expected; and will be in danger of becoming wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the work, and ready to throw it off, as thinking it unprofitable. Wherefore to avoid these ill consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the mistake that begets them, consider well,


<pb n="288" facs="tcp:107818:152"/>
                  <hi>That it is the uprightnesse and sincerity of your hearts in the performance of your duty, which may administer most ground of comfort to you when you reflect upon it:</hi> for be assured, if you have this ornament, you were really acceptable to him that lookt down upon you, though this acceptance might not be testified with the giving in of any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary joy. Let it not then trouble you, as if God was not well pleased with you, because your affections were not raised up to an higher pitch, since he doth not look so much at fits of passion, as at the steady bent, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the soul. Nor think because you mist of great joys, that you had no favour from, nor communion with God: for consider again, <hi>That the truest communion with God, is to enjoy the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mmunications of his grace to your souls, whereby you are made conformable to him:</hi> and you may enjoy these saving influences of the Spirit, when you cannot feel his more abundant consolations. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the fruit of this Ordinance is not so much to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned at present, as in your after-conversation. For the great benefit you are to expect, being to receive farther measures of Grace from the Holy Spirit accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying these means, it cannot be well known what Grace you have received, till you come to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of it; when temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ations shall assault you. And, to allude to the Apostles words in another case, Though this Ordinance <hi>may not at present be joyous, yet it may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward yield the peaceable fruits of righteousnesse</hi> to those that are conversant therein. And lastly, If you are but sincere, as I said, in your covenanting with God, it is your duty to believe, that you have this day received from him, a seal to the promise of pardon and eternall life, and in this belief may you take much rationall and solid comfort, which otherwise you are not like to find: And this is the ordinary way whereby the Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys comfort to the Soul; first working in you a belief,


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:107818:152"/>
that the promises of God are in themselves most true, &amp; enlightning you to the knowledge of your own souls, and then enabling you to apply these promises to your selves, as being such to whom they belong. Thus the Apostle tells us, their rejoycing was from the testimony their Conscience gave of their simplicity &amp; godly sincerity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. Wherefore you are not so much to expect any extraordinary immediate assurance from the Spirit, that you are the Lords; But see to get good grounds for your faith, and so to have your hearts fill'd with <hi>peace and joy in believing.</hi> Yet do not misinterpret what I have said, thence to indulge your selves in any sloth or dulness, or to content your selves with the bare doing of the work, without heeding the frame of your heart therein; no, but take as much pains as you can, to raise them to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test sensiblenesse &amp; affection; and if you do so, you may reasonably expect to find much sweetness and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the work it self: but my meaning in this caution is, that you should not look so much at the feeling of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary comforts, as at the integrity of your hearts in vowing your selves to God, and the continuing sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse of your resolutions to be true to these vows.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that's the next thing I would exhort you to, <hi>even to disc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver this inward truth and sincerity, by your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holy and exact walking</hi>; This is that which must crown all the rest. I may say to you as <hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> Deut. 26.16, 17. <hi>You have this day avouched the Lord to be your God, to walk in his ways, and keep his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes; And the Lord hath avouched you to be his peculiar people</hi>; And you have promised to take Christ for your Husband and Lord, to live in love and obedience to him, as you hope to be saved by him. One thing now remains, <hi>that you go and do likewise.</hi> Say with the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <hi>I have sworn, and will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgements,</hi> Psal. 119.106. Now you have


<pb n="290" facs="tcp:107818:153"/>
been remembring him <hi>that suffered in the flesh, arm your selves with this mind, no longer to live the rest of your time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.1, 2, 3. Let it not happen to you according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>The Dog is turned to his own vomit again, and the Sow that was washt to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> If God have spoke peace to your souls, turn not you again to folly. Call to mind particularly what sins you confest and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to forsake, and do accordingly. You that have been guilty of drunkennesse or gluttony, fornication and wantonnesse, pride or covetousnesse, be so no more; you that have been wont to spend your time in idlenesse and vanity, in sinfull company or excessive recreations, spend it so no more; you that have been wont to give way to your exorbitant passions, and suffered them to break forth in unseemly actions and language, do so no longer. You that are Masters or Servants, Parents or Children, Husbands or Wives, consider well what particular duties your relations call for, and be faithfull in the performance of them. You that are Subjects obey them that are set over you in the Lord. Towards your neighbours, and all with whom you converse, be just and honest, loving and courteous, avoiding all backbiting, lying and slandering, all foolish and filthy speaking. Be compassionate and charitable to all that need your help in one sort or another. Be conscientious for the future in the more immediate service of God: Be frequent &amp; seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his worship, both in publick and private, alone and with your families. Beware of swearing and cursing, or of taking the holy Name of God or Christ in vain; make not mention of him in your common discourse without due reverence, &amp; that you are not like to have, if at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turn you are crying, oh God and oh Lord, as is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of careless people. Profane no more Lords-Days, as you may have formerly done, but improve them to

your souls good. Whatever talent you have, of wit, wealth, time or honour, employ it to his honour, who entrusted you therewith; In all things study to please God, and so commit your self and all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to his will, and quietly submit to all his dealings with you without murmuring or repining. To a sincere endeavour after all this, you have bound your selves by the Sacrament, where you have taken God to be your God, and have profest your selves his people. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I beseech you, beware of that dangerous, and yet too common mistake, <hi>To think this weighty action termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What would you think of that woman, that when she had promised a man to be his wife, and was solemnly married to him in the face of the Congregation, should think there was now nothing more required of her, but that she might go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she list, and live with whom she pleased? Even just such is your folly and grosse absurdity, who when you have been in the most solemn manner engaging your selves to God, and have taken the Sacrament upon it, that you will live in obedience to him, then think that you may go away and live as you list. Beware how you make such mistakes as these: for believe it, God's in earnest, whether you are or not: If you would not have him take you at your word, you had better never have made such fair promises. Since then the great design of this duty, is, to be an engagement to, and an help for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse

This is the principall thing which <hi>we</hi> are to do in order to the due improvement of Sacraments to our advantage, even to remember often, what a strict Covenant we thereby entred into, that by the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof we may be the more aw'd and restrain'd from doing any thing against it.

Especially make this use of it when you meet with temptations to any sin whatever, or when you begin to grow carelesse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse in your carriage. If old companions should set upon you and entice you, or if your own heart should incline you to any former sinfull courses, then say with your selves, [How can I do this and go back from the vow that I have made?

Think now what an horrible thing it would be to run into drunkenness, whoredome, or quarrelling the same day you have received it, and know your sin is little lesse hainous, though it be a Month or two, or twenty after it: for this breaks your oath as well as that. If the Wife be guilty of Adultery twenty years after her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, her crime is as great, as if it had been within a week after: for she had oblig'd her self to conjugall

fidelity, as long as she and her husband should live. And thus your Covenant with God is not for a Month, or Year only, but for your whole lives. If you should never but once have opportunity to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, this would ever after remain a forcible engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon you: but yet God in his wisdome and good providence hath ordered, that this duty should be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeated, that it might the more work upon, and affect our mindes, who are prone to be so forgetfull and dull. Remember then, the matter is now out of your hands; you have given away your selves to God, and cannot revoke this gift, since indeed you gave him nothing, but what was his own before. <hi>After these vows there is no inquiry to be made,</hi> whether they should be kept or not. Yet, this much i'le say to you, if you can finde a greater portion and surer friend than God, a better Master than Christ, better work than his service, better wages than life eternal, you may take your choice: for I would wish you to nothing for your hurt or losse, nor doth God you may be sure, that blessed Beeing, who wants nothing out of himself, nor envies his Creatures any thing that's truly good for them: but till you can thus better dispose of your selves, keep your first love, and if you will keep it till then, I shall never question your perseverance to the last.</p>
               <p>And as you are thus to improve this Ordinance to quicken you to, and help you in your duty, so may you make advantage of it for your comfort, by remembring how God stands engaged to you by that Covenant to which he hath here set his seal, and which he will be sure to perform to you that depart not from him. With this consideration repell all temptations to excessive doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and despair. When the remembrance of former sins is ready to overwhelm you, have recourse to your sealed pardon, and confidently take the comfort it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords

When you finde the remnants of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yet so strong within you, that you are afraid you shall never hold out, remember the Holy Ghost is in Covenant with you to assist you in your combat, and will bring you off Conquerour, if you throw not away your weapons: And let this encourage you the more to beg his assistance; yea in all your addresses to God let it strengthen your faith to apprehend him as in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with you. And if you are surprized by any sin, yet whil'st it's matter of grief and shame to you, and you are resolv'd to be more watchfull for the time to come, let it not cast you into such a sorrow, as tends only to disquiet and consume your spirits; but remember God hath assured you through Christ the forgiveness of such weaknesses, and they shall not put you out of Covenant with him; but know, if you are hereupon a whit the more encouraged to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In a word, whatever difficulties you are plunged into relating to soul or body, let this still uphold you, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that God hath engag'd himself to be with you in all estates and conditions, and to order all things, so that the issue of them shall be for your advantage. And thus by a frequent consideration of your own engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the Lords Table, and of the priviledges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by confer'd upon you, you will finde your selves not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforted and cheared, but very much advantaged for the walking on more steadily in the ways of holiness.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And to the same end, my next counsel is, <hi>That the Lord Jesus, whom you have here been remembring, may ever live fresh in your thoughts.</hi> Let not your remembrance of him be confin'd to Sacrament-seasons, but let him ever dwell in your he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It's like you think, if Christ was on Earth, you'd follow him, though but in the company of poor Women and Fisher-men, and though the most of the World should laugh at you for so doing, why, know hee'l take it as well at your hands, if you will but tread in his foot-steps, and adhere faithfully to his interest, though it should cost you the losse of all you had, and of life it self. And let the <hi>death</hi> of Christ be much in your thoughts; let the love of God which was herein shewn, be your daily, delightfull study, and ever leave a sweet tincture upon your spirits, that by the power of love you may be moved and carried on in the whole of your duty; Let this shame and drive you from sin, let this make you laborious and unwearied in his service. When you are set upon by a temptation, stay so long as to set a bleeding Saviour before you; and think how you have much such a case now before you as the <hi>Jews</hi> once had; to wit, whether <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>Barabbas</hi> should be prefer'd; whether your lust should be subdued, or your Lord crucified afresh; If you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the <hi>Jews</hi> choice in this case, you had best imitate them. If that which would murder your soul deserve to be spared, rather than he who dyed to save it, then go on, give Christ a stab and sin boldly. Consider further how Christ by his death hath acquired a title to you, so that <hi>you must glorifie him both with body and soul as being not your own, but bought with a price: Bought</hi> you are, not out of the hands of the Father, that you should now have liberty to sin against him, but out of the hands of Satan, that being <hi>free from sin,</hi> you may become <hi>subject to God, and the servants of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> How wilfully blinde are they who take the more liberty in sin, from the consideration of that death, which was undergone to <hi>redeem us from a vain conversation</hi>? 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. Where's that Man's reason and ingenuity, who when he was fallen into his Masters displeasure, and brought into favour again by the great industry of the Son, should think he might now safely disobey his Master? Though the Son pittied the servant so much, that he was loth to see him perish, yet he loves his Father so well, that hee'l


<pb n="298" facs="tcp:107818:157"/>
never purchas'd an allowance for his disobedience; and indeed the servants <hi>disobedience</hi> is his <hi>destruction.</hi> Christ died once to save the penitent, but hee'l never die more to save those that remain will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully disobedient. Consider also, Christ by his death hath purchast abundant grace for the supply of all your wants, and now being at the Fathers right hand, hath full power to give out of this store, wherefore make use of him to obtain the same. Even as the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> received food from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by the hands of <hi>Joseph,</hi> so must you receive all you have from the Father by his Son Jesus. Let then the very <hi>life you live in the flesh be by faith in the Son of God.</hi> By earnest desires vented in fervent prayers, be ever deriving virtue and vigour from him your head. Be as desirous and craving as you are necessitous, as hungry as you are empty, that the good God, acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. If you would thus grow in grace, <hi>Be diligent in the use of all the means of grace which Christ hath afforded, and let them be used and improved as means.</hi> You must, I have told you, be much in earnest Prayer to God in the name of Christ, for what ever you are wanting in. Let not one day pass without the practice of this duty; you that have Families call them together, and pray with them morning and evening. If you neglect this, how little do you differ from those Heathens who call not upon God, and upon whom he will pour out his wrath. Be diligent in attending to the publick preaching of the Word, and prepare your selves before-hand with a resolution to obey what shall be made known to you to be the wil of God, and beg his blessing on what you hear. Consider when you come home, wherein you are particularly concern'd, in what you have heard, and accordingly follow it: Setting against that sin, or upon that duty, that you are thereby convinc't of. When you can get time, spend it in reading Gods Word, and good Books, which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and enforce that Word. Especially you that have not much time on the week-days, spend the remainder of the Lords day, after publick worship, in some such good employment, and waste it not in idlenesse; no nor an hour at any other time. Read also to and with your Family, and ponder of it afterwards, that it may be more profitable to you. Often discourse one with another about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of your souls, soberly and seriously; that you may afford each other what help you can. It would be exceeding well, if, when you sit with your neighbours, you would be thus employed in holy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury conference to the use of edifying, rather than in idle chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and talking of persons, and things that concern you not.

But as I desire you not to neglect these exercises of Religion, so on the other hand as earnestly I would wish you to beware of rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, as thinking all Religion is confin'd to them, and so becoming lesse carefull of your carriage, as to justice, temperance, inward piety, and all vertuous actions. Methinks the wretched error of those Sects that throw off all external duties of worship, and crie up themselves as above Ordinances, may teach this wholsome lesson to all professing Christians, to beware of resting in these things and framing to themselves a Religion out of them. These I grant are parts of obedience to God: for he hath commanded them, and they are waies for the exercise and encrease of our graces, and to be as helps to godlinesse; but to think that they give any discharge from the practice of godlinesse, and make amends for sins we are loath to leave, for which we do as it were compound with God by these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, making sin our pleasure, and his service a pennance for it, these are conceits so gross, that methinks none but a Papist or one willingly ignorant should entertain them. Religion is no road of performances, but a new nature attended with a new life; It is the subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ction of the soul to the will of God expressing it self in all commanded acts of obedience; an eager and ingenuous pursuance after the blessed God in all those waies where in he is to be found, and whereby he communicates himself to the soul of Man, so that there is no contradiction betwixt inward holinesse and outward du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but much-what the same relation, that there is betwixt <hi>life</hi> and eating, breathing and motion: for in these the divine life is exprest exercised and nourished. But to think that Sacraments, Prayers and hearing, &amp;c. may serve turn without any inward holinesse and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal sincere obedience, is as if a Man should think, that the forced motion of a Puppet, should make it pass for a living creature; that great promises may pass for performances, and that knowing what we must do, and talking of it, may serve instead of doing what we are taught. Let them lay this seriously to heart, who, when their practices are ungodly and loose, think to salve all by keeping their Church, and saying their Prayers; and all such who make more adoe about the externals in devotion, than about the right ordering of their hearts and lives, whereas all our devotions should tend to better these.</p>

                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:107818:158"/>4. If you would make good the promises you have made at the Lords Table, to live a strict and godly life, you will find it of singular importance, yea of flat necessity, <hi>to retain a great watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse over all your ways.</hi> Ever keep up a sense of the danger you are in, by reason of the frailty of your nature, the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of your hearts, and the many temptations you are every where exposed to; And therefore let this care secretly run through the whole course of your actions, to beware of being sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by sin therein. In all emploiments, companies and affairs still keep up this watch. And think beforehand where your danger is greatest, where you are most apt to be overtaken, and there place the strongest guard. Set a watch over your eyes, ears, appetites, tongues, hearts and hands, that you be not by them betraid into any miscarriage. When you find your self endangered by a present temptation, then have some solid reason ready at hand to repell it, with store whereof you should alwaies be furnisht, with reasons drawn from God, Christ, Heaven or Hell, or from your Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall engagements, as I shewed before; and be sure, have a strong resolution to check the first risings and beginnings of sin, before it have gone so farre, that your judgment is brib'd and blinded by your affections; and have speedy recourse to the God of all grace, that he would send you help from above. <hi>Consideration, Resolution,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> are three weapons wherewith the Christian Souldier may do wonders against the tallest sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> that shall assault him in his way to <hi>Canaan.</hi> Often take account of your selves, and review your behaviour in actions that are past; and let one days experience still teach you how to live the next better. But upon the sense of any miscarriage, let not your guilt drive you farther from God, &amp; put you into unprofitable vexations and horrors, but present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make hast to the throne of grace, get your peace made with God through Christ, and renew your watch with more diligence than ever, but alwaies with the most humble and absolute dependance upon divine assistance.'Tis too probable, that some lazy wretches will here flye out, as <hi>Naaman</hi> in a rage did against the Prophet, when he heard he must wash seven times in <hi>Jordan</hi> for the cure of his Leprosie, which he thought would have been done with a word speaking, so perhaps you'l tell me, <hi>that you had thought Receiving of the Sacrament would so have kill'd your lusts, and cleansed your hearts, that you need have been at litle care about them afterward; and will be ready to ask, what good you got by it, if you must take all this pains notwithstanding.</hi> You slothfull souls, may you not as well ask what good you get by Christs death, and the giving of the Spirit? Since notwithstanding both these, you must take pains, or


<pb n="301" facs="tcp:107818:158"/>
else you are never like to be saved. For know, God will have you employ the faculties he has given you, and the work of Grace is to heal your faculties, and enable them for their proper employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He that made you Reasonable creatures, will make you holy and happy as such; and the help which he affords, is to bring you to diligence, and assist you therein, and by that means to save you. Thus Sacraments are onely profitable to the diligent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious, their use being to quicken and strengthen, but they are no refuges for the slothfull, no encouragements to idlenesse. Never think that God will make such a way to heaven, that you may walk in it without using your legs. 'Tis <hi>you</hi> that must <hi>do</hi> the things required, though it be by <hi>Christ strengthning you,</hi> for whose sake al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so your frailties are forgiven. Wherefore let me renew my advice, that at all times, and in all things you would be watchfull, and maintain an holy jealousie over those hearts, that have too often shown what they have in them. Take this for the greatest work you have to do in the world to beware of sin, and to be carefull to please God, as the Souldier's whole work is to serve his Generall, and the Servant's to obey his Master; yea more absolutely than so ought a creature to study his Maker's will; and account this work your own greatest happinesse. So avoid sin, and all occasions and appearances of it, as you would do the Plague in a Visited Town; and be as carefull to watch all opportunities of doing good both to the souls and bodies of others, as men ordinarily are of laying hold on their gain. Often ask your selves, wherein God is honoured by you, or others profited, and be ashamed to live to no better purpose than to eat and drink, to sleep and dresse your selves for work or play. And do not object against this constant watchfulnesse, that it will take up all your time, and hinder your necessary employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for by using it awhile it will grow even naturall to you, and will no more hinder you in your affairs, than it hinders a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller in his journey, to take heed of running into bogs and ditches. Is it any hard matter to be alwaies carefull, least you should hurt your bodies? Wherever you are, and whatever you are doing, cannot you keep up this care, and yet follow your businesse well enough? Why then can you not take the same heed of your souls with as little trouble or hindrance?</p>
               <p n="5">5. To help you in this watchfulnesse, and guide you in an exact circumspect walking, it will be exceeding profitable for you, <hi>at all times to retain upon your minds a very awfull sense of the presence of the most Holy God.</hi> Whatever you are about, remember he observes you, and ponders all your paths, though you perceive not him. Wherefore always order and behave your selves as before him.

And remember, you are always going on to the Judgement seat of Christ, where you must have a triall of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times greater concernment, than those that use to come before Earthly Princes and Judges; when the case must be decided where you must live for ever, whether in the highest joys, or the sorest torments. Had you not need then now, to be getting a good cause: for according to the life you led here in the flesh, will that sentence passe. <hi>The wicked must go into everlasting punishment, and the righteous into life eternall</hi> The God who sees you now, will Judge you then by Christ the Redeemer. Think what a life you shall wish you had led, when you come to the end of it, and must be Judged for it, and lead such an one now. When the sugred baits of sin are presented, and you have much ado to hold off them, then think what bitternesse it will be in the end; compare the honey with the gall, the present delight which is vanisht in a moment, with the sting and pain which endures eternally, and then judge and act like reasonable creatures. But above all, let your thoughts be even steept and swallowed up in the pleasant contemplations of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which shall be revealed in, and bestowed upon all that love the Lord Jesus. Whenever you are ready to faint and give out, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the joy that is set before you, and let that remembrance cheer and revive you. Consider what that goodnesse is, which God hath laid up in himself for them that fear him, till you find your love enflamed towards him; and let that love put you upon more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thoughts, and earnest longings after him. Onely see to fill up all your time with suitable actions, and then let it even please you to see your days post away so fast. Alwaies keep it on your thoughts, that you are in a journey to a glorious Kingdome, and be often saying, <hi>Now I am one day, or month, or year nearer than I was before.</hi> Stretch out thy self with a longing look towards thy Fathers house, <hi>Shortly I shall be in the arms of my dear Saviour, and shall be joyning with Saints and Angels in the triumphant praises of Jehovah and the Lamb.</hi> And remember, this happinesse consists chiefly in being made perfectly holy, and therefore here must that grace be sown and grow up, that shall then be ripened into glory.

And the more holy you are, the nearer to heaven will you get whilst you stay on earth, and the meeter for it will you be, when you are taken off from the earth. Ever keep up such a sense of the excellency of this future blessednesse, as may blast all other things in your esteem, and deaden the temptations that are taken from pleasures, riches and honours. Oh think how perfectly provided for must he needs be, who shall have God for his portion! How mad are they that would lose the least hope of this happinesse for the whole world! And they that look for such great things, <hi>what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of persons ought they to be in all holy conversation and godliness</hi>? Oh let nothing weary you, or turn you out of the way. Hold out awhile longer, and you shall be plac'd out of the reach of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations for ever. Fasten upon nothing on this side heaven with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great delight or long stay: But still tell your selves it's time enough to be happy when God shall take you to himself, so he will but here vouchsafe you that converse with him, whereof we in this state are capable, Let every thing you meet with be as a step toward Mount Sion, and raise you nearer to heaven, and make you more desirous of it.
