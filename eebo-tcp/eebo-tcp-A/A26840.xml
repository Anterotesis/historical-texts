            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:50543:3"/>
and Complements to fill up the vacuity of diſcourſe; which in the firſt uſe, were faithful interpreters of the affections they repreſented: ſince falſe tongues are as modeable as falſe Locks, and Grateful lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (like excellent fruit grafted on a Crabſtock) uſurped by thoſe who take not any impreſſion from the favours their ſpeech pretends engraven in their hearts, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unaltered from their innate ingratitude, as the Crab-root re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his ſowre nature, though his boughs are adorned with Golden Apples. Since men have learnt to give thanks by Rote, as Parrots do Goodmorrows; To reduce the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Gratitude to lip-labour, is to offer Sacrifice on a polluted Altar; to prophane that which is holy, and to pay a debt in braſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which may have the ſtamp, but not the value of currant Coyn.
<pb facs="tcp:50543:3"/>
Large profeſſions of thankfulneſs having by general abuſe degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into pure impoſtures and viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of hypocriſie, or (at beſt) empty ſounds, which naturally inferr the hollowneſs of the Veſſell they proceed from.</p>
            <p>My obligations to you are many and great; Juſtice returns <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> ſomething equivolent to what is received; but Gratitude obliges <hi>reddere cum foenore</hi>; a Duty I am ſo far from being Capable to ſatisfie, that I confeſs my ſelf Bankrupt by your favours: and for laying out kindneſſes where they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, nor can be requited, you might have repented your ſelf of ill husbandry, equall to his, who ſowed Wheat on the ſands; But that bounty to an undeſerving per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, reſembles ſo nearly that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetype of Goodneſs, whereby Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence obliges the Univerſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

its merit; that my want of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and diſability of retribution, will intitle your beneficence the more Divine; and be Arguments of your Prudence, in doing good for Ends whereof you cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed: that is, like <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Good Man, of being ſatisfied from your ſelf; a deſign not to be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated: and carries in it the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of being Conformable to his Precept, who Commands to give without hope to receive again.

'Tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to view in a Fryars Frock, and the Pomp of a Cardinal; in the ſolitary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements of an Ermitage, and attended with legions of armed men: Praying in a Cloiſter, and Judging on a Throne; Begging Alms, but withall beſtowing Provinces, and relieving Princes in diſtreſs: Dead to the world, to live in it with Content; and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a Monaſtery, to obtain a glorious
<pb facs="tcp:50543:7"/>
reſurrection into the Theatre of Action, and the prime dignities of Church and State. Fortune the Miſtris of other mens vertues, waited on <hi>Ximenes,</hi> as a Page Errant through the deſart ſolitudes of Covents and Cloyſters, into the glorious ſplendour of Palaces and Soveraign Courts: like a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Lover, ſhe purſued him who fled from her, and Courted him, who ſlighted her. His merit had preference to the prerogative of Royal Birth, when Queen <hi>Iſabell</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asked, promoted him to the Archiepiſcopal Chair of <hi>Toledo,</hi> which the Charms of Conjugal affection, aſſiſted with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull influence of Majeſty in the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> her King and Husband, laboured in vain to perſwade her to grant to <hi>Don Alonzo</hi> his Son, then Suitor for that Great dignity of prime Prelate and firſt Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> who miſt his mark, though he was born a Prince, and had a King for his Advocate to plead in his behalf: the ſucceſs juſtified the wiſdom of Queen <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> choice. For the vertue of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> was proof againſt the Charms of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and continued humble and pious <hi>in pontificalibus;</hi> not Fortunes ſlave, but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris: gained vaſt revenews, to appear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly liberal; and Soveraign Honors to Grace his Magnificence; filled his ſoul with
<pb facs="tcp:50543:7"/>
zeal for Converſion of Infidels, and his Heart with Courage to conquer <hi>Oran.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the Generals Staff, and ſwayed the Scepter with the ſame dexterity he handled the Breviary: the Head of an Army in a Cardinals Cap, and Governour of <hi>Spain</hi> in the Purple of the Church; a Courtier and Patriot in one perſon; the darling of his Prince, for fidelity and zeal to promote the intereſt of the Crown; the favourite of the people, for eaſing their grievances, procuring immunities, erecting and endowing Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Hoſpitals and Granaries; wherein he expended the vaſt profits of his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, like the Ocean returning the Tribute of the leſſer Waters, he receives in ſhowers of beneficence on thoſe who paid it. When he retired from the Preſidents Chair in the Councel Royal, he went to Aſſiſt at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Divinity, to demonſtrate the Conſiſtence of Piety (to Canonize him a Saint) with Policy, which gained him the title of Great Miniſter of <hi>Spain.</hi> And that the diſtractions of Government, could not diſorder the harmony of his ſoul into an incapacity to perform exerciſes of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when toſt with the Tempeſts of a turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent State.</p>
            <p>He was humble in his perſonal carriage and private concerns, but haughty in his
<pb facs="tcp:50543:8"/>
Conduct, and heroically magnanimous in his publick capacity. His Gratitude to his Benefactors was Generous and exemplary; but <hi>uſque ad Aras,</hi> confined within the limits of Juſtice, from which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, though tempted by the higheſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, which occaſioned his conteſt with his Good Maſter <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the Pope; when the former denyed him what in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice was due; and the other would have uſurped a power to unlock at pleaſure the Treaſuries of the Church of <hi>Spain,</hi> with the Keyes of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> But blind obedience was not an Article of the Cardinals Creed, who reverenced the Pope as Paſtor of the flock; but would not admit him Lord of the heritage. He ſlighted mean exerciſes of Vertue, as born only for arduous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts: annulled Contracts made by the High Treaſurer <hi>Don Manuel</hi> in deceit of the King, and tore in pieces the fraudulent Leaſe drawn by Colluſion with the Farmers of <hi>Granada.</hi> Made Judges examples of his Juſtice, and feel the ſeverity of the Laws they had corruptly abuſed, to colour their ſale of the right of the poor to the purſe of the rich. Reformed the Exchequer and Counſel Royal, as well as the Retinue of the Court: laid proſtrate three of the greateſt Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had vilified his Perſon, and
<pb facs="tcp:50543:8"/>
contemned his Authority: forced the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel Royal to pay him the reſpects they had neglected: obliged Prince <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Brother to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth then King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to obey the Orders he threatned to break: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Rebell Cities of <hi>Spain</hi> to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by Arms, and Mutineers by the ſole Majeſty of his looks, and the ſilent Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Great Conduct; opened (as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall) a paſſage to the Catholick King; and (as Archbiſhop and Cardinal) to the Catholick Faith into <hi>Africk.</hi> Was a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Piety, to Fryars; of Charity, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and Zeal, to Prelates: of Courage and Conduct to Commanders of Armies: of Royal Juſtice, Prudence and Magnanimity to Princes: and ſhines a Conſtellation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private, Moral and Politick, Civil and Theological Vertues, that moved ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively in the ſeveral Orbs of Religious, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary and Politick Government: was a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Luminary in each, and made it appear, that neither Religion, Military Diſcipline, nor Civil Government, but a tranſcendent Eminency in every of them, was his proper Sphere.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Lineaments of that vertue, the following Story preſents in lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; and renders as lovely, as that in <hi>Plato</hi>'s fancy, whoſe Idea of vertue was

Eminent and Conſpicuous, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing him Palms of Victory, and Crowns of immortal Glory. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I make your Eminence, of the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and oppoſitions Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred and ſurmounted, in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Kingdom, I dare affirm, the greateſt and moſt conſiderable, the Treaſures of paſt Ages can afford. But I fear, my Lord, I may appear as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in offering it, as he that carries water to the Sea. Since the Eſteem and Repute you have this day, of the prime Perſon of our Age, is no leſs grounded upon your incomparable Conſtancy, in ore coming all obſtacles that oppoſe your vertue; then your admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in Affairs of State. The Painter certainly commits no Crime, who fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guring out the Battels of other men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineates the Combates of ſome Great Captain, which were not deſigned the ſubject of his Pencill. And if my Pen innocently mention any Action, that may correſpond, and run parallel with yours; I conceive it merits neither blame, nor contempt on that accompt. For, my Lord, what Miniſter of State is there, who hath not reſembled others in ſome Traverſes of Fortune, and croſs
<pb facs="tcp:50543:19"/>
occurrences in his Adminiſtration, it being impoſſible to govern men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſition from men? The Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Philoſophers held it an undoubted truth, That the World is a Temple built by God, who hath impreſſed his viſible Image in the body of the Sun, to act in his ſtead. What the Sun is in the Univerſe, that a Miniſter of State is in the Government under his care; the great Repreſentative of the Soveraign Authority. The Sun is the Eye of the World; and the Miniſter of State, in the <hi>Perſian</hi> phraſe, the Eye of the King. Yet this glorious Luminary hath its Eclipſes, and aſpiring miſts and Clouds interpoſing between us and him, to the obſcuring of his Light. The Ancient Fiction of the Suns riſing out of the Sea, and ſetting there, without dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of his Luſtre; preſents to us in him, the lively Picture of a Miniſter of State in the Government of the world; and intimates thoſe troubleſome and diſaſtrous occurrences, that frequently infeſts the beginning and end of his Adminiſtration; but cannot impair the Rayes of his Glory. Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> who by his good Conduct, rendred <hi>Spain</hi> happy; had notwithſtanding a

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a Cuſtome received in all Ages, and approved by the practice of the whole world, to expoſe to publick view the Effigies and Statues of men who have ſurpaſſed others by the greatneſs of their Vertues, lived the Glory of their times, and rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves Recommendable to the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Poſterity. To theſe figures of their Corporal Lineaments and Reſemblances of the external forms of their perſons, ſome have added Tables and Memorials, as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of their Heroick and Magnami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Actions in preſiding o're Councills, and publick Aſſemblies, appeaſing popular Seditions, and reſtoring quiet and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to a diſordered City, Countrey, or State, or the like. I have propoſed to my imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:50543:22"/>
this latter way of repreſenting illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Perſonages, and here preſent to the publick, the pourtraict of the greateſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of his time, that <hi>Europe</hi> could then boaſt in all the States ſhe contains: I have drawn him Active in War, a Counſellor in Peace; extending the borders of <hi>Spain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas; advertiſing his Maſter of the diſorders of the Court; and giving him his Counſells and ſage Advice. I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him appeaſing the Tumults and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious diſorders of Cities, of Provinces, of a whole Realm; advancing Vertue, reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Merit, puniſhing Vice, and eſtabliſhing a general felicity in the whole body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. The work is compoſed with that Candor, that Liberty, and Truth, (which ought to Animate, and are the principal Ornament of Hiſtory) that the end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, will eaſily appear to have been not the pleaſing of any particular perſon, but the profit of the publick, and the good of the Common-wealth. Which I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in that of the Adminiſtration of the Cardinal <hi>D' Amboyſe,</hi> already publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſome others that may follow this, wherein my only deſign is truth, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes tends to the publick good. But the Actions of this great Miniſter, being far above thoſe of other men, who have mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb facs="tcp:50543:22"/>
the Affais of Monarchs, I thought it my Duty to conſider ſome of them apart, and to make particular reflections thereon, for the delight of thoſe that ſhall take the pains to read them.</p>
            <p>The Croſſes he met with in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Spain,</hi> were almoſt infinite; and the power of the Enemies that attacqued him, very remarkable; but his conſtancy, in the reſiſtance admirable. As a couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pilot forſakes not the helm in tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous weather, but periſhes gloriouſly with his hand upon it: ſo hath he left us this inſtruction, that a Miniſter ſhould never endure diſorders tending to the vilifying and contempt of the Supream Authority, (which his repreſents) or to the oppreſſion of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but chooſe rather to lye buried in the Ruines of the one and the other.</p>
            <p>His Actions in the Armies when ſeventy years old, demonſtrate that men who wear a Robe, as well as thoſe who wear a Sword, have their Vigour and Activity to encounter Enemies, perils and difficulties. And though their condition exempt them from corporall labours, yet they remain ſubject to thoſe of the mind; whoſe cares are more weighty, and pains more conſiderable and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. All that fight have their ſhare in the Victory, but the General who conquers by
<pb facs="tcp:50543:23"/>
his good conduct and prudence, merits all the glory. Therefore the <hi>Spartans</hi> for a Victory gain'd by force of Arms, ſacrificed only a Bird; but a whole Oxe fell Victim for a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory obtained by the prudence of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> in attacquing <hi>Oran</hi> in the face of the Sun, contrary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his Captains, who would have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the advantage of the night, to carry on the Aſſault; ſeems to have revived the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who refuſed to ſet upon <hi>Darius</hi> by night, as ſcorning to ſteal a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; but deſiring the Sun might teſtifie he owed it to his valour. Moreover his good Conduct in all the War of <hi>Africk,</hi> where his Age and Quality forbad him the bearing of Arms, juſtifies the opinion of the Great <hi>Roman</hi> Captain,<note place="margin">J. Caeſar.</note> That Conqueſt by Counſel, is not leſs honourable, than that by the Sword.</p>
            <p>'Tis a great inſtance of the excellency of his Conduct, that he brought Learning and Military Valour, to eſteem and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in <hi>Spain;</hi> that the State received thereby the means, not only to defend, but render it ſelf illuſtrious. Nor was he ever ſubject to the reproach of extinguiſhing the ſparks of Vertue in the breaſts of youth, by depriving Gallant Actions of their due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb facs="tcp:50543:23"/>
of juſt Rewards; but exerciſing with courage and integrity, both commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and diſtributive Juſtice, diſpenſing Rewards to the good, and inflicting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the bad; He raiſed his condition to that pitch of higheſt perfection; which induced the Sage Politician to affirm,<note place="margin">Plato.</note> that nothing in the World is ſo like God, as a juſt man.</p>
            <p>The Government of Provinces, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Charges of State, were not given to thoſe who were moſt in favour, but to thoſe who had moſt merit. 'Tis true, he preferred Perſons of Quality, but ſuch as were alſo men of Fortune and Eſtate; leaſt their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities might incline them to peel and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the people: Nor had he leſs regard to their integrity. And in preferring Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of integrity and worth, before other perſons of equall vertues; he ſeems to have imitated the order of the Heavens, which are guided by intelligences, whoſe Nature is more excellent and pure, than thoſe forms which derive their Groſſer Eſſence from the Elements. And as by the Ordinances of Nature, we do not only receive Light im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the Sun the fountain of it, but from the leſſer Stars, whoſe bodies na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath diſpoſed and adapted to a Capacity of receiving Light from the Sun, and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating
<pb facs="tcp:50543:24"/>
the ſame to us by Reflection: So the Governours of Provinces, and places of importance ſhould keep up and maintain the Splendor of Majeſty in the abſence of their Prince; as the Starrs by night (which is the abſence of the Sun) ſhew us part of the brightneſs of that glorious Luminary. And, beſides that the people honour and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence men of eminent quality, and are more propenſe and ready to yield them obedience, than to men raiſed from a Mean Condition; Gentlemen together with their blood, derive from their Parents the ſeeds of Generoſity; and have commonly the advantage of better Education, and the memory of the Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Acts of their Anceſtors, is ordinarily a ſpurr to vertue, a ſtrong motive and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful incitement to good Actions. But Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> though where he found equall vertue in two perſons of unequall birth, he did, (as Reaſon would) prefer the Noble; yet was he far from abandoning or ſlighting vertue, from which Nobility is derived, and by which it is maintained.</p>
            <p>The Gifts and Largeſſes he beſtowed out of his proper ſtock on particular perſons and the publick, are worthy remarque: His advancement of an infinite number of perſons of integrity and merit to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Magiſtrature, the Dignities of the
<pb facs="tcp:50543:24"/>
Chureh, and Charges of War, preſerve to this day in <hi>Spain,</hi> the memory of the Grandeur of his Spirit, and will remain an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing monument of Glory and Benediction to his name. The Hoſpitals built at his Charge in <hi>Spain,</hi> and endowed by him with Revenues; the Religious Houſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining there for durable works of his piety and bounty; the publick Granaries ſtored with Corn for relif of the poor, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the Rents ſetled by him to that purpoſe; the Seminaries and publick Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of vertue for the Common-wealth, where he provided for the education of youth of both Sexes, left deſtitute of neceſſaries in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half declare and will record to perpetuity, that the Grandeur of <hi>Ximenes</hi> conſisted not ſo much in his Eminent and Great Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as in his tranſcendent Liberality and extraordinary bounty.</p>
            <p>The Temples of the Graces in the Cities of the <hi>Levant,</hi> were by the Ancients built in publick places, as in their Markets, or near their Cirques and Amphitheaters, to ſignifie that the Benefits and good Actions of great men, ought to be not only open to private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but communicated to the publick. A Miniſter of State is a publick perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the moſt eminent Dignity of a Kingdom, next the Royal: And if it be
<pb facs="tcp:50543:25"/>
true, that a good King is the Father of his people; the Miniſter of State who is his Aſſiſtant, ought to be a faithful Steward to diſpence his favours, and afford ready helps to the wants and neceſſities of the publick. When <hi>Cinon</hi> the Athenian was grown Rich, he cauſed the fences and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures of his Gardens to be laid open, that the poor might have free ingreſs to gather the fruits; he kept an open houſe and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all that were in want; and ſent his ſervants loaded with Garments through the Streets of <hi>Athens,</hi> to be diſtributed amongst them that were in want; holding himſelf unworthy to poſſeſs a great Eſtate, without imparting of it to others. In like manner, had Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> when ſeiſed of that great Benefice, (whereby was veſted in him the largeſt Revenue of that Kingdom,) filled his Coffers with Treaſure, and locked up there the Gold deſtined for other uſes, he had condemned himſelf as guilty of embezling and converting to his private benefit, what ought to have been laid out in the Redemption of Slaves, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of Priſoners, Cures of the ſick, comfort of the afflicted, and ſuſtenance of the poor. But he made liberal deſtribution thereof ſuitable to the neceſſities of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral objects of his Bounty. Certainly
<pb facs="tcp:50543:25"/>
ſome good Kings are publick Springs, whence the people have right to draw; that is, to have recourſe to their Beneficence; and good Miniſters of State ought to be the pipes to thoſe Royall Fountain, to convey to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the water of Relief.</p>
            <p>The greatneſs of his vertues, could not ſo exempt <hi>Ximines</hi> from Envy, but that in his life time it attacqued both his Name and his Conduct, though his death put a period to detraction, and procured Reverence to his name, honour to his memory, and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies for his Government. And 'tis obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, men never behold the Sun ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as when he is Ecclipſed. Innocence, of all places of the world, makes leaſt Reſidence at Court, where Ambition alwayes wars againſt eminent vertues. This concludes it neceſſary for a Miniſter of State, to fortifie himſelf with Conſtancy and Reſolution, to reſiſt their malignity, who would call him to account; and charge him as anſwerable for all the ſiniſter Accidents that fall out: as if the Events of Affairs, depended only on him. Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> had this vertue in the ſuperlative; alwayes like himſelf, alwayes aquanimous, alwayes firm, ſtout and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, in the beginning, progreſs and end of his adminiſtration, that he might have ſaid of himſelf, what the Roman <hi>Camillus</hi> once
<pb facs="tcp:50543:26"/>
of himſelf in another ſenſe; That neither the Dictatorſhip had elevated, nor Exile aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the height of his Spirit. That neither the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> the Primacy of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Cardinals Cap, nor the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Governour of a Kingdom, had given him courage, nor the croſſes and misfortunes of Court taken it from him.</p>
            <p>Theſe great and heroick vertues have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him the compleat original and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitype of a perfect Miniſter of State: which I propoſe to thir view, who Govern the world under the Authority of Soveraign Princes; that they may imitate his Zeal for the publick good, his fidelity to his Prince, his affection to perſons of worth and wel-deſerving, his ſtrong inclinations and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous actions for the good of the people, and increaſing the Glory and Grandeur of the State; being the ends and principal marks aimed at in all Governments, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with wiſdom, and crowned with Succeſs.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>INGS, who are Maſters of the Goods of this world, advantage men in their fortunes, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their eſtates; but 'tis the Sun, that King of Starrs, and firſt of all ſecond Cauſes, that enriches them with the Gifts of Nature; ſo that thoſe Regions which are bleſt with the more favourable aſpect of this Eye of Heaven, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50543:27"/>
things of greater excellency than other Countreyes, and give birth to men of more eminent parts, and endowed with the rareſt qualities in Natures gift. <hi>Spain,</hi> by the happy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of her ſcituation, lyes ſo full and open in the Eye of that great Luminary, that, as ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of her beauty, he vouchſafes her the light of his countenance, and by the large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his irradiation, afforded her, contributes to her production of eminent perſons. In her was born <hi>Francis,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> of the Noble Family of the <hi>Ciſneres,</hi> who deduce their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the Suburbs of <hi>Villaizar,</hi> in the Dioceſs of <hi>Toledo.</hi> His Father was <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> Receiver of the Tenths of the Clergy granted by the Pope to the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; who, taken with the beauty of a young Maid of an honeſt family and the ſame place, married her, and had by her ſeveral Children, whereof <hi>Ximenes</hi> was the eldeſt. At the Font he received, with the Graces of Heaven, the name of his Father <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> which he after changed, in the Cloiſter, into that of <hi>Francis.</hi> In his Infancy, he had his Education in the Town of <hi>Areula D' Henares,</hi> where he learnt the principles of the Latine Tongue, and of good manners: from thence he was removed to <hi>Salamanca,</hi> to ſtudy thoſe Laws which regulate the Eſtates and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of men: where, by the advantage of his pregnant Wit, he became ſo great a Proficient, that in a ſhort time he was capable to inſtruct others.</p>
            <p>His Family was reduced to ſo low an Ebb of Fortune, that his Father was put to his ſhifts to furniſh him with neceſſaries requiſite for his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50543:27"/>
and could not well ſpare him ſufficient to bear his charges. This obliged <hi>Ximenes</hi> to beſtir himſelf, as having no means of livelihood, but what he could get by his wit and induſtry: therefore he read the Laws in his Chamber to ſeveral Students, who contributed to defray his Charges. But his Genius aſpired higher; and the honeſt gains he made in his Chamber, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſtudy of Divinity. And having finiſhed the courſe of that Study, returned to his Countrey, where his Father practiſed as an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney in the Court of Juſtice of that place. Some Moneths he ſpent at home, but finding no imployment there, worthy his Abilities, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Fathers leave, to go to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſeek a better fortune; But was unfortunately robbed by the way, and reduced to extream neceſſity. This diſaſter occaſioned his ſtay at <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> till <hi>Brunet,</hi> a young Gentleman of <hi>Spain</hi> bound for <hi>Rome,</hi> (who had been his School-fellow at <hi>Salamanca</hi>) paſſing that way, happily relieved him by taking him into his company, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Charges to <hi>Rome.</hi> Being arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> he became Advocate for ſuch of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as had Suits depending in the Eccleſiaſtical Jurisdiction; till the news of his Fathers death; and his good nature carried him back into <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſuccour his Mother now a Widow, and afford his helping hand to the Orphan ſtate of his younger Brothers. But before his departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> he obtained from the Pope (thoſe they call) Spectative Bulls; whereby he was provided of the firſt Prebend ſhould be void in his Native Countrey; which happened to be that of the

The granting of ſuch Bulls, gives great offence to the Biſhops of <hi>Spain,</hi> as retrenching their power in collating Benefices. <hi>Alphonſo Carilla,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> beſtowed the ſame Prebend on his Almoner. <hi>Ximenes</hi> oppoſes it; the Archbiſhop reſents the reſiſtance, as a high contempt, and preſumptuous obſtruction of his Authority; reſolves to ſuppreſs it by force, and claps up <hi>Ximenes</hi> in the Tower of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ceda,</hi> where he kept him cloſe Priſoner under hard and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous uſage, in a place which <hi>Ximenes</hi> after his promotion to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> made the Repoſitory of his Riches; teaching us, that great Souls make the Diſgraces of the world a Treaſury of Vertue. The miſerable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and rude uſage of this place afflicted his Spirit to ſo extream a degree, that it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; There is nothing in the world more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, than trouble and ſlavery to men of Letters, whoſe Genius requires Liberty and Repoſe. The loſs of both drew ſighs and groans from the heart, and loud complaints from the tongue of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> which an old Prieſt his fellow priſoner, and companion in miſery, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to allay, beſpake him thus: A wiſe man, <hi>Ximenes,</hi> is alwayes free; and vertue which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves no other ſlavery but that of vice, loſes not her Liberty in Chains and Irons. Ceaſe then to complain, and put an end to your Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; endure with patience the lot befallen you: Suffering is often the way to preferment. In the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50543:28"/>
very place you are in, was heretofore locked up <hi>John Zerervella,</hi> Brother to that Great Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile Alvarez de Luna,</hi> with no other advantage than that of cloſer impriſonment and heavier irons than yours; yet he was afterwards Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Toledo.</hi> Great miſeries uſher in thoſe perſons into great proſperities, who by patience triumph over their calamities. <hi>Zerervella</hi> in the courſe of his felicities, drew the comfort of his life from the memory of his impriſonment. The innocence of your viſage and majeſty of your countenance, are, in my judgement, preſages of the like fortune to you.</p>
            <p>He was removed from the Tower to St. <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quats,</hi> a Priſon for Prieſts lying under Accuſations of crime. His innocence was ſo apparent and conſpicuous, that his deteinure there, was ſo long only, as might ſerve for the execiſe of his vertue. The Counteſs of <hi>Bondiano,</hi> Siſter to the Archbiſhop, obtained his liberty. <hi>Ximenes,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſecond loſs of it, reſolves to enjoy it at diſtance from the violences of a Prelate, who ſo ill underſtood the vertues and merits of men. And therefore quitting the Dioceſs of <hi>Toledo,</hi> he retires into that of <hi>Siguenza,</hi> where he chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Prebend for a Chappelleny with a ſmall penſion.</p>
            <p>Here that noble Affection of the beſt Spirits and moſt excellent temper, the love of Learning, made him withdraw from the converſation of the world, to follow his Studies; where he learnt the Hebrew and Chaldee Languages. But though his life was retired, his reputation increaſed. The rayes of vertue diſcover the owner at diſtance,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50543:29"/>
though he ſeem to lye hid in obſcurity. <hi>Peter Gonſalve,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Mendoza,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Siguenza</hi> named <hi>Ximenes</hi> his Vicar General, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner forced him to take the Office, and with it, the care of his Dioceſs: the ſame time <hi>Alphonſo De Sylva</hi> Earl of <hi>Cifuentes,</hi> taken priſoner by the <hi>Moors</hi> in the Wars of <hi>Granada,</hi> was induced, by the repute of his honeſty and abilities, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute <hi>Ximenes</hi> Adminiſtrator General of all his Demeans, during his impriſonment. Thus For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune began to follow him, when he fled from her, and ſought an employment more agreeable to the tranquillity of his ſpirit, than was to be found in the troubles of ſecular affairs. He held the world a Sea, where ſome are wrecked, but all without exception are toſſed with winds, and ſubject to the agitation of the waves: the object of his deſires and end of his deſigns, being a Port to ſecure him from the one and the other; he made choice of a Cloiſter, as moſt ſuitable to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and took on him the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> in order to the enjoyment of God and himſelf in prayer and contemplation.</p>
            <p>Here he changed the name of <hi>Alphonſo</hi> into that of <hi>Francis,</hi> and reſigned his Benefices to <hi>Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> his youngeſt Brother; leſt neceſſity that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the vertues of the braveſt ſpirits, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proves an ill Counſellor to them, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him in ill courſes for gaining a livelihood.</p>

            <p>WHen <hi>Ximenes</hi> had thus quitted the World for a Cloiſter, the world went in ſearch of him into the Cloiſter; the gravity of his manners, and holineſs of his life, invited thoſe of beſt quality in <hi>Toledo</hi> to viſit him, for receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his directions for guidance of their ſouls in the way to Heaven. Even the Ladies reſorted to him for inſtructions to order their devotion; ſome with Reſolution to practiſe them, others to ſatisfie their Curioſity, in ſeeing a man to famed for ſanctity. The crowds of people that flocked daily to him, interrupting him in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his Religious Exerciſes, and wearying him by importunity, obliged him to quit <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and ſeck out a more retired ſolitude in the Monaſtery of <hi>Caſtanet</hi>; ſo called, from a Grove of Cheſtnut-trees which in a large circumference en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed it round, the Monaſtery being the Center. A year was ſcarce elapſed, but he was drawn out thence, to take on him the charge of Warden of the Covent of <hi>Salceda,</hi> where he kept the Fryars within the Rules of their Order, more by the example of his good life, than the commands of a Superiour. But 'tis the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Courts to enter into Cloiſters, and take thence ſuch men, whom Fortune hath deſigned to partake of their Grandieurs. <hi>Iſabel</hi> Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> calles him to Court in the year 1492. and by the advice of Cardinal <hi>Mendoza,</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> makes him her Confeſſor. In this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50543:30"/>
eminent place, he gave proofs of great vertues, without any exception, but that of intermedling with Matters of State, wherein he exceeded his Call, and ſtrained beyond his Charge and his Frock.</p>
            <p>This perhaps, gave thoſe of his Order occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to draw him back from Court to a Religious imployment, by chooſing him their Provincial for three years. And here he gave a moſt preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant proof of the indifferency of his ſpirit for the affairs of Court, and of the great love he bore his Order, by going from Court more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, than he had come into it, and imploying his time in viſiting the Religious Houſes under his charge. Coming to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> moved with a charitable zeal for the ſalvation of the Infidels, he deſigned a Voyage into <hi>Africk,</hi> at the peril of his life to inſtruct the <hi>Moors</hi> there in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith: but a Fryar of his Order, and in great eſteem for Piety, diſſwaded him; aſſuring him, God had prepared him a great imployment in <hi>Spain.</hi> He travelled on foot, and begged, but was ſuch a bungler at the Trade, and begged ſo untowardly, that he ſeldom carried any but an empty bagg; which made <hi>Franeis Rouys</hi> his companion tell him, he muſt give over begging; for that no man was more certainly born to give to all, and begg of none, than he. And had not the care of <hi>Rouys</hi> ſtood him in more ſtead than his begging Alms, he had made more Faſt-dayes, than the Rules of his Order required. So unfit to begg are Great Spirits, being naturally diſpoſed to Give, not to Ask.</p>

            <p>FOrtune, which had deſigned him for the prime Prelate of <hi>Spain,</hi> took care ſoon after, to furniſh his ſtrong inclinations for the Good of mankind; with means competent to expreſs his Good nature in acts of benificence, anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Greatneſs of his Soul. Cardinal <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> laboured under two maladies, the one incurable, the other dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, Age and a Feavour; which induced him to go to <hi>Guadalfayre,</hi> to take the benefit of that Ayre, he drew at his birth. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabel,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> went thither to viſit him; This honour had ſaved the Cardinals life, if death had regarded the preſence of Kings, who are themſelves his Homagers. <hi>Mendoza</hi> now drawing near to his end, gave his Maſter theſe three ſage Counſels. 1. To make peace with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and keep it inviolable when made. 2. To marry the Infant <hi>John,</hi> Deſigned Succeſſor of their Crowns to <hi>Joan,</hi> ſince the wiſe of <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> pretendant to the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> 3. To conferr the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> on a perſon of mean Condition, but of great inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and extraordinary Capacity: That theſe qualities were apparently eminent in the perſon of <hi>Ximenes</hi>; That the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> proud enough of the Titles they are born to, become intolerably inſolent, by the addition of thoſe of great Dignities.</p>
            <p>Theſe Princes ſlighted the firſt Advice, to the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50543:31"/>
prejudice and notorious damage of Chriſtendom, which ſmarted for their contempt of it, as the Spaniſh hiſtories ingenuouſly Confeſs. The third they embraced, which Coming to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> he remonſtrates to them, that the Dignity of the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo</hi> being the prime of the State, as well ſpiritual as temporal; which gave the perſon inveſted in it, the priviledge of ſpeaking next the King, in the Council-Royal; ought to be given to the moſt illuſtrious, and Ancient Gentry of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Mendoza</hi> quitted his life, and the Archbiſhoprick together, in the year 1496. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> would have preferred his natural ſon Don <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> to this great Benefice: But <hi>Iſabel,</hi> who had right of Preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, as Queen of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> preferred the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> before the birth of Don <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> and the intreaties of the King her husband: The year enſuing, they preſented <hi>Ximenes</hi> to ſucceed in this Grand Prelature, no leſs in dignity than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue; which amounts to two hundred thouſand Ducats a year. <hi>Ximenes</hi> forced by expreſs Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat from the Pope, accepts it: At his firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination he left the Court, and fled on foot to a Covent of his Order a great way from <hi>Madrid,</hi> to avoid inveſtiture in the Archbiſhoprick: But returning in obedience to the Pope, he declared to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabel,</hi> that he would never conſent that this Rich Benefice ſhould be charged with one farthing penſion, as prejudicial to the dignity and liberty, of the prime paſtor of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now hath he juſt cauſe to meddle in Affairs of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50543:31"/>
the State, as being one of the moſt conſiderable members thereof: This ſudden change of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſhook not his Conſtancy, nor altered his ſetled Reſolutions of adhering to vertue; Yet was he as free from mean, and baſe Actions, as from the Corruptions that uſually attend great fortunes; he made it appear that no dignity could be ſo great, as to exceed his capacity, no Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in the gift of fortune, to which his ſoul was not commenſurate; though in his plenty of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and Eminence of place, he continued the plainneſs of a Religious life: Piety hath brought plenty, and abundance of Riches into the Church; And by the diſorders of the world, the Daughter hath devoured the Mother; ſo that there are more Eccleſiaſticks Rich, than Pious: <hi>Ximenes</hi> was not of their number; for amidſt the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that Great Revenue, he kept inviolable that poverty that exalts Great Perſonages above the height of fortune, and conſiſts in the contempt, and ſober uſe of theſe periſhing enjoyments; And, as if he had been afraid to loſe the leaſt part of it, he continued the practiſes of that Poverty, which the Rules of Religion exact from its ſtricteſt votaries. The Pomp of a Cardinal, and Attendance of the Prime Prelate of <hi>Spain,</hi> could not keep him from retyring into a private place, from the eyes of his domeſtiques, to mend with his own hands, the frock he had wore among thoſe of his Order; ſo that after his death, in a Box, whereof in his Life-time, he conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept the Key; there were found needles, thred, and pieces of Gray Cloth, of the Colour of his Frock, which he laid up for that uſe. He ſlept
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50543:32"/>
on a Friers pallet, which he had hid in his Chamber, where ſtood his Bed of ſtate; And that his family might not perceive it, he made it his cuſtom to go to bed, and riſe alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attendants, and his door ſhut. When he was firſt made Archbiſhop, he rid into the Country upon an Aſſe attended by a troop of Monks of his Order; his houſe, his family and his table were ſo ordered, as not to be inconſiſtent with his Vow of poverty; The Great Revenue of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of <hi>Spain,</hi> was imployed in works of Piety, the poor receiving a moity of it for their ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, whom he called, the Lords and Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his Revenues.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops of <hi>Spain,</hi> inſtead of imitating the good Example of his ſimplicity, were offended at it, and complained of him to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, who ſent him a Brieve, adviſing him to change that mean faſhion of life, into a more ſplendid, and becoming his dignity; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, it was not only convenient, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to maintain with ſome external pomp and luſtre, the dignities founded in a holy ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: <hi>Ximenes</hi> obeys the Pope, his table is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter covered, his Beds more ſumptuous, his utenſils of Earth are changed into Plate, and all the ornaments of Prelature more ſplendid and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent: But his Golden Croſs made him not a woodden Biſhop; he continued his conferences in Divinity with the Prieſts, and his ſermons to the people: and it is remarkable, he admitted no man into his family, but upon the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of honeſty and vertue.</p>
            <p>But can it be expected, <hi>Ximenes</hi> ſhould quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50543:32"/>
enjoy a Dignity ſo Eminent, a Benefice of ſo vaſt revenue? ſince 'tis the courſe of the world, that, as Roſes have their prickles grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up with them; ſo croſſes are inſeparable Companions of great fortunes. The firſt that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqued him, were the Monks of his Order, who were at Court with him, and offended that he kept them in his houſe to the Auſtere Rules of their Order, and forbad them to intermeddle with any thing but their Beads, And that being lately made Preſident of the Kings Council, he procured not for them the Prelatures of <hi>Spain</hi>; ſpread ill reports of his perſon, and made their Sermons invectives againſt his conduct; Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pulpit, which ought to be the Oracle of truth, into a Theatre of Envy; They reſted not there, but ſent for their General from <hi>Rome,</hi> and armed him with Calumnies againſt <hi>Ximenes.</hi> The General, arrived in <hi>Spain,</hi> and hurried with faction and inſolence predominant in him; goes to the Queen, and addreſſing himſelf with little reſpect, accuſed <hi>Ximenes</hi> of Ignorance, of Pride, and of Hypocriſie: Blaming the Queen for permitting ſuch a man, to fit in her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and in the prime Chair of Prelature in the Kingdom. <hi>Iſabel</hi> well aſſured of the integrity, and merits of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> and moved at the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable rudeneſs, and irregular paſſion of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; asked him if he were in his wits, and knew whom he ſpoke to. Yes Madam (ſaith he) I am ſo well in my wits, as to know I ſpeak to Queen <hi>Iſabel,</hi> who is but a heap of Duſt as I am; and ſuddenly withdrew from the preſence of the Queen, more like a Fury than a Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50543:33"/>
But the accuſations of theſe Monks, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other foundation, but Envy, hatred and untruths, were eaſily diſſipated by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of <hi>Ximemes,</hi> to their ſhame, but his Glory.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe Ambitious men, who went out of the world upon deſign, to return with greater advantage, attacqued his reputation: But <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardine</hi> his brother, attempted his life. <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> when he took the habit of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to him his Benefices, and was ſoon after followed by this young man; who too, became of the ſame Orders; and afterwards tracing the ſteps of his Brothers fortune, went to Court, in hope of a Biſhoprick: but the ſucceſs not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deſignes, he imputed the cauſe to <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and reſolved to be revenged of him, for the refuſal or delay of his preferment. <hi>Ximenes</hi> lay ſick at <hi>Arcula D'Henares,</hi> in Latin <hi>Complutum; Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> was in his houſe, and finding his Brother one day in his chamber, without any attendant, threw himſelf on the bed where he lay, and preſſing the bolſter hard on his neck, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to choke him, and thinking it done, went out of the Chamber: <hi>Ximenes</hi> not quite dead, was helped by his ſervants who came in, and having acquainted them with <hi>Bernardines</hi> villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, commanded them to apprehend him; They ſearch, and having found him hid in a Cave, drag him out, and bring him to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who took no other revenge, than that he ſent him bound to the Monaſtery of <hi>Torrice</hi> to learn more wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

His pains, and the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> oppoſitions and complaints in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, almoſt exceed expreſſion. But by the end of the year 1499. his Conſtancy ſurmounted all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties raiſed by them, and afforded him oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to employ his thoughts, towards redreſs of the peoples grievances. It troubled him to ſee the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon</hi> oppreſſed by a heavy Tax called <hi>Alcabala,</hi> which forced them to pay the King the tenth part of all they ſold or exchanged. This Impoſition was firſt laid, towards defraying the Charge of the Wars of <hi>Granada,</hi> againſt the <hi>Moors</hi>; but continued to the grievance of the people, after the War; though ended to the great advantage of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabel. Ximenes</hi> remonſtrates to them, that God had made them Paſtors, not Tyrants over the people; that by the favour of Heaven, they had obtained Victory over the <hi>Moors</hi>; that it was an ill Acknowledgement of the mercy, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in time of Peace and Triumph, that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy which was intended only for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the War. His advice was taken, and the people diſcharged of the Tax. This gained him great reputation all over <hi>Spain</hi>; ſo that he never entred the Palace Royal, but the people attended him with joyful Acclamations, ſaying publickly, He never went to Council, but for the good of the Commonalty. A wiſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of State deſigns no leſs the good of the

Sir, I may ſay without incurring ſuſpicion of flattery, that your Victories ſurpaſs the King's; for he gained Stones, but you have gained Souls to God. The greateſt part of the unconverted <hi>Moors</hi> followed the example of a Prince of their Sect, of the Royal Family of the Kings of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> who became Chriſtian; and drew them with him, to the knowledge of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Theſe new Converts, by the light of truth began to diſcover and deteſt their former errors; and of their own accord, laid at <hi>Ximenes</hi> feet five thouſand Volumes of the Alcoran, or Gloſſes and Explications of it; all curiouſly bound, neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trimmed, and exquiſitely adorned with Claſpes and Knots of Silver, Gold, and precious Stones, which made out the Eſteem that people had, for the lying impoſtures of their Prophet.</p>
            <p>Many Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> became Suitors to <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> for one of thoſe Books to adorn their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries: but he refuſed, and cauſing a great fire to be made, expoſed them all to the fury of the devouring flames, except few that treated of Phyſick, and had been found among the Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans. Taking from theſe new Converts thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which might renew the memory of the Errors in which they had lived moſt part of their time. So frail, and ſo fickle is our nature in good actions, that our progreſs in the way of vertue, is like that of Boats againſt the ſtream of a rapid Torrent, which fall back in one hour more than they advance in a whole day: This was not enough to contain them within the bounds of their duty, ſome ſighed for their loſt liberty, others relapſed into their old ſuperſtitions, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50543:35"/>
taking up Arms, reſolved to force their way to both, by fire and ſword. <hi>Ximenes</hi> who was yet in <hi>Granada,</hi> ſtood the ſhock, and bearing up bravely in a Sea of troubles that ſurrounded him, ſends an Expreſs to the King: And for better diſpatch, a Gentleman of Quality of the ſame City offered him an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Slave, ſo nimble and ſwift of foot, that he would travell fifty Leagues a day. But the brutiſh Sot having received the Pacquet, inſtead of making haſte, overcharged himſelf ſo with Wine and Victuals at the ſecond Inn he met with by the way, that he ſlept there till the morrow after: and he, who ſhould have been in two dayes at <hi>Sevil,</hi> where the Court then was, made it five ere he arrived there. In the mean time, the King had intelligence of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Granada</hi> from them, who envying the greatneſs of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> took care to ſend better Courriers than the <hi>Ethiopian:</hi> and informed the King, that <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who through a raſh and undiſcreet zeal, would have converted to Chriſtianity in a moment, men who were not only born and had lived, but were for the moſt part grown old in the Profeſſion of Mahometiſm, had loſt the Realm of <hi>Granada</hi>: That he was utterly incapable to manage matters of State, who propoſed and made uſe of no other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements, to win over his Converts to ſubmit their necks to the yoke of a new Government, than the headſtrong Capricchio's of his violent fancy, and the rigorous Auſterities he had pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in a Cloiſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> believes them, and remembring <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> had been introduced into Court, and his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50543:36"/>
Conduct extolled by the Queen his Wife; goes to her Lodgings, and all in a flame. See now, Madam, (ſayes he)! the Triumphs of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and our own, purchaſed with the blood of the Nobles of <hi>Spain,</hi> ruined in a moment, by the humourſome follies of your <hi>Ximenes! Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> by this time, had intelligence from his friends of the negligence of the <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> and the ſenſe of the Court; he acknowledges his fault to entruſt the ſottiſhneſs of ſuch a Brute, with an Affair of ſo great Importance: And reſolved for the future, never to ſend Courriers on the like Occurrences, but ſuch as were perſons of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and honeſt Repute; which he obſerved, making it his cuſtom, to honour and load with Preſents, ſuch whom he imployed in diſpatches of Conſequence.</p>
            <p>To retrive this miſcarriage, and remedy the preſent diſorder of his Affairs, he diſpatched <hi>Roiiys</hi> his Companion of the Order, to inform their Majeſties of the Cauſes of the Revolt, and the Remedies he had applyed. The good eſtate of <hi>Granada,</hi> quenched the fire of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> anger and diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Ximenes,</hi> and drew from him Letters of thanks to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> for his great expence for the good of the publick, in reſtoring peace to <hi>Granada</hi>; and the dangers he expoſed himſelf to, to ſave his Cities from ruine, and the Kingdom from deſtruction. A Miniſter of State who labours with integrity to ſerve his Majeſty, ought by good Actions and patience, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Envy and Calumnies of his Enemies, which like thin miſts are eaſily diſſipated; and being built on the ſandy foundations of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood,

            <p>THE watchings and labours <hi>Ximenes</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, to ſuppreſs the Tumults of <hi>Granada,</hi> had impaired his health into a Hectick Feavour; ſo malignant, that the Phyſitians could find no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for it. A <hi>Moriſeo</hi>-woman converted by him, hears of this, and ſends him another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the ſame Nation, to deſire permiſſion to cure his Feavour; which being granted her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eight dayes by the uſe of Oyntments, and ſome words ſhe recited, ſhe reſtored him to perfect health. This enabled him to go to <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> to ſalute the Princeſs <hi>Joan,</hi> Daughter and Heireſs of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabel,</hi> together with <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Auſtrich</hi> her Husband, and Son to the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who were lately come to <hi>Spain.</hi> And thence to viſit that glorious Temple of the <hi>Muſes,</hi> his Colledge of <hi>Arcala,</hi> the love of Learning being inſeparable from his ſoul: inſomuch that in the year 1502. in order to the Explication and Imprinting of the Holy Scriptures in Latine, Greek, Hebrew and Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee, by perſons of knowledge and skill in thoſe Tongues at his charge in that City; he bought up all the Manuſcript Bibles he could hear of; and cauſed moſt exact and correct Impreſſions to be made thereof in thoſe Languages. Seven Hebrew Copies coſt him four thouſand Crowns; the Latine and Greek Manuſcripts, being eight

hundred years old, amounted to a greater ſumm: beſides a vaſt expence for maintenance and Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Profeſſors of thoſe Languages, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors and Printers for fifteen years. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to inſtruct the Prieſts in the Truths of the two Teſtaments, and to leave the Church theſe Lights of the Holy Scriptures in their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal purity. As if he had foreſeen, that a few years after the perfection of this work, Hereſie would ariſe, by falſe interpretation of Scripture; to attacque the purity of Chriſtian Doctrine. And therefore he provided this Impreſſion, as a well furniſhed Armoury, to defend the Church againſt the malice of her Enemies. This great and painfull work being finiſhed; and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſenting him with the firſt Copy of it; with eyes and hands lift up for joy to Heaven, My God, ſaid he, I return thee immortal thanks, for granting my deſires of good ſucceſs to this work. Then turning to his Domeſtiques who were moſt familiar with him; 'Tis true, ſaid he, my friends, that God hath been pleaſed to crown my Labours with ſucceſs, in many important Affairs for the good of the State; but there is not any thing, in which ye ought to rejoyce with me more, than for the happy accompliſhment of this Impreſſion and Explication of the Bible in the four Languages.</p>
            <p>He had deſigned alſo a Tranſlation of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s works, and to adorn them, ſuitable to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the ſubject. And certainly, ſince he thus revived good Literature; 'tis but juſt, Learning ſhould raiſe him to life again; and that the <hi>Muſes</hi> give immortality to his Name: for he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50543:37"/>
who labours for them, ought in recompence of his Travels, to receive from them the <hi>Auguſte</hi> priviledge of never dying.</p>
            <p>Much about this time, <hi>Joan</hi> Heireſs of <hi>Spain</hi> was delivered of her ſecond Son at <hi>Arcala. Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> layes hold of the opportunity, for the glory of his Colledge: and by the favour of this birth, obtained for that City (which he had made an habitation of the <hi>Muſes</hi>) exemption from Taxes and all manner of Impoſitions. The inhabitants of <hi>Arcala</hi> in memory of the favour, keep to this day, the Cradle of that Prince; and bleſs the name of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who procured it. As he went out of his Lodgings the ſame day, he met the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Juſtice leading a Malefactor to the Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet; he ſtops them, and grants the wretched Criminal, Pardon. Telling them, that though it was an Action beyond his Authority, yet ſo much ought to be allowed his Dignity, to hinder that day of general Joy to all <hi>Spain,</hi> from being Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital to an Inhabitant of <hi>Arcala.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, he built a Colledge for Maids of honeſt Families, whom Poverty kept in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: and adjoyned to it a Nunnery for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of ſuch, who were inclined to bid farewell to the world; with Proviſion, that none ſhould be taken into it, but ſuch as came volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily; and as for thoſe who deſired to continue ſecular, beſides the vertuous breeding of the Colledge, he gave them honourable portions, and diſpoſed of them in Marriage according to their conditions.

               </gap>ffered him a Jewell at 5000. Crowns, and preſſed him much to buy it; though the price put upon it, exceeded far the value of the Stone. <hi>Ximenes</hi> liked well the neat glittering and ſparkling brightneſs of the Jewel; but I know, ſayes he, to beſtow the money better: for in an urgent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity I can relieve 5000. Souldiers with Crowns apiece; his Levies for the Wars of <hi>Africk</hi> being then afoot.</p>
            <p>The year 1505 <hi>Spain</hi> had great loſs by the death of Queen <hi>Iſabel,</hi> the Moſt Illuſtious Princeſs of her Age; no leſs Eminent for acquired habits of Goodneſs, than Royal Extraction; being as worthily adorned with the Crowns of Vertue, as legally Crowned with the Diadem of <hi>Spain</hi>; a Princeſs of Knowledge, Piety and Generoſity above the uſual Capacity of her Sex. She who had obſerved in <hi>Ximenes</hi> the Eminence of Rare Conduct, attended with ſingular integrity, made him Executor of her Laſt Will and Teſtament: which was but a drop of that Ocean of honour thoſe qualities procured him, which rendered him ſo venerable in the State, that never Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was ſo much honoured in his life, ſo much deſired and miſſed after his death. Every time he came to wait on his Maſter <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the King went out of his Chamber to meet him, and at parting, brought him to the Chamber-door: nor would he ſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:50543:38"/>
So powerful are great Vertues, as to obliege even the Scepters of the World to reverence them. That Miniſter who is prudent and Generous, whoſe deſignes tend only to the glory of his Maſter, and good of the publick, deſerves the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of Guardian-Angel of the State, and ought to be honoured as ſuch by every one.</p>
            <p>The death of <hi>Iſabel</hi> gave <hi>Ximenes</hi> occaſion to do <hi>Ferdinand</hi> good Service in <hi>Spain,</hi> and to give new proofs of the greatneſs of his Conduct: <hi>Iſabel</hi> who was Queen of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> had by her Teſtament made <hi>Ferdinand</hi> her Husband, (who was only King of <hi>Arragon</hi>) Adminiſtrator general of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Caſtile: Philip</hi> his Son in Law, husband, as was ſaid, of the ſole Heireſs of that Kingdom, had other deſignes; and by the inſtigation of ſome Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> and preſuming upon the amity of <hi>France,</hi> intended to dethrone his Father in Law, and take poſſeſſion of <hi>Caſtile</hi> as the inheritance of his Wife. He was at that time in <hi>Flanders</hi> with <hi>Joan,</hi> about whom <hi>Ximenes</hi> had placed ſome perſons of truſt, by whom ſhe informed him of the deſignes of her Husband to trouble <hi>Spain:</hi> and the ill uſage ſhe had from him; for his Love to the Flemmiſh Ladies had divided the Husband and Wife, and filled their Breaſts with Jealouſie and hatred of each other: <hi>Joan</hi> writes to her Father the threats of <hi>Philip,</hi> to drive him out of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> contrary to the Teſtament of the Queen her Mother; <hi>Philip</hi> ſurprizes <hi>Lopez Couitrilla, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>'s Embaſſadour, with ſeveral Letters about him; and without reſpect to his perſon, cauſed him to be impriſoned. <hi>Ximenes</hi> advertiſed of theſe threats and violences, adviſes the Remedy,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50543:39"/>
for <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s ſervice; he knew <hi>Philip</hi> had Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations afoot in <hi>France</hi> to ſollicite the Aid of that Court againſt his Father in Law. <hi>Ximenes</hi> ſteps in, and prevents it, adviſes <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to a ſtrict Alliance on that ſide, and to take to Wife <hi>Germain de Foix,</hi> Niece to <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth.</p>
            <p>The Marriage was accompliſhed, and <hi>Philip</hi> ſurprized to ſee himſelf abandoned by them from whom he promiſed himſelf the greateſt ſuccour, was forced to a Treaty of Accommodation with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and agree to him the Adminiſtration of the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> reſerving to himſelf the honour only of being named joyntly with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in all Letters Patents. This Agreement quieted the Affairs of <hi>Spain,</hi> though not long. <hi>Philip</hi> comes thither with <hi>Joan</hi> his Wife, viſits the Cities of the Kingdom, and acts as ſole Maſter of it without ſeeing <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his Wife to ſee him: <hi>Ferdinand</hi> though his Father in Law longs to ſee <hi>Philip,</hi> and follows him from place to place, but <hi>Philip</hi> flees from him, till <hi>Ximenes</hi> by his prudence procured an Interview. <hi>Philip</hi> inſtigated by the great ones, deſirous of novelties, and envying the Authority of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> appeared at the enterview in the Equippage of Conqueſt and Triumph, not like a Son to meet his Father, but marching with ſix thouſand Warriers at his heels; <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had only two hundred men of his houſhold and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and mounted on Mules. But this Flemiſh Bravado laſted not long; the ſage Advice of <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> made it vaniſh; he goes to <hi>Philip</hi> at <hi>Burges,</hi> ſhews him the injury he did himſelf to ſow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in a State belonging to him; that to raiſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50543:39"/>
Warr in <hi>Spain,</hi> was to Aſſault his own Houſe; that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had only the Adminiſtration of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and ſerved only to keep it, and improve it for him; that the Counſels given him, tended to his ruine; that Don <hi>John Manuel</hi> his great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident and Prime man of his Council, was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon intereſſed, and for his own advantage foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diviſions between him and his Father in Law; that it concerned him in point of intereſt, and for his own good to remove <hi>Manuel</hi> by ſome honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Employment; that an Embaſſy to <hi>Rome</hi> would be very fit for the purpoſe. To remove from a Prince a pernicious favourite, is to rid a Sick man of his Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>And becauſe this Enterview is a principal piece of our Story, I thought fit to give you the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable particulars. <hi>Philip</hi> going to meet <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> had on his right hand <hi>Ximenes</hi> (who went to him at <hi>Burges</hi>) and on his left Don <hi>Manuel</hi> his High Treaſurer; thoſe of his Court were in Armour, and marched in a poſture of Warr; <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinands</hi> followers ridd on Mules, as men of peace, with Cloaks and Swords only; the Principal Courtiers having forſaken him to attend <hi>Philip,</hi> verified the old obſervation, that Courtiers adore the riſing Sun. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> meeting the Troops of his Son in Law, made a halt on a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle riſing Ground to give them way: this place he choſe as fitteſt in his judgement, (one of the ſageſt of his time) to view and contemplate the diſloyalty of the Court, having of purpoſe taken up his ſtanding in a narrow place, where all thoſe who had abandoned him to go to <hi>Philip,</hi> muſt of neceſſity paſs cloſe by him: And of them the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50543:40"/>
Duke of <hi>Najar</hi> firſt preſented himſelf, mounted in Armour on a Spaniſh Jennet, as for a day of Battel; his Page carryed his Lance, and one of his Captains led a Troop of men at Arms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him: Duke, ſayes <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> you are ready for a Combat, you alwayes carry a ſpice of the Captain. It is, Anſwered the Duke, to ſerve the King our Soveraign Lord, and your Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The next that came up, was <hi>Garcia de la Vega</hi> Lord of <hi>Cnerva,</hi> who had been Embaſſadour from <hi>Ferdinand</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and graced with his favours in a large meaſure; <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> a perfect Maſter of the Art of Diſſimulation (commonly called the Art of Reigning) perceived by the Bunching of his Cloaths that he wore cloſe Armour underneath, and Embracing him ſaid, <hi>Garcia,</hi> you were not ſo Groſs a few dayes ago, you are grown fat on the ſudden.</p>
            <p>Theſe Embraces and Courteſies, were ſmart Reproofs, and cutting Exprobrations of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude; and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> experimented in them, that if the good fortune of the Court hath few ſure Friends, the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll fortune of it hath much fewer. <hi>Philip</hi> upon the fight of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> would have alighted, but <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſpurting his Male, prayed him not to Diſmount; <hi>Philip</hi> with Hat in Hand, deſired <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Hand to Kiſs; <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſpreads his Armes and Embraces him. <hi>Spain</hi> is ſo ſtored with Caſtles and fair Countrey-houſes, that in all that Road there was not one fit for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the two Kings which forced them to entertain one another in an Ermitage; <hi>Ximenes</hi> followed them in, and ſo did Don <hi>Manuel, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> Favourite. <hi>Ximenes</hi> ſeeing him enter, ſayes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50543:40"/>
to him; Don <hi>John,</hi> their Majeſties would be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, Let's withdraw, I will be Porter, and keep the door for this time. <hi>Manuel</hi> goes out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſpleaſed; <hi>Ximenes</hi> re-enters, and having ſhut the Door, ſits down with the Kings: <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nands</hi> Counſels to <hi>Philip</hi> were the only entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Princes, which were to this effect.</p>
            <p>My Son, the weight of a Crown is ſo great, that a good King cannot bear it without help; and the Government of people requires ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual care and inceſſant travels, that a Prince hath need of eaſe by perſons of fidelity, and capable to manage publick affairs; and herein the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Princes is remarkable, that they find few who mind more the honour of the State than their own profit, or ſtudy the intereſt of their Maſter, more than their own private advantages. Take heed therefore, my Son, that you grant not to them you honour with your good will, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Favourites) any thing to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the people over whom God hath inveſted you with Soverain Authority, whereof you muſt make good uſe, and render him one day an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and undergo the ſentence of an exact im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Juſtice, and abide the ſeverity of its Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Think not that ſuch men are called without cauſe, the Leeches of the Court, who hanging ſtill at the Eares of their Prince, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to their Benefactour, have by their inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable avarice, baſe flattery, and monſtrous ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude merited thoſe names of infamy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the vices they are infected with. I had deſigned to have aſſiſted you in the diſcharge of your Office, knowing your Youth unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50543:41"/>
in the Government of Kingdoms; but ſince the great ones of <hi>Caſtile</hi> have perſwaded you to the contrary, I will retire, and confine my cares to the Governmens of the States, ſubject to the Crowns God hath given me: but ſhall make it my Prayer to God to give you the Graces, and Forces neceſſary for great Kings; and during my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from you I leave you another Father, who will be of no leſs uſe to you, than if I were with you in perſon, I mean my Lord Arch-biſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> here preſent; the many proofs, and evident teſtimonies I have had of his fidelity and experience give me cauſe to Aſſure you that a King cannot be wrecked in the Government of his State, where he ſits at the helm. May you believe his ſage ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and gather the ſame fruits from his conduct as have given my name and that of Queen <hi>Iſabel</hi> the reputation and glory of having happily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned <hi>Spain</hi>; and to the inhabitants of theſe Kingdoms the felicity they enjoy.</p>
            <p>After this Enterview, the Kings parted. <hi>Philip</hi> went to dinner at <hi>Bimo, Ferdinand</hi> at <hi>Remefid,</hi> and <hi>Simenes</hi> at <hi>Requete,</hi> three little villages with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half a league of the Ermitage; but the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of accommodation, was on <hi>Philip's</hi> part, as feaſted before dinner with the Royal Collation of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> entertainment: For the Sage advice, for the Government of a Kingdom, is a true ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Prince's ſpirit.</p>
            <p>The affairs of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> were at this time carried according to the paſſion of the high Treaſurer Don <hi>John Manuel, Philips</hi> favorite; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Kingdom which is the blood of the people ſquandered away by him; which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50543:41"/>
highly diſpleaſed <hi>Ximenes</hi>: It hapned one day that <hi>Bertrand</hi> de <hi>Salto</hi> one of the Kings Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who had formerly treated with <hi>Ximenes</hi> about ſeveral affairs, in reſpect to him came to let him know, that the King by advice of <hi>Don Mannel</hi> had farmed out the Revenue of the Silks of <hi>Granada</hi> for ten years at a price; and that he had the Charters in his hand ready drawn, to be delivered to the Seal; <hi>Ximenes</hi> reads them, and obſerving that they were much to the damage of the King, tore them in pieces; and gave the pieces to a page of his Chamber, who ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, which are kept to this day among the records of <hi>Arcala,</hi> for a monument of the coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious liberty of this Miniſter: then turning to the Treaſurer, <hi>Salto,</hi> ſaid he, were you not one of my friends, the King ſhould cauſe your head to be taken off: Dare you make Grants ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the State? Then going to the Palace, he informed <hi>Philip</hi> of this diſorder, and forced him to confeſs, they had ſurprized him.</p>
            <p>This Prince began to reliſh the excellency of <hi>Ximenes</hi> counſels and fully reſolved to live for the future in better correſpondence with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> but was ſuddenly taken with a great ſickneſs which with his life ended his troubles.</p>

               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was then in his voyage for <hi>Naples</hi> his new Conqueſt; the Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> aſſembled in <hi>Ximenes</hi> Chamber to conſult about the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Caſtile</hi>: divers opinions were hotly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. The Conſtable, the Admiral, and the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> adviſed to ſend ſpeedily after King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> then at Sea, and to deſire his return into <hi>Spain</hi> to take the Government upon him.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50543:42"/>
The Earl of <hi>Benevent,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Villena,</hi> and the Dukes of <hi>Infantado,</hi> and <hi>Najar,</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted this advice with ſo much paſſion, that they came to high words with thoſe that propoſed it. <hi>Ximenes</hi> who had been all this while ſilent the better to diſcover the intention of both parties, to prevent danger to the State by this Rupture, and Divorce of Opinions, and by Amuſing the paſſion of the four laſt to divert and fruſtrate their deſigns of trouble, ſpake as followeth; My Lords, King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> hath ruled theſe Kingdoms above forty years, 'tis now high time he ſhould govern his own; ſince God hath given <hi>Caſtile</hi> men capable to Govern it; and ſuch as can give a good account of their Actions. The Aſſembly by common conſent choſe <hi>Ximenes,</hi> the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Najar,</hi> as a Triumnivat to Govern the State, to be Guardians to the Queen, and Tutors to Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Charles</hi> the fift. <hi>Ximenes</hi> informs the King of theſe paſſages; and believing him to be then at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> beſeeches him to return into <hi>Caſtile.</hi> But the Courrier ſound him at the Iſle of <hi>Isbice</hi>; and that having given <hi>Italy</hi> Advice of his voyage he held himſelf obliged to perform it. But in truth his vehement deſires to ſee <hi>Gonſalves</hi> outed from <hi>Naples,</hi> being the main occaſion of the voyage, would not permit him to return till he had ſeen it done. Therefore he writ to <hi>Ximenes</hi> to govern <hi>Spain</hi> in the mean time with the fidelity and integrity he alwayes found in him.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Ximenes</hi> reſolves to ſit alone at the Helm; and notwithſtanding the reſolutions of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Aſſembly is by the Council-Royal choſen ſole

Guardian of the State, the Queen and the Infant <hi>Charles:</hi> he puts himſelf immediately into the Poſture of Governour of the Kingdom, Raiſes and Armes Regiments of Horſe and Foot for the Guards of the Princes and his own: The Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of <hi>Spain</hi> aſtoniſhed to ſee a man bred in a Cloyſter uſe force, and have recourſe to Armes for Authoriſing his Conduct, blamed him as a light ſpirited perſon; But he who knew of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it was to Awe the factious, and have forces in readineſs to ſuppreſs innovations gave them leave to talk, but proſecuted his deſign. Queen <hi>Joan</hi> by the Travails of Child-birth, or rather (as 'tis ſaid) by the Charmes, and Inchantments with ſome poyſonous druggs given her by a Flemiſh Lady, King <hi>Philips</hi> Miſtreſs had a great weakneſs in her ſenſes, and was much diſordered in her rational faculty. This made her wander up and down the Countries, quitting <hi>B — Burgos</hi>; and great with Child taking a Journey to the Burrough of <hi>Benferriale</hi> where ſhe was delivered of the <hi>Poſthumous</hi> Princeſs <hi>Catharine</hi> afterwards marryed to the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> While ſhe lay In, the Citizens of <hi>Medina</hi> took up Armes, and being divided into two parties, had brought the City to the brink of deſtruction: the Province of <hi>Granada</hi> was up in Armes at the ſame time, and the Guards of the Sea-coſte, from Guards to Defend were become Enemies to Aſſault the Countrey: <hi>Ximenes</hi> by his prudence oppoſed the one, contented the other, and made all quiet again. Yet he was not in quiet, for the Queen after Child-birth having recovered her ſtrength, but not her ſenſes, made him follow her through
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50543:43"/>
the Countrey to his great inconvenience by the incommodities he underwent, in an Age fitter for repoſe, than the Fatigues of the Court. This Princeſs could not be perſwaded to Lodge any where but in the fields, with the whole Court in Tents or in the Countrey Villages. <hi>Ximenes</hi> put her in mind how incommodious this was for her, and and what diſorder ſhe put the whole Court in for want of Lodgings; She anſwered, a Widdow ought not to go into Towns, but wander in the Fields, and live in Villages. Thus ſhe paſt from one Village to another, carrying with her the body of her dead Husband <hi>Philip</hi> embalmed, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying ſhe enjoyed his Perſon by the ſight of his Carcaſe, and cauſing it to be laid in the Pariſh Church of every Village ſhe Lodged in, with a Guard to keep conſtant Watch at the Coffin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſtrict charge not to permit a Woman to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it. So Jealous was ſhe of a body without life, and incapable then to raiſe theſe paſſions in the beholders which he had cauſed in his life time, being poſſeſſed of thoſe natural beauties, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with goodneſs ſo excellent, which charmed Ladies affections into a paſſionate Longing, and men into an intire Love for him. This Princeſs fool'd with the Love of a Lump of dead fleſh, would by no means part with it till <hi>Ferdinand</hi> her Father returned from <hi>Italy,</hi> cauſed it to be taken from her, and buryed privately. The jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys ſhe made were Noctural, by Torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; which occaſioned many inconveniences by ſickneſs amongſt her retinue; Loſs of her Baggage and falls of thoſe on Horſe-back. <hi>Ximenes</hi> threw himſelf at her feet and begged on his Knees that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50543:43"/>
ſince ſhe was reſolved to make the Court Errant and Itinerary, ſhe would at leaſt Travel by day, but ſhe Wedded to her folly, anſwered, That a Woman having loſt her Husband, which is her Son, ought to avoid the light of the Sun in the Firmament, and make no journeys, but by night. The art of a skilful Pilot is often of no uſe amidſt the fury of the Windes and Waves: And the prudence and conduct of a Miniſter of State are thrown away upon ſuch Soveraings as are inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of good Advice.</p>
            <p>During theſe extravagancies of Queen <hi>Joan, Ferdinand</hi> returned from <hi>Italy</hi> with <hi>Germain de Foix</hi> his new Wife; and tooke a voyage by Sea, to <hi>Savona,</hi> to ſee his Wives Uncle King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth; while he ſtaid in <hi>Italy</hi> he obtained of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond a Cardinals Cap for <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> with the Tytle of Cardinal of <hi>Spain</hi>; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given to <hi>Peter,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Triaſio,</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and then to <hi>Peter Gonſalve</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Mendoza,</hi> under <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> in token of the Popes eſpecial favour. So that in the ſequel of our Story we ſhall call <hi>Ximenes</hi> by the name of Cardinal. Together with this dignity he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that of Inquiſitor General of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> for the Inquiſition had of long time got firm footing in <hi>Spain,</hi> having been introduced by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabel,</hi> in the year 1577. by reaſon of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Moors with Chriſtians, and the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the former, deeply rooted in the heart of that Kingdom. The Rigour of this Eccleſiaſtical Juſtice ſtruck terrour into ill Chriſtians, but was ſo far from making them better, that it rendred them only more ſubtle and refined Hypocrites.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50543:44"/>
Cardinal <hi>Mendoza</hi> was his immediate Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour in that Office, and <hi>Thomas Torquemata</hi> ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of the Covent of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> at <hi>Segovia</hi> the firſt that bore it. Theſe new honours alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the manners of <hi>Ximenes</hi>; the Love of Learning and Advancement of vertue had ſtill the ſame place in his ſoul, and were Continued in their former Station. He finiſhed his Colledge of <hi>Arcala,</hi> conſtituted Laws and made Statutes for the regulation of it, filled it with able Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours drawn from the famous Univerſities of <hi>Paris, Salamanca, Valadolid, Bologina,</hi> admitting none from meaner places; endowing it with great Revenues, adorned it with a rich Library, and brought it to ſuch perfection that <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt of <hi>France</hi> paſſing that way (when the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of Warr made him experimentally know good luck doth not alwayes attend the valorous) and ſeeing this admirable Colledge, ſaid, that his Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> was the work of many Kings; but <hi>Ximenes</hi> alone had Compleated a Royal work: <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Emperour being one day to hear Maſs in the Colledge at <hi>Arcala,</hi> quitted the Chair, and Cloth of State pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him at the high Altar, and took his place in the Quire, in the ordinary Seats of the Prieſts of the Colledge being for the moſt part publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours; and all of them Learned men, telling them; he would not loſe the glory of ſitting that day among men of ſo great Learning, and making one of the Quire with them. Such are the fruits of great Miniſters, Labours for vertue and the publick good; future Ages reverence their names; the Greateſt Kings of the world

            <p>THE Spirit of <hi>Ximenes</hi> was not only great and high, but Comprehenſive and Capable of all Affairs, thoſe of Warr as well as peace found it a proper receptacle to entertain them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The ſame time that his thoughts were buſily taken up with impreſſion of Books founding Monaſteries building Colledges, endowing them with Revenues, and furniſhing them with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents and Students he had in proſpect the Warr of <hi>Africk,</hi> formed deſignes and made preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for it. When the Kingdom enjoyed a Secure peace, and flouriſhed in a deep repoſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed tranquility, he Levied Soldiers, iſſued Commiſſions, and provided moneys for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Aſſurance of the State. It was his Maxime That the Spirits of men being naturally free, cannot endure ſervitude and ſubjection; but of force, and compelled by neceſſity; and he would often ſay, That never Prince was feared abroad, or honoured at home that had not levyed an Army, and at leaſt made all the preparatives requiſite to carry on a Warr.</p>
            <p>The deſire of extending Chriſtianity into <hi>Africk,</hi> and to free <hi>Spain</hi> from the incurſions and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50543:45"/>
Robberies of the Pyrats of that Countrey who were grown ſo bold as to Enter the Spaniſh Ports to Spoil and carry away the Veſſels of Traffick engaged him in the enterprize of a Warr of ſuch Conſequence. There was at that time in the Court of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> a Venetian named <hi>Jerome Vianelli</hi> well verſed in the Voyages of <hi>Africk,</hi> having often Sailed thoſe Seas, that he knew per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly all the Ports, and ſafe Landing places on the Coaſt; This man had intelligence of <hi>Ximenes</hi> deſign, goes to him, informs him of all the Avenues of the Coaſt, and particularly the great Port of <hi>Merſalcabir</hi> near <hi>Oran,</hi> capable to receive a very great Fleet: <hi>Ximenes</hi> hearkens to him, and finding him ſerviceable for his deſignes, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he would ſee him often, and commanded his Porters to admit him at all times, and give him Entrance as often as he deſired it. By the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant mode of Courts, it hath been alwayes diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to get entrance to great Miniſters of State; which Cuſtome, as it preſerves them from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite trouble of importunate perſons; ſo it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives them of the knowledge of many perſons of merit and worth, whoſe generoſity will not permit them to begg admittance from Servants, and leave to enter from Grooms and Porters: And 'tis ſeldome ſeen that the perſons imployed in theſe Services either keep out the former, or admit the latter to their Maſters preſence. <hi>Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelli</hi> having the priviledge of free acceſs to <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> viſits him often, and acquaints him with what he had ſeen in <hi>Africk: Ximenes</hi> the better to comprehend what he ſaid, commands him not only to make a draught in Paper, but to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50543:45"/>
imprint in Wax the figures of the places. By this repreſentation he ſaw a Caſtle ſcituate on a Rock almoſt inacceſſible, having a Lanthorn on one of the Towres, not unlike the Grecian Phares to ſerve Marriners for a mark of direction how to ſteer their Courſe in dark nights, to ſafe Harbour. This Caſtle had on one ſide the Port of <hi>Merſalcabir,</hi> and on the other, the City <hi>Oran</hi>; called by the Moors <hi>Guharran,</hi> which in their Languge ſignifies a high place, and expoſed to the Windes. The Etymology may be derived from the Greek Verb <hi>Oran,</hi> which in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſignifies to ſee: the height of the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gives an excellent proſpect. It was in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time a little Burrough, but by frequency of Commerce and Traffick of Merchants, was now grown to the greatneſs of a City, encloſing within the Walls, ſix thouſand Houſes, ſeveral Moſques and Colledges, ſome Hoſpitals, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of publick baths. The Sea waſhes it on one ſide, the other ſide affords an excellent proſpect over delicate Gardens, and pleaſant Fountains, ſo plentifully embelliſhing the Countrey therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, that it Courts the ſpectators to taſte of its pleaſures.</p>
            <p>By the draught and repreſentations of <hi>Vianelli, Ximenes</hi> found it neceſſary in order to an Attempt on <hi>Africk</hi> to make himſelf maſter of <hi>Merſalcabir,</hi> as the ſafeſt Port for entrance. Having thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected a deſign for the good of Religion, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Spain,</hi> he propoſed the Execution to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> adviſing him to undertake the Warr, as an enterprize he made appear no leſs profitable then Glorious. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> anſwered, that the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50543:46"/>
intereſt of Religion was ſo inſeparable from that of his Crown, that if there had been no Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to incline him to ingage in this Warr, but the ſole advantage to accrew to Religion, the piety of the deſign was Motive enough to prevail with him to undertake it; but that the vaſt Charges he had been at, in the Warrs of <hi>Granada,</hi> and his great expences in <hi>Italy,</hi> had emptyed his Coffers, and exhauſted his Treaſures, which are the Sinnews of War; and without which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be maintained. <hi>Ximenes</hi> offers him money, and Promiſes to Pay the Soldiers, and Victual the Army for ſix Moneths; ſo great a Maſs of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure had this generous Prelate by frugal parſimony heaped up together from the Revenues of his Biſhoprick: Upon this Offer, the Warr againſt <hi>Africk</hi> was reſolved on; a Naval Army prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and <hi>Diego Fernand de Cordova,</hi> made Captain General, who took with him ſeveral old, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Commanders; particularly <hi>Raymond Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Vice-Admiral of the Fleet, and <hi>Diego de Vera,</hi> Maſter of the Artillery; <hi>Vianelli</hi> was a principal perſon amongſt them, as a guide to the Reſt.

The King of <hi>Tremeſen</hi> ſent them a Succour of <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Numidians</hi> to raiſe the Siege, but they were defeated by the valour of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> Thoſe of the Caſtle made ſtout defence, till an unlucky accident quailed their Courage: The Captain of the Garriſon, a man of Valour and Repute among his Souldiers, going round the Works to give Orders where neceſſary, was ſtruck dead upon the place, with a Muſquet ſhot out of a Spaniſh Ship. The Loſs of this man aſtoniſhed the Garriſon, and brought them to a Parley, and promiſe of Surrender, if they received not a more powerful Succour from <hi>Tremeſen</hi> in three dayes: three dayes paſſed, but no Succour came; they deſired three dayes more, which was granted, but no Succour appearing, they yielded upon Terms of ſafety for the Lives of Men, Women and Children; and liberty to enjoy what they could carry on their backs; which being agreed to by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they opened their Gates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diego Fernand</hi> a Religious obſerver of his Word and Promiſes, to ſee the Articles of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation performed, ſtands at the Gates where the <hi>Moors</hi> paſſed out of the Caſtle. A Soldier caſting his eye on an <hi>African</hi> Woman in the Crowd laden with the Riches of Fortune and Nature being extreamly handſome and Carrying with her the moſt precious of her Goods, was violently hurryed by the blind paſſions of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and Love to Rob and Raviſh her; <hi>Diego</hi> forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſeized him, and cauſed him immediately to be killed with puſh of Pike.</p>

            <p>The taking of the Caſtle of <hi>Merſalcabir</hi> ſtrook ſuch terrour into the inhabitants of <hi>Oran,</hi> that many left the City and retyred to <hi>Tremeſen:</hi> But <hi>Oran</hi> continuing for ſome time free from the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of <hi>Spain</hi> they took the reſolution to return; and being on their way near the Town, they met a <hi>Moor</hi> of the beſt quality and State in <hi>Oran,</hi> on his way from thence to <hi>Tremiſen,</hi> with a Camel laden with Gold upon ſight whereof they were ſeized with ſuch a panique fear, that they turned again for <hi>Tremiſen</hi>; So powerful are Riches to Attract men to the place of their reſidence.

But amongſt others, 'tis remarkable that after the Warrs of <hi>Granada,</hi> a Prince of the Blood-Royal of the <hi>Moors</hi> named <hi>Zegri,</hi> neer <hi>Kinſman</hi> to the famous King <hi>Abenamar</hi> having

            <p>To reſume our Diſcourſe of the Cardinals Enemies, they were very Comical in the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their Envy, ſaying at Court that the great Captain was buſie turning over his Beads at <hi>Valladolid,</hi> while the Cardinal was commanding Armies.

And that 'twas no new thing to ſee Prieſts on Horſe-back in the head of an Army: Others who pretended to a clearer inſight into th' Affairs of Court, and uſed to Comment upon the News of the time, ſaid, it was the Cardinals deſign to ſend away all the Nobles of <hi>Spain,</hi> into the Warrs of <hi>Africk,</hi> that he might Govern at home without Contradiction. That he could not be better fitted for puniſhment than to grant him his deſire of being General of the Army, and ſending him over into <hi>Africk,</hi> and ſo remove him from Court, <hi>For then out of ſight out of mind.</hi> The buſineſs of Government is very painful and difficult, that great Miniſters beſides prudence in Conduct have need of a Generous patience

to reſiſt the Envy and Calumnies of the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> who knew the integrity of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal (better than all the world beſide) judged more equitably, heard his Advice, weighed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and embraced it, gave him thanks that for the good of Religion, and Service of his Kingdoms, he would expoſe himſelf to the toyles and hazards of Warr in an Age that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired nothing more than the repoſe and quiet of peace; the Cardinal being then ſeventy years old: <hi>Ferdinand</hi> commands the Captain of the Gallies, and the Admiral, to fit up the Gallies and Veſſels of the Kingdom, to be ready at <hi>Malaga,</hi> or <hi>Nova Carthagena</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Cardinal ſhould direct. The Captains of the Ships, the Officers of the Marine, the Commiſſaries of Victuals, and of the Army betake themſelves every man to the duty of his charge, with great diligence and expedition to fit and make ready the Veſſels, Men, Victuals and Ammunition.</p>
            <p>The great <hi>Gonſalve</hi> adviſed the Cardinal to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in this Warr <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Navarr</hi> Earl of <hi>Olivarez</hi> a perſon of quality, valour and experience, and to make him his Lieutenant General of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: The Cardinal upon his Recommendation calls <hi>Navarr</hi> to him; and makes him Lieutenant General. On the other ſide the Commiſſaries for Victuals, and thoſe of the Navy, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers and Paymaſters of the Soldiers, either guided by the Cardinals Enemies, or loving <hi>Spain</hi> more than Voyages into <hi>Africk,</hi> ſlacken their former diligence, and to their utmoſt power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the fitting of the Fleet, by diverting the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50543:50"/>
Soldiers pay to other uſes and conſuming the Bisket provided for the Ships: The Counſellors of ſtate oppoſed the Cardinal in his Diſcourſes of the Warr, and advice for ſetting out the fleet, alledging the Winter ſeaſon was too rigorous and not yet over; when Winter was paſt, they ſaid the heat of Summer drew on, and would be more inſupportable to the Soldiers, than the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of the <hi>Moors:</hi> The Army this while moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred away, and was like in ſhort time to come to nothing. The Cardinal had beat his Drumms throughout <hi>Spain,</hi> and made <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi> ring of his deſign. The preparations he had made were great, and if not attended with ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ſuitable, would have proved the travels of the Mountains that brought forth a Mouſe. All the World was againſt him, only the King had not declared himſelf upon the advices given him. He Addreſſed himſelf to the King by a Letter from <hi>Carthagene,</hi> intreated him by the many travels and great Labours he had endured in the adminiſtration of the Affairs wherewith he had honoured him, for the intereſt of Religion and the Love of God, that he would not ſuffer ſo compleat an Army, and ſo great preparations for Warr to periſh unprofitably; that the deſignes of thoſe who envyed him, tended to the diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Royal Glory, only to make him incurr the blame of Temerity; he declared to him the facility of the enterprize, and the treaſure he had provided for it, that he had of his own ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to pay the Army three moneths: And if it ſhould be his ill fortune to ſee his deſignes ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fruſtrated, and the Army disbanded, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50543:50"/>
his Majeſty would be pleaſed to grant him leave to retire to his houſe at <hi>Toledo,</hi> where he would endeavour by Exhortations and Sermons to make Warr againſt Vice in his Dioceſs. The King who had a value for his perſon, and Judged him neceſſary for <hi>Spain,</hi> gave him the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he deſired, ſlighted the Counſels of his Enemies, gave him order to ſet Sail, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the whole Army to attend him the next Spring, being the year 1508. But though theſe obſtacles were overcome by the Courage of the Cardinal, and Authority of the King, there ſprung up new to retard his deſignes and ſtay him at <hi>Carthagene.</hi> For juſt as he was to put his men on Board, the Soldiers mutinyed, fled from their Colours, and drew to the hills neer the Sea: The occaſion was this: The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal had ordered that the Muſter of the Army ſhould be in <hi>Africk</hi> at their firſt Landing: And to prevent the Pilleries practiſed by the Captains on their Companies that every Soldier ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his pay immediately from the Treaſurers. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Navar</hi> accuſtomed to the rapines of the Warrs in <hi>Italy,</hi> liked not this order, and gave notice thereof under hand to the Captains, who diſguiſing the matter, and ſetting it out to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage before the Soldiers, cauſed them to disband. <hi>Vianelli</hi> who was of Authority in the Army, inſtead of appeaſing the ſedition, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed it; holding cloſe intelligence with <hi>Navarr,</hi> and having reſolved with him to drive on the Mutiny to the laſt point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>
            <p>In order to this he cauſed all the Mutineers he
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50543:51"/>
he could Light on to be preſently hanged up; and by colour of doing Juſtice put thoſe on the hills in a deſperate fury: The Cardinal ſeeing the remedy worſe than the Diſeaſe ſends <hi>Villaroel</hi> Governour of <hi>Caſtocle</hi> to command <hi>Vianelli</hi> to proceed with more gentleneſs, and not deſtroy thoſe men who were neceſſary for the Warr they were to make. <hi>Vianelli</hi>'s pride made him take this in ill part, and Anſwer, he knew better than the Cardinal or him how the mutinies of Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were to be appeaſed. <hi>Villaroel</hi> layes his hand on his Sword, ſtrikes, and wounds him in the head; and retires into the Citadel of <hi>Carthagene,</hi> under the command of his Kinſman. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd the ſetting out of the Fleet; for <hi>Vianelli</hi> being the principal guide of the Voyage, it was neceſſary to attend his Cure, as to appeaſe the mutiny of the Soldiers. To effect this the Cardinal employes Captain <hi>Salazar</hi> Campmaſter of the Regiment of <hi>Toledo,</hi> a great Warrier, Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in Soldierly Eloquence and powerful in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary perſwaſion. He goes to the Soldiers, tells them the Muſter was to be taken Aboard the Gally-Royal, perſwades them to come to it, ſhews them baggs of Money, crowned with green Boughes carryed in their fight on the Shore at ſome diſtance from the hill towards the Gally: the Mutineers at ſight of the money haſte down as Hawkes to the Lure. By this Artifice they were imbarqued, and ſet Sail from <hi>Carthagene</hi> the 15th. of <hi>May</hi> with 24 Ships, ten Gallyes, and a great number of ſmaller Veſſels. The Army was compoſed of ten thouſand foot, and four thouſand horſe. On <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> Eve they came
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50543:51"/>
happily to Anchor on the Coaſt of <hi>Africk.</hi> At their Landing the Cardinal was Cloathed in a long Veſt of the Habit of his Order, with a Croſs of Silver carryed before him by a Cordelier of a monſtrous ſtature, mounted on a white beaſt, his Sword by his ſide, girt upon his Robe. Others of the Older who accompanied the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, were habited alike with long Robes and Swords. With this Retinue he retires into the Caſtle of <hi>Merſalcabir,</hi> to Reſt and Refreſh himſelf. News was brought him that <hi>Navarr</hi> had Landed the Foot, but left the Horſe on Board as uſeleſs on this Coaſt being full of Hills and Rocks. The Cardinal goes to the Port, and commands all the Cavalry aſhore: To this Act the whole Army owed their ſafety in ſeveral Engagements with the <hi>Moors</hi> wherein the Cavalry ſheltered the Foot from Ruine and Defeat. The Army was drawn no in four Batallions, and the Soldiers commanded by the Cardinal to fit themſelves for fight, by taking their Repaſt before they Engaged: Their proviſion of Victuals conſiſted moſt of Bread, Bacon and ſalt Meats, and the Cardinal diſpenſing with the abſtinence of the day, being <hi>Friday,</hi> gave them liberty to eat thereof; and after their repaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to fight Couragiouſly for the ſervice of God and their King. This done, the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Officers intreated him to withdraw into the Fortreſs, the feebleneſs of his Age inclined him to conſent, and being Conducted into the Caſtle he retyred into St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Chappel to fight againſt the <hi>Moors</hi> by Prayers to God being diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by Age for manual Combats.</p>
            <p>The Infidels diſcovering the Approach of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50543:52"/>
Army were ready for battle, and for better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage had poſſeſſed themſelves of a little hill where the Army muſt of neceſſity have paſſed to attaque <hi>Oran; Peter</hi> of <hi>Navarr</hi> ſeeing this Poſt taken by the Enemy was in doubt what to do, and goes to the Cardinal for Advice, who having heard him, anſwered in ſhort, <hi>Fight, God will be your Leader</hi>; with this Anſwer he returns, and ſets upon the hill, where in effect he made no progreſs but in the Loſs of his men, and thoſe, the flowre of his Troops, whom the <hi>Moors</hi> ſlew in great numbers; Cut of their heads, and ſent them to <hi>Oran</hi> to be carryed in Triumph through the Streets; where Women, and Children, who ſeldome fight but with the dead, expreſt their joy over them by Songs and Dances. <hi>Lewis Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treras</hi> Captain of the ſlain, had but one Eye, and partaking the fate of his fellow Soldiers, had his head cut off, and dragg'd in the ſtreets of <hi>Oran</hi>; ſome of thoſe many old Women that pretend to Divination, among the <hi>Moors,</hi> ſaw it; and having attentively viewed its Phyſiogmony, ſuddenly cryed out, <hi>An ill Omen, our Town is near Deſtruction.</hi> The people inſolent and ſenſeleſs in ſuch occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, ceaſe not to dragg it along the Streets, ſaying it was the head of the <hi>Alfaqui</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, meaning the Cardinal whom they knew to be General of the Army, and dragged it on to the Priſon of the Chriſtians, made ſlaves at the taking of <hi>Merſalcabir</hi> by <hi>Diego Fernandez.</hi> The fight in the mean time continued at the Hill where at laſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> beat off the <hi>Moors,</hi> and having encloſed them in the midſt between the body of the Army, and ſome Troops <hi>Navarr</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:50543:52"/>
had commanded to advance, they put them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every man to the Sword, as they fled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the City. The Chriſtians advance to the Walls of <hi>Oran; Soſa</hi> Captain of the Cardinals Company, firſt mounts the Wall; and having planted there his Maſters Colours, cryes out, <hi>Victory</hi>; the reſt followed his Example, and ſome of the Soldiers getting into the Town open the Gates and give the Army entrance, who put all to the ſword. The <hi>Moſques</hi> were filled with the blood of the <hi>Moors,</hi> who retyred thither in great numbers, and the Streets paved with dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ran down with the blood of the ſlain; the Victors killing all, without pitty of Age or Sex, till the miſerable ſpectacle of a ſucking Child, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Breaſts, and Labouring with fingers and mouth, to get the Teat of his dead Mother to ſuck, ſtaid their fury, and melted their relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hearts into Compaſſion to a Creature ſenſeleſs of his miſery; the poor Infant ſmiling at the Maſſacre of his Mother. Two dayes after he was ſold among the Captives to <hi>George Baracald</hi> the Cardinals Secretary, and happy in the ignorance of his misfortunes was carryed into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he continued without trouble for the Ruine of his Countrey, or grief for the Maſſacre of his kindred. 'Tis ſome kind of happineſs to the miſerable, that they have been ſo in their Cradles.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards having made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Oran, Navarr</hi> ſent the News to the Cardinal, who paſſed that night without ſleep in chanting Hymnes of praiſe to God for ſo important a Victory.</p>
            <p>The day following he went aboard the Gallies,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50543:53"/>
and came by Sea to <hi>Oran,</hi> to avoid the Hill that lay in the way by Land. The greateſt part of the Army then Marched to meet him, Received him in Triumph, and with joyful acclamations ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him <hi>Conquerour of Barbary,</hi> the Keyes of the Town were preſented to him, which he afterwards ſent to the Colledge of <hi>Arcala,</hi> with ſome Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards and Armes of the Turks. All the booty was laid at his feet; <hi>Navarr</hi> having cauſed it to be carefully locked up by the Cardinals order; Part was diſpoſed afterwards defraying the charge of the Army; ſome rare pieces of value ſent to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the reſt diſtributed among the Captains and Soldiers according to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive valour and merit: The Cardinal for his ſhare taking that which is moſt acceptable to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſpirits the pleaſure of giving to others. After this he cauſed the Town to be cleanſed and what might prove infectious to be carryed out, and in memory of the taking of the Town ſounded an Hoſpital, and ordained in the Church he built there, an Annual Service for the 15 of <hi>May</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity with Prayers to be made for him, for which he gave thirty thouſand Crowns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alvarez Gomez</hi> who writ more of the Actions of the Cardinal, then any Author come into my hands obſerves that he held intelligence in <hi>Oran</hi> before he left <hi>Spain</hi> with two Jews, <hi>Acmat Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nixe</hi> the prime man of the Town and <hi>Catorre.</hi> Theſe perſwaded the Townſmen to deny entrance to the Succours from <hi>Tremiſen,</hi> ſent by that King to maintain the Siege, ſuggeſting he deſigned by thoſe Succours to take the Town for himſelf. And when the Spaniards entred the Town, thoſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50543:53"/>
two men broke the Keyes of a Gate where the people might have fled and eſcaped the Maſſacre. The houſes of theſe Jews were exempted from pillage, and their perſons from Violence, they paſſed afterwards into <hi>Spain,</hi> and had penſions from the King, during their Lives: Yet the ſame <hi>Gomez,</hi> and moſt of the Spaniſh Hiſtorians forbear not to ſay that the Arrival of the Army the Siege, and taking of the Town were all miraculous, that a Croſs appeared to them at their Landing, that the Sun ſtopped his Courſe 4 hours, adding ſo much length to the day, to give light to the Combat.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of <hi>Tremeſen</hi> made the taking of <hi>Oran</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the Chriſtians and Jews trading there, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all to death upon the news; while <hi>Spain</hi> on the other ſhore Celebrated the ſucceſs with Joy. The Cardinal had ſent <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the news by <hi>Fernand de Vera,</hi> ſon to <hi>Diego</hi> Maſter of the Artillery in this expedition, who had deſired the employment for his Son, but <hi>Fernand</hi> being young and careleſs, made ſlow haſte, ſleep and play took up the beſt part of his time: This oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a Soldier deſirous to make advantage of the voyage to follow him privately, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoftneſs of his temper he robbed him off his Letters to the King in the firſt Journey he made by Land, and arriving at Court, ere <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> was half way thither, Received of the King, the gifts uſually beſtowed on Courriers that bring ſuch happy news.</p>
            <p>This new inſtance of negligence in <hi>Vera,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Cardinal in his reſolution taken on the Ethiopians miſcarriage mentioned above, never to ſend a Courrier on Affairs of importance, but
ſuch 
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50543:54"/>
as ſhould be a perſon of Judgement and Merit, whoſe good addreſs may advance the honour of the Prince and Reputation of his Miniſters.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal had many Croſſes in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor had he fewer in the end of this Warr: For as Fortune labours to obſtruct vertuous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo Envy ſtrives to obſcure their glory: <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Navarr</hi> was preferred by the Cardinal to be Lieutenant General of the Army, and Received from his hand the Authority and honour he ſtood poſſeſſed of; but made ſo ill acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the favour that he employed them againſt the perſon of his Benefactor. A Soldier had killed a Domeſtick of the Cardinals, who commanded Juſtice to be done thereupon: <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr</hi> not only oppoſed it, but upheld the Criminal, and beſpoke his General and Benefactour in this arrogant Language: If there be diſorder and inſolency among the Soldiers; the cauſe is from you alone: They never knew two Maſters in Warr: Had I the ſole command of the Army, I durſt undertake in few moneths to ſubdue <hi>Africk.</hi> Return when you pleaſe into <hi>Spain</hi> to attend your charge of Prelate, and know that from henceforth you ſhall be no otherwiſe treated then as a private perſon: Theſe are not yours, but the Kings Armes. I know the King gave you the Charge of <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> but it was only for the Siege of <hi>Oran:</hi> your power is determined with the Siege: I will inſtantly cauſe the Kings name to be proclaimed throughout the Army without mention of yours, which he did the ſame day: To <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

to a mad-man, is to imitate him. Nor was he daunted it this inſolent Proclamation that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed his Authority, and Annulled his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. But ſome dayes after, with the genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and gravity natural to him, he ſent for <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr,</hi> gave Orders, and commanded him to do what was neceſſary and fit to be done. <hi>Navarr</hi> obeyed him, acknowledged his fault, begg'd his pardon, and was reconciled to him. The Cardinal embraced him, commended him in publick, and told him he deſerved worthily the name of Captain: but after their arrival in <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſet forth his humours and extravagancies to the King, and adviſed him not to give him the Government of <hi>Oran,</hi> nor any Authority in the Affairs of <hi>Africk,</hi> that the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of his Nature, rendred him unfit for ſuch imployments, and was proper only for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Armies, wherein he behaved himſelf as a man of valour and great undertaking.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal had in the mean time command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the guards of the Port of <hi>Africk</hi> to ſend him all the Letters that came from <hi>Spain,</hi> without any reſpect to their addreſs to others; they ſend him a packet directed to <hi>Navarr,</hi> he opens it where he finds the Kings command to <hi>Navarr,</hi> that if the Cardinals preſence were requiſite in <hi>Africk,</hi> he ſhould keep him there as long as he could, and diſſwade him from croſſing the Sea. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal being of a temper (natural to all great ſpirits) Melancholick and Suſpicious, imagined the King had written this with deſign to ruine him, and that ſuppoſing the ſtrength of his Aged body, much impaired by the toiles of the Warr, he gave this command in hopes he would ſoon
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50543:55"/>
pine away, and end his life there. This haſtened his return; ſo that about the end of <hi>May,</hi> he went on Board, and ſoon after arrived at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Action he did after his Arrival in <hi>Spain,</hi> was to Execute an Article of his Teſtament, whereby he appointed that in caſe the Warr of <hi>Africk</hi> brought any Damage to the Villages of the Dioceſs of <hi>Toledo,</hi> by reaſon of the great number of Peaſants he had imployed in the Warr; Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould be made out of his Eſtate, which he did himſelf in all places where he held it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. A vertuous man ought not to leave that good undone till his Death, which he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in his life.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal arrived at Court continued his good Counſels for the advancement of the State: he propoſed to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to change the Reſidence of the Knights of Saint <hi>James,</hi> from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of <hi>Volſan</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> into the City of <hi>Oran</hi> in <hi>Africk</hi>; And that to merit the Commanderies they ſhould ſerve twenty years, without parting thence, that ſo many years elapſed, they ſhould ſucceed in the Commanderies by their Seniority and Services. This (ſaid he) will ſtrengthen your Militia in <hi>Africk,</hi> and render it formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a number of Gentlemen who commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed others in valour: This advice if embraced had been attended with great advantages, but the King refuſed it, only to reſerve in himſelf the power to preferr whom he pleaſed to theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manderies.</p>
            <p>The year following in the beginning of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> the Army Led by the Cardinal into <hi>Africk,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:50543:55"/>
continued their progreſs, and advanced farther into the Countrey: <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Navarr</hi> took the Town of <hi>Bugia,</hi> and about the end of <hi>July</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, that of <hi>Tripoly,</hi> but relapſing into his Vice of ingratitude againſt the Cardinal, he joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Vianelli,</hi> who followed his paſſion in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to rend in pieces the Cardinals name, and deſtroy the reputation of him who had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him to the prime Offices of the Warr. But as great Men proſper by their Generoſity, ſo unthankful wretches periſh by ingratitude: <hi>Vianelli</hi> having abuſed an Enſign in <hi>Africk,</hi> was by him betrayed to the <hi>Moors,</hi> who ſtabbed him in his ſleep. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Navarr</hi> ſoon after on change of Fortune changed his party, and ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the French in the Wars of <hi>Italy,</hi> was taken and impriſoned by the Spaniards, where the miſerable incommodities of a priſon, brought him to that height of deſpair, that the Spaniards ſay he attempted his own life, and in hope to end his miſeries, ended his dayes by his own hand, ſo tragical was the Cataſtrophe of theſe two men ſignal for their envy, and remarkable for their enmity to the glory of the Cardinal their Benefactour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter Arias</hi> a valiant Captain, famous for many gallant actions in the ſame Warr of <hi>Africk,</hi> hath merited eternal praiſes for his conſtant payment of the reſpect and acknowledgements due to the Cardinal who imployed him. This recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the favour of the Court where he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the charge of General of the Fleet, to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> againſt the ſavage <hi>Cannibals</hi> feeding on humane fleſh. There he became famous for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50543:56"/>
his remarkable familiarity with death, for being taken with an incurable malady, that ſenſibly threatned to bring him lingeringly by degrees to his Grave, and finding himſelf paſt hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, he cauſed a Grave to be digged in a Church where he went every day to hear Maſs, which being ended, he went to his Grave, and lay along in it, celebrating in his life his own Funeral. As he lay in this Poſture the Prieſt with his Laver ſprinkled Holy Water over him, and Chanted a <hi>Libera</hi> where it needed not. This done, he roſe again before death, went out of his Grave, and made to his Lodgings. His wife and friends imputing this Action to Melancholy more than Vertue or Devotion, endeavoured to divert him from it. But he ſeriouſly anſwered, <hi>I Do this to Accuſtome my ſelf by little and little to an habitation where I muſt long abide.</hi> And though Dead men need no Accuſtomance to their Long home, yet ſuch was the Meditation of this gallant Captain <hi>Arias</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on death, which though a ſtranger to his mind in the Warrs where he had it daily in his Eye, he practiſed in peace in all its parts and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Man better thinks of his end in repoſe and tranquility of Spirit, than in the troubles of Affairs, and paſſions that diſtract him.</p>
            <p>The envy that attaqued the Cardinal in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and progreſs of the Warr of <hi>Africk,</hi> could not hinder him from obtaining (over and above the glory of having planted the Croſs there, and extended the limits of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the other ſide of the Sea) the reputation of a Captain fit to command Armies, generous in Enterprize, prudent in Conduct, and hardy in Execution.

Order and Diſcipline the ſoul of Warr, as well as other Affairs of the World was wiſely eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and carefully kept during his command, inſomuch that the old Spaniſh Soldiers long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, gave this teſtimony of his conduct in Warr, that Captains and Soldiers were never in greater honour and eſteem, nor the Muſters better paid than in his Time: 'Tis admirable that a Man bred in a Cloyſter, having never made profeſſion of Armes, imployed to the Age of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years in Eccleſiaſtical Functions became ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in a Moment to command an Army like him in former Ages of whom it is obſerved that he went from the Republick leſs than a Soldier,<note place="margin">Scipio.</note> became by the way an excellent Captain.

            <p>UPon the firſt deſign of the Warr of <hi>Africk,</hi> the Cardinal furniſhed the King with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney toward the Charge thereof on Condition of re-imburſement, or caſe <hi>Oran</hi> were taken, the King ſhould grant it to the Arch biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> unleſs he choſe rather to pay the money; The Voyage of <hi>Africk</hi> being generouſly accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Spaniards maſters of <hi>Oran,</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal demands the money he advanced. This gave his Enemies freſh occaſion to attacque his reputation, and calumniated his integrity; The grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> who had deſigned to trouble the State after <hi>Iſabels</hi> death, and to take from <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Adminiſtration of <hi>Caſtile</hi> ſaw their deſigns defeated by the Counſels of the Cardinal, and themſelves reduced to a private life in their houſes with as little Authority as the meaneſt Burgeſſes of <hi>Madrid.</hi> See here an opportunity of Revenge, to out the Cardinal from Court, and ſoon after with eaſe to Remove <hi>Ferdinand</hi> from the Adminiſtration: they lay hold on't, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that the Cardinals avarice was inſatiable; that there was no reaſon he ſhould demand the money advanced, having made vaſt gains by the richeſt part of the booty of <hi>Oran</hi> which he had reſerved for himſelf, in recompence of his Loans, That the braveſt warriers having loſt their blood in battel, returned with no greater felicity than that of being loaden with glory and Booty; that the more generous contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50543:57"/>
with the glory, leaving the booty to the Soldiers. But the Cardinal who had ſeen no Field but St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Chappel, nor handled other Weapon than his Breviary, while others with their Swords in their hands, lay weltred in blood in the midſt of their Enemies, is not ſatisfied with the glory of Conqueſt, and ſpoils of a City, but muſt empty the Kings Coffers on pretence of a Lone, which the King was not obliged to pay. The King unwilling to drain his Treaſures (as what King is willing to do it?) approves of theſe diſcourſes. So eaſily do Monarks believe what they deſire: The Kings Officers ſpake al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the ſame effect: The Cardinal never daunted by the Croſſes and Troubles of Court, makes a generous defence; alledges the Services he had done in the Warr, that beſides the money furniſhed to Levy the Army, he had Conducted them to the place, eſtabliſhed order amongſt them, prevented the frauds and pilleries of the Captains at Muſters, which often proves the deſtruction of Armies (for where the Soldier is not paid, he muſt of neceſſity ſtarve or disband) That but for him <hi>Navarr</hi> had left the Cavalry uſeleſs in the Ships, that the Combat had not been undertaken if not Counſelled yea commanded by him. As to the Booty of <hi>Oran</hi> he took only ſome <hi>Arabick</hi> Volumes for the Library of <hi>Alcala,</hi> where they were beſtowed. That even that ſmall parcel of the Booty was not for him alone, but for the benefit of the whole Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> for whom he had founded the Colledge and Library; and therefore he prayed his Majeſty to pay him the money advanced, or grant the City of <hi>Oran</hi> to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50543:58"/>
the Church of <hi>Toledo,</hi> according to promiſe. Some of the Councel held this propoſal reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and uſeful to the King in ſaving him the Charge of a Garriſon at <hi>Oran</hi>; Others had more generous ſentiments, and ſaid that fear of expence ought not to Raviſh the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> of ſo important a place, that the Cardinal in offering to maintain a Garriſon there, acted as a King; and the King by refuſing it to ſave his money ſhould act as a private perſon, and in derogation to his Royal Condition; That honour is the true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of Kings, to which money ought to be ſubſervient to preſerve and increaſe it. That by the Laws of the State, no private perſon can hold a place of ſtrength upon the Frontiers of the Kingdom that <hi>Agrede</hi> had been, heretofore taken from the Earles of <hi>Montacute,</hi> becauſe it was ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate on the Confines of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and the Village of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And in ſeveral places eſtabliſhed the Abominations of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cardinal patiently heard theſe ſeveral Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and ſaw they tended all to his Ruine, but had before his eyes the Example of the great Captain <hi>Gonſalves</hi> who having Conquered the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and made it Subject to the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50543:58"/>
Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> had no other Recompence but that of baniſhment in his own Countrey, as living there without Office, without imployment, without any acknowledgement turning over his Beads at <hi>Valladolid,</hi> or ſometimes at Court where he was as inconſiderable; For men, how great ſoever their Vertues be are oftentimes in the hands of Fortune and of Kings, as Counters in the hand of a Banker, where that which now ſtands for a thouſand preſently ſignifies no more than one.</p>
            <p>Yet Reaſon and Juſtice carryed the day, the Cardinal had them on his ſide, and the King cauſed payment to be made him of the moneys he advanced, his Vertue which before defended his Authority againſt Envy, and Obloquy preſerved it ſtill and triumphed over both: and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal gave his Majeſty thanks for altering thoſe opinions which the envy of the Grandees his Enemies had once infuſed into his Majeſty againſt him.</p>
            <p>But this was not the only Trouble that ſprung from the taking of <hi>Oran</hi> to the vexation of the Cardinal. For among the conditions agreed on before the Warr; one was that the Church of <hi>Oran</hi> ſhould depend on that of <hi>Toledo</hi> in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of an <hi>Abby</hi> to which the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and not the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould preſent <hi>Lewis William</hi> a <hi>Cordelier</hi> obtains a grant thereof by Bull from the Pope with the Title of a Biſhoprick, which he aſſumed, but was hindred by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal from taking poſſeſſion; This man who leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Cloyſter, propoſed to himſelf the glory of appearing in the World with the Mytre and

Revenue of a Biſhop, frames a Proceſs in the Council, exclaims in the Court, complains of the Cardinal, proteſts againſt his Violence, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims to all the World, that by the force of his great Authority he had Raviſhed a Biſhoprick from him. The Cardinal to ſtop the mouth of this impudent Monk, who cared not what he ſaid, thought it prudence to propoſe a fair Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, makes him underſtand the Right accrued to the Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> over the Church of <hi>Oran,</hi> that he was obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Conſecrate it to the Dignity of the Arch-biſhoprick in memory of the Warr of <hi>Africk,</hi> not out of any covetous deſigns to draw profit thence to enhance his Revenues, nor Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to joyn it to the Croſs of the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick, Offers it to him with the Title of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> of <hi>Oran,</hi> and a ſeat in the Quire of the great Church of <hi>Toledo,</hi> with the dignity and Revenue of a Canon, beſides the Dignity and Revenue of Abbot of <hi>Oran</hi>; Nothing but a Biſhoprick could ſatisfie the Cordelier; he refuſes the offer, the Cardinals Enemies bear him in hand, he ſhould overthrow the Cardinal, and obtain ſentence from the King againſt him, he believes them and continues obſtinate. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> dying ſoon after, the Cardinal receives the intire Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſlights the Cordelier, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, as before, a Monk; and it may be, an ill one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis Rouys</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ciudad Roderigos,</hi> the Cardinals Companion in the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> followed his fortune, and had negotiated for him at Court in ſeveral Affairs of importance: he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50543:59"/>
not content with his <hi>Biſhoprick,</hi> his Croſs ſeemed too ſmall, and his Revenue far ſhort of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; he preſſes the Cardinal to procure him the Biſhoprick of <hi>Avilas</hi> then vacant: The Cardinal anſwers, If my advice might prevail with you, you would value your repoſe above Dignity and Revenues. You live happily in the condition you are in: Let me perſwade you to keep you ſo, and not ſeek troubles, and inquietudes elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The time of our acquaintance cannot but have furniſhed you with clear experience by your knowledge of my affairs, how many cares and troubles are hid under the fair appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of great Offices, and Eminent Dignities. Nevertheleſs to ſatisfie the deſires of his perſon who was knowing and Vertuous, he made him Biſhop of <hi>Avila,</hi> though he was ever averſe from bringing his friends into Offices which might break their repoſe, or endanger their Conſciences, and very Loath to draw out of Monaſteries to the great dignities of the Church, thoſe men who were conſecrated to God in the tranquility of holy Solitude. To draw a good Fryer from the Cloyſter, when he loves his profeſſion, is to take Fiſh out of water, which is his proper Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal had Laboured with great care and Vigilance in peace and Warr for the State of <hi>Spain,</hi> and now preſſed with Age, which ſliding away like the Current of a rapid ſtream, brings a man to his end ſooner than he is aware of, caſts his thoughts towards the advancement of his houſe; Marries one of his Brothers to great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage into one of the noble families of <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:50543:60"/>
where Vertue the Mother of Nobility was as Eminent as the blood illuſtrious; he made it a condition in the Marriage, his Brother ſhould not come to Court, where vanity and Luxury (whoſe Vaſſals are the baſeſt of Slaves) bear a Soveraign ſway, introducing into their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons all ſorts of Corruptions. He enjoyned him to reſide in the place of his nativity to live nobly there in a vertuous tranquility. Some years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he marryed <hi>Joan Ciſnere</hi> his Niece to <hi>Peter Gonſales Mendoza</hi> Nephew of <hi>Diego Mendoza</hi> Duke of <hi>Infantado,</hi> a name and Family of the firſt Rank of the Nobility of <hi>Spain,</hi> he gave him for portion the Marquiſat of <hi>Val Suilian:</hi> The marryed Couple were both in their Minority, which ſoon after ſerved the Cardinal for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to annul the Marriage, though really the true cauſe of the Rupture was the cheat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of <hi>Mendoza</hi>'s Kindred, who thinking that having given the Cardinal a man of their name and Family, they had ſufficiently obliged him to provide him a fortune, performed not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes they had made in behalf of their Kinſman in point of Eſtate. For his Mother in confidence the Cardinal would provide enough for <hi>Peter,</hi> left by her Will, her whole Eſtate to <hi>Roderick Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sales</hi> her younger Son, but the Cardinal who loved ſolid honour, ſcorned to be baffled, and broke the Marriage, maugre all the oppoſition of the Duke of <hi>Infantado:</hi> Yet afterwards he marryed her into the ſame Family to <hi>Alfonſo Mendoza,</hi> ſon and heir to <hi>Bernardo Mendoza</hi> Earl of <hi>Clung:</hi> Such was the care he had of his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Nor is it forbidden that a Miniſter of State
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50543:60"/>
ſhould impart to this Kindred the fortune he poſſeſſes, if done with moderation, and that by his Alliance he cover not, nor uphold the Violences of others. This natural affection is an evidence of his goodneſs, and ſets of the Glory of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with greater advantage.</p>
            <p>The Naval Army ſoon after ſent for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> had not the good ſucceſs of that Led by the Cardinal. <hi>Don Garija</hi> ſon to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> Commanded it, and had the misfortune to ſee it defeated by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> at <hi>Gerbes: Ferdinand</hi> deſignes to ſet out another <hi>Fleet,</hi> and the Rendezvous to be at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> but would not reſolve till advice with the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this as other matters, a Courrier is diſpatched to him at <hi>Toledo</hi> to command his attendance at <hi>Sevil:</hi> The Cardinal ſet out, and drawing neer to <hi>Guadalquana</hi> expreſſes a deſire to Lodge in the Inn of <hi>Saja Vedra</hi> and ſends his harbingers to take it up, The harbingers find it marked for <hi>Gonsalve</hi> the great Captain, and adviſe the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal accordingly, Take another (ſayes the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and leave that to him who deſerves all manner of honour. So propenſe was the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal on all occaſions to honour perſons of Eminent Vertues: great men naturally love thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble themſelves when the Concurrence of Offices or Jealouſie of dignities do not intetpoſe.</p>
            <p>When the Cardinal drew neer to <hi>Sevil,</hi> the King with all the Court went four Leagues to meet him; the Cardinals Enemies being part of the Retinue, and thus forced to honour him, they envyed and hated. The King at their meeting alighted and Reverenced that head whence iſſued
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50543:61"/>
thoſe Counſels that gave happineſs to <hi>Spain.</hi> This honour wrought two different effects, of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the Cardinal and Rage in his Enemies.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Sevil</hi> a Veſſel arrived from the <hi>Indies,</hi> brought the King and Cardinal advice that the Spaniards in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> abuſing the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they had received from God above the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that Countrey, tyrannized over thoſe new ſubjects of God and the King, and Sacrificed the lives of the <hi>Indians</hi> to their avarice, Murdering them firſt, and then Robbing them of the Gold amaſſed in their Grounds, and laying all deſolate, without pi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ty, without mercy, without Juſtice. The Cardinal adviſed his Maſter to ſend thither ſome men under the Rules of Religion, who dead to the World, and wholy diſ-intereſſed from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular concerns might oppoſe their Charity to the violence of the Governours. The advice was embraced; many men of his Order, Embarqued for the Voyage; and among them three of the Cardinals companions, whereof <hi>Francis Rouys</hi> was one; but the Ayre of <hi>India,</hi> not agreeing with his Conſtitution, forced him to return to <hi>Madrid,</hi> ſix moneths after his departure: At his Arrival he preſented King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> with a Box full of Idols Worſhipped by the <hi>Indians,</hi> and a wedge of Gold weighed above a thouſand Ducats which doubtleſs had been an Idol to which they who tormen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

At <hi>Sevil</hi> propoſal was made for raiſing another Army to recover the honour loſt by the defeat of the former, ſome preparations were made, but the affairs of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond put a ſtop to the proceedings.

troubled all Europe ſent his <hi>Nuncio</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> to deſire Aide from <hi>Ferdinand</hi> againſt the Council of <hi>Piſa,</hi> (where the Cardials had choſen another Pope) and to demand vengeance againſt <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardine</hi> Cardinal <hi>Caruajale</hi> a Spaniard whom he had ſtruck out of the Catalogue of Cardinals as Author of that Council, and prayed the King to deveſt him of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Siguenza</hi> which he held in <hi>Spain: Ferdinand</hi> to pleaſe the Pope, took the Biſhoprick from <hi>Bernardine,</hi> and gave it <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi>; But the ſtorm being over, <hi>Bernardine</hi> was afterwards reſtored to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick, that he might end his life with ſome kind of Dignity: in the affair of <hi>Julius</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the generoſity of the Cardinal in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the fauours of thoſe who had obliged him was remarkable: he writ to this Pope who had ſent him the Cardinals Cap, that he would return him to <hi>Rome</hi> four hundred thouſand Crowns when he pleaſed, that he would Levy an Army at his own Charge if the Pope needed it, and would in perſon lead them into <hi>Italy</hi> againſt his Enemies.

Court, and in his journeys: The day following the Cardinal walked with Prince <hi>Ferdinand</hi> into the Palace Gardens: the King ſpies them from his Window, and Calling to the Prince, beſpeaks him aloud in theſe words, Son, You are in very good company, and if you take my advice, will never part from it. Knowing he was with a man who could make Princes ſuch as they ought to be Wiſe, Religious, and Generous: from the Garden the Cardinal attended the young Prince to the Palace where he took leave of him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre to his Lodgings, the Prince offered to bear him Company, the King coming upon them in the Complement adviſed him to it, but the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal thanked for the honour and obtained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Go alone. The reſolutions taken in the Aſſembly at <hi>Burgos</hi> by the advice of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal were, that the King ſhould not haſten the Warr, but chooſe any way rather than that of Armes to bring affairs to a ſolid peace: but this advice was ſoon changed: The Cardinal receives Advertiſement of a ſecret League between the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarr,</hi> thereupon he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for Warr, adviſes his Maſter to it: And preſſeth him to haſten the raiſing of an Army: The diſcovery of the League was thus: The King of <hi>Navarr</hi> was paſſionately in Love with a Lady of the Court, whoſe beauties had charmed his reaſon; This Love by the prerogatives of the Crown which few Women know how to deny, was come to enjoyment. A Secretary of State, and prime confident of this Prince took part in this affair of Love, as if it had been a matter of State, Viſits the Lady, declares his affection,

            <p>The year 1513. being the next after the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Navarr,</hi> Carryed <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, out of the world to prevent his ſpreading of further miſchiefs: ſoon after, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> fell ſick of the malady whereof he dyed: this affected him with extraordinary ſadneſs. To make him merry the whole Court turned Revellers: the Ladies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to pleaſe him by their divertiſements of Balls and Dances; the Gentlemen by Juſts and Turnaments. <hi>Alfonſo Mendoza</hi> Husband of the Cardinal Niece was of the party and expended ſeven thouſand Crowns to fit himſelf for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity a great expence in thoſe times; this was to be paid out of the Cardinals purſe who uſed to reject and diſallow all vain expences, but paid this cheerfully, telling thoſe who ſpoke to him of it, that theſe Turnaments were the remedy for recovery of the Kings health which he ſhould buy very cheap ſince his Nephew had expended no more. So willing was he to part with his eſtate for the good of his Prince or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the people. 'Twas at this time he made proviſion againſt that publick exigency to which <hi>Spain</hi> is often reduced for want of Corn: At <hi>Toledo, Arcala</hi> and <hi>Torrelaguce,</hi> he built publick Granaries, and filled them with Corn. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Toledo,</hi> in acknowledgement of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, hath Conſecrated the memory thereof to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity, by an Inſcription engraven in the midſt of the Palace; and the people preſerves the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of it by a Marble Table, which to this day ſhews the Character of his Liberality in the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50543:64"/>
great Market of the City; and yearly on the fifth of <hi>October,</hi> they Celebrate their grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements in an Harangue made of the Vertues and merits of this great man.</p>
            <p>Soon after he erected a magnificent Monaſtery and Church at <hi>Torrelagave</hi> for the perpetual Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of his praiſes, whoſe bounty raiſed him to the height of his fortunes: he adorned the Church with Sacred Veſſels, and Veſtments, and furniſhed it with all neceſſaries for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and Ornament of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. For the convenience of this holy place and the publick, he clave Rocks, and boared through Mountains to make Aqueducts for conveyance of water thither from a ſpring at great diſtance from the Church; the Aqueducts were Arched and Wide, and coſt him by the computation of the Spaniards, no leſs than a Million of Gold, this place to this day teſtifies the Generoſity of this Cardinal in his affections to the publick; for great edifices without flattery, report to poſterity the Grandeur of the Builders.</p>
            <p>But though he built of his own for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, yet would he not permit others to be Magnificent at the Spaniards charges. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, who ſucceeded <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, had a deſign at this time to build at <hi>Rome,</hi> a Temple to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſuitable to the dignity of the firſt Church of Chriſtendome; and becauſe the charge of ſuch a building amounted to vaſt ſumms of money, he ſent his Bulls into <hi>Spain,</hi> to demand Contribution from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> King <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> conſented, but the Cardinal being a ſevere man, and inclined to eaſe the people, though
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50543:64"/>
he commended the Popes deſign, approved not his exacting Money by his Bulls, but with all his power hindered the Execution thereof; and with a generous liberty writ his thoughts thereupon to <hi>Rome,</hi> and told them his mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> approached the end of his Reign, and his Life, by the malady before mentioned, which handled him ſo rudely at <hi>Burgos,</hi> that he left that place, imputing to the Ayre the cauſe of that diſtemper he carryed within him. When he came to <hi>Arand,</hi> he ſent for the Cardinal, who ſet out to attend him, and drawing neer to the Court, the King went in his Litter to meet him, to the aſtoniſhment of all that were about him, his diſeaſe having ſo weakened him that he could hardly ſtand, and in a few dayes after was laid on his death-bed. The Cardinal was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to wait on his Maſter to the laſt moment of his dayes, but thought fit to withdraw, to avoid the ſuſpicion his attendance might occaſion, if he were appointed governour of the Kingdom, which would be attributed more to the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cardinal, than the Judgement of the King or the advice of his Council.</p>
            <p>This was the reaſon of his retiring to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cala D' Henares,</hi> while God diſpoſed of this Prince according to the Decree of his will. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in the mean time felt himſelf dying, yet could not believe he ſhould dye of this ſickneſs. The holy women of <hi>Avila</hi> had deluded his reaſon by her pretended prediction, that he ſhould out-live the violence of his diſtemper: he was ſo poſſeſt with conceit of the truth of her aſſertions, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and put off <hi>Matreuſe</hi> the Cordelier his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50543:65"/>
Confeſſor who came to diſpoſe his Conſcience to part with this World, and appear before him who Judges Kings without reſpect to their Crowns, and ſaid, That Man came to ſee him, not out of zeal, of piety or devotion, but ambition, and in hopes to obtain ſome gift. Prince <hi>Charles</hi> his young Son, ſent Dean <hi>Adrian</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tretcht</hi> to Viſit him in his Sickneſs, but he could not get audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and when the Secretaries of State, moved in his behalf, and were urgent with the King to admit him to his preſence, he refuſed anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in Spaniſh, <hi>What comes he for, it may be to ſee whether I am dead or not.</hi> However he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him afterwards, and received the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of Charles: The great ones of the world can hardly part with it, nor is there any place men are more loath to leave, than a Throne: But Death is as inexorable as neceſſary; She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects not Scepters, nor fears Crowns. The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, and principal Councellors of State adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he was arrived at the laſt hour of his life, that he had but a ſhort time left to think of the Affairs of his Conſcience and Kingdom this made him Reſolved to admit his Confeſſor and believe, the Saint of <hi>Avila</hi> had not received from Heaven the advice ſhe gave in the Affairs of his Kingdom: he told them that by his ſecret Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made at <hi>Burgos,</hi> he had ordered <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his younger ſon, Brother of <hi>Charles</hi> to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Spain,</hi> and appropriated to him as a peculiar Legacy the grand Maſter-ſhipps of the three principal orders of <hi>Spain,</hi> thoſe of St. <hi>James, Calatrave</hi> and <hi>Alcantara.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors remonſtrate to him the injury he did the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50543:65"/>
Crown in the Alienation of thoſe three orders which himſelf had judged neceſſary to be kept alwayes annexed to it: That he gave them to a Prince who might when he pleaſed make uſe of them againſt the Crown, that the beſt and ſureſt inheritance he could leave <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was the love and good will of his brother <hi>Charles.</hi> That it was dangerous to leave the Government of <hi>Spain</hi> in the hands of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> whoſe youth made him ſuſſceptible of ill impreſſions from the great ones to the ruine of the State: Upon theſe Remonſtrances he altered his Reſolutions and appointed <hi>Charles</hi> Governour during the life of the Queen his Mother, ſole Heireſs of that Kingdom. But in the abſence of <hi>Charles,</hi> there wanted an adminiſtrator to manage the publick affairs, with prudence, integrity and generoſity: <hi>Laurence Galinda Caravegal,</hi> one of the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors propoſed the Cardinal as eminently endued with all theſe qualities. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> turns his head, and anſwers, Know you not the ſeverity of <hi>Ximenes</hi> his ſpirit, no wayes fit to treat with men? Thus did he Reject him whoſe conduct he admired, whoſe perſon he honoured going to meet him every time he came to do him ſervice, ſuch was the inconſtancy of this great King. But there was ſome (though a very light) cauſe for this diſdain of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> againſt the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The King wanted a great ſumm of money, and would have borrowed it of the Cardinal, but he refuſed to lend it, telling him boldly, the moneys ariſing from his Eccleſiaſtical Revenues, were neither his, nor his Majeſties, but belonged to the poor of the Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:50543:66"/>
whoſe neceſſities could not give way to the Loan he propoſed: Nevertheleſs the Cardinals merit prevailed more with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> than the memory of this Refuſal: having muſed awhile; his mind altered, and he tells the Councellors, Were it poſſible to frame a perſon of purpoſe fitted with vertues proper for the Government of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, he could not be more capable than the Cardinal to diſcharge it, if we could mitigate the exceſſive ſeverity of his nature, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it with ſome ſweetneſs of diſpoſition: he hath to this time acknowledged Queen <hi>Iſabels</hi> favours and mine, and will certainly retain a grateful memory of them for the future: with that, he declared him adminiſtrator General of <hi>Spain,</hi> and preſently after breathed his laſt.</p>
            <p>This change of the Teſtament at <hi>Burgos</hi> alarm'd the Governours of Prince <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to take on him the Government of the Kingdom, and diſpatch Patents in his name to the Councellors of State, requiring their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to adviſe him in the Government. One of them upon receipt of his Letters made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, We will go to the Prince to pay him our reſpects but we know no King but <hi>Caeſar:</hi> which alluſion to that piece of holy Scripture proved Prophetical; <hi>Charles</hi> then King, being afterwards Emperour. The Cardinal in the mean time enters on the Government of <hi>Spain,</hi> where he was ſo abſolute that having long ſince the purpoſe of the Church, he wanted only that of a Monarch, and the name of a King, he held the Government two years, which he managed with prudence, integrity, and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50543:66"/>
inſeparable from his actions: he bore up couragiouſly againſt the diſturbers of the publick peace, and wiſely appeaſed the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Spain,</hi> checked and ſuppreſſed the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the great Ones; and plucked out of their hands the eſtates of the meaner ſort, raviſhed from them by violence and injuſtice: inſomuch that <hi>Spain</hi> did then acknowledge, and confeſſes to this day, She never enjoyed ſo perfect repoſe, ſo ſecure a peace, as under the conduct of the Cardinal; who made it appear that the happineſs of the people is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with the glory of Adminiſtration, that the direct way for a Miniſter of State to acquire glory and honour is, by imploying his cares with prudence and generoſity to procure and promote the good of the People.</p>

            <p>THE firſt Action he did after opening King <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Teſtament, which declared him Regent of <hi>Spain,</hi> was, The taking of Prince <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> into his care. And having given him a Retinue befitting his birth, he kept him alwayes neer him, to prevent the great Ones of <hi>Spain,</hi> from drawing him to their party, and making him their head, to follow the motion of the members, and to be at the diſcretion of his pretended Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals. After this he took order for performance of the honours due to Queen <hi>Germaine,</hi> and the Maintenance of her family, ſuitable to her dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:50543:67"/>The Croſſes that rendred his Conduct more illuſtrious, attacqued him early: <hi>Adrian</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> Dean of <hi>Lorain,</hi> was ſent by <hi>Charles</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s ſickneſs, with Patents for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Spain,</hi> in caſe <hi>Ferdinand</hi> dyed: After his death, <hi>Adrian</hi> declared his Charge, publiſhed his Patents in full Council; and would have taken upon him the Soveraign adminiſtration of affairs. The Cardinal oppoſed it, and Remonſtrates, that by the Teſtament of Queen <hi>Iſabel,</hi> King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was made Regent of the Kingdom, untill <hi>Charles</hi> ſhould have attained the Age of twenty years, that, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being dead before that time, he was by his Teſtament to ſucceed in his room. And therefore the Regency belonged to him alone. Moreover, that by the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it was prohibited that a Stranger ſhould Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the State; and that <hi>Adrian,</hi> being a <hi>Fleming,</hi> his birth excluded him from what he pretended to. This Conteſt had Abettors and maintainers on both parts: the Cardinal had the good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots on his ſide; and <hi>Adrian</hi> was upheld by the ambitious Grandees, who deſired nothing more than trouble to gain by, <hi>Charles</hi> who was in <hi>Flanders</hi> muſt determine the difference: but while his Judgement was expected, the Cardinal and <hi>Adrian</hi> Governed joyntly, and both ſigned all Orders and Commands; though <hi>Adrian</hi> was but the ſhadow to follow the motions of the Cardinal as the ſubſtance acting in the publick Affairs.</p>
            <p>The firſt that by Armes diſturbed the publick peace was <hi>Peter Porto Carrero,</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> whoſe Succeſſours, are, at this day, Marqueſſes of <hi>Villa-nova.</hi> This man, of great
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50543:67"/>
power among the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> beyond the River <hi>Guadiana,</hi> ſtirred up the people on that ſide the River to take up Arms, and ſet all in confuſion throughout that Province: his deſign was to poſſeſs himſelf, by force, of the great Maſterſhip of St. <hi>James,</hi> which the great <hi>Gonſalve</hi> pretended to; and attended ſo long, till death put an end to his pretenſions, his hopes, his life, and his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: <hi>Porto Carrero</hi> had obtained the Pope's Bulls to ſucceed <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> in caſe he ſurvived him. On the other ſide, Prince <hi>Charles</hi> who was in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> had the Pope's Bulls for the three great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manderies of <hi>Spain:</hi> The Cardinal upon the firſt news of <hi>Porto Carrero</hi>'s Arming, without more ado, ſent towards him ſome Troops of his men at Armes, under the Conduct of <hi>Ville Fanno</hi> who reſtored peace to the Province, and beat the feeble Mutineer, into more wiſdom for the future: The beſt remedy for Troubles raiſed by particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is the Publick Force.</p>
            <p>This firſt Cloud thus diſſipated, the Cardinal brought the Court and Council to <hi>Madrid,</hi> as a place where the Liberty of the Regency would be more abſolute againſt the Grandees of <hi>Spain.</hi> A Courrier arrives there from <hi>Charles</hi> with Letters to Queen <hi>Germaine,</hi> the Council, and Grandees; containing his promiſe of coming into <hi>Spain</hi> the next Summer; with Order to all that owed him obedience, to pay it in the mean time intirely to the Cardinal. Theſe Letters came attended with private inſtructions to <hi>Adrian</hi> to found their opinions of the new Title of King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which he had aſſumed on the death of <hi>Ferdinand, Adrian</hi> ſpeaks of it to the Cardinal and Council;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50543:68"/>
they wonder at the Novelty, and Anſwer, That by <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s death, <hi>Charles</hi> had acquired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in <hi>Spain</hi>; That the Queen his Mother lived there ſole Heireſs of the Kingdoms. In their Letters to <hi>Charles,</hi> they remonſtrate that his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the quality of King, might cauſe trouble in the State, by furniſhing ſeditious Spirits with a pretence to take up Arms; and declare, that it was not Juſt to ſuffer the uſurpation of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, during the life of their natural Queen. <hi>Charles</hi> anſwered, that having taken upon him the quality of King at the requeſt of the Pope, and by advice of the Emperour; it would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him to quit it, but would be of prejudice to his Authority, and derogatory to his honour. He writes to the Cardinal to imploy his Credit to procure him the continuance of the name of King, and to proclaim him King throughout <hi>Spain.</hi> The Cardinal ſitts about it, and plyes it cloſely; called an Aſſembly of the Notable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Realm compoſed of Prelats, Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Counſellors of State, and cauſes overtures to be made, and the Affair propoſed to them by <hi>Laurence Galiud</hi> Counſellor of State, his Confident, a man of great Learning and Eloquence. Who declared to the Aſſembly the pittiful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and miſerable Eſtate of Queen <hi>Joan</hi> now beſides her ſelf, and uncapable to Govern; ſhews them the neceſſity of having a Prince, who might, at leaſt in name, fill up what ſhe could not indeed poſſeſs: That Authority was the ſoul of the Kingdom; and ſince it could not be found in the perſon of <hi>Joan,</hi> they muſt ſeek it in that of <hi>Charles:</hi> That it was no new thing for the Infantes
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50543:68"/>
of <hi>Spain</hi> to bear the Title of Kings in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents life-time. He cited Preſidents in the Reign of the <hi>Goths</hi> and their Succeſſours. In the Cloſe of his diſcourſe, he drew out of his boſome the Prince's Letters, not demanding advice, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding obedience; and concluded it better, By unanimous conſent to gratifie him in his deſires, with Congratulation to him for the Title he had aſſumed, than to refuſe him That he had already taken, and was reſolved to keep. The Biſhops, and Councellours of State, were of his Opinion: The Grandees, of the Contrary. <hi>Henry Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante,</hi> and <hi>Frederick D' Alva,</hi> ſwore before the Aſſembly, They would never endure ſuch an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. The Cardinal turns to them, and with a face and voice full of ſeverity ſayes, King <hi>Charles</hi> has no need of your Votes for the quality he Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes; nor did I aſſemble you, to deſire them: but of my free inclinations for your good to give you this occaſion by the freeneſs of your Suffrages and cheerful Conſent, to merit the good-will and favour of our Prince. But ſince you conceive that to be due to you of Right, which was done you of Courteſie; I'le make you know, you are not ſo neceſſary in this buſineſs as you miſtake your ſelves to be. And going out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil he ſent for the Governour of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and commanded him to cauſe <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to be proclaimed King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> by ſound of Trumpet in every Street of the Town; which was ſolemnly done the ſame day. <hi>Toledo</hi> followed the Example of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and joyfully made the like Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Such was the fruit of the Cardinals Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that the Grandees durſt not attempt any
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50543:69"/>
thing to hinder it. Where a Miniſter of State ſees, Diſcourſe and Perſwaſions too feeble to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, he muſt uſe ſeverity and force to back his Authority.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Arragon,</hi> followed not the example of <hi>Caſtile. Alfonſo</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> was Governour there by the Teſtament of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> The <hi>Arragonois,</hi> wonderful Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the Laws of their State, refuſed to give <hi>Charles</hi> the Title of King, during his mothers life: And, to ſecond the refuſal with violence, <hi>Peter Gironne,</hi> eldeſt Son of the Earl of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>renne,</hi> takes up Armes, attacques the Dutchy of <hi>Medina, Sedonia</hi> pretending a right to't; and beſieges <hi>Luzerre</hi> on the Sea ſide. The Cardinal ſends againſt him a light Army under the Conduct of <hi>Anthony Fonſeca,</hi> and with him a Miniſter of Juſtice to puniſh the Rebells with the Axe and Rope; <hi>Fonſeca</hi> goes directly to <hi>Luzerre,</hi> raiſeth the Siege, and puts the Rebells to flight; who not long after came from thoſe parts to increaſe the troubles raiſed by the Duke of <hi>Infantade</hi> on his ſide: Who keeping in mind the offence given by the Cardinal, by breaking off (as he ſaid) the Marriage between his Niece, and the Duke's Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, exclaimed againſt him in Words and Writing; publiſhing in his Manifeſtoes, that the Nobility of <hi>Spain</hi> were oppreſſed by the Cardinal (whom he called an unfrock'd Monk); That the grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> had ever defended the Crown; that it was more reaſonable the Cardinal ſhould obey them as Protectors of the State, than that they ſhould ſubmit to the Cardinal, who had nothing worthy the taking notice of, but the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50543:69"/>
quality he owed to the gift of blind Fortune; and knew no more than the ſeverities and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourſome <hi>Vagaries</hi> the Monks practiſe in their Cloyſters, when they perſecute one another.

               </gap>. That the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſpend their Revenues on their Vanity and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to the laſt Farthing; having nothing left but noiſe and exclamations, the feeble ſupport of their huffing and pride; when he could pay an Army with the Revenue of his Benefices. And leaving them thus to Champ on the bit, he gave them leiſure to acknowledge their fault and feebleneſs, and by the Experience of his powerful Authority to come to themſelves, and return to their duty; which moſt of them did, and among others the Duke of <hi>Infantade,</hi> who, after ſo many ſallies, and freaks, ſent him Letters of Submiſſion and teſtimonials of his Affection and Obedience. For they ſaw this Man intirely fix'd and reſolute in his deſigns; when juſt then he had rendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf capable to command Armies, learning daily the <hi>Theory</hi> and practick of the Art of Warr, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining himſelf with Diſcourſes of all points thereof, amongſt the ſageſt and moſt Ancient Captains. Beſides, he had a ſtanding Army of thirty thouſand men, raiſed out of the Cities and Burroughs of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had no other pay than Franchiſes and Immunities; Theſe Forces made him formidable to his perſonal Enemies, and to the Diſturbers of the publick peace. As wings carry the Eagle to the glory of Combat; ſo Armies,

the wings of Royal Authority, carry it againſt the Enemies of the State, to their ruine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, but to its own certain Victory and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
            <p>The next Year being 1516. the Cardinal ſent to <hi>Charles</hi> in <hi>Flanders, Diego Lopez Ajala,</hi> a perſon in whom he repoſed much confidence, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Letters Patents to confirm <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which gave him the Regency; to approve his Conduct; and to give him full Authority over the Council, the Tribunals of Juſtice, the Governours of Towns, and the Receivers and Treaſurers of the <hi>Finances. Diego</hi> had in his Inſtructions, To let the King know, that the Grant of theſe things by Letters Miſſive to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, was not ſufficient. This he did to take away all pretence from the Grandees for ſtirring the people againſt him, on colour that his Actions were not approved of by the Prince. For upon his ſetting a foot thirty thouſand men of the Militia of the Towns and Cities which received Immunities on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for pay; the great Ones of <hi>Spain</hi> gave out that theſe violent Courſes tended to the ſubverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the State That he Armed the people againſt them, and with deſign firſt to deſtroy them, and then to ruine the People; That his irregular Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and exorbitant Pride had tranſported him into a fantaſtick extravagancy of Acting the Captain, who had never handled any Arms but a Breviary; nor worn any Armour but a Frock. Inſomuch that when he ſent <hi>Japie</hi> of <hi>Segonia</hi> to make Levies of the Militia at <hi>Valladolid,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, inſtigated by <hi>Henry Almirant</hi> and others, ran to their Arms, impriſoned <hi>Japie,</hi> fortified
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50543:70"/>
the Town; and rolling the Cannons to the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, cryed openly in the Streets, This is againſt <hi>Ximenes</hi> the Tyrant of the people. The like fury was practiſed in the Towns neer <hi>Valladolid</hi>; and paſſing forward, like Fire in a Foreſt, drew the Cities of <hi>Leon, Burgos,</hi> and many more, into the like Revolt. The Cardinal was of opinion that violent Remedies would heighten the diſeaſe, and inflame the more; and inclined to reduce the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers to their duty by the wayes of Sweetneſs and Gentleneſs. Hence it was, that he writ to them of <hi>Valladolid</hi> that had begun the diſorder, That he never intended to infringe their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, or violate their immunities: But that, if they had any to exempt them from the Levies of the Militia, they ought to make them known to the Council; where he would protect them to the utmoſt of his power.</p>
            <p>But Reaſon and Gentleneſs are ſometimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to greater Inſolences in the people: They of <hi>Valladolid</hi> ſent the Cardinal an arrogant Anſwer, that they had nothing to do with him, nor the Council, for the preſervation of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; but knew well enough how to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them by their Armes againſt his manifeſt Tyranny; and yet doubtleſs this was the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the great Ones in the mouth of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. They ſend into <hi>Flanders</hi> a ſolemn Embaſſy to <hi>Charles</hi> againſt the Cardinal, to repreſent the peril he put the State of <hi>Spain</hi> in. The Cardinal, whoſe prudence and courage crowned all his enterprizes with good ſucceſs, ſent alſo into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>; and by the negotiation of his <hi>Diego Lopez,</hi> a man of Judgement and Dexterity, prepoſſeſſed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50543:71"/>
               <hi>Charles</hi> and made it appear to him, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts in <hi>Spain</hi> were effects of the envy and malice of the great Ones. Moreover, he ordered him to preſs for the Confirmation he deſired, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that if it were not ſent him, he would quit the management of Affairs, and go to <hi>Toledo</hi> to enjoy there that Repoſe which is not to be found at Court.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs of the Militia was for ſome time interrupted and laid aſide, till theſe Seditious were baniſhed <hi>Spain.</hi> But (as the inſtitution thereof by the Cardinal was upon grounds of prudence, and very neceſſary to the Kingdom) <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, a Judicious Prince, Re-eſtabliſhed it in the year 1565. long after the deceaſe of <hi>Ximenes.</hi> The Training of the People to Warr, is the fortifying of the State. And the prudent Counſels of a Miniſter of State, who deſigns the good of the publick, are durable; and Time, the Father of truth, diſſipating the Factions and Fictions of thoſe that Envy him, give them the glorious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to ſerve after his death, for the rule of good Conduct.</p>

            <p>THe Affairs of the <hi>Marine,</hi> claimed no leſs ſhare in the cares of the Cardinal, than the other Affairs of <hi>Spain.</hi> The death of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the malady of Queen <hi>Joan,</hi> the abſence and immatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Charles</hi> had made way for diſorders to creep in, to their Ruine. The Cardinal re-eſtabliſhes at <hi>Sevil</hi> the ancient Methods for Regulating the Maritine Affairs, re-fitts the number of Men of Warr neceſſary for defence of the Coaſt; and Chaſing Pyrats, Manns and furniſhes them with Cannon, Powder, Bullets, and Victuals. <hi>Diego Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbo</hi> the Admiral, ſon of the great <hi>Chriſtopher Columbo</hi> who filled the new World with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> with the Treaſures of the new World, addreſſes himſelf to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal as Regent of the Kingdom; beſeeching him to extend his Compaſſion and Juſtice to the Iſles of the Ocean depending on the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> where the mercileſs <hi>Spaniards</hi> treated the Natives ill, committing inhuman Cruelties and uſing them worſe than Mules or Aſſes, forcing them to carry burdens, and to undergo Labours and Toyler intolerable; That theſe poor Iſlanders were men, and carryed in their faces the image of God as well as the Spaniards; That if they were duller and more ignorant than the Spaniards, they were alſo better and more innocent than they.

to the relief of the Iſlanders, of whom ſome were killed daily by the Spaniards in their Sugar-works, ſent diſpatches to <hi>Charles</hi> on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, deſiring him to do therein as he thought fit. <hi>Charles,</hi> by advice of the Flemings, and without the privity of the Cardinal, commanded 400 <hi>Moors</hi> brought from the Land of <hi>Negroes</hi> into <hi>Portugal,</hi> to be ſent into the Iſlands to labour in the Sugar-works, and eaſe the Iſlanders, who were naturally weak and feeble. The Cardinal, adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of this Order, diſpatched a Courrier to <hi>Charles</hi> to put him in mind of the inconveniencies might enſue upon the introduction of theſe <hi>Negroes</hi> who were a ſtrong and Warlike people, and would queſtionleſs teach the Iſlanders the uſe of Armes, and the Art of Warr, which would one day cauſe a notable Revolt. <hi>Charles</hi> communicates to his Council the Advices of the Cardinal; the Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings divert him from following them; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, This Advice proceeded from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Ambition becauſe he was not conſulted with in the Affair: But in 1522. (5 years after the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals death) <hi>Charles</hi> felt to his coſt the peril the Iſlands were in, occaſioned by the flighting of that Counſel; for the <hi>Moors,</hi> taking up Arms at the Iſle of St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> Attacqued the Town of that name, and had put all to Fire and Sword, if not prevented by the valour of <hi>Melchior Caſtre,</hi> and <hi>Francis D' Avila,</hi> who forced them to retreat and flee to the Mountains; and being beaten thence by the Admirals Army, they had the deſerts of their Rebellion in the puniſhment of the Axe and the Rope inflicted on them.</p>
            <p>The Warr of <hi>Navarr</hi> which happened in the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50543:73"/>
time that the Cardinal ordered the Affairs of the <hi>Marine,</hi> was an Evidence of his Courage and the haughtineſs of his Conduct: He ſent an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which ſtopped the Progreſs of the French more by the advantage of narrow and difficult wayes, than their Valour and Arms: and, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the <hi>Navarrois</hi> of occaſion to take up Armes again, and recalling home their Ancient and Lawful Lords, he pulled down the Walls of all their places of ſtrength, except <hi>Pampelun,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed all their Caſtles and Forts: which was afterwards of great advantage to <hi>Spain,</hi> which poſſeſſing <hi>Navarr</hi> without juſt Title, kept it by the force of the Garriſons placed there, and the weakneſs of the inhabitants. Great States are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Revolts, as groſs bodies to Feavers. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laga,</hi> a Martine Town of <hi>Spain</hi> takes up Arms, and cryes Liberty, on this occaſion. Complaint was made, that no puniſhment was inflicted on Robbers taken in the City, though Juſtice had been demanded; for the Criminal, by appeal from the ſentence of the Judges of the City to the Admiral of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the Soveraign Judge in places neer the Sea, oft eſcaped the puniſhments due to his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds: the people in Armes ran into the places ſubject to the Admiral's Juriſdiction, demoliſh the Tribunals of his Officers of Juſtice, beat down the Racks and Gibbets ſet up for marks of their Soveraignty, and, to maintain the ſedition, roll the Cannons off the Ramparts, ſhut the City Gates, and declare, that if the Cardinal would uſe his ordinary Violences to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of their Liberties, they knew how to defend them by Force. The Inhabitants brought into
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50543:74"/>
one place all their Utenſils of Braſs and Copper, and having melted them down, Caſt new Cannons, with the Armes of the City, and theſe words atop, <hi>The Defenders of the Liberty of</hi> Malaga, <hi>cauſed theſe Cannons to be Caſt.</hi> The Flemmings in <hi>Charles</hi>'s Court, thinking to draw the Envy and Blame of the Rebellion of <hi>Malaga,</hi> on the Cardinal's Conduct, who, they ſaid, was too harſh, and Rigorous for the people of <hi>Spain</hi>; encouraged thoſe of <hi>Malaga</hi> by Letters, to defend themſelves againſt his Violence, promiſing them their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance with <hi>Charles.</hi> But the Cardinal, ſlighting the threats of the Flemmings, carryed on his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs with Courage and Prudence; and like a ſage Pilot, who ſcorns to forſake the Helm in a Tempeſt, continued his Conduct; and applyed the Remedies he thought proper for theſe Popular Commotions, by ſending 6000 Foot, and 400 Horſe of the Militia of <hi>Spain,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Anthony Cueva,</hi> directly to <hi>Malaga</hi>; with Order to uſe the inhabitants as Enemies of the State. <hi>Cueva</hi> marches with theſe forces; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within two dayes March of the City, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, better adviſed, ſent their Deputies to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him Obedience. He goes thither, and enters the City, diſarmed the Rebels, and Hanged five only, for an Example, and Terrour to others. Thus, without Expence, without ſpilling the blood of the Subject, whereof a Miniſter of State ought to be alwayes ſparing; the Cardinal quenched the fire of Rebellion, kindled in a place from whence it might have eaſily dilated to the utter Conſumption of the ſoundeſt parts of the State. Of ſo great importance it is, that the

Authority of a Miniſter be intire, and like that of the Soveraign's it repreſents.</p>
            <p>The flames of Rebellion were no ſooner quenched in one part of <hi>Spain,</hi> but the Grandees blew them up in another; and alwayes with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to charge the Cardinals Conduct with the blame of the Confl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

They ſet up <hi>Velaſio Cuellar,</hi> high Treaſurer of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of the Finances, againſt the Cardinal; and, to engage him to Arm with more Ardour and Eagerneſs, they make <hi>Mary, Velaſio</hi> his Wife, of the party: who perſwaded him to ſeize <hi>Arevale,</hi> which he did, and Cantoned it with his Forces, whom he diſpoſed into ſeveral quarters, Fortified by him in that Countrey. The Admiral of <hi>Spain</hi> was the principal <hi>Boutefeu,</hi> and main Incendiary, and Ringleader of this new Commotion; he fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it, goes by Night to the Duches of the place, ſpeaks to the Inhabitants, encourages them to hold out ſtifly; promiſing them Succours of Men, and ſupplyes of Money, in caſe they were Aſſaulted; And that he would come in perſon to defend them from the Violences of the Regent, till the arrival of <hi>Charls</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. The Cardinal knew of theſe Troubles, and the Abettors thereof; and fearing to loſe <hi>Velaſio,</hi> a perſon of quality, he tryed every way before that of force to reduce him: he writ, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted, intreated, and threatned if he obeyed not, but all to no purpoſe: This obliged him to ſend thither ſome Regiments of Horſe, and Foot, with a train of Artillery, under the Command of <hi>Cornelius.</hi> The Forces arrived at the place, and the Captain ſummoned <hi>Velaſio</hi> to render himſelf,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50543:75"/>
declaring that in caſe of diſobedience, he would put all to Fire and Sword, and him to death by the hand of a Hang-man, and tranſmit to his poſterity the infamy of his Crime. <hi>Velaſio,</hi> ſeeing himſelf deceived by the Admiral, and other Grandees, who had made him promiſes of Forces and other Succours they could not perform, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted his own ſafety, obeyed, opened the Gates; and received Grace and Pardon, inſtead of the Puniſhment he deſerved.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal having appeaſed this Sedition alſo, without Charge or Blood, gave <hi>Charls</hi> Advice thereof, and intreated him to cauſe the Admiral to be puniſhed, as the Author of all thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that aroſe in <hi>Spain</hi>; whoſe proceedings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, by a pregnant inſtance, That th' Obedience due to Kings is a very brittle and frail thing, if not upheld by fear, and the reverence of Majeſty. To preſerve which, the Cardinal inſtituted the Militia in the Kingdom, that he might have Armes ready at hand to reſiſt the motions of Inſurrections, and ſuppreſs them in the birth, without giving them time of growth and increaſe. And, to render the ſtrength of the Militia more conſiderable he cauſed a great quantity of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery to be made: and filled Arſenals with it in the four Corners of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the Conveniency of drawing them where it ſhould be neceſſary for defence of the Royal Authority, with theſe fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Engines. The Cannon is the laſt reaſon of Kings, and, if not the beſt, yet certainly the beſt able to defend them.</p>

            <p>THhough the Cardinal, Regent of <hi>Spain</hi> after <hi>Ferdinands</hi> death, had in his hand the Regal Authority, yet hitherto you have ſeen him exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe only the Office of a Phyſitian to cure the diſtempers of it; But now that he hath reſtored it to health and peace, he bends all his thoughts to the exerciſe of Juſtice, the principal buſineſs of Kings. He began with the Governours of Towns and Cities, ſending Judges impartial and not ſubject to Corruption, to inquire into their demeanour, and inform him of their deportment and behaviour in their places; and where he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood they were Tyrannical to the oppreſſion of the poor, who groaned under their violences, he depoſed them from their dignities; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made their names infamous, left them more miſerable than thoſe they oppreſſed. He of <hi>Toledo</hi> was the firſt example of his Juſtice. The Officers of Juſtice who behaved themſelves ill, had the puniſhments they deſerved: ſome of them who had been more covetous than Juſt, having ſold the right of the Poor to the purſe of the rich, were whipped through the Streets of thoſe Towns where they had been in Commiſſion; with a Hang-man at their backs, and before them, a Trumpet who proclaimed their ſhame in the Enormity of their Crime. The like uſage had they who in places of Judicature had exacted ſees that were not due. The greater Gentry who were Juſtices in the Countreys whereof
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50543:76"/>
they were Lords: thoſe Eagles which break through the Spider-webb, could not eſcape the puniſhment due to their violences, by being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the Juriſdiction and power of the Judges: for the Cardinal cauſed them to be handled with the Rigour they deſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arrojou</hi> a Knight of the Order of <hi>Calatrava,</hi> acted in his Commandery of <hi>Zoritan</hi> like a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Countrey he Uſurpes. The Maids and Women whom Nature had made moſt Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and Vertue moſt Amiable, he Sacrificed to his extravagancies: And what Love could not obtain, Force raviſhed from them: Thoſe were taken from their Parents, and theſe from their Husbands, to ſerve the pleaſure of this Beaſt; The Cardinal ſent a power Competent to Attaque him, but by flight to <hi>Flanders</hi> he changed his place, but eſcaped not his puniſhment: The Cardinal by Letters ſignifies to <hi>Charles</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances and Enormities of this Ruffian, and the puniſhment due to his Crimes, and prayed him to make him an Example of his Juſtice by ſeverity anſwerable to the heinouſneſs of his Actions.</p>
            <p>The Treaſurers of the Finances who had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezelled the publick Moneys (which are the blood of the people) were ſtrictly Examined and Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſiſted, nor were theſe Spunges ſqueezed only, but puniſhed for their Rapines.</p>
            <p>Theſe Actions of Juſtice drew an univerſal Love to the Cardinal from the people of <hi>Spain,</hi> who reverenced his Name; and moſt of the Grandees ſought his Friendſhip, with Oaths and proteſtations to defend his Authority as their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50543:76"/>
Lives; and not without reaſon. For, Juſtice the Mother of other Vertues, being the Daughter of Heaven and Queen of the Earth, gains them that Exerciſe it the ſavour of God, and good will of men.</p>
            <p>The happineſs of the Kingdom was this great mans Aim; and in order to attaining a compleat felicity he continued the Exerciſe of his Juſtice in Reducing every part of the State into their proper bounds. The military Orders of Knights in <hi>Spain</hi> are divers, and of great Latitude; the greatneſs of their power made them uſurp on others within their Juriſdiction, and abuſively aſſume Priviledges not due to them: But the Cardinal forced them to make reſtitution of what was not theirs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated their Juriſdictions, and Abrogated the Priviledges they had arrogated to themſelves. The favour of Court having introduced more Members into the Council of State, than Merit or Vertue, had filled it with Perſons unworthy that place. But he who knew that the Miniſters who ſerve in this Sacred Temple of Policy ought to be perſons of the greateſt experience and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar integrity, purged it of all thoſe who were unfit for that dignity, and filled their places with better men.</p>
            <p>Having reformed the Council he turned to the Train, and Attendants of the Court; where the importunity and impudence of the Mean, and the Recommendations of the great Ones, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a multitude of men who had no other Vertue to boaſt of than a confident Miene, a proud Gate, and vain Diſcourſe. He reſolved to Caſhiere theſe droniſh <hi>Lurdanes,</hi> and ſtop
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50543:77"/>
thoſe unprofitable Mouths that ate the Kings Bread, but did him no Service: which he did with one daſh of his Penn, Croſſing out the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances made them, who were ſo leight in their Vanities, that they were blown away with a Feather. That Monarch wants a Guardian to order his Affairs, who by the Penſions he beſtows, feeds with the Bowels of his People, ſuch men as are neither neceſſary for him, nor ſerviceable to the publick.</p>
            <p>This Retrenchment was Juſt: but his taking from two famous Hiſtorians of that time, the Penſions given them as due to their Labours, is marked as unjuſt in the Hiſtory of his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Gonſales D' Oviedo</hi> were croſſed out amongſt the Retainers; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, with their Penns, the Loſs of their Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione; ſtaining his name with ſpots of ſo black a dye, as the whole ſeries of the paſt Age hath not been able to waſh out. But it may be he was forced to this; By their example, to take from others all cauſe of Complaint. But what an example is this to robb them of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward who deſerve it, and take away the Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of two Learned men who ſerved the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Or if he thought this neceſſary to be done, he ſhould have made up their Penſions out of his own fortunes, and paid them out of that eſtate which was ſufficient to pay an Army.</p>
            <p>Peradventure 'twas <hi>Charls</hi> his pleaſure it ſhould be ſo. Had he ſo little credit with <hi>Charles</hi> whoſe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he preſerved for him, as not to prevail with him to continue the Penſions of two Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who could have given <hi>Charles</hi> and his name
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50543:77"/>
immortal Glory? This ſeems ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his Severity, and call it Inconſiderate. But the greatneſs of his Conduct in other matters, his excellent Juſtice, and ſingular favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to oblige men of Vertue, make it hardly credible that ſo great a perſon, who had done ſo much for Learning, ſhould commit ſo groſs a ſault; but give cauſe to impute it to ſome other Miniſter, whoſe enmity againſt theſe Hiſtorians, might have engaged him in ſo foul a fact. Thus <hi>Alvarez Gomez</hi> in the Hiſtory of his life excuſes him; and obſerves that he lamented ſeveral times, that occaſion was often given him to exerciſe juſt Severities in taking from men what they unjuſtly poſſeſſed; and not to expreſs his Liberality, in giving unto them thoſe Largeſſes he eſteemed due from him to Vertue.</p>
            <p>To do good to men of merit, is to pour Oyle into Lamps, which proves no leſs uſefull to others in the light they receive from them, than benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to them in enabling them to impart it.</p>
            <p>That the Exchequer be full, and the Treaſury of the Prince abound in Caſh, is certainly one of the things moſt neceſſary for the State; this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it, this augments its Grandeur, and renders it formidable to its Enemies: The Cardinal who harboured in his heart as one common Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, an extraordinary zeal for the Service of his Maſter, and no leſs affection for the good of the people; deſigned to fill the Treaſuries of <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſerve the glory of his Maſter; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intention to inrich his King by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhment of his people; ſaying, Thrift and Frugality, Parſimony and good Husbandry, were
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50543:78"/>
great Revenues to a monyed King, as the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> And that Gifts made without reaſon and againſt Juſtice, are the Moths that eat through his Baggs, and the Thieves that empty his Coffers. <hi>Charles,</hi> in four moneths of his Reign, gave away to his Courtiers (or rather Leeches of his Court) two Millions of Gold: This he ſaid, with grief, to ſee ſo prodigious an exceſs, of Profuſeneſs and Laviſhment: Not but that he allowed Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty place among the Vertues of a Prince, but that he would have it exerciſed with Moderation and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Admiral, <hi>Pacieco D' Aſcalone,</hi> and <hi>Henry Fortune,</hi> had obtained of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion a piece of <hi>Lievres</hi> of Gold, charged on the Revenue of <hi>Peru</hi>; and ſhould have received it at the return of the Plate-Fleet. The Cardinal made void, and annulled theſe Gifts; And though <hi>Fortune</hi> was of Kin to his good Maſter <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he took from him his Million as well as from the others. Kings, ſaid he, ought to diſpenſe the effects of their Juſtice, indifferently to perſons of all ſorts; but thoſe of their Liberality to them only, who ſerve their Perſons or the Publick; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage others by their Labours, and excell them in the fidelity of their Services, and the Dignity of their Vertues. The Revenue of Princes, though great in it ſelf, is alwayes too little for the neceſſities of State, and paſſing through many hands, is much diminiſhed ere it arrive at their Coffers. The Cardinal to provide againſt this inconvenience, gave the Offices of the Finances, to men fit for them; perſons under no neceſſity to tempt them to Rapine. And choſe for Surinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50543:78"/>
of the Kings moneys, a Lord by Birth, one of the Nobleſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> and in Eſtate the Richeſt in the Kingdom. Spunges full of water, take in no more, though ſteeped in it.</p>
            <p>Great Buildings, without good Foundations, ſwagg and come to Ruine. The <hi>Cardinal</hi> laid three Foundations neceſſary for Royalty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as on firm pillars, the Authority thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: The firſt is Juſtice, when the King diſpenſes it to his Subjects impartially, and without reſpect of perſons; when the Scepter affords relief to the poor and the weak, againſt the injuries of the Rich, and the Powerful. The ſecond, when the King hath a reſpect, and good value, for the Men of Warr, that give proofs of their Experience, and Valour, in the Service of his Warrs. The third, when the King doth not ſquander away his Revenue, but, by thrift and parſimony, keeps a good ſtock in Reſerve for Royal Enterprizes, which ought to be his ordinary Exerciſes; who, that he may be great, muſt do great things. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience had taught the Cardinal the truth of this ſage Maxim; for in four months of his Regency under <hi>Charles,</hi> by help of his Treaſure, he had compaſſed his deſigns, ended a Warr of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, calmed the Commotions of <hi>Spain,</hi> made ſure of <hi>Navarr,</hi> reduced <hi>Malaga</hi> to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, maintained ſtrong Garriſons on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, aſſured the Sea-coaſt, made incurſions into <hi>Africk,</hi> ſent a Naval Army againſt <hi>Algiers,</hi> and delivered <hi>Bugie, Pignon,</hi> and <hi>Melillo,</hi> from the Siege of <hi>Barbaroſſe,</hi> great Admiral of the <hi>Turks.</hi> If I (ſaid he) have done all theſe things, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the oppoſitions of my Enemies,

what cannot a King do, by his abſolute power, if he leave in his Treaſure a ſtock for Royal Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. Money being the ſinews of Warr, and the object of mens Affections, the Monarch who is Rich, becomes puiſſant in the one, and abſolute Maſter of the other.</p>
            <p>The glory the Cardinal had acquired by his prudent management of the State, and his good Actions to private perſons, was greatly augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Violences of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and misfortunes of <hi>Africk,</hi> which brought a ſtronger King at his feet, to implore his Aſſiſtance. The King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> Son and Heir of <hi>Jabet Albuzen,</hi> was guilty of the Crime of being Neighbour to a Monarch, more powerful than he, and poſſeſſing a Crown convenient for the <hi>Ottoman.</hi> This brought a Warr upon him; <hi>Barbaroſſe</hi> who had command from the <hi>Turk</hi> his Maſter to oute him from his Throne, was the more willing to attacque him, in that he had obtained from the Ottoman Poſte, a promiſe to ſucceed in the Throne and Title of the King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> in caſe he Conquered him; on Condition nevertheleſs to hold it of the Crown Imperial of the Turks. The <hi>Corſayre</hi> undertakes it; and, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering <hi>Tunis,</hi> enters the City, and drives out the King; who diſpoiled of his Eſtate, embarks for <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſeek relief in Chriſtendome for his diſaſters: in his paſſage he was ſet upon with Tempeſts and Storms; which, though leſs than thoſe he met with at Land, put his Veſſel in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but he eſcaped a wreck at Sea, being reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a greater at Land, which had already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of his Crown, his eſtate, his repoſe, and reputation, and had more miſeries in ſtore
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50543:79"/>
for him during the reſt of his life, which the Sea might have ſwallowed up, and therein all his Loſſes and Calamities. He Arrived in Spain, and threw himſelf into the Cardinals Arms, who received him, gave him Retinue befitting a King, comforted his miſeries with kind entertainment, and promiſes of Re-eſtabliſhment in his Throne. The Miniſter that repreſents a King, and holds his Scepter in his abſence, ought to do Royal Actions; and, to reach forth a helping hand to diſtreſſed Princes, is one of the greateſt of theſe; for if, the Man that helps a Man, is a God to that Man, the King who is a God on Earth, and his Miniſter in his ſtead, ſuccouring a perſecuted King, is a God to a God.</p>

            <p>THE ſame Year <hi>John Rio,</hi> a Spaniſh Pyrate, returned from his Courſe, having taken many <hi>Genoa</hi>-Veſſels, and Rich in Booty and Prizes, and at Anchor in the Port of <hi>Carthagena Nueva,</hi> where he enjoyed other mens goods, by the Laws of Pyracy: when ſome Ships of Warr, arrived from <hi>Genes,</hi> attacqued him in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and, being well Armed, and fighting for the intereſt of their Republick, they took this Sea-robber, and carryed away his perſon, and Veſſels. But this Action done within a Port of <hi>Spain,</hi> was an offence againſt the Majeſty of the King: the Cardinal reſents it as ſuch, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth an Edict, commanding all the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> to depart the Kingdom within fifteen dayes, upon pain of Confiſcation of their goods, and of their Lives; and in the mean time cauſed ſeizure to be made of their Goods, wherever they could be found; This Alarum'd the Republike, ſeeing their Commerce, to which they owe their Maintenance and Grandeur, broken on that ſide, and their Allyance much altered: They betake themſelves to their remedy, and ſend Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to <hi>Charles</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to diſavow the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe Ships which in the Port of <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene,</hi> had violated the reſpect due to his Crown, which had met by the way the puniſhment they ſhould have received from the Republick, had they arrived at <hi>Genes,</hi> which the Tempeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, in taking from them both their Ships and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50543:80"/>
their Lives: Therefore, they implored his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty not to impute that to their State, which was the Act of two or three private perſons; <hi>Charles</hi> was ſatisfied with this ſubmiſſion, and revoked the Edict publiſhed by the Cardinal. But he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jealous for the honour of his Maſter, which had a greater ſhare in his thoughts, than the care of his own life, holding the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> to be very Cautelous people, and deſirous to penetrate the depth of their intentions; upon information re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they held intelligence with the French about the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> deferred the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of the Revocation, and Reſtitution of the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> goods, till he had ſent Ambaſſadours to <hi>Genes</hi> to clear the doubt; but the Ambaſſadours finding the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> ſincerely inclined to keep good Correſpondence with <hi>Spain,</hi> he made reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> of their Goods, and their liberty of Commerce. The Honour of Kings is their true Patrimony, preferrable to their eſtates. Their Miniſters ought carefully to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and couragiouſly defend it; for as bodies without ſouls, which give them life, are eaſily corrupted, ſo Monarchies without Honour and Reputation decline and come to Ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spain</hi> had long ſince laid the Foundations of Dominion over <hi>Italy</hi>; and the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> now entred into <hi>Spain,</hi> carryed on the building. <hi>Maximilian,</hi> Grand-father of <hi>Charles</hi> paſſed the Mountains on that deſign. <hi>Charles</hi> diſpatched a Courrier to the Cardinal to demand his Advice in the Affairs of <hi>Italy:</hi> the Cardinal ſent it him, and adviſed to divert <hi>Maximilian</hi> from the Siege of <hi>Breſeia</hi> then in deſign, and to turn his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50543:81"/>
Forces againſt <hi>Milan</hi>; for that City being once taken, the other would be eaſily Conquered; that, to render himſelf yet more conſiderable in <hi>Italy,</hi> he muſt gain the Popes affection, and make uſe of him upon occaſion; to quiet the troubles of the Countrey, and to ſerve himſelf of his Authority, as a new <hi>Peru</hi> to furniſh moneys for the Warr, by obtaining <hi>Cruſadaes</hi> for <hi>Spain,</hi> which (as uſual) would bring a Croſs on Gold and Silver, and raiſe him a Conſiderable Revenue: He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed <hi>Maximilian</hi> to threaten the Pope into fear, to force his Condeſcenſion to what he would not willingly grant; and counſelled <hi>Charles</hi> to make choice of a perſon Generous, Vigilant, and of great Authority, to be Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to gain from the Pope a perſon of innocent Manners, and of a gentle and tractable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to be <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>; For on this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the good of all great Affairs, and the peace of the Nation. Theſe Counſels the Princes of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> did then make uſe of to their great advantage, and purſue the ſame to this day: For the ſage Anſwers of a great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter conſulted with in affairs, whoſe like do often fall out in a State, are the voice of an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which foreſees things to come, and guides the deſigns of Poſterity.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> had been long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the falſity of Religions, contrary to the Chriſtian; The <hi>Moors</hi> Preached there the Errours of the <hi>Alcoran</hi>; and the Jews the ſop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries of their <hi>Talmud</hi>; and though they had woon the one and the other to the faith of Chriſt, yet the Jews whoſe Religion is Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50543:81"/>
relapſed often to their former Worſhip, Apoſtatizing from the faith they came to profeſs. This expoſed them to the rigours of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, being daily dragged before that ſevere Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal. To deliver themſelves from the pains they deſerved, they Deputed the principal amongſt them, to attend <hi>Charles</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and beſeech him to permit them to enjoy that which God gave man when he ſent him into the World, the Liberty of Choice in a Free will; That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion could not be impoſed by force, but inſtilled by Diſcourſe; And that he would grant them who were born in Judaiſm, liberty to Judaiſe as their Fathers had done, or become Chriſtians at their pleaſure: In acknowledgement of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, they offered him eight hundred thouſand Crowns of Gold: <hi>Charles</hi> aſſembles his Council to adviſe on this propoſal, they give their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in favour of the Jews, and that in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity he was reduced to, he ſhould accept the eight hundred thouſand Crowns: The Cardinal, Advertiſed by his Agent in his Maſters Court of the Counſels of the Flemmings, ſent a Courrier to <hi>Charles,</hi> adviſing him not to meddle with Gods right, that Religion was above Crowns, that Heaven knew to maintain its intereſt againſt his incroachments, that he ought rather to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Piety of King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> his Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who in the neceſſities of the Warrs of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr,</hi> had refuſed ſix hundred thouſand Crowns of Gold offered by the Jews for the like indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: <hi>Charles</hi> followed the Cardinals Advice: That King is unworthy the Aſſiſtance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for preſerving his eſtate, who deſpiſes the

Eſtate of God, which is Religion; and God who expelled out of the Temple, the Tradeſmen, who made it a place of Merchandiſe, outes thoſe Monarchs from the Throne who ſell for money the reſpect due to Divine Worſhip. The inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt whereof a good King and his Miniſters, preferr before the reaſon and intereſt of State.</p>
            <p>Ill Cuſtomes never dye, or grow old at Court, though good ones preſently make their <hi>Exit.</hi> The Government of Provinces and Towns in <hi>Spain,</hi> was heretofore committed to the perſons beſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, and of greateſt integrity in the Kingdom; Time which carries away the beſt of things abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed this cuſtome, and made it abſolete; Favour brought in ſuch men whoſe faults and defects the blindneſs of Court diſcovers not. The Cardinal reſolved to re-eſtabiſh what he found Juſt in the ancient Cuſtomes of <hi>Spain,</hi> beſtowed the ſame Governments on men whoſe nobleneſs of blood and integrity of life rendred them the moſt Conſiderable in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But that the puiſſance of their Families, and ſupport of their Kindred, being perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, might not debauch their integrity, and encourage them to violence, he Removed them to places diſtant; imploying them in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Towns and Provinces, where they could expect no ſupport but from their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. He who adds greatneſs of dignity, to that of birth and quality, tempts vertue, and needs a Bridle to retain it within the bounds of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:50543:83"/>Theſe eares of the Cardinal tended to the Glory of Vertue; the aime and mark of his deſigns, being the advancement of vertuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe fortunes he raiſed in his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his own beneficence, or the Kings, by his procurement. He gave <hi>Adrian Florent,</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tricht,</hi> Dean of <hi>Lovayn,</hi> and his companion in the Government of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Tortoſa,</hi> with the Office of Inquiſitor General of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was an advantagious ſtep for him to a Cardinalſhip; and to mount him thence to the Papal Chair. He preferred <hi>Alfonſo Manri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez</hi> to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Cordova.</hi> And the Sieur <hi>Motta</hi> of <hi>Burgos,</hi> a perſon well verſt in Theology, and Secretary to <hi>Charles,</hi> to that of <hi>Badacos</hi>; The advancement of <hi>Motta</hi> was great in appearance, but in effect mean; his Vertue and Learning had rendered him conſiderable in the Court of <hi>Charles,</hi> and that of <hi>Rome</hi>; After the death of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> the King gave him the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick of <hi>Toledo</hi>; and the Pope, a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Cap. But theſe Gifts were made him, when he could not enjoy them; and Fortune gave him only a View, but no Livery and Seizen of the Grandeurs of the World. The Letters of the King, and thoſe of the Pope, which conveyed to him thoſe eminent digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſound him on his death-bed; So that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf on the brink of the Grave, he took the Letters out of a Box, and gave them one of his principal Domeſticks to Read. Having heard them, he diſcourſed of the vain pretenſions of Court, and the cheating hopes of the World, that the ſuteſt courſe for a vertuous man to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50543:84"/>
ſteer, is to conform to the will of God, and condoled their misfortune to ſee their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fall with him into the Duſt. But this care of the Cardinal to advance perſons of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, evinces he was not guilty of retrenching the Penſions of the two Hiſtorians afore mentioned; But rather that of Learned men, the moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Laborious for the publick, are not the greateſt favourites of Fortune, whether it be for want of importunity in purſuing it, or of Friends to introduce them into the Theatre of Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo that their Vertue continues indigent, like the Sick man on the brink of the Pool, which makes Poverty often the Siſter of Wit.</p>
            <p>Theſe things happened in 1516. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year will be the laſt of the Adminiſtration, and Life of the Cardinal: In the moneth <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> this Year, he entertained himſelf one Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſome Divines of Repute; and their Diſcourſes being of matters of holineſs advanced far in the night. One of the Domeſticks tells the Cardinal, A Courrier from <hi>Africk,</hi> then at the door, deſired to ſpeak with him; he Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to admit him, the Courrier delivered his Letters, the Cardinal read them to himſelf; and then turning to them that ſtood by, with a Compoſed and Serene Countenance told them, The News is, that the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> have beaten us at <hi>Algiers,</hi> and our Army Defeated. But the Loſs is not great, for <hi>Spain</hi> is delivered of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Malefactours. Vagabonds, and Aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, whereof our Army was Compoſed.

Realm, of murtherers, thieves, robbers, and other-ill Livers. Having ſaid this, he continued his Theological diſcourſe with admirable vigour of ſpirit, and force of wit: The prudence of a Governour ought to be attended with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in publike misfortune, that the ſerenity of his countenance, and alacrity of Diſcourſe, may extenuate and leſſen the ills that befall; And that Miniſter deſerves well of the publike, who bears up in good hopes of the State, notwithſtanding the Loſſes and Calamities that ſeem to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him.</p>

            <p>'TIS natural to the Spaniards, to purſue their Reſolutions with a ſettled and unmoveable conſtancy; ſo that 'tis equally difficult to divert them from purſuing their deſignes as to extort from them what they are poſſeſſed of by their Atchievements. The Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> envying the Cardinal's Authority had reſolved his ruine, as appears before; and what demonſtration ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they made of Amity, yet the Leaven of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie remaining in their hearts, ſet them on afreſh to carry on their deſign, and endeavour the deſtruction of his, by eſtabliſhing of another's Authority! They prevail with <hi>Adrian</hi> his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate in the Government, to write to <hi>Charles</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> that the Cardinal was a proud man, impatient of a companion, and did all after his own humour and fancy, without conſulting him; that he wanted ſtrength to reſiſt the ſallies of his daring and hardy ſpirit: And therefore became his humble Suppliant for a ſecond to Aſſiſt him in the Government; and, by their joynt-Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to balance the Exceſſive power of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which might otherwiſe prove in time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to his Majeſty's. <hi>Charles</hi> ſent <hi>Laxaus</hi> a Flemming, and of His Council, to make up the Triumviral in the Government of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Grandees who knew that what is divided, is of leſs force, rejoyced to ſee the Cardinal's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in that predicament; and went all to meet <hi>Laxaus</hi> with great Demonſtations of honour:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50543:85"/>
The Cardinal ſtaid in his Lodgings to attend his coming; and as <hi>Laxaus</hi> was conducted to him, he came no farther to meet him, than to his Ante-chamber, where he received him with a gravity befitting his Perſon, and Dignity. And as it is a principal part of the dexterity of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State, To know men, he ſtudied the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and humour of <hi>Laxaus</hi>; and finding him a downright Flemming, more enclined to Pleaſures and Jollity, than ſerious Affairs; he thought his Enemies made choice of a weak Rival to confront his Authority: and, to let them know he ſlighted him, ſhewed greater reſpect to <hi>Adrian,</hi> than him. Yet <hi>Adrian,</hi> led by the Noſe by the Cardinal's Enemies, made uſe of the occaſions they offered him to attacque his Authority. Letters Patents were to be diſpatched and publiſhed in ſome Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of importance; The Grandees adviſe <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Laxaus</hi> to ſign them firſt, and to take up the moſt honourable place of ſignature: They did ſo, and then ſent the Letters to the Cardinal to be Signed. Who having Courage anſwerable to the Grandeur of his Spirit, obſerved this Flemmiſh Bravado of Ambition, and ſlighted it; cauſing the Letters to be torn in pieces by his Secretary in his preſence, and ordered others to be made ready, which he ſigned alone, and cauſed them to be executed as effectually, as if ſigned by all three; and, during the courſe of his Adminiſtation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued it thence forward, though before he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Adrian</hi> the reſpect of ſending them to him to be ſigned; which he forbore after this time, that the Contempt he had deſigned for him, might fall on himſelf. The Flemmings durſt not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50543:86"/>
reſiſt his Authority, fearing his Anger; and that, by provoking him, they might prejudice <hi>Charles,</hi> who would impute to them the diſorders that might follow; <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> brother to <hi>Charles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in <hi>Spain,</hi> under the Guard and Conduct of the Cardinal.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, to deſtroy this great Authority, by more powerful means; they propoſed to <hi>Charles,</hi> to put the Scepter of <hi>Spain</hi> in his abſence, into the hand of a Prince of his Houſe, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to intreat <hi>Maximilian</hi> th' Emperour, his Grand-father, or <hi>Lewis</hi> Count-Palatin, his Couſin, to come into <hi>Spain</hi> for that purpoſe. Some were for making <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Governour, others for the high Chancellour <hi>Savage,</hi> but all for outing the Cardinal. <hi>Maximilian</hi> was buſie in <hi>Italy:</hi> The <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> is ſo far above that of <hi>Alemain,</hi> that the Count <hi>Palatin</hi> was not likely to bear up to the height, requiſite for the Government; and, if the abſolute power were committed to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> it might be feared he would not quit it when deſired. So that of all the perſons propoſed in Council, the Chancellour only ſtood. The Cardinal had intelligence of all tranſactions in <hi>Charles</hi> his Councils, and deſired him by Letter, to grant him leave to quit the Government, and retire to his Dioceſs, rather than ſend him a new Companion, with whom he muſt renew the conteſts with the former. That the nature of Government is ſuch, that, to carry it on with Authority, it muſt be given to one alone. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, <hi>Savage</hi> came into <hi>Spain,</hi> with the Title of Governour, as well as the Cardinal: But made no other progreſs in the State, than to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50543:86"/>
eſtabliſh there, venality of Offices in Judicature, Council, and Court; to baniſh vertue; and fill his purſe. For it is obſerved, that in his four moneths ſtay in <hi>Spain,</hi> he drew away five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Crowns, which he carryed into <hi>Flanders:</hi> The Cardinal vexed to ſee thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Orders his care and pains had eſtabliſhed in the State, ruined in a moment; and that Offices formerly the Rewards of Vertue and merit, were now put to ſale by the Avarice of this Flemming; and poſſeſſed by them who had more money to buy, than capacity to mannage them; complained to <hi>Charles,</hi> and with a liberty full of reſpect writ him his mind; Remonſtrating to him, That great Kings obtain from God the enjoyment of their Crowns, and from men the Reverence due to them, ſo long as they govern the people with Juſtice and Integrity; That in reſpect of the great weight of the Government, God allowed them to call Aſſiſtants for their eaſe and ſupport in the Management of great Eſtates; That their Juſtice and Vigilance ought to be as Conſpicuous in the choice of their Aſſiſtants, as in the Government of their Subjects: That a Prince is Reſponſible for his Miniſters, and Chargeable with the Crimes they commit in the State, if he knows and ſuffers them. He prayed him in all humility, that he would come into <hi>Spain,</hi> to eſtabliſh there by his preſence, that order which the Strangers he had ſent thither, had deſtroyed; and to keep the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple within the bounds of their duty, who were now apparently raiſed to a boldneſs that tended to the ſubverſion of the State; being ſo licentious that every one not only ſaid, but Printed what he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50543:87"/>
pleaſed; and attacqued his Authority by publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Juſtifying their complaints againſt him.</p>
            <p>This couragious Liberty of Advertiſing <hi>Charles</hi> of the diſorders and miſdemeanours of the Flemmings in <hi>Spain,</hi> drew on the Cardinal the hatred of many to ſuch a degree as obliged him to provide for the ſafety of his life; his guard was more ſtrictly and conſtantly kept, his meat watched to prevent poiſon, and this care ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to his bed, and tryal made of the water that was ſprinkled in his Chamber. But all this caution could not ſave him from that Lingering Poyſon, which, the Spaniards write, deſtroyed his health, and at laſt his life: whereof you ſhall hear in due time.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Spain</hi> was at this time full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Libells, againſt the Flemmiſh-Miniſters; and againſt <hi>Xeures,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Croy,</hi> favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to <hi>Charles,</hi> whom <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12. of <hi>France</hi> having the Gard-noble of his perſon, gave <hi>Charles</hi> for his conduct; The Libellers ſpared not the Cardinal; nor his Confident, <hi>Francis Rouys</hi>; the Flemmings were highly incenſed at the Libels and Obloquy of the people; This obliged the Cardinal to make ſearch for the Authors; but ſo lightly, that neither Author nor Seller was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for writing or publiſhing. For as for him, though he writ of this matter to <hi>Flanders,</hi> yet he was (ſayes <hi>Gomez</hi>) of opinion, that, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours ſhould have the Liberty to avenge their grievances by words and writings, which endure no longer than while you are offended at them; that to ſlight them was the only way to ſuppreſs them, and, to be angry at them, was to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

them true. <hi>Alphonſo Caſtilla,</hi> Governour of <hi>Madrid,</hi> brought <hi>Adrian,</hi> and <hi>Laxaus,</hi> ſome Copies he had recovered of the Libells againſt them. They, not uſed to ſuch Satyrs, as things not accuſtomed in <hi>Flanders,</hi> reſented them highly, and ſpecially <hi>Adrian,</hi> to whom injuries of this kind were like Fleas in his Ears, or Snuff in the Noſe, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe and inflame the Levity of his Temper; inſomuch that being afterwards advanced to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair, under the name of <hi>Adrian</hi> the 6. the Satyrical reflections, and tart Animadverſions publiſhed by the Roman Witts on the Statues of <hi>Paſquin,</hi> and <hi>Morphorio,</hi> were ſo offenſive to him, that he commanded the Statues which had ſtood there many Ages, to be digged up, and thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Tyber.</hi> The Count <hi>De Seſſa,</hi> being preſent when this Order was given, told him, Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you cauſe theſe Libel-Carryers to be caſt into <hi>Tyber,</hi> the Froggs will Croke out their Verſes; and what two Stones whiſpered to men, many mouths will proclaim to the River: 'Tis a hard matter to take from men that liberty of their ſpirit which God hath allowed them, which they will find means to make known to the World: <hi>Adrian</hi> followed his Advice, and left <hi>Paſquin,</hi> and <hi>Morphorio</hi> ſtanding in the place they poſſeſs at <hi>Rome</hi> to this day.

            <p>The Troubles which before had diſquieted the Court, and raiſed the people to Armes, were now entred the Churches, and got up to the very Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars: The Prieſts of <hi>Spain</hi> had taken the Alarm, and publiſhed grievous Complaints, and loud Threats in defence of their Revenues, and the liberty of their Dignities; For <hi>Selim,</hi> Emperour of the Turks, having carryed his Arms into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> taken from <hi>Tomombey</hi> his Crown and his Life, and Triumphed over the whole Nation; reſolved, after this notable Conqueſt, to turn his victorious Arms againſt <hi>Italy,</hi> to add that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to the reſt of his Triumphs, to enter <hi>Rome</hi> by a breach, and feed his Horſe on the Altar of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Theſe barbarous Threats obliged the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to provide for the ſecurity of their Eſtates. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, then in the Chair, imployed his care to preſerve the Patrimony of the Church; and for the Guard of the Sea-Coaſt, an Ordinance was paſt in the <hi>Lateran</hi>-Council to Levy the tenths upon the Clergy of <hi>Spain.</hi> This put them in an uproar: the Cardinal uſed his beſt endeavours to appeaſe them, and to reſtore peace to the Church, the houſe of God, as he had done to Cities the habitations of men: he diſpatched a Courrier to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ordered <hi>Arteagua</hi> his Agent in that Court, in his name, to make the Pope an offer, not only of the tenths of the Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> but of all its Revenues, his money, his moveables, all that he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50543:89"/>
had of rich or precious in the Treaſure of his Church; if the neceſſity of a holy Warr required it for the defence of the Altars of God in <hi>Italy.</hi> But, to declare, that, without ſuch a neceſſity he would never be the Author of thoſe new Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, nor conſent that the Prieſts of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould be made Tributary to Strangers; with a ſtrict charge to ſend him the Reſolutions of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council hereupon. <hi>Arteagua</hi> underſtood by the Pope's Nephew, the Cardinal <hi>De Medicis,</hi> that the Council had not ordained the Levying of theſe Diſmes, but in caſe of extream neceſſity, and that the Enemies were within the State of the Church, or upon the Borders of <hi>Italy</hi>; and it appeared, the Source of this trouble about the Benefices of <hi>Spain</hi> aroſe from the Pope's Nuncio in that Kingdom, engaged therein by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to finger the moneys, or his imprudence in management of Affairs. Thus the Cardinal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the intereſt of the Church, and calmed the Commotion. Prieſts have in their perſons a kind of Spiritual Royalty, whereof their Miters are marks. To protect and defend them is to paſs to Glory, by the way of Piety.</p>

            <p>THough the Cardinal had ſurmounted the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Flemmings againſt his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, triumphed over the Envy of the Court, and the Threats of the greateſt part of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of <hi>Spain</hi>; there remained an important victory to be gained over three potent Enemies, who like a triple-headed Monſter ſtood up againſt him, with a boldneſs he was obliged to humble, and bring to the ground: The firſt was <hi>Mendoza</hi> Duke of <hi>Infantado,</hi> his Capital Enemy for the Rupture of the Marriage between his Nephew and the Cardinal's Niece: This hatred was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by the loſs of a Cauſe at Law, whereby a Burrough of the Duke's demeans, was rejoyned to the Church of <hi>Toledo,</hi> from which it had been diſmembred. And as the <hi>Syndic</hi> of the Church went to take poſſeſſion of it, the Duke himſelf gave him the Baſtonado. This Outrage offended the Cardinal at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who told many. He would teach the Duke more Reverence to Juſtice, make him looſe his Dukedome, and undergo the puniſhment he deſerved. The Duke was netled to the quick at theſe Threats, and, to declare his reſentment, ſent to the Cardinal one of his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants to tell him, That he was a diſſembling Monk, meanly born, and raiſed to the fortune he poſſeſſed by the ſubtlety and hypocriſies natural to his Frock. This Envoy arrives at <hi>Madrid,</hi> goes to the Cardinal, and ſhews him that he was a Domeſtick of the Dukes, received wages from
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50543:90"/>
him, and ate of his bread, and therefore ſubject to his Commands; that he had given him one to tell him ſuch words which peradventure would Anger him, and therefore before he ſpoke them, he deſired his leave to do it; and that he would not impute the offenee to him: The Cardinal gave him leave to deliver his meſſage, which he did word by word as the Duke had commanded: The Cardinal nothing moved, made Anſwer; My Friend, you are employed in a very fooliſh Embaſſie: Return to your Maſter, and I am perſwaded you will find him wiſer than when you left him, and repenting his follies. Which was true; for the Duke much troubled that paſſion had ſo far blinded his reaſon, ſharply rebuked his principal Domeſticks, that they had not withſtood his Choler, and prevented the ſending of that meſſage to the Cardinal. <hi>Velasco</hi> Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who knew the inconſiderate raſhneſs of the Duke, adviſed him to a Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with the Cardinal; returned to <hi>Madrid</hi>; and intreated the Cardinal to pardon the Duke, and impute theſe words to the blindneſs of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and not eſteem them the ſenſe of his mind. The Cardinal Anſwered, that when <hi>Mendoza</hi> would in perſon begg pardon, and confeſs with his own mouth he deſerved puniſhment, he ſhould not find him inexorable. <hi>Velaſco</hi> diſpoſed the Duke to do it: A day and place were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the enterview. <hi>Fountain Caralla,</hi> within two Leagues of <hi>Madrid,</hi> was choſen for that purpoſe; where the Cardinal came attended with ſome of his Domeſticks: The Conſtable and the Duke came alſo. But being upon the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50543:91"/>
place, the Duke forgot the Conditions of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview; and, inſtead of performing them, with a bold Countenance, and haughty expreſſion, having ſaluted the Cardinal, told him, Provided I violate not the Laws of Religion, and pay the King the obedience I owe him, I little value the diſpleaſures of others, ſlight their Checks, and ſcorn their Affronts. Theſe words of pride, ſounded ſtrange in the Cardinal's Ears, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a better temper, according to the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble's Promiſe; and, made this Anſwer: <hi>Mendoza</hi> when you fail in the one or other, you ſhall know me to be the grand Inquiſitor of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the King's Lieutenant General in all his Eſtates; and in theſe qualities, I will cauſe you to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed according to your demerits. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, ſeeing their hatred inflamed, not reconciled; and troubled at the huffing of the Duke, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him ſharply for it; and having brought him by diſcourſe to an acknowledgement of his fault, inclined him to expiate it in the inſtant he had committed it, making him caſt himſelf at the Cardinals feet, and begg his pardon, whereupon the Cardinal embraced him, and took him up.</p>
            <p>The very inſtant this was doing, they heard a noiſe of Soldiers, and a Volley of Muskets, ſhot at the door of the houſe. Horrour ſeized the Conſtable, and the Dukes pride was turned into fear. Both apprehended a train laid for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty or Lives: but 'twas a Pannick fear, and the cauſe appeared to come from <hi>John Spinoſa Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina</hi> of the Regiment of Guards, who having underſtood that the Cardinal was with two Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> without any Guard to attend
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50543:91"/>
him, rann thither with the Guards under his Command. The Cardinal reproved him for comming without order, and having taken leave of the Conſtable and Duke, with a countenance full of reſpect and friendſhip, returned for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond of the three powerful Grandees, whoſe boldneſs and envy the Cardinal was to grapple with, and overcome; was <hi>Giron,</hi> Lord of <hi>Vienna,</hi> who was alwayes of the contrary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Ringleader to thoſe that oppoſed his Authority: <hi>Giron</hi> was of a lively ſpirit, bigg words, bold in his raillery, ſmart and cutting in his Reparties: Coming one day to the Cardinal's Chamber-door, he asked the Uſher, Friend, what is King-<hi>Ximenes</hi> a doing? <hi>Spain</hi> had been govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a King of that name, who was ſo dull and ſottiſh of ſpirit, and ſo groſly vitious, that no day paſſed without ſome inſtances of his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies; which gave his Subjects cauſe to ask one another often, What is King <hi>Ximenes</hi> a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Another time, this Lord having been in Treaty with the Cardinal, about ſome affairs of importance, and taking his leave, the Cardinal ſcarce moved his Cap at parting, <hi>Giron</hi> turn'd about and asked the Servants, Whether their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had a ſcalded head: Theſe flights added to many attempts againſt his Authority, provoked the Cardinal to Reſentment upon occaſion, which fell out patly: For <hi>Giron</hi> was in ſuit againſt <hi>Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terio Quixada</hi> for the Burrough of <hi>Villas Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi> which <hi>Giron</hi> had uſurped; In the ſuit the weakeſt went to the Wall, and ſuffered under the oppreſſion of the greater; <hi>Giron</hi> having drawn it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50543:92"/>
at ſuch length that <hi>Quixada</hi>'s purſe being too ſhallow, could not have Juſtice: he complains to the Cardinal, telling him, that, as the King ought to do Juſtice to his people, ſo ought the King's Lieutenant: the Cardinal did it, and, by Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Court of <hi>Valladolid, Giron</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to reſtore to <hi>Quixada,</hi> the Burrough of <hi>Villas Hermanos</hi>: A Senator of <hi>Valladolid</hi> went upon the place to execute the Judgement, and put <hi>Quixada</hi> in poſſeſſion: <hi>Giron</hi> makes up a party, ſends his Son and Servants to the place; where they received the Commiſſioner, and gave him the Baſtonado. An information was drawn up of this inſolent Rebellion, and ſent to the Cardinal and Council, who decreed the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to be Arreſted; cited them by ſound of Trumpet to appear, and proceeded againſt them as Traytors: The Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> who ſaw <hi>Giron</hi> in the high way to deſtruction, ſent two Gentlemen of note to the Cardinal, to intreat him, not to ruine a perſon of <hi>Giron</hi>'s quality: That it was his intereſt to preſerve the Grandees; and, to deſtroy them, as he did was to deſtroy himſelf, as being by his dignity of Arch-biſhop of <hi>Telodo,</hi> as Primate of the Prelates, ſo firſt of the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> and having precedence of all; The Cardinal's anſwer was, He would protect honeſt men, and puniſh the wicked contemners of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and diſturbers of the publick peace.</p>
            <p>When they ſaw the Cardinal inflexible, they ſent to <hi>Charles</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the matter, and obtained a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to ſtay execution of the Judgement, till he came into <hi>Spain:</hi> Upon receipt of the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50543:92"/>
the Cardinal and Council, ſent to <hi>Charles,</hi> informed him of the truth of the Crime, ſent him the Proceſs, and remonſtrated to him, that having been appointed by God the Guardian and preſerver of the Laws, he ought to give Juſtice liberty in her functions and freedom, and to do her duty; intreated him to conſider the Conſequence of this Affair, that if ſuch Enormities were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, there ſhould not be one King only in <hi>Spain,</hi> but as many Kings, as there are puiſſant great Ones: <hi>Charles,</hi> in Anſwer to the Cardinal and Council, writ, He had been miſ-informed, and that it was his intention, Juſtice ſhould be done: The Judgement againſt the Offenders was Executed. The Cardinal ſending Regiments of Horſe and Foot, againſt <hi>Villas Hermanos,</hi> where <hi>Giron</hi>'s Son, and ſeveral Young Lords of his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Sons of the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſome Forces, and had added new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolences to the former Rebellion, having cauſed the Effigies of the Cardinal to be drawn through the Streets in his pontifical habit, with a Trumpet before it, to publiſh the Ignominy: But when they ſaw the Aſſailants, they left their ſport, and betook them to their heels: The Walls of the Town were beaten down to the foundations, and they plowed up, the houſes fired, and the places they ſtood on, ſowed with ſalt, in token of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction. Seven men of the place, who had ſaid they knew no Lord but <hi>Giron,</hi> were whipped by the hangman; and with them ſome of <hi>Giron</hi>'s Domeſticks on a holy day, that ſo important an execution might not be retarded: To make <hi>Quixada</hi> amends, and repair his damage in the

loſs of the Town, they adjudged him <hi>Giron</hi>'s Eſtate, and proceeded further againſt his family and perſon. To take from the Rebels all hopes of mercy, this execution was confirmed by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents from <hi>Charles</hi> in <hi>Flanders.</hi> This brought <hi>Giron</hi> to reaſon: he humbles himſelf to the Cardinal and deſires mercy; and to make his prayers more effectual, all the Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> joyned with him: The Cardinal by Letter inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded to <hi>Charles</hi> for a pardon; that in bringing him to an exemplary humiliation, and forcing him to begg pardon in perſon, he had ſufficiently puniſhed him; that the Grandees acknowledging their faults, and truly humbled, were not to be treated with the ſeverities uſual in other mens Caſes.</p>
            <p>The third puiſſant Enemy of the Cardinal, among the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> was the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> of great Authority, of a great Family, Illuſtrious in blood, abounding in Riches, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Friendſhip and Allyance: the Cardinal had his opportunity to bring him to reaſon, as well as the others. The Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> in King <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s life time, in whoſe favours he had a great ſhare, obtained for <hi>Diegolus</hi> third ſon, the Priory of St. <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> of the Order of Knights then at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> now at <hi>Malta</hi>; a Dignity of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and equal Authority in the Kingdom: <hi>Antony Alſtuniga</hi> of an illuſtrious family, was at that time in Legal poſſeſſion; but the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> upheld by the Authority of the King, and the great maſter of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> took it from him by force, contrary to Right, and the Laws of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſetled his Son there; who enjoyed it peaceably
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50543:94"/>
for ſix years, till <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s death: <hi>Aſtuniga</hi> ſeeing the Duke's credit buried with that Prince, had recourſe to Juſtice, and ſummons the Uſurper to a Legal Tryal: The Proceſs was decided at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Diego</hi> enjoyned to make reſtitution of the Benefice. <hi>Aſtuniga</hi> returns into <hi>Spain</hi> with the Decree, implores the Cardinal's protection, whom he knew to be the Defender of Juſtice, and obtains it: <hi>Charles</hi> in the mean time, informed of this difference, looked upon it as of importance to the State, writes to the Cardinal and Council, to put the Benefice in a third hand till farther or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> refuſes to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, believing it an invention to outt him from the Priory, calls the other Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> his Friends to his Aſſiſtance, and fortifies <hi>Conſabrona</hi> the principal place of the Priory: The Cardinal ſeeing him act the King in <hi>Spain,</hi> reſolved not to endure it; he commands forth a thouſand Horſe, and 500 Foot of his Guards, in the Suburbs of <hi>Madrid</hi>; but at the inſtant falls ſick to the danger of his life: <hi>Madrid,</hi> and all the Realm of <hi>Caſtile</hi> made publick Prayers for his Recovery, on which, as then, depended the peace of <hi>Spain.</hi> He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers, and finding the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> unwilling to obey, reſolves to force him, but, by the way, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him a fair accommodation: And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, this great Miniſter never took the way of Rigour, till he had firſt tryed that of Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and found it ineffectual to perform the duties of Juſtice, in his Adminiſtration: He propoſed to the Duke, That he ſhould give the King a Gentleman of his Family, to be anſwerable to his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50543:95"/>
Majeſty for the places of the Priory that ſhould be put into his hands, and to ſurrender them to the King if there ſhould be cauſe, when he had declared his Judgement; by which means the Duke might have remained Maſter of the Priory, and the Revenue. The Duke ſtormed at this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and thinking that to accept it, would have been to part with his own, rejected it. The Cardinal ſends a leight Army to beſiege <hi>Caſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brona</hi>; the Duke alſo ſent thither a thouſand Foot, and ſome Horſe with Victuals and Money: The Cardinal's Troops met them by the way, engaged, and defeated them, took their money and Victuals, and marched to the place they were to inveſt. The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>'s Son was within, with a great number of young men of his Age, moſt of them Sons of the Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi>; All the Nobles of <hi>Toledo,</hi> that had attained the age of 21 years, aſſiſting in the Defence. The Herald ſummoned them to open their Gates, and obey the King; their Anſwer was high, though not a word ſpoken; for they ſet on the Walls of the place, Biers covered with black, to ſignifie tacitly their reſolution, rather to dye than yield. The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> this while was anxiouſly diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his thoughts. On the one ſide, he ſaw the ſhame that would attend his ſuffering a Piece of ſuch convenience and profit to his Family, to be wreſted out of his hands, and that his labours and great preparations would end in Affronts and greater Diſgraces: On the other ſide, he beheld the thunderbolt hanging over his head, ready to fall upon him to the ruine of his perſon and his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50543:95"/>
houſe. His Eſtate was already Confiſcated by Decree of the Council, which gave him fearful apprehenſions of the Cardinal's ſeverity, as a man whom he knew intire and immoveable in his reſolutions.</p>
            <p>The example of <hi>Villas Hermanos,</hi> was freſh in memory, and the image of it in his thoughts troubled him; repreſenting him as miſerable as his friend <hi>Giron.</hi> He reſolved to bow, rather than break; goes to <hi>Madrid,</hi> humbles himſelf, makes means of Reconcilement to the Cardinal, cauſes his Son to obey, renders the place, and obtains of <hi>Charles</hi> the moiety of the Priory for his Son, the other moiety being left for <hi>Aſtuniga,</hi> and enough for both. Another difficulty ariſes in the enjoyment of the Benefice: The great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Rhodes</hi> who had unjuſtly outed <hi>Aſtuniga,</hi> to inveſt <hi>Diego</hi> in the place, would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any <hi>Prior</hi> but <hi>Diego,</hi> gave him all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Grand Prior, and ſent him Orders for a general Aſſembly of all the Knights of the Order in Spain; <hi>Diego</hi> ſummons them, and would have had them aſſembled without other Authority than his; the Cardinal hinders it, ſends for him, and tells him, If you were in the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> you might do your pleaſure; but in <hi>Spain</hi> where I command, know, you muſt come to me and have my permiſſion.</p>
            <p>Thus he reduced to reaſon the three Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had moſt oppoſed his Authority; who having made a great noiſe, had experience to their ſhame of the greatneſs of his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the height of his Courage, and his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50543:96"/>
Addreſs, being compelled to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at his feet, whoſe head they ſlighted, and had in contempt. The Fable of the Giants deſtroyed by Thunderbolts, and buried under the Mountains they had accumulated, inſtructs a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of State, ſometimes to uſe force and ſeverity againſt potent men, who, to trouble the publick peace, would by deſtroying his Authority attain the King's.</p>
            <p>Theſe Croſſes, and the unwillingneſs of the great Ones, to acknowledge the honour he had acquired in <hi>Spain,</hi> with the ingratitude of the people, whoſe eaſe he affected, and procured the happineſs they enjoyed; gave him ſenſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures, and made him call to mind the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and ſweetneſs of his Religious life in the Monaſtery of <hi>Caſtanet.</hi> Neer which, there was in view a little hill covered with Trees, where he often went to ſearch, under their ſhadows, the light of truth in Holy-Writt, and after ſome hours reading, kneeled, and with hands and heart lift up to Heaven, converſed with God in Prayer and Meditation; then retiring immediately into a little Cabbin, made with his own hands, in imitation of, thoſe Angels of the Deſart, the ancient Hermits, he fed his body with Bread and Water, but his Soul with plentiful repaſts of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual delicacies: The holy pleaſures of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude he panted after, amidſt the Croſſes and oppoſitions he encountered in the State; ſaying often to his greateſt Confidents, If I might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain leave, how willingly would I change this Palace for my Cabin at <hi>Caſtanet</hi>; the Authority
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50543:96"/>
of Governour of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the ſilence of that ſolitude; and my Mitre of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Cap, for the habit of that poor place. A Miniſter of State, hath not in the troubles of Affairs, a more ſolid comfort than that of Piety, which is the Policy of Heaven (if any be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed there) as well as part of the Politicks of this World.</p>

               <hi>Charles,</hi> often adviſed by the Cardinal to come into <hi>Spain</hi> to enjoy his Crown, and diſſipate by his preſence the Troubles that daily grew up, at laſt leaves Flanders, and by an Expreſs to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, gives him notice he was Embarqued; The Cardinal goes from <hi>Madrid,</hi> and advances with the whole Court to meet his Maſter, making choice of the Burrough of <hi>Alcande,</hi> ſcituate on the Banks of the <hi>River Guadalayer</hi> to attend his coming; and taking with him Prince <hi>Ferdinand</hi> under a ſtrong Guard, on which depended the peace and ſafety of <hi>Spain</hi>; in his journey he paſſed through <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>zeguillas,</hi> a Village on a Hill, and Dined there; but the worſt Dinner he ever made: (for there the Spaniards generally believe) he had that venomous Doſe of Lingering Poiſon which deſtroyed his life; which is the more probable, for that the Provincial of the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantines of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> being on his way with ſome of his Order, to go to the Cardinal, a man on Horſ-back came to them with his face muffled up in a Hand-kerchief to prevent their diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and ſaid; Fathers, if your buſineſs be to the Cardinal, make haſte to him before he Dines, and adviſe him, not to eat of a Pigeon that ſhall
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50543:97"/>
be ſerved in to him, for 'tis poyſoned; <hi>Marquine</hi> the Provincial arrives at <hi>Bozeguillas,</hi> and recounts to the Cardinal, what the ſtrange Gentleman told him. The Cardinal having thanked him for his Care of him, made him this Anſwer; Father, if I have been poyſoned it was not this day, but a while ago reading at <hi>Madrid,</hi> a Letter from <hi>Flanders,</hi> when me-thought I drew in poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by my Eyes; ſince which, I proteſt, I feel my ſelf dye every day: Nevertheleſs I am not ſo well aſſured of this, as to exclude all doubt of the truth thereof; We are all under the Conduct of Gods Providence, which takes away, and reſtores our health, as he judges moſt neceſſary for our Salvation. Let's obey then thoſe holy Decrees that are irreverſible.</p>
            <p>But when his malady came on him, he returned to his former opinion, telling his Phyſitians, that he ſhould periſh by the Treaſon of thoſe Wretches, that attempted his life. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> write, that after Dinner at <hi>Bozeguillas,</hi> his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady heightned ſo apparently, that putrified mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter broke out under his Nails; yet this could not hinder him from imploying the ſmall portion of life that remained, in the ſervice of the State. He had written to <hi>Charles,</hi> that it concerned him to command from his brother <hi>Ferdinand, Alvarez Oſorio,</hi> the Dominican, Biſhop of <hi>Aſtozia,</hi> the Prince's Tutor; and <hi>Peter Guſman,</hi> Grand Prior of the Order of <hi>Calatrave</hi> his Governour, who apprehending the Arrival of <hi>Charles</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> might give the young Prince Counſel to the diſſervice of the King, it being long reported
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50543:97"/>
that theſe men would never brook the Flemings whom they hated, and to avoid a meeting would retire to <hi>Arragon</hi> with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and cauſe him to be Crowned King of that Kingdom: But he was deſigned by Heaven for greater Fortunes, and was Emperour after his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and had the Royal Crowns of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in right of Queen <hi>Anne</hi> his Wife, Heireſs to <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> and <hi>Lewis,</hi> her Father and Brother, Kings of thoſe Kingdoms; he had four Sons, and eleven Daughters, of whom <hi>Joan d' Auſtria</hi> was marryed to <hi>Francis de Medicis,</hi> great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>; of which Marriage was born, <hi>Mary de Medicis,</hi> Queen of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr,</hi> Wife of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, and Mother of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth late Regnant; a Princeſs of eminent Vertue, ſingular goodneſs, and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable magnanimity, maternally deſcended from the Houſes of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> as well as thoſe of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi>: for, the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> her Grand-father, was younger Son to <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> only Daughter of Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> and <hi>Iſabel</hi> of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Charles</hi> judging the Remove of <hi>Oſorio</hi> and <hi>Guzman,</hi> neceſſary for his Service, Commanded it, and writ to the Cardinal to that purpoſe; The Maſter of the Courriers, who received the diſpatch, inſtead of delivering it (as addreſſed) to the Cardinal, carried the Pacquet to Dean <hi>Adrian,</hi> who opened it, though not directed to him, and gives to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Brother's Letter, where the young Prince ſaw the King his Brother's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for Removing <hi>Oſorio</hi> and <hi>Guzman</hi>; He went
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50543:98"/>
to the Cardinal, and with tears in his eyes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him not to make any change in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, till his Brother's Arrival in <hi>Spain</hi>; that <hi>Guzman</hi> and <hi>Oſorio</hi> were very faithful to him, and had great affections for him, that they were given him by the hands of King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Grand-father, and his Grand-mother Queen <hi>Iſabel</hi>; That to take them from him, were to condemn the Judgement, and vilifie the Memory of two Princes whom the whole world had honoured: The Cardinal though ſurprized, as not knowing of the Affair (which <hi>Adrian</hi> had diſcovered) to remove the Odium from himſelf, exhorted the young Prince to obey the King his Brother, on whom depended his Fortune and Grandeur, that he ought to preferr the intereſt of <hi>Charles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of his Domeſticks, and to conform to his will. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſeeing that he gained nothing on the Cardinal's ſpirit, gave him in choler this reparty; Since you are reſolved to deſtroy me and mine, when you might have pleaſured me in forbearing a little while to execute what is writ to you from <hi>Flanders,</hi> I will take order, my Servants ſhall not be Ruined, as you have deſigned. The Cardinal was moved at his threats, but being Reſolute and Couragious to maintain the intereſt of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, told him, Sir, You may do what you pleaſe; but before the Sun ſet to Morrow, though all <hi>Spain</hi> ſtood againſt me, the King ſhall be obeyed, and you ſhall obey him the firſt of any. <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> ne<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed at theſe words, retired towards <hi>Aranda</hi>; The Cardinal ſent after him, and gave the charge of his Perſon, and of the Town to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50543:98"/>
               <hi>Cabanilla</hi> and <hi>Spinoſa</hi> Captains of the Guards, commanding them to be up all night with their Troops, and not permit a perſon of the Princes Family to go out of the Town: They obeyed him, and on the morrow <hi>Oſorio</hi> and <hi>Guzman</hi> were diſmiſſed, and the will of <hi>Charles</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted with Fidelity and Courage; the principal qualities of a Miniſter of State, in Affairs which concern the intereſt of the King with the Princes of his blood.</p>
            <p>Some Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> ſeeing the Cardinal proceed with abſolute Authority againſt the Infant <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and themſelves, demanded of him a fight of his Commiſſion; The Cardinal pointed to the Soldiers of his Guards, and told them, Thoſe Folks there with the will of the King, are the power I have to command <hi>Caſtile:</hi> then twiſting on his finger the Cord of his Order wherewith he was girt, This, ſaid he, is ſufficient to chaſtiſe proud Vaſſals, and bring them to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. A little after, he cauſed ſome Cannons to be diſcharged, and a Volley of Muſquet-ſhot, which was the laſt Anſwer, but more terrible than the firſt: This ſtopped their mouths, and ſtruck fear into theſe men who had been more curious than wiſe. Scarce had the Cardinal ended this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Affair of <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Family, when a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier brought him news, <hi>Medina Sedonia</hi> was taken by <hi>Peter Giron,</hi> Son of <hi>Giron,</hi> Lord of <hi>Vienna,</hi> who took up Armes, made himſelf Maſter of the Field, and Siezed that place into his hands in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the injury of <hi>Villas Hermanos</hi>: the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal ſent againſt him ſome Troops of the <hi>Militia</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:50543:99"/>
then afoot under the command of Count <hi>Quig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonio de Luna,</hi> with order to take the Rebel and bring him alive or dead. Another Courrier at the ſame time arrived from <hi>Charles,</hi> to inform him of a deſign of the <hi>Turks</hi> againſt <hi>Oran</hi>; For having ſet Sail from <hi>Flanders,</hi> the ninth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> 1517. he met with ſome <hi>Corſayres</hi> by the way, who informed him that an Army of <hi>Turks</hi> were upon their March to <hi>Oran:</hi> this obliged him to advertiſe the Cardinal, praying him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the ſafety of that place with all Diligence poſſible, as a Piece of great convenience for the Rendevouz of the Forces he deſigned to ſend to <hi>Africk,</hi> for extending Chriſtianity unto thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Countries. The Cardinal by the ſame Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier aſſured him of his beſt care for preſervation of <hi>Oran,</hi> commended his deſign, and adviſed him to purſue it; that of ſo many Monarks who in paſt Ages had worn the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> they only added a conſtant felicity to a long Reign who had laboured moſt in the propagation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But <hi>Oran</hi> for this time had only an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Turkiſh Armes: for the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Africk,</hi> fearing the violences of the <hi>Turks,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed their Paſſage, and defeated their Army.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Charles</hi> after a happy Voyage came to <hi>Villadichoſa</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> with the Princeſs <hi>Elenor</hi> his Siſter, afterwards Queen of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ſince that Queen of <hi>France</hi> by Marriage with <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt: He gave the Cardinal notice of his Arrival, and demanded his advice about his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into the Kingdom, that he might make it like a King, and be received of his people according
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50543:99"/>
to his deſires and dignity. The Cardinal adviſed him to Receive courteouſly ſuch as came to meet him, to compoſe his Countenance, and order his Diſcourſe and Habit, ſuitable to the mode of <hi>Spain</hi>; to ſend his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> for that his preſence in <hi>Spain</hi> was uſeleſs to his perſon, and might prove prejudicial to his Authority; that it concerned him to uſe his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dexterity in executing this Reſolution; to impute the cauſe to <hi>Maximilian</hi> his Grand-father, and to appear much diſpleaſed at the ſeparation; the people of <hi>Spain</hi> having a paſſionate love for <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> as bred amongſt them, and a perfect Spaniard in Language, behaviour and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: That he would not come to any reſolution againſt the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> who had Maſſacred their Senators, till he had firſt weighed the Condition of his Exchequer, and the forces of his Kingdom. That he would advance further into <hi>Spain,</hi> and make haſte to <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to this laſt point, the Flemmings reliſhed it not, but reſolved to retain <hi>Charles</hi> in the remote parts of the Kingdom, till the Cardinal's death, which they were adviſed muſt ſhortly follow: they deſired nothing leſs than that this man ſhould come to ſpeech with the King, apprehending a diſcovery of their rapines by his generous liberty and integrity to the King. But <hi>Charles</hi> received thoſe Counſels, as lights for his Conduct, and ſent an Expreſs to convey his thanks, confeſſing himſelf much obliged by his cares, his prudence, and fidelity. The Cardinal by the ſame Envoy Returns Anſwer, That the ſervices he had done
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50543:100"/>
him, were of duty; That he eſteemed it his glory to have ſuſtained the Envy of almoſt all the world in ſerving him; That the predominant paſſion of his ſoul was his deſire to ſee his Majeſty, and to put into his hands the Kingdom more ſound and intire, than he had received it, at the beginning of his Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Spain</hi> went to meet their new King: the Conſtable <hi>Velaſio</hi> was attended with ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe; the Council made haſte to tender him their duty, and thinking they had no more to do with the Cardinal, now <hi>Charles</hi> was arrived in <hi>Spain,</hi> they took their journey without adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing the Cardinal. But he out went them by his Courriers, whom he ſent to the King, deſiring his Majeſty not to ſuffer a diſorder of ſo ill example in the State; that the Council the principal body of it ſhould thus ſeparate from their head, and intreating him to command them back to <hi>Aranda: Charles</hi> did ſo, commanding the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to return the way they came, and go to the Cardinal; that it would be more acceptable to him to ſee them together with him. This put them in great diſorder; for, having with them their Wives and Children, they could not return without much inconvenience: They ſent to the Cardinal, entreated him he would be pleaſed to permit them to attend his Majeſty in the place the Courrier found them. The Cardinal impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of Contempt, and highly offended at the ſlight offered him, made no ſhew of Reſentment, but reſolved not to bate them a ſtep of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Aranda</hi>; anſwers them, That he was glad
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50543:100"/>
they were all in health, that they all knew how punctual he had alwayes been in cauſing the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due to the King to be exactly performed. And ſince his Majeſty had adviſed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Aranda</hi>; it was his advice, They ſhould obey him with all the diligence in their power. They, as they parted raſhly, returned ſhamefully:</p>
            <p>The reſpect due to a Miniſter of State is to be preſerved even to Jealouſie, as that that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Authority which Slights and neglects deſtroy.</p>
            <p>At this arrival of the King in <hi>Spain,</hi> the people were much moved, and hotly demanded an Aſſembly of the States of the Realm. The Cardinal was of opinion it ought not to be granted ſo ſoon, but that the King muſt be firſt Received, and Affairs ſetled in a quiet Poſture, ſaying, It was of great concernment that Kings at their coming to the Crown ſhould be received of their people with extraordinary reverence as a matter of great importance to their Authority: This advice was ſlighted, but the neglect coſt <hi>Spain</hi> dear. All the Kingdom was in trouble and the State in danger by the conteſts that aroſe about the place where the Eſtates ſhould convene; at laſt it was agreed, the King ſhould come to <hi>Valladolid</hi> for holding the Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>There the envy of the Cardinal's enemies muſtered all its force to affront his Perſon, and attacque his Authority. The harbingers of this great Miniſter having taken up a houſe for him, the Marſhals of the Kings Lodgings, being Flemmings, ſet on by the Grandees, took it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50543:101"/>
from them, and for reaſon told them, This Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be marked for Queen <hi>Germain</hi>; The Cardinal Jealous of his Authority, and impatient of Affronts, having diſcovered the practiſes of the Flemmings, diſputed it with them, and carryed the Lodgings.</p>
            <p>But he muſt ſhortly diſlodge from the Court, and the world, though with the ſame honour he had lived there: the Flemmings enter into a Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, to outt him the Court. <hi>Mota</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Badaos,</hi> a dignity he owed wholly to the Cardinal's favour, to pleaſe <hi>Xeures,</hi> the Kings favourite, (as the Spaniards ſay) and his own intereſt, adviſed <hi>Charles</hi> to remove the Cardinal from Court into his Dioceſs of <hi>Toledo. Charles</hi> who was no leſs obliged to the Cardinal than to him who gave him the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> forgot the ſervices of this Grand Miniſter, followed <hi>Mota</hi>'s advice, and by his inconſtancy confirmed the <hi>Proverb,</hi> that Services of great ones are no inheritance; having ſent a letter to the Cardinal the tenour whereof was this.</p>
            <p>My Lord Cardinal, I hold on my journey by <hi>Jurdefillas</hi>; whereof I thought fit to advertiſe you, that you may come to <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>jados</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Segorges</hi> Houſe, where I deſire to ſee you, and to receive your good Counſels, not only for the conduct of my Eſtate, but the ordering of my Family, which I will regulate according to your ſage Advice. This is the laſt help I can receive of you in my Affairs; for, your long Services de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve repoſe, and your Age requires it; and I grant it willingly, and adviſe you to retire to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50543:101"/>
your houſe, to enjoy it with more pleaſure. God alone can give you a juſt recompence for your long travels in the conduct of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; as for me I ſhall never forget them, and will ever pay you the reſpects due from a good natured Child to a careful and bounteous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>This Letter of diſmiſſion by the trouble it gave the Cardinal caſt him into a Feaver which brought him to his Grave, though ſome Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Hiſtorians ſay, that the Courrier who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed it, finding the Cardinal deſperately ſick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it not, but that (the Feaver holding him eighteen hours after, whereas the Phyſicians advertiſed him, he could not live above ſix hours) he brought back the Letter to the Council, and delivered it to <hi>Adrian.</hi> Others write, that he received it on his death-bed, and called for pen, ink, and paper to anſwer it; but that, having written three or four Lines, his ſtrength failed him, the pen dropt out of his hand, and he ſoon after breathed his laſt. Theſe Lines, or piece of a Letter were never publiſhed, as if fate had been unwilling to diſcover to the world any thing imperfect to which this man had put his hand. Certain it is, the Cardinal perceiving he muſt ſhortly dye, made an End worthy his good life, Muſtering up the force of his Spirit, in the weakneſs of his body, and diſcourſing piouſly and learnedly of the mercy of God, the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of the World, and the Vanity of the Court; imbracing the Crucifix, bedewing his face with tears, he begged pardon from God for his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50543:102"/>
ſins, and having proteſted he had not laid out one <hi>Rial</hi> of the Revenues of his Benefices for the advancement of his Kindred, he received the Chriſtian-<hi>Viaticum,</hi> the Holy Euchariſt, repeating often thoſe words of <hi>David, My God, in thee have I put my Truſt,</hi> and went to enjoy in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe Crowns which God gives them, who govern people with prudence, integrity, and piety. This happened on <hi>Sunday</hi> the ninth of <hi>November,</hi> 1517. in the 80th. year of his Age, having worn the Mytre of <hi>Toledo</hi> 22. years, and governed <hi>Spain,</hi> as many, under <hi>Ferdinand, Iſabel, Joan, Philip</hi> and <hi>Charles:</hi> His body was interred in the Colledge of St. <hi>Idelphons</hi> in <hi>Alcala D' He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nares,</hi> which he had built; his Tomb of white Marble, and his Effigies of the ſame are to be ſeen at this day, with this Epitaph worthy his illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Actions, which comprehends in ſhort, both what he did before his Glorious Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his Acts in the State,
<q>
                  <l>Condideram Muſis <hi>Franciſcus</hi> Grande Lycaeum,</l>
                  <l>Condor in exiguo nunc ego Sarcophago.</l>
                  <l>Praetextam junxi Sacco, Galeamque Galero,</l>
                  <l>Frater, Dux, Praeſul, Cardineuſque Pater.</l>
                  <l>Quin virtute Mea junctum eſt Diadema Cucullo,</l>
                  <l>Cum Mihi regnanti paruit Heſperia.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He was tall, and ſtreight of Stature, of a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Look, carrying in his face natural Gravity, his voice was Maſculine and firm, his Viſage Long and Meagre, his forehead Large and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wrinkles, midling eyes ſomewhat deep ſet
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50543:102"/>
in his head, but very lively; his Noſe long and aquiline; his Teeth jutting out a little toward his Lipps, which gave the Courtiers occaſion in Raillery to call him, The Elephant: a piece of Buffonnery wherein they ſpoke more truth than they were ware of; for an Elephant muſt he needs have been in ſtrength, who carryed the weight of ſo many Affairs, and ſo great Croſſes. Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight years after his death, as they were digging the Grave his body lay in, they drew out his Bones, and his Head, once the Palace of the greateſt Judgement that ever appeared in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Scull whereof was all of a piece, without Suture, the mark of a ſtrong Brain; but withal the cauſe of the continual Head-aches he was ſubject to, by the vapours wanting vent.</p>
            <p>This is the Pourtrait of his body: that of his mind is already drawn in thoſe many illuſtrious Actions, and ſage Counſels it produced: yet like the Painters finiſhing Touches, we'll add ſome obſervations to the body of our paſt Story. He expreſſed himſelf in few words, but handſome and very ſignificant, his Anſwers were clear and very intelligible; and when he diſcourſed of any buſineſs, he never went from the point; his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments were ſerious, ſaying often with the Roman Orator, We were not born to trifle away time, in ſports and playes, but to imploy our ſelves in ſerious Matters and Affairs of Weight. His Study was his Pleaſure; and Diſcourſes of Divinity his Recreations after Meat.</p>
            <p>True it is Melancholy was his, as moſt great mens predominant humour: but when it troubled him,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50543:103"/>
he retired from buſineſs, and appeared not to any but his moſt intimate Familiars. This diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it ſelf in ſome notable paſſages of his life, as the Baptizing the Moors of <hi>Granada,</hi> with the Laver, and his deſign to Conquer <hi>Africk.</hi> What he had once reſolved on, he executed with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible promptitude: <hi>Saluſt</hi> had taught him that leſſon which he would often repeat, That nimble Execution ought to tread on the heels of delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Reſolutions. No man more impatient of contempt and ſlights offered againſt his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, none more apt to endure Liberty of Speech.</p>
            <p>A Prieſt of <hi>Oſma</hi> deſired of him a Judge extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary to determine a ſuit he had depending, and preſſed him earneſtly, as the chief of the Council, to grant it; the Cardinal anſwered, The ordinary Judges ſhould do him right, that he muſt content himſelf with them, and abide ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with their Decree, that he knew not where to find better in all the Cities of <hi>Spain.</hi> Is it poſſible (ſaid the Prieſt) that the pittiful Burrough of <hi>Torrelagine</hi> ſhould give a Primate to all <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo many Cities not afford a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judge for a ſmall ſuit? The Cardinal find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo free in his expreſſion, thought he had belonged to ſome Grandee, who had ſet him on to ſpeak theſe words, and asked him, Who was his Maſter? My ſelf, ſaid the Prieſt, and I be, no other: You ſay well, replyed the Cardinal, you cannot have a better; and having given a Judge as deſired, diſmiſſed him. <hi>Contrera</hi> a Spaniſh Prieſt Preached one day before the Cardinal, and, with more Zeal than Diſcretion, inveighed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50543:103"/>
againſt Rich Habits, not conſidering how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they are to procure Reverence from the people to perſons in Authority and Eminent Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and turning to the Cardinal, he reproved him in the face of the Congregation for wearing a Robe lined with rich Furrs. The Cardinal took this Reprimande very patiently, and after Sermon invited the Preacher to Dinner, and commended his Sermon. Some write that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sermon he took the Preacher aſide into the Veſtry, and having opened his Boſome, ſhewed him a hair Cloth under his Robe; but I dare not affirm it, leſt I ſeem to condemn the moſt ſolid Judgement of that Age, of Levity. Time was one of the things moſt in his Eſteem, and knowing that the Loſs of it was irreparable, he was a very niggard of it, and loath to loſe a moment: he was alwayes Trimmed by Night, for fear of ſpending any part of the day on the neceſſities of his perſon, which might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched another time. And as he was Trimmed, it was his courſe to have ſome ſerious Book Read to him. He took an ineffable delight to beſtow Benefices in his Gift, on perſons Capable, who ſought them not, nor knew of the Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and ſeverely rejected ſuch as begged them of him, as failing in the reſpects due to his perſon. The way to miſs a promotion from him, was to begg it of him. One of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners had advice of a Vacancy very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him; and, knowing that if he moved not the Cardinal for it, he might beſtow it on one he never thought of; and that to begg it,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50543:104"/>
was to loſe it; he preſented himſelf to his Maſter, and beſpoke him thus: My Lord, ſuch a Benefice is void, To deſire it of you, were to violate your Laws, and the prohibitions you have made in that behalf, which I will never do, nor came I to that purpoſe, but humbly to crave your Directions how to obtain it. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal liked his addreſs, and anſwered, You ſhall have it with a good will, get the Writings diſpatched, and the Benefice will be yours; and inſtantly commanded his Secretary to provide them.</p>
            <p>But as he was ſevere in rejecting the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate requeſts of his Domeſticks, he was no leſs ready to acknowledge their Services, but would have his favours prevent their demands, to engage them with more grace, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obligation. 'Tis obſerved of this great Miniſter, that never Man ſerved him in or out of his Family, who was not largely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. God made man Free-born: Fortune hath Robbed him of that Liberty, by reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him under Servitude of great Ones, who are guilty of Raviſhing from him, what is moſt precious, his Liberty, and his Time; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they reſtore them the fruits of the one, and the other by way of recompence in ample rewards, which alone can repair the loſs of this letter, being otherwiſe irrecoverable.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal was apt to reſent Injuries, and Affronts, but no man more thankful for Pleaſures done him, which he never forgot. <hi>Brunet</hi> the Spaniard, mentioned in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
