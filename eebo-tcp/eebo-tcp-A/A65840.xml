            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THe daily Accounts we receive of the great Oppressions of our Friends in several Counties, upon the prosecution of the Statute 22th <hi>Car.</hi> 2. cap. 1. Entituled, <hi>An Act to prevent and suppress Seditious Conventicles,</hi> constraineth us yet further to make our Complaint to you, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that upon your weighty Consideration thereof, some way to relieve us may be found by you. In the perusal of the following Accounts you may see what Destruction and Spoil hath been made upon our Estates within these two or three years last past, many poor Families being wholly ruined, and Tradesmen that helped to imploy and relieve others, are now so impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, that they are fain to shut up their Shops, and be helped themselves, and the industrious and laborious are become a prey to the rapine of dissolute idle Informers, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hers, who after
<pb facs="tcp:58892:3"/>
they have devoured all they could find in one County, have gone to the next, hunting from Meeting to Meeting, nothing satisfying them till they have devoured all our outward Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, all which Oppressions we have endured with much patience and long-suffering, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that our assembling is in good conscience towards God, and that we have always endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to exercise a Conscience void of Offence towards men; and in such case where we could not obey what the Law of men required, we have yielded our selves patiently to suffer the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties inflicted on us, and have never Plotted nor Contrived to disturb the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or sought Revenge under our Sufferings, though they have extended not only to the Spoil of our outward Estates, but to Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Banishment, and loss of Life it self, and that of some Hundreds of us since the King's Restoration, as in the Relations following will particularly appear, and that chiefly for our peaceable Meeting together to Worship God, a Duty so incombent upon us, and so consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiously performed by us, that if the Law had been made to take away our Lives, as it was to destroy our Estates, we could not have forborn our assembling together, except we should have
<pb facs="tcp:58892:3"/>
been Treacherous to God, and our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</p>
            <p>And further, we desire you to consider the inequality of the aforesaid Act, the mercinary Informers, who Swear against us, gain part of our Estates to themselves; and we are convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Arbitrary Determinat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on of one Justice of the Peace, who in our absence is both Judge and Jury. And what-ever wrong is inflicted on us, our Appeal must not lie in any other Court, but only before the Parties themselves, complained of to do us the wrong, who are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times sole Judges in their own cases, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being often over-awed by them, so that they are afra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>How repugnant these Severities inflicted upon us are to the Indulgence formerly promised to us by the KING, you may judge, when you call to remembrance the many Declarations he was pleased formerly to make, for the Liberty

            <p>If the Lord shall put it in your Hearts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us from these our great Oppressions, we humby propose to you Consideration the repeal of the Statutes, 22th <hi>Car.</hi> 2. cap. 1. made against Conventicles, and the Statute 13th and 14th <hi>Car.</hi> 2. by which last Statute so many of our Friends suffered Imprisonment till Death, for conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously refusing to Swear in any case, and for their peaceable Meeting to Worship God.</p>

The 23d of the same Moneth, coming to the same place, he demanded of <hi>George Peace</hi> what his Name was; and because he gave not his Name suddainly, the said Justice drew his Kife upon him; but one of his Servants restrained him from his

wicked purpose. The 27th day of the same Moneth, at the same place, the said <hi>John Merideth</hi> took <hi>John Bawn</hi> and pulled him by the Hair of the Head, and after that finding him in the High-Way the same day, he fell upon him and beat him after a very Cruel and Barbarous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>And the said Justice <hi>Merideth</hi> did beat <hi>John Fryer</hi> and <hi>Joseph Glover,</hi> two Officers, because they refused to pull and hale People, as he would have them; Several others were also sorely beaten by him; and he broke five Glass Windows with his Staff, not leaving so much as one whole Quarrel, and caused the Benches and Fourms to be cut in pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Boy</hi> of <hi>Luckington,</hi> for three several Fines for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Meetings, had Goods taken from him worth 11 <hi>l.</hi> by Warrant from <hi>Gabriel Low,</hi> called Justice: And the Officers, when they seized upon the Sufferers Goods, belonging to <hi>Bodmanton</hi> Meeting, did say, <hi>They were charged by the said</hi> Gabriel Low <hi>to take all they could find, and that which was not worth a carrying away, they should burn it, or break it to pieces</hi>; insomuch that <hi>Thomas Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brow,</hi> an old Blind man and his Wife, and several other poor People had not a Bed left them, but their Lodging was on Straw for several Weeks; and the Blind man and his Wife had lain above eleaven Moneths on Straw, when the Account was sent up; and when Clothes were lent them by their Friends to keep them warm in the cold Season, the Officers took part of them away; And this Cruelty and Spoil did not suffice, but the poor Blind man, and one <hi>Henry Ashby</hi> of <hi>Hawksbury Upton,</hi> were Indicted for not going to the publick Worship, and by a Sessions process were apprehended and carryed to the Goal.</p>

                  <p>Thirty two Persons were fined for being at the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of <hi>Philip Tyler</hi> of <hi>Walton,</hi> 1675. for which they had taken from them in Cows, Corn, and other Goods, to the value of 82 <hi>l.</hi> and upwards, by Warrant from <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Paulet,</hi> Justice, who when none else would buy the distrained Cattle, he sent men to buy them for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
