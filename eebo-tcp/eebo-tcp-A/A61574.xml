         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have received your Letter,
and am extreamly well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with your Intentions of
Publishing the Sermons of that
most Reverend <hi>Prelate,</hi> Dr.
<hi>William Sancroft, Late Lord Arch-Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which he
long since Preached, and made
Public to the VVorld. Each
of them in the Front of the
<hi>Title,</hi> signifie to the View of
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:103100:3"/>
the <hi>Reader,</hi> the remarkable <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions</hi>
upon which they were
Preached; and being through
Length of Time become very
scarce and difficult to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
the Impression of each
of them, being worn out, I do
not doubt but it will be an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
Service to all who not
only Love <hi>Learning</hi> in general,
but likewise the Memory of
that <hi>Great Prelate,</hi> who had so
great a <hi>share</hi> of it <hi>himself,</hi> and
daily Encouraged and Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it in others.</p>
                  <p>The first of these <hi>Discourses</hi>
was Preached at St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster
on the first <hi>Sunday</hi> in
<hi>Advent,</hi> 1660. just after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of our Government in
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:103100:3"/>
                     <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> wherein the
Honour of our <hi>Church,</hi> and of
<hi>Episcopacy</hi> is most Learnedly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
against all the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
and weak Pretences and
Arguments of the <hi>Adversaries</hi>
of <hi>Both;</hi> and this at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
of Six Right Reverend
Bishops; who very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the Honours were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon them by that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Prince, <hi>King Charles the
Second,</hi> not only for the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
of their Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations,
but of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and other Public Services
they did for the Preserving
and Defending our Established
<hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi> in these
Realms in that <hi>Long Rebellion,</hi>
                     <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:103100:4"/>
which had endeavoured the
utter Ruin and Extirpation of
<hi>Both.</hi> And whoever peruses
this Sermon, will find he hath
handled it, as the Argument
of it requires, and the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Auditory,</hi> then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from him: And herein
he gave an Early Taste, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of his Abilities and Learning
on this Subject, but of what
he even then deserved, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
arrived to, the <hi>Greatest</hi>
our <hi>Church</hi> could give him,
and his <hi>Prince</hi> bestow upon
him.</p>
                  <p>The second was a <hi>Sermon,</hi>
which he Preached before the
<hi>King</hi> at <hi>Whitehall, October</hi> 10.
1666. on that Solemn Fast,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:103100:4"/>
which the Government had
appointed to bewail the Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
Judgment of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God upon the <hi>City</hi> of
<hi>London,</hi> by that Prodigious
Fire, which laid it in Dust
and Ashes: Wherein he shews
himself to be a great Master of
Devotion and Piety, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
the same in others, and
Encouraging the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to a real Sense of those Evils
they had suffered, and to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and timely Repentance of
all their Sins, least a worse
thing fell upon them.</p>
                  <p>The third Discourse was
Delivered likewise before the
<hi>House of Peers</hi> on the 13th.
of <hi>November,</hi> 1678. being the
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:103100:5"/>
Fast Day appointed by <hi>His
Majesty</hi> to implore the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Almighty God in the
Protection of his Majesties Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Person and his Kingdoms,
from the Attempts and Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
that were then on
Foot by the several <hi>Partisans</hi>
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All of which Discourses
were extorted from him, and
made Public by the <hi>Request</hi>
and <hi>Authority</hi> of those, before
whom he Preached, contrary
to the Inclination of his Mind,
and singular Modesty, which
was indeed Peculiar to him,
having ever affected a great
Privacy in his Thoughts and
Writings, being resolved never
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:103100:5"/>
to appear in Print, if he could
with any Decency avoid the
<hi>Importunity</hi> or <hi>Commands</hi> of those,
who requested the Publishing
of them.</p>
                  <p>But I shall say nothing more
concerning these <hi>Discourses,</hi> but
leave them to the Perusal of
the Judicious Reader, as you
desire.</p>
                  <p>All that I have now to do is
only to give you a short Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of this <hi>Excellent Person:</hi>
Though, I am very Conscious
to my self, that my Abilities
are not equal to this Attempt,
which I have at your request
undertaken; and therefore I
have rather chosen to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
my little Reputation to
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:103100:6"/>
your kind Importunity and
the Public Censure, then
that this little Volum of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
should go <hi>unpraefac'd</hi> to
the World. I am exceeding
sensible of the Boldness here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
of the most ingenious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signer,
to draw his <hi>Picture,</hi> as
it ought to be, and the most
skilful Hand would be at a
Loss for the true Features and
Lineaments of this Great Man;
but the best, though the most
difficult, Enterprize, ought not
to meet with any Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when it is designed well;
and not only for a Private but
a Public Good too.</p>
                  <p>His Life was the Transcript
of those excellent Endowments
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:103100:6"/>
and Virtues, which usually
Adorned the Lives of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Bishops;</hi> and as no one
could know more what belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Character of a true
<hi>Prelate,</hi> so no one Practised it
better. He Gradually Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to his Greatness, by ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Notices in the World: And,
while a Youth, and under the
Government of his <hi>Parents,</hi> he
was always addicted, through
the Pregnancy of his Genius,
to a great Sense of <hi>Piety</hi> and
<hi>Goodness,</hi> and out-striped the
great Care and Education of
his <hi>Masters,</hi> by the large
Steps and Progress he daily
made in Learning and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<hi>Cambridge</hi> was the Place
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:103100:7"/>
he came to, when he at first
appeared in the World, and
so became the happy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of this Renowned <hi>Prelate,</hi>
in the very Bloom of his
Years: Which is a just Honour
to that great <hi>Seat</hi> of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and which any other
<hi>Vniversity</hi> I am sure would just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
boast of. He was settled
in <hi>Emmanuel</hi> College, and no
sooner there, but he gave the
World those Early Hopes of
him, as he made good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after in many of the
great Actions of his Life.</p>
                  <p>His Accomplishments in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Literature</hi> were very sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising,
and within a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
while after his being there,
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:103100:7"/>
he became Master of the
whole Circle of it: Which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Occasions in Public as
well as in Private, shewed it
self very remarkably. In this
he had a peculiar Talent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an admirable <hi>Critic</hi> in all
the Antient and Classic Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
both among the <hi>Greeks</hi>
and <hi>Romans.</hi> He had through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
digested all their Learning
in <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>History,</hi> and this
without the least Affectation
of Vanity, or Ostentation of
Learning. He attained to that
Perfection in it, that as it was
his Divertion, so he made it
an Advancement to his other
Studies. He made it subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to the carrying on his
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:103100:8"/>
unwearied Labours in <hi>Theology.</hi>
In this he spent the greatest
part of his Time, and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
the Soyl, in which it
was planted to so great a height,
that it became exceeding Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and I do not doubt, within
a short space of Time, but that
the Learned World will be the
better for many Noble Fruits
and Productions of it. Were
there only these, which we
now Present you with, it
would be sufficient to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the Greatness of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the Excellency of his
Learning.</p>
                  <p>The Great Men of that
Time, who were justly Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Learning, and Honoured
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:103100:8"/>
with those Rewards in the
Church, that might make them
Public Benefits and Examples
to the World, quickly took
Notice of Him, as a Person,
who was growing into Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and whose Extraordinary
Parts and Abilities would soon
Ripen him for the Greatest
Employments his Profession
could Entitle him too. He
was intimately Known to all
the Learned Bishops of that
Age, and particularly to the
Most Reverend Doctor <hi>Iohn
Cosens,</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
who had singled him
out to be his Chaplain, and
(which was a far greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to him) His Friend
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:103100:9"/>
and Confident; He was most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
Beloved by all the <hi>Great
Ones,</hi> both in Church and
State, and so might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
whatever he could
have desired in the Church,
from those, who had so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
excellent Preferments in
their Donations: But Privacy
and a retired Life, was the
only thing he Coveted; and
preferred to all the greatest
Employments they could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
upon Him. Because
this did best Improve his
Mind, as it gave him the
largest Opportunities of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the greatest Stock and
Treasure of Knowledge and
Wisdom: Which he esteemed
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:103100:9"/>
above all the Honours and
Wealth in the Kingdom.
He never did desire either
to be Rich or Great, but
to be as <hi>Knowing</hi> as he
could be; which he thought
could never be obtained,
but by <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Quietness,</hi>
and by <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Study,</hi>
which are very much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by Public Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Employments. And
being therefore blessed with
admirable natural Parts, and
Qualifications of Mind, he
resolved to take this Course,
to obtain the End he Aim'd
at, of gaining as much Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as he could, to render
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:103100:10"/>
him every way Serviceable
to his Profession and to the
World.</p>
                  <p>He had an Understanding
that was extended to all the
Parts of useful Knowledge,
and this improv'd by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
and Foreign Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He spent some Years
in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> amongst
the most Learned <hi>Personages</hi>
that those <hi>Countries</hi> could
boast of. Here he prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Studies with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
Industry, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and Beloved by every
one, for the singular Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and Affability of his
Mind and Temper, and for
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:103100:10"/>
his great Attainments in
all manner of Knowledge,
that could render him not
only an Honour to his
Country and Profession, but
highly Acceptable to all
Learned and Ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                  <p>Some time before the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration</hi>
of our <hi>Government,</hi>
he returned to his Native
Soyl, and lived in that <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy</hi>
and <hi>Retirement,</hi> which
was so suitable to his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
till the <hi>Place</hi> of his
Education in the <hi>Vniversity,</hi>
became the Scene of his
Government: Wherein that
<hi>College</hi> may justly boast of
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:103100:11"/>
it's Happiness, by reason of
the great <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
which was Visible to
every one of the <hi>Fellows,</hi> by
his Careful Management of
their Affairs, giving every
day Instances of his great
Understanding, and clear In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
in the Nature of <hi>Business,</hi>
and in his most Obliging De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
to every Member of
that <hi>Society;</hi> Who were encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by his great Example
to Laborious Study, and to
the <hi>Prosecution</hi> of the Greatest
Attempts in Learning.</p>
                  <p>Here he staid not long,
but was by that Wise and
Discerning <hi>Prince,</hi> King
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:103100:11"/>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to the <hi>Deanary</hi> of
St. <hi>Pauls;</hi> St. <hi>Pauls</hi> being
through Length of Time,
and a Barbarous <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
become very much Decay'd
and Ruin'd; it was necessary
that so Charitable a <hi>Person</hi>
should be fix'd in that <hi>Post,</hi>
in order to contrive VVays
for the Repairing of her
Breaches, and the Decays She
then lay under. None I
am sure had a larger Heart
for such an Undertaking, and
a more eager Inclination
to endeavour all he could
to Restore her to her former
<hi>Beauty:</hi> And in Order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:103100:12"/>
while he sate in this
<hi>Chair,</hi> no one could have
Husbanded her <hi>Revenues</hi> with
a more frugal, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Oeconomy, in order
to Advance her to her
Greatness, wherein She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in former Ages. But
while he was carrying on
this Noble Design, it fell a
Sacrifice to that dismal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration,
and had <hi>Burning</hi>
instead of <hi>Beauty.</hi> However
this fatal Judgment which
befel this Renowned City,
and Noble Structure which
had been the Honour of our
Nation, and the Admiration
of all the World, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:103100:12"/>
Ages, did not lessen his
singular Zeal for the <hi>House</hi>
of <hi>God.</hi> His Labours and
Solicitations in order to the
Re-building of it, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied,
and he was as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
to raise this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>Pyle</hi> out of its Ashes,
as he had been before to
support it in it's Ruin.</p>
                  <p>Here he continued for
many Years, Adorning the
Post he was in, by Re-buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the <hi>Deanary,</hi> and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
its <hi>Revenue,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on his great Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of doing all the
Good he could to the
Church in General, and to
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:103100:13"/>
his <hi>Own</hi> in Particular: While
this was the daily Object
of his Thoughts, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he was unexpectedly,
and without the least Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in Himself, Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
This Promotion, as it was an
<hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> which flow'd
from the Great Benignity
of his <hi>Prince;</hi> so it was the
Effect of that Judgment in
his <hi>Majesty,</hi> which all the
World acknowledged to be
remarkable in him. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was not possible
for him to lie long hid,
though He Industriously
sought it, and seemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:103100:13"/>
to be earnestly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to the Acceptance of
it, than through any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Desire after Greatness dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
towards it. No sooner
that the World knew of
his <hi>Nomination</hi> to the <hi>See,</hi>
but his Advancement thither
met with an Universal Joy
and Satisfaction. Every one
were sensible of what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Days this truly <hi>Primitive
and Apostolical Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
would enjoy under his
Zealous Patronage, and how
much <hi>Learning</hi> would flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in these <hi>Kingdoms</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Auspicious Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Protection: And
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:103100:14"/>
so indeed it hath, <hi>He</hi> being
generally known to be a
hearty and faithful Friend
to all that had any Merit
to expect his Favour, or
desire it. He carefully sought
out such Persons for the
<hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in those
<hi>Preferments,</hi> that fell within
his Gift, as were of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Abilities, of great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and of Exemplary Lives
and Conversations. He had
a Heart enlarged to the
greatest Hospitality that
could be, and his Charity
was Diffusive to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Objects relating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
He was a constant
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:103100:14"/>
Friend to <hi>Learning,</hi> to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
and to our <hi>Established
Church,</hi> and designed to wear
away the Remains of his
Life, his Estate, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
for the Encouragement
and Preservation of them.
He had for many Years
been Collecting a Useful Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
of the best Books in
every Science, but Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>Philology, History</hi> and
<hi>Divinity;</hi> and all these of
the best Editions, which he
at first Designed for the
Public Library at <hi>Lambeth;</hi>
but afterwards he altered his
Intentions, and sent this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Present to his own <hi>College,</hi>
                     <pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:103100:15"/>
where they Design an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Apartment to their
Library in Commemoration
of so useful and generous
a Benefaction.</p>
                  <p>He was a great Admirer
of the Excellency of our
<hi>Liturgy,</hi> in the last Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of which, just after the
Restitution of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> as
he was very much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so he was a constant
Attender upon the Public
Worship of <hi>GOD,</hi> both in
Private and in Public. His
Behaviour was always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Grave, and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and when-ever present
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:103100:15"/>
at the Public Service of
the <hi>Church,</hi> he had not only
a Habit of Seriousness, visibly
dwelt upon his Mind and
Spirit, but a Reverend and
Profound Humility, which
appeared in the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
of his Heart. In a
Word, he had all the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Qualification, both of
a Great and of a Good Man;
he was a Wise <hi>Prelate,</hi> a
most Learned <hi>Divine,</hi> an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
<hi>Scholar,</hi> a Just <hi>Man,</hi>
a Faithful <hi>Friend,</hi> an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Councellor,</hi> a Kind and
Tender <hi>Master</hi> to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
a great <hi>Benefactor</hi> to
others, a Thankful <hi>Beneficiary,</hi>
                     <pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:103100:16"/>
where he was obliged, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Zealous <hi>Asserter</hi> of his
Religion, against <hi>Popery</hi> on
the one side, and <hi>Fanaticism</hi>
on the other, and (in short)
all the single Perfections
that make many Men Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
were United in this
<hi>Primate,</hi> and render'd him
<hi>Illustrious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I have ventur'd
in hast to give you my
Thoughts of this most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
<hi>Prelate,</hi> while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and I am confident you
earnestly expect at the same
Time, I should say something
how he Died. All that I
shall observe, is, that his
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:103100:16"/>
Retirement into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was wholly in order
thereunto, that he might lay
his Remains in the very same
Soyl, where he first recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his Being. His Time
was spent most in Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for his great Change,
which he expected with the
same Joy and Pleasure of
Mind, as others are wont
to do their Advancements
to Honour and Greatness.
The World was what he
never Loved, but only for
those Opportunities it gave
him of doing Good. He
parted with his Life with
the same Submission to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:103100:17"/>
Providence, as the
<hi>Christians of Old</hi> did, with
an humble Chearfulness and
Resignation of Spirit. He
spent most of his Time in
Private Devotion and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
in daily Prayers to
God, for Himself and the
whole World, in Reading
and Meditations, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Duties are necessary
for a Good Man, and a
Dying Christian. He was
some Months before he Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
seized with a Fit of an
Ague, which confined him
to his Bed for many Weeks.
The third Fit proved so
exceeding violent, that it
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:103100:17"/>
was in great Likelihood to
have Mastered his Nature
and Constitution, and Carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him off; every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him thinking, and His
<hi>Grace</hi> likewise finding, His
Strength so far gone, that
it seemed impossible for him
to have Grappled with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
However, it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
though against his
Inclinations, by the <hi>Cortex
Peruvianus,</hi> being more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to Dye than Live.</p>
                  <p>He was, for many Days in
Prospect of Death, which he
saw as it approached, and
felt it come on by Degrees;
and to the very last Minute
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:103100:18"/>
of his Expiring Breath (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
placed Himself in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of Dying, and Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Recommendatory Prayer</hi>
in the <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Visitation
of the Sick</hi> to be read to him:
He immediately Resigned his
Spirit to Almighty God) and
thereby gave all that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him great Cause to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
his <hi>Faith</hi> towards <hi>GOD,</hi>
his <hi>Zeal</hi> to his <hi>Church,</hi> his
<hi>Constancy</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> his <hi>Contempt</hi>
of the <hi>World,</hi> his Universal
<hi>Charity</hi> to all Mankind, and
his Chearful Hopes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
                  <p>He Dyed on the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Fourth of <hi>November,</hi>
                     <pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:103100:18"/>
between Twelve and One
of the Clock, and was Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on the Twenty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
between Eight and
Nine, very Privately (as
He himself Ordered it) in
<hi>Fresingfield</hi> Church-Yard, on
the <hi>South-side,</hi> as near the
Wall, as they could Lay
Him. A Place indeed of
his Own Chusing, Sixteen
Years Since, at which
Time, he was Nominated
to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>CANTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BVRY:</hi>
But before his
Instalment, he took a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
down into <hi>SVF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FOLK,</hi>
to see his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and his Native
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:103100:19"/>
Place, and then told his
Friends, they should Bury
Him There, in Case He
should Dye in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Though afterwards
he Changed his Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and made a Place for
his <hi>Interment</hi> in his own
<hi>Palace</hi> at <hi>LAMBETH:</hi>
But upon his Deprivation,
and Return to the Place of
his Nativity, he Re-assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his former Resolutions,
and Disposed of his Body
as above mentioned, and
his <hi>SOVL</hi> into the Arms
of his Dearest SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:103100:19"/>What then Remains for
Us, but to Preserve the
Memory of his Great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
always fresh in our
Minds, and Express as far
as we are able, the Copy
of them in our Practice;
for this will be the best
Way of Remembring the
Dead, which brings in
most Advantage to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and the truest Way
to Honour Him, is to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate
what was so good,
and highly Commendable
in Him: When the Piety and
Humility, the Justice and
Charity, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Excellent Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:103100:20"/>
of this <hi>Great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
are kept Alive, and
shewn in the Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those that Survive
Him. It is only these
Virtues, which have Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
those that have gone
before Us, and which can
Carry Us too, in the
End, to a joyful Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Worthy Sir, I have
at your Request, ventured
to give you a brief Account
of this most <hi>Excellent Prelate,</hi>
and am very Conscious to my
self, the <hi>Character</hi> I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you of <hi>Him,</hi> is Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
short of his Extraordinary
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:103100:20"/>
Merit. I might have insisted
upon many Peculiar Passages
of the Life and Actions of
this <hi>Great Man,</hi> which would
have been more Honourable
to him, there being no VVay
so Advantagious of drawing
out Excellent <hi>Persons,</hi> as by
shewing the Draught which
they have made of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
their own most Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
Actions making
them more truly Illustrious,
than all the Paint and Varnish
of an abstracted Eloquence:
Especially, because this is of
more Use, and a better Help
to Imitation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xl" facs="tcp:103100:21"/>But I have chosen rather
to give you my Thoughts of
Him, in the General, not
doubting but some more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and Larger Account will
in due Time be Published

I have this Satisfaction, that
you will, I am sure, Accept

Ordination, and Jurisdiction too, the
whole Office must be managed, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
<hi>As I had appointed thee.</hi>
These are the Parts.</p>
                  <p>Of which that I may so speak, and
you so hear, and all of us so remember,
and so practice, that God's holy Name
may be glorified, and we all built up in
the knoledge of that Truth, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto Godliness; We beseech God
the Father, in the Name of his Son <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> to give us the assistance of his
Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And in these, and all other our Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
let us always remember to pray for
Christ'<hi>s</hi> Holy Catholic Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the
whole Congregation of Christian People, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
through the whole World; That it
would please Almighty God to purge out of
it all <hi>Schism, Error</hi> and <hi>Heresie,</hi> and to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103100:26"/>
unite all <hi>Christians</hi> in one Holy Bond of
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> that so at length the
happy Day may draw upon us, in which all
that do confess his Holy Name, may agree
in the truth of his Holy Word, and live in
Unity, and godly Love. More especially
let us pray for the Churches of <hi>England,
Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> That the God of
Peace, who maketh Men to be of one Mind
in a House, would make us All of one Soul,
and of one Spirit, that again we may meet
together, and praise Him with one Heart
and Mouth, and worship him with one Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in the Beauty of Holiness. To this
end, I am to require you most especially to
pray for the King'<hi>s</hi> most Excellent Majesty,
our Sovereign Lord <hi>Charles,</hi> by the Grace
of God, King of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Defender of the Faith, and
Supream Governor in these His Realms, and
in all other his Dominions and Countries,
over all Persons, in all Causes, as well Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,
as Temporal: That God would
Establish His Throne in Righteousness, and
His Seed to all Generations. Also for our
gracious Lady <hi>Mary</hi> the Queen-Mother, for
the most Illustrious Prince, <hi>James</hi> Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> and for the whole Royal Family:
That God would take them all into
His Care, and make them the Instruments
of His Glory, and the good and welfare of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103100:26"/>
these Nations. Further, let us pray for
the Ministers of God'<hi>s</hi> Holy Word and
Sacraments, as well Arch-Bishops, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
as other Pastors and Curates; for the
Lords and others of his Majesties most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Council; and for all the Nobility
and Magistrates of the Realm: That All,
and every of these, in their several Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
may serve truly and painfully to the
Glory of God, and the edifying, and well
governing of his People, remembring the
account that they must make. Let us also
pray for the Universities of this Land,
<hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford:</hi> That God would
water them with his Grace, and still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
them the Nurseries of Religion and
Learning to the whole Land. Let us pray
for the whole Commons of this Realm: That
remembring at last from whence they are
faln, they may repent, and do the first works,
living henceforth in Faith and Fear of God,
in humble Obedience to their <hi>King,</hi> and
in Brotherly Charity one to another. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
let us praise God for all those that
are already departed out of this Life in the
Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> and pray unto <hi>God</hi> we may
have Grace to direct our Lives after their
good Examples; that, this Life ended, we
may be made partakers with them of the
glorious Resurrection in the Life Everlasting.
For which, and for all other needful Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103100:27"/>
let us say together the Prayer of our
Lord, who hath taught us to say, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

Who, to serve the over-high pretences of

what variety of Opinion hath past, even

our Learning, as its End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and so suitable (one would think)
to our Inclination too. The Character,

a new <hi>Model</hi> of Government, a

so many Learners they are but few that
learn Righteousness:—And therefore,
God himself here opens us a School;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103100:55"/>
erects a severe Discipline in the Text;
brings forth his <hi>Ferulas,</hi> when nothing
else will serve the Turn. For he hath
indeed <hi>four</hi> Schools, or rather four di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Forms, and Classes in the same great
<hi>School of Righteousness;</hi> the last only
(that of his Judgments) express in the

                  <p>For whether we look upon the latter
Clause of the proposition. <hi>The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

find our selves there under a double For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality;
As Learners, and as Inhabiters.
As Learners first, and so indued with

capable of Learning, what is to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
stampt, and possest with first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and common Notions which deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
search'd and duly improv'd, and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated,
might teach us Much of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
And this is <hi>Schola Cordis in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo

God's first School in the little World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us. Secondly, as Inhabitants of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> great World, which is God's School too,
as well as his Temple, full of Doctrins
and Instructions; <hi>Schola Orbis,</hi> in which,

that both from the Natural World, and
from the Political; whether <hi>Schola Regni,</hi>
or <hi>Schola Ecclesiae.</hi> Or if we return to
the former Branch of the Text, <hi>When
thy Iudgments are in the Earth.</hi> This
<hi>when they</hi> are, supposeth another time,

the School of God's severe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
driving us to Repentance, and
compelling us to come in and learn Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
A provision (you see) every
way sufficient, and abundant for our
Learning, were not we wanting to our
selves.</p>
                  <p>But alas! We may run by the Text,
and easily read in it these <hi>three</hi> things,
as so many very Natural Deductions, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Emanations from it. First, our own
Ignorance and Stupidity; <hi>Born like a
wilde Asse</hi>'s <hi>Colt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job. xi. 12.</note> as <hi>Zophar</hi> speaks;
and then to our Natural we add affected
Ignorance too: So that we are much to
seek, and to learn Righteousness it must
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103100:56"/>
be taught us. Secondly, God's infinite
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and inexpressible Grace and Mercy to
us: that when we had blurr'd the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
defac'd the first Traces of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
upon our Souls, he was pleas'd
to provide Expedients to teach it us
again the second time, that we might
be <hi>renewed unto Knowledge after the Image
of him,<note place="margin">Col. iii 10. Ephe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. iv. 24.</note> that created us in Righteousness,</hi> as
the Apostle speaks. And Thirdly, Our
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> indocible and unteachable Humour, our
foul and shameful Non-proficiency under
so plentiful a Grace. For though the
Text indeed speaks of our learning Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
when God's Judgments are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us; yet (if the Appearances of the
World abroad suggested nothing to the
contrary) 'tis introduc'd here in the Text
too, as the Effect of the last Form in
God's School, in exclusion of all the
former as ineffectual; his utmost Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
not to be used but at a pinch, when
all the rest are baffled, and prove impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
upon us: And then 'tis exprest
in the Original, and learned <hi>Versio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

with so many Limitations and Aba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(as we shall see by and by) that
we may well give it up as the sum and
up-shot of all, that our All-merciful
God omits no Means or Methods of
our Improvement; but we (supinely
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103100:57"/>
negligent, and prodigiously stubborn as
we are) render them all ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>That we may do so no longer, but
rather make good the profession, with
which we have dar'd to appear this Day
before God, of humbling our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Almighty Hand; Let us, before
we pass on any further, lift up our Hands
and our Hearts to Him in the Heavens,
beseeching him by the Power of his
Mighty Grace so to sanctifie to us All,
both the Sense of his present Judgment,
and all our Meditations and Discourses
thereupon, that by all we may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
in learning Righteousness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THe Inhabitants of the World will
learn Righteousness or Iustice:</hi> What's
that? Is there such a thing in the World?
Or is it a Name only, and a glorious
pretence? Is it not only another word
for <hi>Interest</hi> or Utility, and so nothing
just,<note place="margin">V. Lactant. lib. v.</note> but what is profitable; <hi>Carneades</hi>
his infamous Assertion retriv'd and own'd
with open face by Christians? Is it not
the taking of a party, or the espousing
of a Faction, and appearing for it with
heat and animosity; and a savage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
and destroying All that are
not of it? Is it not the Profession to
believe such a <hi>Systeme</hi> of Opinions, what
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103100:57"/>
life soever is consequent thereupon? An
airy invisible Righteousness, that never
embodies or appears in our Actions, but
hovers in the Clouds, in speculations
and fancies, where no Man can find
it?</p>
                  <p>The Truth is, there is no piece of
Unrighteousness more common in the
World, than thus to weigh Justice it
self in an unjust Ballance; while every
one contrives his <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> so as to
salve the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> so declares his
Notion, as may best suit and comport
with his own unrighteous practices.
But the Righteousness we are to learn
in God's School, must not be a self-chosen
Righteousness: We must not pay God
our Soveraign, the Tribute of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in Coin of our own stamping;
it must be such as will abide the Touch-stone
of his Word, and the Ballance of
his Sanctuary. To make short, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
or Justice, though elsewhere
a single Vertue, yet here 'tis virtually
All:—<gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Chrisostome: Omnes Virtutum species uno
Iustitiae nomine,</hi> saith St. <hi>Ierome.</hi> Not
a particular Star, nor a single Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but a whole Heaven of Vertues, an
entire Globe of Moral and Christian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
an Universal Rectitude of the

Righteous Law,<note place="margin">Hom. 12. in S. Matth.</note> the Rule of our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
Or if you will in two words,
'tis <hi>Suum cuique</hi> to give every one his
Due; <hi>Suum Deo</hi> first, and then <hi>Suum
proximo;</hi> give God his Due, and your
Neighbour too: These are the integral
parts of it. So that Righteousness, as
the great Rule of it, hath two Tables,
or, if you will two <hi>Hemispheres,</hi> the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and the nether: Both so vast, that
we cannot measure them in a Span (the
Span of time allotted me;) I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
contract them to the occasion, and
give you only some of those particular
Lessons of Righteousness, which this
present Judgment of God upon our Land
seems most clearly to take us forth, both
into relation to God himself, and to our
Neighbours; and then call you, and my
self to a serious Scrutiny, how well we
have learn'd them, and so an end.</p>
                  <p>And first we begin (as we ought)
in giving God his due; in rendring to
God the things that are Gods. To limit
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103100:58"/>
this wide Universality too, and render
it more proper, and peculiar we may
reduce all to that first of <hi>Esai</hi>'s three

                     <note place="margin">C. xxiv. 15.</note> giving him

the Glory of his Goodness and <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Give him the Glory of his Power
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and Greatness; which the Prophet calls,
<hi>Singing for the Majesty of the Lord,</hi> Chap.
xxiv. 15. or <hi>Beholding the Majesty of the
Lord, when his Hand is lifted up,</hi> in the
verse after my Text. How great and
glorious our God is, who is in himself
incomprehensible, appears best by the
glorious greatness of his Works. If he
builds, it is a World, Heaven and Earth,
and the Fulness of both. If he gives,
it is his only Son out of his Bosom,
the Brightness of his Glory, and the
express Image of his Person. If he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
'tis a Crown, 'tis a whole Heaven
of Glories. If he be angry, he sends
a deluge; opens the Cataracts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
above, and breaks up the Fountains
of the great Deep below, and pours
forth whole Flouds of Vengeance:<note place="margin">Salvian.</note> Or
else he rains down Hell out of Heaven,

Lake of Brimstone. If he discover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

though the Intention be meer Mercy,

him when he pleases, and let him loose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

All is well; 'tis our dear pastime, and a

others, and flatter our selves, that we
are more righteous than they. To meet
with this ill Humour, God hath reacht
us now an universal stroak that comes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103100:64"/>

Strange furniture, one would think for a

                  <p>Mercy first, that God spar'd us, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103100:65"/>
for his Will's sake alone they were and
are created. He carries Nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in his Bosom, fostering and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
her; and that not only as she
came out of his own hand, and bears
the Impresses of his Infinite Wisdom
and Power; but as we have transform'd
and disguis'd her by our petty skill;
as she is fettered and shackled by our

so it is also as deep in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,)
'tis Righteousness <hi>Internally</hi>
and <hi>Spiritually</hi> too; as being a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
taught us by God's, and not by
Man's, Judgments only, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
must have an Effect proportionable:
'Tis when thy Judgments are in the
Earth, Men will learn—As the <hi>Iews,</hi>
while <hi>their Fear towards God was taught
them by the Precepts of Men, drew near
to him, and honoured him with their
Mouth,</hi> only, <hi>but removed their Hearts
far away from him,</hi> Isai. xxix. 13. Upon
the same Ground, our Righteousness
will never exceed the Righteousness of
Scribes, and Pharisees, Hypocrites, must
needs prove Noise, and appearance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
a meer and vain Semblance, if we
learn it in no higher School than Mans;
take it forth from the XII. Tables only,
not from the Two, and have no other
Tutor in it than <hi>Solon,</hi> or <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> or
<hi>Iustinian.</hi> For the Derivation can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103100:69"/>
no higher than the Fountain-head;
and what is taught us only by the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of</hi> Omri, or <hi>at</hi> Caesar's <hi>Iudgment-seat,</hi>
will never come up to what the
perfect Law of God requires. While we
are under this lower and external Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
only, if we can but skulk and
shift, and play least in sight, and seem
to be righteous, though we are not so;
<hi>Recti in Curia,</hi> though not <hi>upright in
Heart:</hi> Or if we be discovered and
impleaded too, if we can, whether by
Power or Artifice, break through the
venerable Cobweb, and run under the
miserable shelter of a Temporal Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
at these lower Bars: Why, All is
well;<note place="margin">Prov. 30. 20.</note> with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wanton we wipe
our Mouths, and are suddenly very
Virgins again, not only safe, but inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
too. But though Humane Laws
exact only outward Compliances, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
not to themselves to judge the
Heart, because they cannot discern it,
nor take Cognizance of secret Thoughts
and Purposes, further than they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
by overt Acts: Yet God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and a Discerner of the inmost
Thoughts and Intentions; and his Law
Spiritual too, and given to the Spirit;
and the Righteousness taught in his
School, is not a Carcass, nor an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103100:69"/>
only, but a living Soul, and a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Righteousness: and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it stays not in the outward Act,
(the proper Object of Human Laws
and Provisions;) restrains not only open
violences (such as the Judgment-seat of
Man condemns, and the Schaffold, or
the Gibbet take notice of;) not only
smooths and polisheth the outward Garb,
to render that plausible in the eyes of the
World: But goes yet further and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
even to the Heart; composeth the
whole Inner-Man too, and labours to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
that to the Righteous Judge, who
sees not as Man sees; and, in fine, calls us
up to that glorious height of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians in <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd
indeed the Municipal Laws of their
Country, but out-liv'd them too, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
them far, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
as he speaks; they contented
not themselves with so scant Measures,
but flew a higher and a nobler pitch, aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at a more refin'd and perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
the worthy Effect of God's
Judgments, and not of Mans only;
taught in his School alone, and not at
our Tribunals. And then,</p>
                  <p>Lastly, 'Tis Righteousness <hi>Positively</hi>
and <hi>Affirmatively</hi> too. For though the
Decalogue is almost all over <hi>Negative in</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:103100:70"/>
in the Style and Form of it; yet, our
Lord, by reducing all the Precepts of it
to one <hi>Affirmative (Love,)</hi> and also by
his <hi>Affirmative</hi> Glosses or Additions to
it in his <hi>Sermon</hi> on the <hi>Mount,</hi> seems to
have authorised the Rule of their Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
receiv'd generally by Christian
Divines, <hi>That the Negative still infers
the Affirmative,</hi> and that there are many
<hi>Yeas</hi> conceal'd in the Bosom of every
such <hi>No.</hi> So that however 'tis indeed a
part of our Duty, not to Murther, and
not to Slander, and not to Cover, and
the like, (an Obligation consequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God's prohibition; and he takes it
well, when for his sake we abstain from
the Evil we are inclin'd or strongly sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
to, and so accepts graciously our
very <hi>Nothing,</hi> as I may call it, our <hi>not
doing</hi> amiss; thus giving us leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close,
as it were, a part of our Waste,
and to raise some Revenue upon it:)
Yet this is so much short of the Height
of the Lesson we are to learn in God's
School, that 'tis only the unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
something that might obstruct it;
so far from making us truly <hi>Righteous,</hi>
that it can only Style us <hi>Innocent,</hi> and
set us <hi>Extra vitia</hi> rather than <hi>Intra vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem.</hi>
We must not then content our
selves with a <hi>Negative</hi> Righteousness;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103100:70"/>
nor confine, and limit it within the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bounds of the Pharisaical Boast, <hi>That
we are not,<note place="margin">Luc. xxiii. ii.</note> as other Men are, Extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
or Unjust:</hi> In some Cases he is unjust
too,<note place="margin">Ps. cxii. 9. Isai. lviii. 7, 8.</note> that gives not his own, as well as he
that takes away what is anothers: In the
Sacred Dialect, Alms-Deeds are Justice
too; Even Acts of Mercy, and Bounty
to those that need them, <hi>stricti Iuris,</hi> a
part of our Righteousness sometimes so
indispensable, as not to be omitted
without Sin. And therefore glorifie
thy self no longer, that thou do'st harm
to no Man:

Sin: And the dreadful Decretory
Sentence proceeds at the last Day, not
for oppressing the Poor, but for not feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not cloathing, not visiting them:
A reflection very common indeed; yet
never more proper or seasonable then at
this time, when God presents us an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Charity, the greatest, I think,
and the most considerable that was ever
offer'd to this Nation, and when Heaven
and Earth expect, that something extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
should be done.</p>
                  <p>I have now opened the Book, and laid
it before you, and given you a short
Draught of this very important Lesson:
a Lesson so considerable, that our Wise
and Good God thinks it worth his
while to rout Armies, and sink Navies,
to burn up Cities, and turn Kingdoms
upside down; to send Wars, and Plagues,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103100:71"/>
and Conflagrations amongst us; to set
open all his Schools, and ply all his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest
Methods to teach it us the more
effectually. Think now, that he looks
down this Day from Heaven to take
Notice of our Proficiency; to see how
far we are advanc'd by these his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in learning Righteousness. And
is it possible, we should stand out any
longer? Can we still resist so powerful
a Grace? Are not the parts of the Text
by this time, happily met together? And
the Truth of it accomplisht, and exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in us to the full?—God's Judgments
on us, and his Righteousness in us? Who
would not think and hope so? But as St.
<hi>Ierom</hi> complains of his Age (which was
indeed very calamitous) <hi>Orbus Romanus
ruit, &amp; tamen Cervix nostra non flectitur:</hi>
The World sinks and cracks about our
Ears, and yet our Neck as stiff, and the
Crest of our Pride as lofty, and as erect
as ever. How few are they that repent
in Dust and Ashes, even now, that God
hath laid our City in Dust, and our
Houses in Ashes! Look we first upon
the Text, and then upon our Selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and we must ingenuously acknowledge,
that whatever Abatements or Diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Height of the design'd event
of God's Judgments upon us the Text,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103100:72"/>
or any <hi>Version</hi> of it note, or imply, our
wretched evil Lives do but too plainly
express and justifie. For—</p>
                  <p>1. Who are they that are said here
to learn Righteousness in the Text? Not
always the Afflicted themselves, it seems;
but some others that stand by and look
on. For 'tis not to be omitted, that the
Phrase manifestly varies in the parts of
the Proposition: <hi>Iudgments in the Earth,</hi>
or upon the Land, some particular
Country; and the <hi>World</hi> at large, or
some few in it <hi>learn Righteousness.</hi> Thus
<hi>Tyrus shall be devour'd with Fire,</hi> saith
the Prophet:<note place="margin">Zach. ix. 4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Ashkelon shall see it, and
fear; Gaza and Ekron shall be very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful:</hi>
But not a word how <hi>Tyrus</hi> her
self is affected. God forbid it should
be so with us! May it never be said,
that any of our Neighbours make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
use of our Calamities, than we our
Selves! Have we any so hard-hearted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, that can look upon so sad a
Spectacle, as if they sate all the while in
the Theatre, or walkt in a Gallery of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures;
little more concerned, then at
the Siege of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> or the Ruines
of <hi>Troy?</hi> Shall any Neighbour-City
say wisely—<hi>Mea res agitur, jam
proximus ardet Ucalegon—?</hi> Shall
our Enemies themselves (the sober and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103100:72"/>
the Wise amongst them, at the least)
tremble at the Relation, and we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
stupid, and senseless? Shall <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
and <hi>Alexandria</hi> resent it,
and we not regard it as we ought?
Nay, shall <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> (it may
be) <hi>Surat</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> both the
<hi>Indies</hi> hear, and be affected with it,
and we our selves insensible? Shall the
Inhabitants of the World abroad warm
themselves at our Fires, with kindly
and holy Heats; while in the mean
time our Repentings are not kindled,
nor our Charity inflam'd, and our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
as cold and frozen as ever? Shall
our Mountain (which we said in our
jolly pride should never be removed) be
fulminated, and thunder strook, but
the blessed shower that follows, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
that descends after, like the
Rain, slide off to the Vallies, to Others,
that are round about us? Our Lord
<hi>wept</hi> over <hi>Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Luc. xix. 41.</note> because she knew
not then</hi> (at forty years distance) <hi>the
time of her Visitation; for the Days will
come,</hi> saith He, <hi>when there shall not be
left one Stone upon another:</hi> But Wo is
me! Our Day is come already, and
our Visitation now actually upon us;
and yet I fear, we will not know it, as
we ought. For,—</p>

the whole stress of his Righteousness,

deeper than so: 'Tis that we must sweat

The life of Religion is Doing. What we

Christians at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Anointed to Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as the word implies; and this Name
sticks by them still, as the more essential.
Their Oyl must not be spent all in the

their Exercises too, <hi>In Gymnasio Iustitiae,</hi>
be anointed to the <hi>Agon,</hi> and to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat

and renounce them all for ever; and yet
further, take forth new Lessons of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness

And if our present Afflictions reform

we heed, lest yet a worse thing befal us.
Remember, that when the Touch of
God's little Finger did not terrifie us,
he soon made us feel the stroak of his

                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>PSALM Lvii. ver. 1.</bibl>
                     <q>In the Shadow of thy Wings will I make
my Refuge, until these Calamities
be over-past.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>WHat St. <hi>Hierom</hi> observ'd
long since concerning
this Book of Psalms,
<hi>Titulos esse Claves;</hi> that
the Title is usually the true Key of
<hi>David,</hi> to set open the Psalm to us,
and to let us into the true Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it; he learn'd probably from a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103100:84"/>
former Author (with whose Writings
he was in his younger years much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted)
<hi>Origen</hi> I mean:<note place="margin">Orig. Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. p. 59.</note> Who in his
Tomes upon the Psalms, discoursing of
some Obscurities in Holy Scripture, and
the proper Remedies thereof, gives us yet
a more ancient Tradition, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
(as he saith) from a learned Jew;
That the whole Body of Scripture is
like a great House, in which are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Appartments, and therein many
Rooms shut up, and in them again ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Cabinets, and Boxes lockt down:
Nor hangs the proper Key at every
Door, but they lie scatter'd here, and
there, and counter-chang'd; so that it
requires some pains, and skill to find
them out, and apply them aright.
Thus the Key of the Prophetic Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
lies in the Historical, where we often
find both the Occasion of the Prophesie,
and the Event too; and that proves
usually the best Interpreter. Thus the
Acts of the Apostles, which contain the
Peregrinations, and Gests of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are
a great Master-Key to open his Epistles,
and to unlock to us many things, hard
otherwise to be understood in them. And
thus in the present Instance, <hi>David's</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
is the proper Key to <hi>David's</hi> Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and so the Books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103100:84"/>
                     <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the best, and
most authentic Commentary upon the
<hi>Psalms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this now before us, lest we should
mistake, the Spirit of God hath hung
the Key at the Door, or at least poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us whence to fetch it: And while
the Title dates it from the Cave, we
are plainly directed to 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv.
There we find the holy Man in a great
streit of Affliction; wandring like an
Exile, or Bandito in the Wilderness of
<hi>Engedi;</hi> the few Men he had, straggling,
and shifting for themselves upon the
Rocks of the wild Goats; implacable
<hi>Saul</hi> in the mean time with five times
his Number so closely pursuing him,
that he is forc'd to take shelter in the
Cave: And there being shut up from
the Sight of Heaven, and Light of the
Sun, and as it were buried alive in
that obscure Dungeon, surrounded with
Danger on every side, and little Hope
left him of escaping with his Life; 'tis
then that he sighs out his <hi>Al-taschith</hi>
(as this, and the two following Psalms
are entitled) <hi>Oh destroy me not utterly</hi>
(so the Word signifies) <hi>but let me live
to praise thy Name;</hi> 'tis then, that by
a vigorous Faith he flies to the tender
Mercies of God, as to his only City
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103100:85"/>
of Refuge: And reposing himself in the
Bosom of the Divine Goodness by Acts
of Faith, and Devotion, and of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
in both, he doth exactly, and
precisely that which We all are enjoyn'd
to do this Day: He implores the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God in the Protection of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and in him of those that belong to
him; <hi>Be merciful unto me, O God</hi> (saith
he) <hi>be merciful unto me, for my Soul trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in thee; yea, in the shadow of thy
Wings will I make my Refuge, until these
Calamities be overpast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that, the proper business of this
Day being visibly stampt in great Letters
upon the Fore-head of the Day, and
that by the Hand of Sacred Authority
it self; and the Lines of the Text too
running so parallel all along, and so
commensurate to those of the Day (upon
which Ground the whole Psalm was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pertinently selected as one of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Psalms for the Office of the Day:)
I may hope in some Degree to discharge
my Duty to both of them, by treating
of those two things; <hi>What God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
is;</hi> and <hi>What we are to do,</hi> that
we may be qualifi'd, and prepar'd
aright, successfully to implore the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of that Protection. In Order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
I will consider the Text in a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Reference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:103100:85"/>I. As it looks down from God to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in gracious and powerful Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
And so it speaks our great Honour,
and Happiness, the high, and glorious
Privilege of pious Kings, and their
Kingdoms, that they are under the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of God's Wings.</p>
                  <p>II. As it looks up in another Aspect
from Us to God again; and so it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
our necessary, and indispensable
Duty; and calls aloud for our suitable
Deportment; which is resolvedly to put
our selves under the Divine Protection,
or to seek, and make our Refuge under
the Shadow of his Wings.</p>
                  <p>I. I begin with the high and glorious
Privilege of all holy Souls, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of pious Kings, and their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
They are under the shadow of
God's Wings. The expression frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
occurs in Scripture, and may seem
to speak these three things, or some of
them; which together will give you, I
think, the full extent of the shadow of
God's Wings, the adequate Importance
of this illustrious Metaphor.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Safeguard and Defence from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
that they come not. Or,</p>
                  <p>(2.) Speedy Help, and Deliverance
out of Calamities, when they are come.
Or however.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:103100:86"/>(3.) Comfort in the mean time, and
Refreshment in Calamities, while they
are upon us.</p>
                  <p>(1.) The Privilege of Safety, and
Protection from Calamities stand first in
our Method; intimated here in a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Expression; A Refuge, a Shadow,
and the Shadow of Wings.</p>
                  <p>(1.) And what is a Refuge, (which is
the first,) but a place of Security, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in regard of its Secrecy to hide us,
or its strength to defend us, to which
we flie, when Calamity threatens us?
And such is God to his People; a City
of Refuge, an inviolable Sanctuary; an
Altar of Mercy, to which we may flie,
and be safe, and from the Horns where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
no bold Calamity shall dare to pluck
us, without his special Commission.
Or in another Reference, a place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
is a Covert from Storm and Rain,
<hi>Es. IV.</hi> 6. and as it follows there in the
same Verse,</p>
                  <p>(2.) A Tabernacle for a Shadow too
in the Day-time from the Heat, which
is the second Expression. The <hi>Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
whereof is far better understood in
those intemperate Climats, where the
Sun-Beams are scorching, and the Heats
insufferable. Nothing there more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103100:86"/>
than a shady Grove, or a deep
Grot, the Sun never looks into, or the
Shadow of a great Rock in a weary
Land. Which Protections, because the
Pilgrim-<hi>Israelites</hi> wanted in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
God supplyed it to them, by
spreading a Cloud over them for a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
in the Day-time (as the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
speaks,)<note place="margin">Ps. CV. 39.</note> and God was in that Cloud;
so that for forty years together they
marcht, and encampt under his shady
Wings, I had almost said, without a
Metaphor. And still whenever the Son
of Persecution,<note place="margin">Jac. I. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> or other Calamity ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
upon us with burning Heat, God
can exempt, whom he thinks good, and
send them times of refreshing from the
presence of the Lord: so that, while
the World is all on fire about them,
they journey through that torrid Zone,
with their mighty <hi>Parasol,</hi> or <hi>Umbrella</hi>
over their Heads, and are all the while
in the Shade.</p>
                  <p>And yet every Shade is not a safe
Protection. <hi>Umbra aut Nutrix, aut No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verca
est,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L. 17. c.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

tell us, that the shadow of some
Trees is unwholsome; of others deadly.
Ay there is a shadow of Death too in
Scripture Language; and you have
heard of the Shades of Hell it self. And
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103100:87"/>
therefore to distinguish this benign, and
saving Protection from those black and
dismal Shades, here is yet a further, and
a higher <hi>Emphasis;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) 'Tis in the third place <hi>Umbra A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum,</hi>
a Shadow of Wings: An Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
borrow'd from Birds and Fowls, that
brood, and foster their young Ones
under them. The Wing of the Dam is
both the Midwife, and the Nurse; it
brings forth the Chickens, and it brings
them up too. So Providence is both
the Womb, that bare us, and the Paps,
that give us suck. The Wing is not
only; as the Shade, a protection from
the Heat; but a more Universal Defence
against all the Injuries, and Inclemencies
of the Air. Is it too hot? The Wing
casts off a cold Shade. Or is it too cold?
The Wing affords a warm Covering.
Are the Younglings frighted with a
Storm? The Wing is a ready Shelter.
Doth the Kite, or Hawk, the Tyrants,
and Freebooters of the Air, hover over
and threaten? The Wing is a safe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.
And thus <hi>in sacris Domini Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionibus,</hi>
as <hi>Cassian</hi> speaks; in God, and
his holy Protections we have All.</p>
                  <p>That our Troubles are not long since
grown too hot for us, 'tis because He
cools, and allays them. That our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103100:87"/>
do not grow cold, and die away in
our Bosoms; 'tis because he warms, and
reinforceth them. That we have heard it
bluster abroad for so many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a formidable Tempest, which hath
drench'd, and drown'd so great a part
of Christendom in Blood, and yet
the Storm hath hitherto flown over us:
That the Clouds have been gathering at
home too, and so long hung black o're
our Heads, and yet not power'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
forth in showers of Vengeance:
That <hi>Gebal,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Amaleck,</hi>
and the Rest; that Hell, and <hi>Rome,</hi> and
their Partizans, our Enemies on all
Hands, both foreign, and Domestick,
have been so long confederate against
us, saying, <hi>Come, and let us root them
out, that they be no more a People,</hi> that
the Name of the Reformed Church of
<hi>England</hi> may be no more in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;
that they have so often lookt
grim, and sour, and roar'd, and
rampt upon us, and yet not been able
to seize us; to what can we justly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
all this, but to the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections
of God's shady Wings spread
over us?</p>
                  <p>'Tis pity, Brethren, we are not more

We sit continually in the Lap, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103100:88"/>
Arms of Providence: She is at once
our Fortress, and our Store-house: 'Tis
to her we owe both our Defence, and
Supplies; our Safety, and our Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:
That we ever had any good
thing in this World, whether Personal,
or National, 'tis because we have suckt
the Breasts of her Consolations: And
that we keep, and enjoy any thing,
(while our Soul is among Lyons, while
we dwell in the midst of <hi>Cruel,</hi> and
<hi>Blood-thirsty Men,</hi> as holy David com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
a little below my <hi>Text;)</hi> 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we sit under the shadow of her
Wings. And since we are for all this so
over apt to forget her, and to pride our
selves in Bulwarks of our own project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
God hath seem'd oftentimes, and
now again of Late, to be about to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantle
all, and to teach us this Lesson
at the dearest Rate, if we will not learn
it better cheap, That we cannot be safe
out of his protection; that the shadow
of his Wings is our best, nay our only
Refuge: And that whether we take a
Refuge for the protection of Secrecy,
or for the protection of Strength. Of
which much might be said, would the
time permit it: But so much briefly of
the first Privilege, that of Safeguard,
and protection from Calamities, that

<hi>how I bear you upon Eagles Wings,<note place="margin">Ex. xix. 4.</note> and

you by my Providence, while you were
yet in the Egg; but I hatch'd you, as
it were, even in the Iron Furnaces of
<hi>Memphis,</hi> into Political Life, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

out safely, openly, triumphantly (as
the Eagle doth her Young) and brought
you off too into a more prosperous
Condition.</p>
                  <p>And may not God bespeak us too,
the People of <hi>England,</hi> in the same

there is no Hope for them in their God:
Then on the sudden, as an Eagle stirreth
up her Neast, and fluttereth over her

(as <hi>Moses</hi> speaks in his admirable Song)
thus awakening,<note place="margin">

lead us, and there was no Other with
him; that's <hi>Moses</hi>'s own Reddition:
When our own Pinion prov'd too weak,
and all our faint Flutterings to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
then by a Miracle of Wisdom, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and Goodness, he took us up to that
gallant, and wonderful Flight, even up
to a higher pitch, than we durst look,
and made us to ride upon the high
Places of the Earth, and set our Neast
again amongst the Stars.</p>
                  <p>And now, when restless, and unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
Men (the true Spawn of him, whose

Heaven,<note place="margin">Rev. xii. 4.</note> and cast them to the Earth)
would fain by their Hellish Plots, and
Contrivances bring us down again from
thence, even down to the very Ground,
and lay all our Honour in the Dust:
When by their secret Machinations
they are at work on all Hands to hurry
us back into the old Confusions; in
Hope, that out of that disordered Mass
they may at length rear up a new
World of their own; (But what a
World? A World made up of a new

out of the Serpent's Root shall never
come forth an Adder, to bite us, or a

will confound these <hi>Babel</hi> builders,
with their City, and their Tower,

their strange Worship; their novel
Modes, and Models of Government in
Church, and State) and scatter them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad

And to the like benign, and
gracious purposes doth God still spread
the Wings of his good Providence over
his People, and their Affairs in calamitous
times, such as this is; when he may
seem to stretch out upon the Political
World the Line of Confusion, and the
Plummet of Emptiness, <hi>(Tohu,</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,</hi>

And if hereupon we put our selves (as
we ought) under the saving Influences
of his Wings; he will either digest our
Confusions into greater Order, and
Beauty than before; or at least support,
and chear us, while we lye under them;
which is the third, and last Privilege
implyed in this Expression.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Comfort, and Refreshment in
Calamities, while they are upon us.
For the Wing is not only the Retreat of
Safety from Calamities, as in the first
particular; Nor only the Instrument of
Deliverance, out of Calamities, as in
the second: 'Tis also the Seat of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and Fountain of Refreshment,
when they lye heaviest upon us.</p>
                  <p>And here I might spend the Hour
with much Delight; for the Prospect is
fair, and large before me. But I am
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103100:91"/>
sensible, that I have already staid too
long upon the first Head of Discourse
propounded; and so perhaps comply'd
too much with the common Humour,
which loves rather to be tickled, and
amused with high Privilege, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in necessary Duty. I shall
therefore make hast to seize what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of the Time, and improve it, to
let you see, That All, I have said hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
and the Much more I might
have said, upon that first Head of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,
signifies nothing at all, is all
blank, and Cypher to them, that go

Duty.</p>
                  <p>II. They that would be safe under
God's Wings, must not only please
themselves with the general Speculation,
that Safety, and Protection is there to
be had: They must also make their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
there, they must put themselves
under the Shadow of those Wings by
their special Act, and Deed; must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
chuse, and effectually place
their last Resort there; and if they will
partake the Benefits, must comply with
the Obligations of such a State. God
is our Refuge, and our Strength, saith
holy <hi>David,</hi> most devoutly, and most
Methodically too:<note place="margin">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103100:92"/>
make him our Refuge by flying to him,
before we can hope, that he will be our
Strength. In vain do they dream of
God's saving Protections, that turn their
Backs upon his Precepts, and cast his
Laws behind them. 'Tis true, God's
Altars are our Sanctuary; an inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Asylum</hi> in our Sufferings, and in our
Sorrows, in our Calamities, and in
our Dangers, for our Ignorances, and
for our Infirmities: But are our Crimes
too privileg'd, and protected there?
That were indeed to turn God's Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into a Den of Thieves, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
(the notorious Abuse of the
modern Sanctuaries;) and to set up
the <hi>Wing of Abominations</hi> (spoken of

high hand.</hi> God will not be so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to those, that offend of malicious
Wickedness, as to receive them, with
all their Sins about them, under that
sacred, and saving Protection. The
holy Dove broods not a Kite, or a Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
They are Birds quite of another
Feather. If in good earnest we would
be foster'd, and cherisht under God's

Partakers in some Measure of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature.</p>
                  <p>To hover no longer in Generalities;
the fruitful Metaphor of the Text, as
you have distinctly seen it big with our
Privilege; so to qualifie us for that,
'tis as remarkably pregnant with our
Duty also. Among the Rest, it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suggests to us in three noble Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of our Duty so many apt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Qualifications, to fit, and prepare
us for God's Wing. (1.) A pious
Trust, and Confidence in God. (2.) A
fervent Devotion towards God, and his
holy Worship in his Temple. And
(3.) A constant unwearied perseverance
in both the former; for 'tis <hi>Donec tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sierint,</hi>
until these Calamities be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past.
And</p>
                  <p>(1.) For Trust, and Affiance in God;
'tis visible, That to fly under God's
Wings, and to make him our Refuge,
and to trust in him, are parallel Phrases,
which expound one another; and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
only, as the same Sence clad in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor,
and stript of it again. And
therefore some Vers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ons, both Ancient,

                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:103100:93"/>
'Twere happy for us, were this Duty
of Trust in God but as visibly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
into our practice, as 'tis origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
legible in the Text. We all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
high indeed, and put on a fair
Semblance here too, <hi>I believe in God</hi>
is our daily Language: But, as one
saith well, <hi>Non est strepitus Oris, sed
Fervor, &amp; Devotio Cordis:</hi> Lip-labour
will not serve the turn; it must go
deeper, even to the Ground of the
Heart. Would we put in then for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
share in the Privilege, God's
Mercy, and Protection to our King,
and to our Selves? We must labour
then for a Trust like <hi>David</hi>'s: <hi>Be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to me O God,</hi> (saith he) <hi>for my Soul
trusteth in thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To bring you to the Test then;
The Trust that may be trusted to,
and that will stand us instead, when
Calamities invade, or threaten us, must
have these Three Properties: 'Tis
founded, and prepared in Self-Diffidence;
'Tis carried on, and exercis'd in active
Diligence; And lastly 'tis consummate
in full, and perfect Resignation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> 'Tis founded, and prepar'd in
deep Self-Diffidence, and Distrust; in a
clear Abrenunciation of our selves, and all
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103100:93"/>
worldly Dependences. The Chickens are
weak, and helpless in themselves; and as if
they knew it too, stay not to combat the
Kite, nor stand the dreadful shock, when
the Hawk hovers over, and is ready to
stoop upon them; but run nimbly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Dam's Wing for shelter. The
very Instincts of Nature have taught
all Weak things, to seek their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
out of themselves, in some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
where they may be safe. Thus
the Firr-Trees are a Refuge for the
Stork;<note place="margin">Psal. CIV. 18.</note> the high Hills for the wild
Goats, and the Rocks for the Conies.
The Hare hath her Covert too, and the
Foxes their Holes or Dens. Even the
weaker, and groveling Plants (as Vines,
and the like) have their Tendrils, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
pliant Strings, wherewith they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
clasp, and twine themselves about
the Supporters, they are to climb by.
In fine, all Nature is wholly Adjective,
and, as if 'twere conscious to it self of
its inability to stand alone, is ever in
busie quest of its proper Substantive,
that may uphold it. Man, as the only
bad Grammarian, makes still false Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax,
and false Construction; apt to
seek his Refuge, where 'tis not to be
had: As if he were under that Curse

of God's Wings; not in the height
of his Rock, but in the Rock of Ages.
Though being a Man of War, he well
understood the grand Importance of a
Castle well seated, and fortified; of a
Mount, or Rock inaccessible; of a Cave
in that Rock capacious, and defensible
(such as <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us there were many
in <hi>Palestine;</hi> and such were probably
the Cave of <hi>Adullam,</hi> and the strong
Holds of <hi>Engedi,</hi> and the rest, which
we meet with so often in <hi>David</hi>'s story:)
yet sever'd, and abstracted from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Protections, he slights all these, as
Paper-walls, and Cobweb-fortifications:
And knowing he could not be safe on
this side Omnipotence, he stiles God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in every Psalm, his <hi>Rock,</hi> and his
<hi>Castle,</hi> his <hi>Fortress,</hi> and his <hi>Strong-Hold,</hi>
his <hi>High-Tower,</hi> and the <hi>Hill</hi> of his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;</hi>
that's the first property of his
Trust, it begins in great Self-diffidence:
But,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It goes on in active Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
The Young one hath its last
Retreat indeed under the Dam's Wing:
Yet the little Wing it hath of its own,
it imploys to bring it thither. The Eagle
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103100:96"/>
in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Song, as I noted before, not
only bears its Eaglets on her own Wings;
but stirs up her Nest too, and provokes
them first to do their uttermost.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>David</hi> resolv'd well,<note place="margin">Psal. xliv. 6.—xxxiii. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>I will
not trust in my Bow;</hi> yet he us'd it sure.
It was not <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword, that could
save him; yet gladly he girt himself with
it, when the High Priest reacht it him.
<hi>There is no King,</hi> saith he, <hi>that can be
sav'd by the Multitude of an Host,</hi> yet
he refus'd not the Voluntiers, that came
to List themselves under him. He fled
from <hi>Saul</hi> with all Diligence into the
Cave; though he had still a Refuge
beyond it. Though he sets up his Rest
under God's Wings;<note place="margin">Psal. lv. 6.</note> yet <hi>Oh,</hi> (saith he)
<hi>that I had the Wings of a Dove too, that
I might fly away to my Rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Moral, and the Reddition of All
is but thus much. We all of us have
Wings of our own too; Faculties, and
Abilities, that must be us'd (Why else
were they given us?) Though they must
not be trusted in. The most excellent
Father <hi>Paul</hi> of the <hi>Servi</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> was
Libell'd in the Holy Office (as they
call it) for advising one that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to immediate Inspirations,<note place="margin">See his Life.</note> and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
to use human Means and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustries,
and so to expect God's Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103100:97"/>
But the Inquisitors were for once
so wise, as to absolve him without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.</p>
                  <p>Our Psalmist states the matter well.
<hi>Trust in the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. xxxvii. 3—5.</note> saith he, <hi>but be doing
Good too, and so verily thou shalt be fed.
Commit thy way unto the Lord, and He
shall bring it to pass:</hi> But walk in it thy
self; how is it else thy way? <hi>Commit
he keeping of thy Soul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. iv. ult.</note> (saith the Apostle,
and so, commend the keeping of the

                     </gap>,
<hi>in well-doing,</hi> in doing thy Duty in thy
Station in all the instances of it.</p>
                  <p>In the Age of Miracles indeed, when
the Sea divided, and suddenly turn'd
green Meadow; and when an Angel
went forth, and dispatcht so many
Thousands in a Night: Well might the
watch-word be, <hi>Stand still and see the
Salvation of God; The Lord shall fight
for you, and ye shall do nothing.</hi> But
the season is chang'd, and 'tis now,
<hi>Come forth, and help the Lord against the
Mighty; and work out your own Salvation,</hi>
(and so the Salvation of the Nation too)
<hi>because 'tis God that Works;</hi> that is St.
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Logic.</p>
                  <p>We must not presume to use our
Lord, as <hi>Herod</hi> did; call for him, when
we please, to Work us a fine Miracle;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103100:97"/>

                     </gap>, to disentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
them. The Glory of God descends
not visibly now adays upon our Palaces,
as of old upon the Tabernacle of the
Congregation, to rescue our <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> from being massacred by a desperate
Knot of Mutineers: Nor doth the Earth
open her Mouth any longer, to swallow
up our Rebels and Traitors alive. 'Tis
a Scepter of ordinary Justice, not a Rod
of Wonders, that fills the Hand of our
Governours. We must not expect, that
a good Cause should work alone of it
self by Way of Miracle: Believe it,
it must be prudently, and industrious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manag'd too, or it must at last mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.</p>
                  <p>For Instance, (the Instance of the
present time:) The Devils of Sedition,
and Faction of Treason, and Rebellion,
those Familiars of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Rhemes,</hi>
and St. <hi>Omers,</hi> (the <hi>Iesuites</hi> I mean, that
have so long possess'd and agitated a
wretched part of this Nation;) will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
go out from hence, and leave us at
quiet, no not by Prayer and Fasting
only. Nay, the best Laws we have,
the best you can make, (if they be not
steddily, and severely executed) will prove
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103100:98"/>
too slight a Conjuration for these stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
evil Spirits of Disobedience. There
is another and a better <hi>Flagellum Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monum,</hi>
than that of <hi>Hieronymus Mengis,</hi>
and his fellow Exorcists. Holy Water
is a Trifle; and holy Words will not
do it. There is no such thing as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicina
per Verba:</hi> Words, and Talk will
never cure the Distempers of a Nation.
Deaf Adders refuse all the Voice of the
Charmer, charm he never so wisely.
If in good earnest we would be rid of
this Legion, and say, as our Lord to
the deaf and dum Spirit, Go out, and
enter no more; (What shall I say?—

both, is the Business of another Place.
I shall resume the general Thesis, and so
shut up this Particular. I say then;
They trust not in God, they presume,
and tempt him, who work not together
with him, but receive his Aids in vain,
and look, that He should bring about
in extraordinary manner, what they take
no care of themselves; but lie flat upon
their Backs looking upward, and will
stir neither Hand nor Foot, to help
themselves.<note place="margin">Ps. xxxi. 24.</note> Nay but <hi>Viriliter agite,
&amp; confortabit Cor,</hi> as 'tis in the Psalm;
play the Men your selves, Do All that
you can or ought to do, within your
proper Sphere; and so <hi>God will strengthen
your Hearts, all ye, that put your Trust
in the Lord.</hi> Wings as they are the
Covert of Safety, so also the Emblems
of Diligence, and the Instruments of
Activity: And as they shew us our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,
may teach us also this part of
our Duty,—to trust only in God's
Wings, but to use our own too; that's
the progress of <hi>David</hi>'s Trust; It goes
on in active Diligence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is consummate (as in the last
Act) in clear, and perfect Resignation
to God's good pleasure in the Event,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103100:99"/>
whatever it be. They trust not in God
entirely, and as they ought, that rely
only on his Power, and dare not submit
to his Wisdom also; that would gladly
engage Omnipotence on their side (and
can you blame them?) but then they
would manage it their own Way, and
in Methods of their own Contriving, and
to Ends, it may be, far distant from what
God hath appointed: As if he would
work Journey-work under them, and
leave them to be Masters of the great
Shop of the World. No; but as <hi>Luther</hi>
said well, when his Friend <hi>Melanchthon</hi>
troubled himself over-much at some
cross Events; <hi>Desinat Philippus esse Rector
Mundi: 'Tis God alone, who sits in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and doth whatever pleaseth him.</hi> If
we be not content with the Portion he
allots us, but will needs be carving for
our selves elsewhere, or otherwise: Or if
we be not satisfied with his Conduct of
the Affairs of the World, but think with
the great <hi>Alphonso,</hi> that we could mend
the System: What is this but in Effect
to turn our Backs upon God, and to set
up for our selves upon our own wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Stock, and implicitly at least to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the shadow of his Wings, and
all the privileges of it? <hi>Pulli non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiciunt,</hi>
saith One: Young Birds have
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103100:99"/>
no Designs, or Forecasts of their own,
but are wholly under the Dams Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
And if we are allow'd to have
any our selves, be they never so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid, or so wisely contriv'd; so skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
managed, or so vigorously pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd;
We must at last intirely submit,
and sacrifice them all to that Sovereign
Wisdom, and Power, which ruleth in
the Kingdoms of Men, and orders
them in all things according to the
good pleasure of his Will.</p>
                  <p>To summ up then this whole great
Duty of Affiance in God, with all the
Parts, and Branches of it: He trusts
Regularly in God, that trusts in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else first: And yet secondly doth
every thing he can, or is oblig'd to do
by his Duty: And thirdly, when he hath
done All, sits down at last under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of God's Wings, and waits the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
in Faith, and Hope, with perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
to God's wise and just Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in all things; That is the first Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
implied in the Expression a pious
Trust, and Confidence in God. The
(2d) Is an ardent and flaming De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
towards God, and his holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and Service in his Temple: <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103100:100"/>

                  <p>There are also <hi>Alae Ecclesiarum,</hi> which

Protection whereof, as 'tis the Devil's
Business to tempt, and withdraw us,
and so to cast us down from one of our
noblest Heights, and Defences: So on
the contrary, holy <hi>David</hi>'s great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
here, and the clear Importance
of the Words of my Text, lead us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
thither (that is the last, and most

seek, and make our Refuge even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the Wings of the Cherubim of
Glory.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, Where can we find on
Earth so safe, or so comfortable a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
when Calamities assail, or threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
us, as here in the House of our
God? Doth not his Cross stand over
it on purpose, to direct us hither, when
we are ready to sink under the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of our own? When God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are abroad in the World, and
the Avenger of our Sins pursues us;
More particularly, When the Land is
mov'd, and divided; when the Pillars
thereof shake, and tremble, and the
Foundations are ready to be cast down;
when all things are in Ferment, and
in Commotion round about us, and
Mens Hearts ready to fail them for
Fear, and for looking after those things
which are coming upon the Earth:
Where should we rather take Sanctuary,
where can we more probably find Help,
and Redress, than at the Altar of the
God of Mercy, and under the shadow
of the Wings of his Mercy-seat?</p>
                  <p>This was holy <hi>David</hi>'s steddy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,

(or, <hi>I will make my Refuge) in the Covert

of thy Wings,</hi> ver. 4. And when his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
put him beside that Guard, set
him at Distance from those happy Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
took him down from those
blessed Heights: Yet still, even at the
lowest,<note place="margin">Psal. cxxi. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>I will lift up mine eyes,</hi> saith he,

toward <hi>Sion) from whence cometh my
Help.</hi> This was the Sting of all his
Sorrows, as it were the Calamity Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
he so groans under, almost in every

and the Wilderness of <hi>Iudah</hi> into Holy
Ground; and I had almost said, even
<hi>Gath</hi> of the <hi>Philistins</hi> into a Holy City;
(for we have Psalms dated from every

means without Doubt the Hill of <hi>Sion,</hi>
the <hi>Pico</hi> of <hi>Iewry,</hi> where God's House

                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:103100:101"/>Men, and Brethren, you that make
up the more popular part of this mixt
Audience; Let me freely speak to you
of the Patriarch <hi>David,</hi> and of your
selves. Blessed be the Mercies of God,
you lie under no such Restraint, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict,
as he did: You are not banisht
into the Wilderness, nor shut up in the
Cave: The Doors of God's House stand
open to you, if you please; and the
Wings of his Mercy are stretcht out
wide to invite, and receive you; would
you but come in, and put your selves
under the shadow of them. Let it not
be said, that your Curiosity, or some
worse Humour leads you quite another
way: That you are over-careful, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
about many things, which belong
not to you, while you neglect the one
thing necessary, the great Duty of this,
and of every Day; namely to implore
God's Mercy, and Protection upon the
King and his Kingdoms, and his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Blessing upon the public Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.
Let my Counsel, I pray, be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
unto you. Study to be quiet, and
to do your own Business: And that
lies not in the Court, or in the Palace,
but here in the Temple. 'Tis not to
listen at the Doors of the two Houses
of Parliament, or to Eves-drop the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103100:102"/>
Council-Chamber; but to wait in your
proper Stations with Modesty, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
what Avisoes, and Commands are
sent you from thence, and to comply
with them. Instead of thronging, and
pestering the Galleries, and Avenues of
those places, where Matters of State are
upon the Table; what a blessed Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
were it in times of Danger, such
as this is, to see the Church Doors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
open, and the great Stream, and
Shole of People continually flowing thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and to find some of you always
upon the Floor there, <hi>Weeping between
the Porch, and the Altar,</hi> and saying, <hi>Spare
thy People, Oh Lord, and give not thy He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage
to Reproach. Thou hast brought up
a Vine out of</hi> Aegypt: <hi>Thou hast cast out
the Heathen, and planted it. Let not the
Wild Boar out of the Wood root it up, nor
the Wild Beast of the Field devour it. Let
thy Hand be upon the Man of thy right
Hand, whom thou hast made so strong for
thy self. Keep him, as the Apple of thine
Eye. Hide him under the shadow of thy
Wings. Let his Days be many, and his
Reign prosperous; and under his shadow
let both Church and State long flourish:
And let them be confounded, and driven
backward as many as have Evil Will at</hi>
Sion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:103100:102"/>To furnish out an Office for such dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Devotions, 'tis but to take your Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
along with you in your Hand, which
is full of them. But especially let me
commend to you that Decad of Psalms,
which begins with the 54<hi>th.</hi> and so on:
which may seem to have been put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on purpose for such an Occasion.
This would be indeed effectually to
transcribe holy <hi>David</hi>'s Copy, in this
his Exemplary, and ardent Devotion:
which is the second Duty requir'd in
the Text, to prepare us for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of God's Wing. There is but
one more behind; and that is</p>
                  <p>(3.) Constant Perseverance in both
the former.</p>
                  <p>In the two former you have seen Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>David</hi> putting himself under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of God's Wings, and making good
his Refuge there, by Acts of Faith and
Devotion. And being once there, no
Storm shall beat him off, no Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall drive him away, no Delay
shall weary him out. If God kills him,
'tis all one, hee'l trust in him still, and
die in his Arms: For here he hath set up
his Rest, and <hi>Donec transierin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:103100:103"/>But here we must take heed of a great
Mistake. There are, that hold the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nec</hi>
in the Text too hard, and stiff; are
too punctual, and precise with God in
it: who will trust in him, it may be,
and ply their Devotions just so long, as
till the Calamity be past: But then on
the sudden their Trust grows feeble,
and their Devotion cold, and heartless:

Ay, that's the Virgin's Soul indeed,
that keeps ever close to her heavenly
Spouse: Not only runs under his Wings
for Shelter, when Calamities affright her,
saying, Spread thy Skirt over me, and
then strays away again, as soon as ever
the flattering Calm, and Sun-shine of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103100:103"/>
Prosperity tempts her abroad. As our
Lord hath given us an everlasting <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nec:
Lo I am with you,</hi> saith he, <hi>till the
end of the World:</hi> (Not that he will
leave us then, but take us yet nigher
unto himself, and <hi>so we shall ever be with
the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Thes. iv. 17.</note> as the Apostle speaks:) So
must we also have One for him of the
same Latitude, and Extension. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
under the Shadow of his Wings;
<hi>till this</hi> single <hi>Tyranny,</hi> as in the old
Translation; <hi>till these Calamities,</hi> as in
the New; or as the Hebrew implies,
till all, and every of our Calamities be
overpast; Both before, and in, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Calamities, still under the Shadow
of God's Wings. While they last, 'tis
<hi>In the Shadow of thy Wings will I trust:</hi>
and when they are past, 'tis <hi>In the
Shadow of thy Wings, will I rejoyce;</hi> that's
all the Difference. As the Scenes shift,
our Devotion must improve, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
too; till our Prayer be heighten'd
into Praise, (as I trust e're long it will
be) our Hope swallowed in Enjoyment,
and our Trust sublimated, and made to
flowre up into Joy, and Triumph:
When the same God, that rais'd <hi>David</hi>
from the Cave to the Throne, shall
translate us also from the Shadow of his
Wings into the Light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:

To the Beatifical Vision where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he of his Mercy bring us, who hath
so dearly bought it for us, Jesus Christ
the Righteous: To whom with thee,
O Father, and God the Holy Ghost, be
ascribed of us, and all the Creatures in
Heaven, and Earth, Blessing, Honour,
Glory, and Power, both now, and for
evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
