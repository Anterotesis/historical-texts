            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>TO drive furiouſly without fear or wit will never render you a good Stateſman, and partially to diſtribut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> your acts of juſtice and of mercy cannot recommend you to the world as a good Chriſtian: If in both you would approve your ſelf, you ought ſeriouſly to weigh, and as one ſaith, Deliberately taſte your words and deſignes before you can digeſt and prepare them for action. And to let you know that the Countrey hath obſerved your preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation in the one, and partiality in the other; theſe lines do now ſalute you. The Act of Indemnity to the Officers of the Army, and your rigorous proceeding with Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> and his Party, do moſt viſibly demonſtrate, that you and your fellow-Members, have baniſhed all thoughts of juſtice or conſideration in all your reſolutions; and how you will anſwer it, either at the Court of Heaven, or of the next enſuing Parliament, is paſt my weak imaginations to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; and therefore give me leave (according to my uſuall plaineneſs) to preſent you with my thoughts, in relation to this ſo unparalleld diverſity of your proceedings. And in the firſt place let me reflect upon Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> and his Party, and in your language admit them Rebels againſt you; and were not <hi>Fleetwood, Lambert, Deſborough,</hi> and the reſt of the Army Officers ſo too? And what Logical or rational Stateſman can include thoſe within the predicament of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and exclude theſe? 'Tis ſaid that the fear of them, was the over-haſty wombe, that gave birth unto their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity, and therefore your power over the other hath made you ſo ſevere againſt them; but how unſuitable is this to a true Roman ſpirit, which delights to make chaines and fetters, rather then open and unconquered rebellion, the ſubject of its mercy. This is the effect of a timorous cowardly ſoul, the other the moſt certain product of every truly generous and noble nature. But all this I hint ſuppoſing the equality of their crimes, then which nothing can be a more groſs and palpable miſtake; wherefore Sir if you would deliberate upon theſe two actions in their authours, and in their ends, and in the circumſtances of both, you will finde the one a Gnat, the other a Camel, and how you ſhould ſwallow this and ſtumble at that, I know no reaſon, unleſſe it be that of our Saviours to the Phariſees. However now let's compare them, and take a ſhort view of their differences. Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> and his Party but endeavoured and affected to fill up your Houſe with its own (ſuppoſed moſt Legal) Members; The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my-Officers have attempted and effected the ſubverſion of you; or if you will, the one would deſtroy the part of the body to preſerve the major part ſound, the other would deſtroy the part, that we ſhould never hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have a whole or part of a Parliament; The one would have perfected you, and made you compleat in all your integrall parts, the other would not have the leaſt part of a Parliament: In a word, one would have a Parliament but not the minor part thereof, the other (from their hatred of the peoples power) abhorred the very name of both; The one were Acted by their Oathes and Covenants to aſſert, and defend the freedome and priviledges of Parliaments; And ſo their actions may ſeem to be at moſt the reſult of an erring Conſcience; The other had no viſible impulſive cauſe, but their own boundleſs ambition, and inſatiable luſt after domination; The one would have defended and confirmed, the other would have confounded and ſubverted all our Laws, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and Religion; The one were Gentlemen of ancient and conſiderable Families, and could not better themſelves by a Warre; the other upſtarted Muſhroms, and could not have riſen but by a Warre; The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the one are the bitter-ſweet fruites of cruelty and bloud; The Lands of the other the gifts of peaceable Laws and Juſtice; The one you had provoked by a forcible ſecluding their Members from their Priviledges in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, The other (after your reſurrection in <hi>May</hi> laſt) you had lately pardoned and after preferred; theſe were your ſlaves and ſervants, Commiſſionated by your Authority, paid by your Treaſuries, and therefore obliged at all times, both day and night to be at your abſolute command and obedience, The other free from all ſuch ſevere obligation, and ſtrict inducements to ſubjection; The one did riſe 150 miles diſtant from you, hoping that you would conſider of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, by a preſent reſtoring of them to their moſt undoubted rights in Parliament, and ſo have prevented any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchief; But the other immediately flew at your very faces, and had the confidence of ſome ſaucy and rebellious Servants, to take you by the head or throat, and moſt inſolently drag'd you out of your own Houſe, and ſhut your own doores againſt you, their Soveraigne Lords and Maſters: Laſtly, The one were and (I dare ſay) ſtill are moſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally beloved and eſteemed the true (though unfortunate) Patriots, of their Countries, Laws, and Liberties; The other the very butt or mark againſt which all true <hi>Engliſh</hi> men do direct and level the Arrowes of their hatred and moſt juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved indignation. Sir, weigh ſeriouſly all theſe but hinted conſiderations, and inlarge them in your own more judicious thoughts; And then let me ask you, whether any prudence, reaſon, or conſcience, can honourably perſwade you, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the whole intereſt of this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, by ruining their friends and pardoning their enemies: And how ſhall the people believe, that you will ever truſt the Governement in them by ſucceeding Parliaments, if thus you heighten and inrage their ſpirits againſt you. Sir, Be you confident that never any kept his intereſt from ſinking by ſwimming againſt the ſtreame; Nor was there any that advantag'd himſelf by a Diametricall oppoſition to the generall humour or genious of the people: And therefore it hath been the prudence of Antiquity, even in full Parliaments themſelves, to ſedate and compoſe the ſpirits of the Nation, rather by a favourable compliance with them, then by an expreſs and open contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction unto them: Hence it is you have a Parliament Roll ſtiled <hi>Rotulum Contrarientium,</hi> The reaſon whereof was, becauſe <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> (a man ſingularly beloved) taking part with the Barons againſt King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the <hi>Spencers:</hi> It was not thought ſafe for the King, in reſpect of their power and intereſt in the affections of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to name them Rebels and Traitors but Contrarientes. True it is, he that deſpiſeth the peoples power knowes not his own weakneſs, and therefore by the neglect of the one and ignorance of the other, ſuddenly makes himſelf obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the miſeries of a popular rage and confuſion. To conclude then, if it be impoſſible to have any ſucceeding Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (though the Royaliſt be excluded therefrom) that will approve and confirme this your late Act concerning Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> and his Party (the poſſibility or impoſſibility whereof I leave to your own thoughts.) Is it not prudence to look before you leap? and to ground your actions upon the popular intereſt, and not upon any particular faction; which (like an <hi>Ignis fatuus)</hi> the contrary windes of private Parties, will eaſily tumble and toſſe with a perpetual agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inconſtancy: Whereas the brightneſſe of a true publick intereſt, will keep its native ſplendour and glory, maugre all thoſe clouds and ſtorms of oppoſition, which the bluſtering ſpirits of private and partiall concernments can raiſe either to eclipſe or weaken it; the undoubted experience whereof, the revolution of a few monthes, will I hope demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate unto as well your ſelf as unto</p>
