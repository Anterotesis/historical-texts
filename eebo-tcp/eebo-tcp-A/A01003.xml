            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT
HONORABLE HIS
VERIE GOOD LORD, THE
Earle of Deuonshire, Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of Ireland.</head>
            <p>IT may please your
good Lordship: I
cannot be ignorant,
and ought to be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the wrong
which I sustaine in common speech,
as if I had bene false, or vnthankfull
to that noble but vnfortunate Earle
the Earle of <hi>Essex:</hi> And for satisfying
the vulgar sort, I do not so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4646:3"/>
it; though I loue good name,
but yet as an handmaid and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of honestie and vertue. For I
am of his opinion that said pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>That it was a shame to him that was
a suter to the Mistresse, to make loue to
the wayting woman;</hi> and therefore to
woo or court common fame other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then it followeth vpon honest
courses, I for my part, finde not my
selfe fit nor disposed. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, there is no worldly thing
that concerneth my selfe, which
I hold more deare, then the good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of certaine persons; amongst
which there is none I would more
willingly giue satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto, then
to your Lordship. First, because you
loued my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will not be partiall towards me;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4646:3"/>
which is part of that I desire: next,
because it hath euer pleased you to
shew your selfe to me an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
friend; and so no basenesse
in me to seeke to satisfie you: and
lastly, because I know your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is excellently grounded in the
true rules and habits of duties and
moralities; which must be they
which shal decide this matter: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(my Lord) my defence needeth
to be but simple and briefe: namely,
that whatsoeuer I did concerning
that action and proceeding, was
done in my dutie and seruice to the
Queene and the State; in which I
would not shew my selfe false hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nor faint hearted for anie mans
sake liuing. For euerie honest man,
that hath his heart well planted, will
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4646:4"/>
forsake his King rather then forsake
God, and forsake his friend rather
then forsake his King; and yet will
forsake any earthly commoditie, yea
and his owne life in some cases, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then forsake his friend. I hope
the world hath not forgotten these
degrees, else the heathen saying: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus
vsque ad ar as,</hi> shal iudge them.
And if anie man shall say, that I did
officiously intrude my selfe into that
businesse, because I had no ordinary
place; the like may be said of all the
businesse in effect that passed the
hands of the learned counsell, either
of State or Reuenues these manie
yeares, wherein I was continually
vsed. For, as your Lordship may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
the Queene knewe her
strength so well, as she looked her
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4646:4"/>
word should be a warrant; and after
the manner of the choisest Princes
before her, did not alwayes tye her
trust to place, but did sometime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
priuate fauor from office. And
I for my part, though I was not so
vnseene in the world, but I knewe
the condition was subiect to enuie
and perill; yet because I knew againe
she was constant in her fauours, and
made an end where she began, and
specially, because she vpheld me
with extraordinarie accesse, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
demonstrations of confidence
and grace, I resolued to endure it in
expectation of better. But my scope
&amp; desire is, that your Lordship wold
be pleased to haue the honourable
patience, to know the truth in some
particularitie of all that passed in this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4646:5"/>
cause wherein I had any part, that
you may perceiue howe honest a
heart I euer bare to my Soueraigne
and to my Countrey, &amp; to that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
man, who had so well deserued
of me, and so well accepted of my
deseruings; whose fortune I cannot
remember without much griefe.
But for anie action of mine towards
him, there is nothing that passed me
in my life time, that cometh to my
remembrance with more clearnesse
and lesse checke of conscience: for
it wil appeare to your Lordship, that
I was not onely not opposite to my
Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> but that I did occupy
the vtmost of my wits, and aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
my fortune with the Queene
to haue reintegrated his, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
faithfully and industriously
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4646:5"/>
till his last fatall impatience, (for so I
wil call it) after which day there was
not time to worke for him, though
the same my affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when it could
not worke vpon the subiect proper,
went to the next, with no ill effect
towards some others, who I thinke
do rather not know it, then not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it. And this I will assure
your Lordship, I will leaue nothing
vntold that is truth, for anie enemie
that I haue to adde; &amp; on the other
side, I must reserue much which
makes for me, vpon manie respects
of dutie, which I esteeme aboue my
credite: and what I haue here set
downe to your Lordship, I protest,
as I hope to haue any part in Gods
fauour, is true.</p>
            <p>It is wel knowne, how I did many
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4646:6"/>
yeares since dedicate my trauels and
studies to the vse &amp; (as I may terme
it) seruice of my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi>
which, I protest before God, I did
not, making election of him as the
likeliest meane of mine owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement,
but out of the humor of
a man, that euer, from the time I had
anie vse of reason, (whether it were
reáding vpon good bookes, or vpon
the example of a good father, or by
nature) I loued my countrey more
then was answerable to my fortune,
and I held at that time, my Lord to
be the fittest instrument to do good
to the State: and therefore I applied
my selfe to him, in a manner which
I thinke happeneth rarely amongst
men: for I did not only labour care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and industriously in that he set
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4646:6"/>
me about, whether it were matter of
aduice or otherwise, but neglecting
the Queenes seruice, mine owne
fortune, and in a sort my vocation,
I did nothing but deuise and rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
with my selfe to the best of my
vnderstanding, propositions &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials,
of any thing that might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
his Lordships honor, fortune
or seruice. And when not long after
I entred into this course, my brother
Maister <hi>Anthony Bacon</hi> came from
beyond the seas, being a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
whose abilitie the world taketh
knowledge of for matters of State,
specially forreine; I did likewise knit
his seruice to be at my Lords dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
And on the other side, I must
&amp; will euer acknowledge my Lords
loue, trust, and fauour towards me;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4646:7"/>
last of all his liberalitie, hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoffed
me of land which I sold for
eighteene hundred pounds to Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Reynold Nicholas,</hi> and I thinke
was more worth, and that at such a
time, and with so kinde and noble
circumstances, as the maner was as
much as the matter: which though
it be but an idle digression, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am not willing to be short in
commemoration of his benefites, I
will presume to trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with the relating to you the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it. After the Queene had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
me the Sollicitors place, for the
which his Lordship had bene a long
and earnest sutor on my behalfe, it
pleased him to come to me from
<hi>Richmond</hi> to <hi>Twicknam</hi> Parke, and
brake with me &amp; said: Maister <hi>Bacon,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:4646:7"/>
the Queene hath denied me yon
place for you, and hath placed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
I know you are the least part of
your owne matter, but, you fare ill
because you haue chosen mee for
your meane and dependance: you
haue spent your time and thoughts
in my matters, I die (these were his
verie words) If I do not somewhat
towards your fortune: you shall not
denie to accept a peece of Land,
which I will bestow vpon you. My
answer I remember was, that for my
fortune it was no great matter: but,
that, his Lordships offer made me
call to minde what was wont to be
said when I was in <hi>Fraunce</hi> of the
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> that he was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
vsurer in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> because he
had turned all his estate into Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4646:8"/>
meaning that he hast left
him selfe nothing, but onely had
bound numbers of persons to him.
Now my Lord (said I) I would not
haue you imitate his course, nor
turne your state thus by great giftes
into obligations, for you will find
many bad debters: he bad me take
no care for that, and pressed it; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I said, My Lord, I see I must
be your homager, and hold land of
your gift: but do you know the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of doing homage in law? al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
it is with a sauing of his faith
to the King and his other Lords,
and therefore my Lord (said I) I
can be no more yours then I was,
and it must be with the auncient
sauings: and if I grow to be a rich
man, you will giue me leaue to giue
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4646:8"/>
it back to some of your vnrewarded
followers. But to returne, sure I am
(though I can arrogate nothing to
my selfe, but that I was a faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer
to his Lordship) that
while I had most credit with him,
his fortune went on best. And yet in
two maine points we alwaies direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; contradictorily differed, which
I wil mention to your Lordship, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it giueth light to all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
The one was, I euer set this
downe, that the onely course to be
held with the Queene, was by obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiousnesse
and obseruance; and I
remember I would vsually gage co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently,
that if he would take that
course constantly, and with choice
of good particulars to expresse it,
the Queene would be brought in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4646:9"/>
time to <hi>Assuerus</hi> question, to aske,
<hi>VVhat should be done to the man, that
the King wold honour:</hi> meaning, that
her goodnesse was without limite,
where there was a true concurrence,
which I knew in her nature to be
true. My Lord on the other side had
a setled opinion, that the Queene
could be brought to nothing, but
by a kind of necessitie and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and I well remember, when by
violent courses at any time he had
got his will, he wold aske me: Now
Sir, <hi>whose principles be true?</hi> and I
would againe say to him: <hi>My Lord,
these courses be like to hote waters, they
will helpe at a pang: but if you vse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
you shall spoile the stomacke, and you
shall be faine still to make them stronger
and stronger, and yet in the end they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4646:9"/>
will lesse their operation:</hi> with much
other varietie, wherewith I vsed to
touch that string. Another point
was, táhat I alwaies vehemently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him from seeking greatnes
by a militarie dependance, or by a
popular dependance, as that which
would breed in the Queene iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
in himselfe presumption, and in
the State perturbation: and I did v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
compare them to <hi>Icarus</hi> two
wings which were ioyned on with
waxe, and would make him ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to soare too high, and then faile
him at the height. And I would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
say vnto him: My Lord, stand
vpon two feet, and flie not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two
wings. The two feete, are the two
kinds of <hi>Iustice,</hi> Commutatiue and
Distributiue: vse your greatnesse for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4646:10"/>
aduancing of merit and vertue, and
releeuing wrongs and burdens, you
shall need no other art or finenesse:
but he would tell me, that opinion
came not from my mind, but from
my robe. But it is very true, that I
that neuer meant to inthral my selfe
to my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> nor any other
man, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stood with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
good, did (though I could lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
preuaile) diuert him by all means
possible from courses of the warres
and popularitie: for I saw plainely
the Queene must either liue or die;
if she liued, then the times would be
as in the declination of an old
Prince; if she died, the times would
be as in the beginning of a new: and
that if his Lordship did rise too fast
in these courses, the times might be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4646:10"/>
dangerous for him, and he for them.
Nay, I remember I was thus plaine
with him vpon his voyage to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
when I saw euery spring put
foorth such actions of charge and
prouocation, that I said to him: My
Lord, when I came first vnto you,
I tooke you for a Phisition that desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to cure the diseases of the State;
but now I doubt you will be like
those Phisitions, which can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to keepe their patients low, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they would alwaies be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest:
which plaineresse he neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
tooke very well, as he had
an excellent care, and was <hi>patientis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus
veri,</hi> and assured me the case
of the Realme required it: and I
thinke this speech of mine, and the
like renewed afterwards, pricked
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4646:11"/>
him to write that Apologie which
is in many mens hands.</p>
            <p>But this difference in two points
so maine and materiall, bred in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of time a discontinuance of
priuatenesse (as it is the manner of
men seldom to communicate where
they thinke their courses not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
betweene his Lordship and my
selfe; so as I was not called nor adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with, for some yeare and a halfe
before his Lordships going into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
as in former time: yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
touching his going into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
it pleased him expresly and in
a set manner to desire mine opinion
and counsell. At which time I did
not onely disswade, but protest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his going, telling him with as
much vehemencie and asseueration
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4646:11"/>
as I could, that absence in that kind
would exulcerate the Queens mind,
whereby it would not be possible
for him to carrie himselfe so, as to
giue her sufficient contentment: nor
for her to carie her selfe so, as to giue
him sufficient countenance, which
would be ill for her, ill for him, and
ill for the State. And because I wold
omit no argument, I remember I
stood also vpon the difficultie of the
action: setting before him out of
Histories, that the <hi>Irish</hi> was such an
enemie as the ancient <hi>Gaules,</hi> or <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi>
or <hi>Germaines</hi> were, and that we
saw how the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had such
discipline to gouerne their soldiers,
and such donatiues to encourage
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the whole world in a maner
to leauie them; yet when they came
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4646:12"/>
to deale with enemies which placed
their felicitie onely in libertie, and
the sharpnesse of their sword, and
had the naturall and elementall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages
of woods, and bogges, and
hardnesse of bodies, they euer found
they had their hands full of them:
and therefore concluded, that going
ouer with such expectation as he
did, and through the curlishnesse
of the enterprise not like to answer
it, would mightily diminish his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
and many other reasons I
vsed, so as I am sure I neuer in any
thing in my life time dealt with him
in like earnestnes by speech, by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and by all the meanes I could
deuise. For I did as plainely see his
ouerthrow chained as it were by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinie
to that iourney, as it is possible
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4646:12"/>
for any man to ground a iudgment
vpon future contingents: But my
Lord, howsoeuer his eare was open,
yet his heart and resolution was shut
against that aduice, whereby his
ruine might haue bin preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my Lords going, I saw how true
a Prophet I was, in regard of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
alteration which naturally
succeeded in the Queens mind; and
thereupon I was stil in watch to find
the best occasion that in the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of my power I could either
take or minister, to pull him out of
the fire if it had bene possible: and
not long after, me thought I saw
some ouerture thereof, which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
readily; a particularitie
I thinke be knowne to very few, and
the which I do the rather relate to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4646:13"/>
your Lordship, because I heare it
shold be talked, that while my Lord
was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I reuealed some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
against him or I cannot tel what,
which if it were not a meere slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as the rest is, but had any though
neuer so litle colour, was surely vpon
this occasion. The Queene one day
at <hi>Nonesuch,</hi> a litle (as I remember)
before <hi>Cuffes</hi> coming ouer, I atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her, shewed a passionate distast
of my lords proceedings in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
as if they were vnfortunate, without
iudgement, contemptuous, and not
without some priuate end of his
owne; and all that might be, and
was pleased as she spake of it to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that she trusted least, so to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the like speech with me; whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
I who was still awake, and true
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4646:13"/>
to my grounds which I thought su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
for my Lords good, said to this
effect: Madame, I know not the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of Estate, and I know this,
that Princes actions must haue no
abrupt periods or conclusions, but
otherwise I would thinke, that if you
had my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> here with a
white staffe in his hand, as my Lord
of <hi>Leicester</hi> had, and continued him
still about you for societie to your
selfe, and for an honour and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to your attendance and Court
in the eyes of your people, and in the
eyes of forreine Embassadours, then
were he in his right element: for, to
discontent him as you do, and yet to
put armes and power into his hands,
may be a kind of temptation to make
him proue cumbersome and vnruly.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4646:14"/>
And therefore if you would <hi>imponere
bonam clausulam,</hi> and send for him
and satisfie him with honour here
neare you, if your affaires which (as
I haue said) I am not acquainted
with, wil permit it, I thinke were the
best way. Which course your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
knoweth, if it had bene taken,
then all had bene well, and no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
in my Lords comming ouer,
nor continuance of these iealousies,
which that employment of <hi>Ireland</hi>
bred, and my Lord here in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
greatnesse. Wel, the next newes
that I heard, was, that my Lord was
come ouer, and that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his chamber for leauing
<hi>Ireland</hi> without the Queenes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:
this was at <hi>Nonesuch,</hi> where
(as my duty was) I came to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4646:14"/>
and talked with him priuately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a quarter of an houre, and he
asked mine opinion of the course
was taken with him; I told him: My
Lord, <hi>Nubecula est, citò transibit:</hi> it
is but a mist: but shall I tell your
Lordship, it is as mists are, if it go
vpwards, it may haps cause a shower,
if downewards, it will cleare vp.
And therefore good my Lord carie
it so, as you take away by all meanes
all ombrages and distasts from the
Queene, and specially if I were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to aduise you, (as I haue bene
by your self thought, and now your
question imports the continuance
of that opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) obserue three points:
First, make not this cessation or
peace which is concluded with <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi>
as a seruice wherein you glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4646:15"/>
but as a shuffling vp of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
which was not very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.
Next, represent not to
the Queene any necessitie of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
whereby as by a coercion or
wrench, she should think her selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to send you back into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
but leaue it to her. Thirdly, seeke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
<hi>importunè, oportunè,</hi> seriously,
sportingly euery way. I remember
my Lord was willing to heare me,
but spake very few words, &amp; shaked
his head sometimes, as if he thought
I was in the wrong; but sure I am, he
did iust co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary in euery one of these
three points. After this, during the
while since my Lord was committed
to my Lord Keepers, I came diuers
times to the Queene, as I had vsed to
do, about causes of her reuenue and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4646:15"/>
law businesse, as is well knowne: by
reason of which accesses, according
to the ordinarie charities of Court, it
was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out, that I was one of them
that incensed the Queene against my
Lord of <hi>Essex.</hi> These speeches I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tel, nor I wil not thinke that they
grew any way from her Maiesties
owne speeches, whose memory I wil
euer honour: if they did, she is with
God, and <hi>miserum est ab illis ledi, de
quibus non possis quaeri.</hi> But I must
giue this testimonie to my Lord <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill,</hi>
thát one time in his house at the
Sauoy he dealt with me directly, and
said to me; Cousin, I heare it, but I
beleeue it not, that you should do
some ill office to my Lord of <hi>Essex:</hi>
for my part I am meerely passiue and
not actiue in this action, and I follow
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4646:16"/>
the Queene and that heauily, and I
leaue her not; my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> is
one that in nature I could consent
with as well as with any one liuing;
the Queen indeed is my Soueraigne,
and I am her creature, I may not leese
her, and the same course I wold wish
you to take: whereupon I satisfied
him how farre I was from any such
mind. And as sometimes it cometh
to passe, that mens inclinations are
opened more in a toy, then in a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
matter: A little before that time,
being about the middle of Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
terme, her Maiestie had a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to dine at my lodge at <hi>Twickna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>
Parke, at which time I had (though
I professe not to be a Poet) prepared
a Sonnet directly tending and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to draw on her Maiesties recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4646:16"/>
to my Lord, which I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
also I shewed to a great person,
&amp; one of my Lords nearest friends,
who commended it: this though it
be (as I said) but a toy, yet it shewed
plainely in what spirit I proceeded,
and that I was ready not onely to do
my Lord good offices, but to publish
and declare my selfe for him; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
was I so ambitious of any thing
in my life time, as I was to haue ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
some token or fauour from her
Maiestie to my Lord, vsing all the art
I had both to procure her Maiestie
to send, and my selfe to be the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger:
for as to the former, I feared
not to alleage to her, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
towards my Lord, was a
thing towards the people verie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plausible,
and therefore wished her
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4646:17"/>
Maiestie howsoeuer she did, yet to
discharge her selfe of it; and to lay it
vpon others, and therefore that she
should intermixe her proceeding
with some immediate graces from
her selfe, that the world might take
knowledge of her Princely nature
and goodnesse, lest it should alienate
the hearts of her people from her.
Which I did stand vpon, knowing
very well, that if she once relented
to send or visite, those demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wold proue matter of substance
for my Lords good. And to draw
that employment vpon my selfe, I
aduised her Maiestie, that whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
God should moue her to turne
the light of her fauour toward my
Lord, to make signification to him
thereof: that her Maiestie if she did
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4646:17"/>
it not in person, would at the least
vse some such meane as might not
intitle themselues to any part of the
thanks, as persons that were thought
mightie with her, to worke her, or
to bring her about; but to vse some
such as could not be thought but a
meere conduct of her owne good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
but I could neuer preuaile
with her, though I am perswaded
she saw plainely whereat I leuelled:
but she had me in iealousie, that I
was not hers intirely, but still had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and deepe respects towards
my Lord, more then stood at that
time with her will and pleasure. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the same time I remember an
answer of mine in a matter which
had some affinitie with my Lords
cause, which though it grew from
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4646:18"/>
me, went after about in others
names. For her Maiesty being migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
incensed with that booke which
was dedicated to my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi>
being a storie of the first yeare of
king <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, thinking it a
seditious prelude to put into the
peoples heads boldnesse and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
said she had good opinion that
there was treason in it, and asked me
if I could not find any places in it,
that might be drawne within case of
treason: whereto I answered; for
treason surely I found none, but for
fellonie very many. And when her
Maiestie hastily asked me wherein;
I told her, the Author had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
very apparant theft, for he had
taken most of the sentences of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius
Tacitus,</hi> and translated them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4646:18"/>
into English, and put them into his
text. And another time when the
Queene would not be perswaded,
that it was his writing whose name
was to it, but that it had some more
mischieuous Author, and said with
great indignation, that she would
haue him racked to produce his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
I replyed, Nay Madame, he is
a Doctor, neuer racke his person, but
racke his stile; let him haue pen, inke,
and paper, and helpe of bookes, and
be enioyned to continue the storie
where it breaketh off, and I will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
by collecting the stiles, to
iudge whether he were the Author
or no. But for the maine matter, sure
I am, when the Queene at any time
asked mine opinion of my Lords
case, I euer in one tenor, said vnto
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4646:19"/>
her: that they were faults which the
Law might tearme Contempts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were the transgression of
her particular directions and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
but then what defence
might be made of them, in regard of
the great interest the person had in
her Maiesties fauour, in regard of
the greatnesse of his place, and the
amplenesse of his Commission; in
regard of the nature of the businesse
being action of warre, which in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cases cannot be tyed to strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of instructions, in regard of the
distance of the place, hauing also a
sea betweene that demaunds and
commands, must be subiect to wind
and weather; in regard of a counsell
of State in <hi>Ireland</hi> which he had at
his backe to auow his actions vpon,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4646:19"/>
and lastly in regard of a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he would alleadge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
which I told her in some religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
was held to be a sufficient dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
for Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
much more for Princes. In
all these regards, I besought her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
to be aduised againe and again,
how she brought the cause into any
publike question: nay, I went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for I told her, my Lord was an
eloquent and well spoken man, and
besides his eloquence of nature or
art, he had an eloquence of accident
which passed them both, which was
the pittie and beneuolence of his
hearers; and therefore that when he
should come to his answer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
I doubted his words would
haue so vnequall passage aboue
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4646:20"/>
theirs that should charge him, as
would not be for her Maiesties ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
and therefore wished the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
might be, that they might
wrap it vp priuatly betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and that she would restore my
Lord to his former attendance, with
some addition of honour to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
discontent. But this I will neuer
deny, that I did shew no approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
generally of his being sent back
againe into <hi>Ireland,</hi> both because it
would haue caried a repugnancie
with my former discourse, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I was in mine owne heart ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswaded, that it was not good
neither for the Queene, nor for the
State, nor for himselfe: and yet I did
not disswade it neither, but left it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
as <hi>locus lubricus.</hi> For this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularitie
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4646:20"/>
I do well remember, that
after your Lordship was named for
the place in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your going, it pleased her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
at <hi>White hall</hi> to speake to me of
that nomination: at which time I
said to her, Surely Madame, if you
meane not to employ my Lord of
<hi>Essex</hi> thither againe, your Maiestie
cannot make a better choice, and
was going on to shew some reason;
and her Maiestie interrupted me
with great passion: <hi>Essex!</hi> (said she)
whensoeuer I send <hi>Essex</hi> backe again
into <hi>Irela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> I will marrie you, claime
it of me: wherunto I said, Well Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
I will release that contract if
his going be for the good of your
State. Immediatly after the Queene
had thought of a course (which was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4646:21"/>
also executed) to haue somewhat
published in the Starre-chamber, for
the satisfaction of the world tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> his restraint,
and my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to it, but occasion to be taken by
reason of some Libels then disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
which when her Maiestie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
vnto me, I was vtterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; and told her plainely, that
the people would say, that my Lord
was wounded vpon his backe, and
that Iustice had her ballance taken
from her, which euer consisted of an
accusation and defence, with many
other quicke and significant tearms
to that purpose: in so much that I
remember I said, that my Lord <hi>in
foro famae</hi> was too hard for her; and
therefore wished her as I had done
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4646:21"/>
before, to wrap it vp priuatly. And
certainely I offended her at that
time, which was rare with me: for I
cal to mind that both the <hi>Christmas,
Lent,</hi> and <hi>Easter</hi> Terme following,
though I came diuers times to her
vpon Law busines, yet me thought
her face and maner was not so cleare
and open to me, as it was at the first.
And she did directly charge me, that
I was absent that day at the Starre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
which was very true; but
I alleaged some indisposition of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to excuse it: and during all the
time aforesaid, there was <hi>altum silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium</hi>
from her to me touching my
Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> causes.</p>
            <p>But towardes the end of Easter
tearme, her Maiestie brake with me,
and told me that she had found my
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4646:22"/>
words true, for that the proceeding
in the Starre-chamber had done no
good, but rather kindled factious
bruites (as she termed them) then
quenched them, and therefore that
she was determined now for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of the world, to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
my Lord in the Star-chamber
by an information <hi>ore tenus,</hi> and to
haue my lord brought to his answer:
howbeit she said she wold assure me,
that whatsoeuer the did, should be
towards my Lord <hi>ad castigationem,
&amp; non ad destructionem,</hi> as indeed she
had often repeated the same phrase
before: whereunto I said (to the end
vtterly to diuert her:) Madam if you
will haue me speake to you in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
I must speake to you as Frier
<hi>Bacons</hi> head spake, that said first,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4646:22"/>
               <hi>Time is,</hi> and then, <hi>Time was,</hi> and <hi>time
would neuer be;</hi> for certainly (said I) it
is now far too late, the matter is cold
and hath taken too much winde;
whereat she seemed againe offended
and rose from me, and that resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for a while continued; and after, in
the beginning of Midsomer terme,
I attending her, and finding her
setled in that resolution (which I
heard of also otherwise) she falling
vpon the like speech, it is true, that
seeing no other remedie, I said to her
slightly, Why Madame, if you will
needs haue a proceeding, you were
best haue it in some such sort as <hi>Ouid</hi>
spake of his mistris, <hi>Est aliquid luce
patente minus,</hi> to make a counseltable
matter of it, and there an end; which
speech againe she seemed to take in il
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4646:23"/>
part, but yet I thinke it did good at
that time, and holpe to diuert that
course of proceeding by informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in the Starre-chamber. Neuertheles
afterwards it pleased her to make a
more solemne matter of the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
and some few dayes after when
order was giuen that the matter
shold be heard at <hi>York</hi> house, before
an assembly of Counsellers, Peeres,
and Iudges, and some audience of
men of qualitie to be admitted, and
then did some principal Counsellers
send for vs of the learned Counsell,
and notifie her Maiesties pleasure
vnto vs, saue that it was said to me o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
by one of them, that her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
was not yet resolued whether she
would haue me forborne in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
or no. And hereupon might arise
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4646:23"/>
that other sinister and vntrue speech
that I heare is raised of me, how I
was a suter to bee vsed against my
Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> at that time: for it is
very true, that I that knew well what
had passed betweene the Queen and
me, and what occasion I had giuen
her both of distast &amp; distrust, in cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
her disposition, by standing sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly
for my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> &amp; suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
it also to be a stratageme arising
from some particular emulation, I
writ to her two or three words of
complement, signifying to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
that if she would be pleased to
spare me in my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> cause,
out of the consideration she tooke of
my obligation towards him, I should
recko<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it for one of her highest fauors;
but otherwise desiring her Maiestie
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4646:24"/>
to thinke that I knew the degrees of
duties, and that no particular obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whatsoeuer to any subiect could
supplant or weaken that entirenes of
dutie that I did owe and beare to her
and her seruice; &amp; this was the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sute I made, being a respect no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that had his wittes could haue omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
but neuerthelesse I had a further
reach in it, for I iudged that dayes
worke would be a full period of any
bitternesse or harshnes betweene the
Queene and my Lord, and therefore
if I declared my selfe fully according
to her mind at that time, which could
not do my Lord any manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice,
I should keepe my credit with
her euer after, whereby to doe my
Lord seruice. Hereupon the next
news that I heard, was, that we were
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4646:24"/>
all sent for againe, and that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
pleasure was, we all should
haue parts in the businesse; and the
Lords falling into distribution of
our parts, it was allotted to me, that I
should set foorth some vndutifull ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of my Lord, in giuing occasion
and countenance to a seditious
Pamphlet, as it was tearmed, which
was dedicated vnto him, which was
the booke before mentioned of king
<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. Whereupon I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to that allotment, and said to
their Lordships, that it was an old
matter, and had no maner of cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with the rest of the charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
matters of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore
that I hauing bene wronged by
bruites before, this wold expose me
to them more; and it would be said,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4646:25"/>
I gaue in euidence mine owne tales.
It was answered againe with good
shew, that because it was considered
how I stood tyed to my Lord of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi>
therefore that part was thought
fittest for me which did him least
hurt: for that wheras all the rest was
matter of charge and accusation, this
onely was but matter of caueat and
admonition. Wherewith though I
was in mine owne mind litle satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
because I knew wel a man were
better to be charged with some
faults, then admonished of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
yet the conclusion binding v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the Queenes pleasure directly,
<hi>volens nolens,</hi> I could not auoide that
part that was laid vpon me; which
part if in the deliuerie I did handle
not tenderly, (though no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4646:25"/>
me did in so cleare tearmes free
my Lord from al disloyaltie as I did)
that, your Lordship knoweth, must
be ascribed to the superior dutie I
did owe to the Queenes fame and
and honor in a publike proceeding,
and partly to the intention I had to
vphold my self in credit &amp; strength
with the Queene, the better to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do my Lord good offices af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards:
for assoone as this day was
past, I lost no time, but the very next
day following (as I remember) I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
her Maiesty, fully resolued to
try and put in vre my vtmost inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
so farre as I in my weaknesse
could giue furtherance to bring my
Lord againe speedily into Court &amp;
into fauour, and knowing (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
at least) how the Queene was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4646:26"/>
to be vsed, I thought that to make
her conceiue that the matter went
well then, was the way to make her
leaue off there; and I remember wel,
I said to her, you haue now Madame
obtained victorie ouer two things
which the greatest Princes in the
world cannot at their wils subdue:
the one is ouer Fame, the other is
ouer a great mind: for surely the
world be now I hope reasonably
well satisfied; and for my Lord, he
did shew that humiliation towards
your Maiestie, as I am perswaded he
was neuer in his life time more fit
for your fauor then he is now: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if your Maiestie will not marre
it by lingring, but giue ouer at the
best, and now you haue made so
good a full point, receiue him againe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4646:26"/>
with tendernesse, I shall then thinke
that all that is past is for the best.
Wherat I remember she took excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great contentment, and did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
iterate and put me in mind, that
she had euer said, that her procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
should be <hi>ad reparationem,</hi> and
not <hi>ad ruinam,</hi> as who saith, that
now was the time I should well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
that that saying of hers should
proue true. And further she willed
me to set downe in writing all that
passed that day. I obeyed her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
and within some fewe
daies brought her againe the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which I did reade vnto her at
two seuerall after-noones: and when
I came to that part that set foorth my
Lords owne answer, (which was my
principall care) I do well beare in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4646:27"/>
mind, that she was extraordinarily
mooued with it, in kindnesse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting
towards my Lord, and told
me afterwards (speaking how well I
had expressed my Lords part) that
she perceiued old loue would not
easily be forgotten: wherto I answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
suddenly, that I hoped she
meant that by her selfe. But in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
I did aduise her that now she
had taken a representation of the
matter to her selfe, that she would
let it go no further: for Madame
(said I) the fire blazeth well alreadie,
what should you tumble it: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
it may please you keepe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience
with your selfe in this case:
for since your expresse directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was,
there should be no Register nor
Clearke to take this sentence, nor no
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4646:27"/>
record or memoriall made vp of the
proceeding, why should you now
do that popularly, which you would
not admit to be done iudicially?
Whereupon she did agree, that that
writing should be suppressed, and I
thinke there were not fiue persons
that euer saw it. But from this time
foorth during the whole latter end
of that Sommer, while the Court
was at <hi>Nonsuch</hi> and <hi>Otlands,</hi> I made
it my taske and scope to take and
giue occasions for my Lords reinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration
in his fortune: which my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
I did also signifie to my
Lord assoone as euer he was at his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie;
whereby I might without
perill of the Queenes indignation
write to him, and hauing receiued
from his Lordship a courteous and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4646:28"/>
louing acceptation of my good will
and indeuours, I did apply it in all
my accesses to the Queene, which
were very many at that time, and
purposely sought and wrought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
other variable pretences, but
onely and chiefly for that purpose.
And on the other side, I did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to giue my Lord from time to
time faithfull aduertisement what I
found, and what I wished. And I
drew for him by his appointment
some letters to her Maiestie, which
though I knew well his Lordships
gift and stile was farre better then
mine owne, yet because he required
it, alleaging that by his long restraint
he was growne almost a stranger to
the Queens present conceipts, I was
readie to performe it: and sure I am
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4646:28"/>
that for the space of sixe weekes, or
two moneths it prospered so well, as
I expected continually his restoring
to his attendance. And I was neuer
better welcome to the Queene, nor
more made of, then when I spake
fullest and boldest for him: in which
kind the particulars were exceeding
many, whereof for an example I wil
remember to your Lordship one or
two; as at one time I cal to mind, her
Maiestie was speaking of a fellow
that vndertook to cure, or at least to
ease my brother of his goute, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
me how it went forwards; and I
told her Maiestie, that at the first he
receiued good by it, but after in the
course of his cure he found himselfe
it a stay or rather worse: the Queene
said againe, I will tell you <hi>Bacon</hi> the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4646:29"/>
error of it, the maner of these Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and especially these Empericks
is to continue one kind of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
which at the first is proper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to draw out the ill humor, but
after they haue not the discretion to
chaunge their medicine, but apply
still drawing medicines, when they
shold rather intend to cure and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate
the part. Good Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
(said I) how wisely and aptly
can you speake and discerne of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
ministred to the bodie, and
consider not that there is the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of Phisicke ministred to the
mind: as now in the case of my Lord
of <hi>Essex,</hi> your Princely word euer
was, that you intended euer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
his mind, and not ruine his
fortune: I know well you cannot
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4646:29"/>
but think that you haue drawne the
humor sufficiently, and therefore it
were more then time, and it were
but for doubt of mortifying or exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerating,
that you did apply and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
strength and comfort vnto
him: for these same gradations of
yours are fitter to corrupt then cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
any mind of greatnesse. And an
other time I remember she told me
for newes, that my Lord had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
vnto her some very dutifull let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and that she had bene moued
by them, and when she tooke it to
be the abundance of the heart, she
found it to be but a preparatiue to a
sute for the renewing of his farme of
Sweet wines: whereunto I replyed;
O Madame, how doth your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
conster of these things, as if these
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4646:30"/>
two could not stand well together,
which indeed nature hath planted in
all creatures. For there are but two
sympathies, the one towards <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
the other towards <hi>Preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
That to Perfection, as the iron
contendeth to the Loadstone: that
to Preseruation, as the vine will
creepe towards a stake or prop that
stands by it, not for any loue to the
stake, but to vphold it selfe. And
therefore Madame, you must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
my Lords desire to do you
seruice, is as to his perfection, that
which he thinkes himself to be born
for: whereas his desire to obtaine
this thing of you, is but for a susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
And not to trouble your
Lordship with many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
like vnto these, it was at the selfe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4646:30"/>
same time that I did draw with my
Lords priuitie, and by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
two letters, the one written as
from my brother, the other as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
returned from my Lord, both
to be by me in secret maner shewed
to the Queene, which it pleased my
Lord very strangely to mention at
the barre: the scope of which were
but to represent and picture foorth
vnto her Maiesty my Lords mind to
be such, as I knew her Maiestie wold
fainest haue had it, which letters
whosoeuer shall see, (for they cannot
now be retracted or altered, being
by reason of my brothers, or his
Lordships seruants deliuerie, long
since comen into diuerse hands) let
him iudge, specially if he knew the
Queene, and do remember those
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4646:31"/>
times, whether they were not the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of one that sought to bring the
Queene about for my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi>
his good. The troth is, that the issue
of all his dealing grew to this, that
the Queene by some flacknesse of
my Lords, as I imagine, liked him
worse and worse, and grew more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
towards him. Then, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
belike the continuall, and
incessant, and confident speeches
and courses that I had held on my
Lords side, became vtterly alienated
from me, and for the space of at least
three moneths, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Michaelmas and Newyears
tide following, would not as much
as looke on me, but turned away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
me with expresse and purpose-like
discountenance wheresoeuer she
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4646:31"/>
saw me: and at such time as I desired
to speake with her about Law busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
euer sent me forth very slight
refusals; insomuch as it is most true,
that immediatly after Newyeares
tide I desired to speake with her; and
being admitted to her, I dealt with
her plainely and said: Madame I see
you withdraw your fauor from me,
and now I haue lost many friends
for your sake I shall leese you too:
you haue put me like one of those
that the Frenchmen call <hi>Enfans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
that serue on foote before hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
so haue you put me into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of enuie without place, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
strength: and I know at Chesse
a pawn before the king, is euer much
plaid vpon: a great many loue me
not, because they thinke I haue bene
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4646:32"/>
against my Lord of <hi>Essex;</hi> and you
loue me not, because you know I
haue bene for him: yet will I neuer
repent me, that I haue dealt in sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie
of heart towards you both,
without respect of cautions to my
selfe: and therefore <hi>viuus videns<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>
pereo.</hi> If I do breake my necke, I shall
do it in manner as Maister <hi>Dorring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
did it, which walked on the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements
of the Church many daies,
and tooke a view and suruey where
he should fall: and so Madame (said
I) I am not so simple, but that I take
a prospect of mine ouerthrow, only
I thought I would tell you so much,
that you may know that it was faith,
and not folly that brought me into
it, and so I will pray for you. Vpon
which speeches of mine vttered
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4646:32"/>
with some passion, it is true her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
was exceedingly moued, and
accumulated a number of kind and
gracious words vpon me, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me to rest vpon this, <hi>Gratia mea
sufficit,</hi> and a number of other sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and tender words and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
such as more could not be;
but as touching my Lord of <hi>Essex,
ne verbum quidem.</hi> Wherupon I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
resting then determined to
meddle no more in the matter; as
that, that I saw would ouerthrowe
me, and not be able to do him any
good. And thus I made mine owne
peace with mine owne confidence
it that time; and this was the last
time I saw her Maiestie, before the
eight of <hi>Februarie,</hi> which was the
day of my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4646:33"/>
After which time, for that I
performed at the barre in my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
seruice, your Lordship knoweth
by the rules of dutie, that I was to
do it honestly, and without preuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
but for any putting my selfe
into it, I protest before God, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
moued neither the Queene, nor
any person liuing concerning my
being vsed in the seruice, either of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
or examination: but it was
meerely laid vpon me with the rest
of my fellowes. And for the time
which passed, I meane betweene the
arraignement and my Lords suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
I well remember I was but
once with the Queene; at what time
though I durst not deale directly for
my Lord as things then stood; yet
generally I did both commend her
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4646:33"/>
Maiesties mercie, tearming it to her
as an excellent balme that did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
distill from her Soueraigne
hands, and made an excellent odour
in the senses of her people: and not
onely so, but I tooke hardinesse to
extenuate, not the fact; for that I
durst not, but the danger, telling her
that if some base or cruell minded
persons had entred into such an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it might haue caused much
bloud and combustion: but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
well they were such as knew
not how to play the malefactors, and
some other words which I now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
And as for the rest of the cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of my selfe in that seruice, I haue
many honorable witnesses that can
tell, that the next day after my Lords
arraignement, by my diligence and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4646:34"/>
information touching the qualitie
and nature of the offendors, sixe of
nine were stayed, which otherwise
had bene attainted, I bringing their
Lordships letter for their stay, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Iurie was sworne to passe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
them: so neare it went, and how
carefull I was, and made it my part,
that whosoeuer was in trouble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that matter, assoone as euer his
case was sufficiently knowne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
of, might not continue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
but be set at libertie: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other parts, which I am well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of stood with the dutie of an
honest man. But indeed I will not
deny for the case of Sir <hi>Thomas
Smith</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> the Queene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
my opinion of it, I told
her, I thought it was as hard as many
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4646:34"/>
of the rest: but what was the reason?
because at that time I had seene only
his accusation, and had neuer bene
present at any examination of his:
and the matter so standing, I had bin
very vntrue to my seruice, if I had
not deliuered that opinion. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
vpon a reexamination of
some that charged him, who weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their owne testimonie; and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
hearing himselfe <hi>viua voce,</hi>
I went instantly to the Queene out
of the soundnesse of my conscience,
and not regarding what opinion I
had formerly deliuered, told her
Maiestie, I was satisfied and resolued
in my conscience, that for the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the action, the plot was to
countenance the action further by
him in respect of his place, then they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4646:35"/>
had indeed any interest or intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
with him. It is very true also,
about that time her Maiesty taking a
liking of my pen, vpon that which I
had done before concerning the
proceeding at <hi>Yorke house,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
vpon some other declarations,
which in former times by her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
I put in writing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
me to penne that booke,
which was published for the better
satisfaction of the world: which I
did, but so, as neuer Secretarie had
more particular and expresse directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and instructions in euery point
how to guide my hand in it: and
not onely so, but after that I had
made a first draught therof, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
it to certaine principall
Councellers by her Maiesties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4646:35"/>
it was perused, weighed,
censured, altered, and made almost
anew, writing according to their
Lordshippes better consideration,
wherein their Lordshippes and my
selfe both were as religious and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of truth, as desirous of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
and my selfe indeed gaue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
words and forme of stile in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
their direction. And after it
had passed their allowance, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
exactly perused by the Queen
her selfe, and some alterations made
againe by her appointment: nay,
and after it was set to print, the
Queene, who as your Lordshippe
knoweth, as she was excellent in
great matters, so she was exquisite in
small: and noted that I could not
forget my auncient respect to my
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4646:36"/>
Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> in terming him euer
My Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> My Lord of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi>
in almost euery page of the
booke, which she thought not fit,
but would haue it made, <hi>Essex,</hi> or the
late Earle of <hi>Essex:</hi> whereupon of
force it was printed <hi>de noue,</hi> and the
first copies suppressed by her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie
commaundement. And
this my good Lord, to my furthest
remembrance, is all that passed,
wherein I had part, which I haue set
downe as neare as I could in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
words and speeches that were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
not because they are worthie
the repetition, I mean those of mine
owne; but to the end your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
may liuely and plainly discerne
betweene the face of truth, and a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4646:36"/>
smooth tale. And the rather also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in things that passed a good
while since, the very wordes and
phrases did sometimes bring to my
remembrance the matters, wherein
I report me to your Honourable
iudgement, whether you do not see
the traces of an honest man: and had
I bene as well beleeued either by the
Queene or by my Lord, as I was
well heard by them both, both my
Lord had beene fortunate, and so had
my selfe in his fortune.</p>
            <p>To conclude therfore, I humbly
pray your Lordshippe to pardon me
for troubling you with this long
Narration, and that you will
vouchsafe to hold me in your
good opinion, till you know I haue
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4646:37"/>
deserued, or find that I shall deserue
the contrarie; and euen so I
continue</p>
            <p>At your Lordships Honorable
commandements very
humbly.</p>
