         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>TRUELY LOYAL Indigent</hi> OFFICER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N honourable Title; It was given us by <hi>Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> not by any way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, but out of pitty; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering our Condition. They little thought we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our Indigency ſo long. The Gift his Majeſty and Parliament gave us, 60000<hi>l.</hi> Men of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did judge it to be a Princely and Noble Gift: beſides his Majeſty was gratiouſly pleaſed to add to it the Office Money, which by moſt Mens Judgments (that had underſtanding in the <hi>Offices</hi>) if honeſtly Taxt and Gathered, would amount to as much more at leaſt. Sixſcore thouſand pound! (a Sum of Money) had it been rightly deſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted according to the intention of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> (that was) to the <hi>Truly Loyal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent Officers,</hi> It would a raiſed them conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sums to Imploy'd them, or purchaſ'd Places, as thoſe that were our Enemies have done. But the Report of this Money to be given, ſo <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57903:8"/>Alarm'd the Counterfit Officers, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, and created themſelves <hi>Officers,</hi> Grooms, Serving-men, and Pedees to Colonels, and Field-Officers, made nothing of getting Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates to Certify them Leiutenants, Cornets, Enſigns, Serjants, Corporalls, Sentenells, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Troopers to make themſelves Enſigns, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and Quarter-maſters: then there was your Paper Officers (as I may call them) that could come up and lye at little Charges here in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> one Aturney would ſerve to lye here for the Letters of Aturney of two or three Shires of ſuch Officers: they would venture their Names and Certificates with them at half Snips, or as much in the Pound according as they could agree for: moſt of them knowing it was all clear gains, if they got any. In conmming up to Clam it themſelves, They knew here were them that would know their faces, if ever they ſhew'd them with credit in his Majeſties Army: but they thought they were not <hi>Act</hi> proof if they came within ſhot of the <hi>Truly Loyal Officers;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would Pickeer at a diſtance a far off, and their Aturnyes to ſtand the danger. I will not ſay but ſome of them may be Right, and the owners truly qualified: but I beleive not the third part according to the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> for after the <hi>Act</hi> came out there was them that made a good living by Creating, and perſwading many to be Captains and Officers both in City and Country; it is too tedious to Relate the Cheats that was in that <hi>Liſt of Officers:</hi> to my knowledge (that was in the <hi>Weſtern Army,</hi> and in one Regiment from the firſt to the laſt) a Drum <pb n="3" facs="tcp:57903:8"/>put in for Lieutenant, a Captain (when examined) did not know his Lieutenat Colonel. Eleven En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to the Regiment that I belonged too, and neer but Ten Colours flying at firſt: Two Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaſters to that Regiment of Foot, and no ſuch Men known by the Colonel, nor my ſelf, (that continued to the laſt in it) and many Officers we never knew, dead men that were comſum'd in their Graves long before this <hi>Act</hi> came out; their Names appear'd here by Conjurations of ſome or other to Cheat Real <hi>Indigent Officers.</hi> Theſe Letters of Aturney-Marchants gain'd well enough to keep themſelves from Indigency, ſome they never paid, and thought it no deceipt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the deceivers, the honeſtes of them (if there were any) took ſuch Fees of their Clyants, they will ſcarce be truſted with any buſines of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence by any honeſt Party ſince, it is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif of many honeſt Gentlemen that the unlawful Letters of Aturney that were paid, made paid, and unpaid, hath juggled away as much money as would ſatisfy moſt of the <hi>Indigent Officers</hi> that are left: there was another ſort of pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Officers put in for a ſhare of this Money! that never had Men, nor Commiſſions neither, many of them; It was an eaſy matter towards the latter end of the Wars to gain a Commiſſion to Raiſe a Regiment, his Majeſty truſting them on their own words (with little knowledge of them, may be, upon their great promiſes) theſe Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onels preſently made their Captains, and other Officers, and ſo Rides up and down the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to Raiſe Men and Horſes upon the Countries Charge, living upon Free-quarters, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57903:9"/>Contribution; never giving accoumpt to Field Army, nor Gariſon, nor never troubling them, till forc'd by the Enemy to make their Retreat, and ſo ſleep in a whole skin; theſe making more Enemies (rather then helping to deſtroy them) by their Plundering, and Coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Actions, which turned the hearts of many that wiſh'd his Majeſty, and Armys well at firſt: Theſe, and ſuch like, made up this Number of 5400. and odd <hi>Commiſſioned Officers;</hi> Enough for Three <hi>Camp-Royals</hi> of Horſe and Foot (beſides thoſe that had Eſtates, Imployments, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands (that did not put in) which was a ſhame to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, to have a Kingdom Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and ſuch a Pious Prince Murdered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own Palace (for want of an Army) the number of Officers ſufficient enough to Conduct a hundred thouſand Foot, and Forty thouſand Horſe; ſuch an Army of Politick Genera's, Couragious Commanders, and well Diſciplin'd and Reſolved Souldiers, need not have fear'd to a Marcht to the Walls of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and make an honourable Retreat, if not Conquer'd the Great <hi>Turk</hi> (had we not loſt the hearts of the truly Ancient <hi>Brittains</hi>) but what ſhould I talk of ſo many Officers, when there were not by the Judgment of thoſe that knew this Liſt, not fifteen hundred that were truly qualified, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Act of <hi>Parliament;</hi> yet all theſe Officers paſt Muſter in the Liſt and Book, and paſt inſpection for all that ever could be juſtly proved againſt them. Thus have I made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, what a number of Money hath been paid, and made paid moſt of it, to an unknown num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57903:9"/>of men, ſo according as it was ordered, this 60000<hi>l</hi> pound, and that Office Money that was paid, would amount to but 40 days pay to them that did receive it, and two Years before we could get it; ſo as it was given for a help for ſome ſubſiſtance for us, it made us more Indigent than we were; for it caſt many of us in Priſon, Running more in Debt then the Money would pay.</p>
            <p>What here I have declared, I know there is many Gentlemen are ſenſible of the truth of it. His Majeſty likewiſe was Graciouſly pleaſed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this to grant a Patten for ſix Years, to thoſe <hi>Commiſſion'd Officers</hi> that were here about the City, that had no Imployments, nor Subſiſtance of a Livelihood, till his Majeſty could make a more ample and laſting Proviſion for them; as is more fully expreſt in the Letter Patten, there was Truſtees Choſen (thirteen, I muſt confeſs) by ſome of us, but we could very well a ſpared half of them, for they have ſhuffled and Cut ſo with the party (which is two hundred and odd) that they have gain'd but a very little by their dealing: There is no body can tell their gains, (nor they cannot ſay themſelves, they are loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers) in a matter of fourteen or fifteen Months after the ſetting up of the Lotteryes, there was account given (I know not whether it was upon Oath, for I heard of none they took, but the Oath of ſecrecy amongſt themſelves; which one of their own party Confeſt, when he was askt how the buſineſs went by one of us) they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the managing and Letting of all <hi>Lotteryes,</hi> for that time, the Plate <hi>Lottery</hi> at <hi>Charing Croſs,</hi> 
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57903:10"/>where his Majeſty and the Royal Family was pleaſed to honour it; not only with their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but likewiſe with their Purſes: There was plentiful throwing into that <hi>Lottery,</hi> according to the drawing out. And likewiſe, they had the benefit of many <hi>Plate Lotteryes,</hi> in divers places that Year; and the letting and ſetting of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lotteryes</hi> that brought in handſom Sums of Money; beſides the <hi>Royal Oak Lottery,</hi> which was more conſiderable then all the reſt: Now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your neceſſary and unneceſſary Charges was deducted, it was brought to Eleven days Pay a piece to the party; which was but a very ſmall ſum, as I ſhall make it appear at laſt, there was a greater Sum of Money left for you thirteen, then for all the reſt of the Party beſides: Each one of you allow'd your ſelves more than you allow'd a whole Regiment of Officers, (Quarter-maſters excepted) you would let none of them come in for a ſhare; intending to quarter us your ſelves with a quarter part of the <hi>Royal Oak,</hi> and judged it enough for us by your Bench of thirteen, your Chair-man Judge, and a full Jury (if you all ſate) to take his part: But now ſo much of the time being gone, and ſo little profit appeared, The party began to murmure, then to ſhow your good intentions you had for the benefit of the party, you were contented the City and Country ſhould be devided in Lots amongſt us, who had the drawing of them I know not: but the City of <hi>London</hi> muſt be your ſhare, (with ſome others that you choſe) which was more reſponſable then all the Countries could be; for all the reſt of the Party not bearing the Charges <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57903:10"/>of any that ſhould go to manage them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as you had and did manage it; and had it not been for the <hi>Royal Oak</hi> (which you did ſtrive to keep all for your ſelves too) moſt of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had had nothing of all the Lotteries ever ſince; at laſt you did allow us the fourth part of that; but we muſt believe your honeſt words, (I hope you did not miſreckon your ſelves) we cannot judge it to be an even account, it comes ſo juſt to two days and a quarter a piece each Officer, twice a Year paid; them that keeps thoſe Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries for you, keeps a very good Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; they know we are ſo poor, a little gain will pleaſe us, ſo they bring us in not looſers: Ten days pay and three Quarters we have had ſince, who you have been pleaſed to pay, which doth amout to a Labourers hire formerly a peny a day one Officer with another, it will not pay for their Lodging, let them ſhift for Meat, Drink, and Cloths, how they can. Now (our Truſtees) thinking we were not content with this ſmall Sallery we had from them (as well they might) nor they ſatisfied for the pains and care they took for us, ſhuffled a third part of us off, that are left alive: the pattern being nere out, having Friends and Money to boot, hath got the <hi>Royal Oak</hi> for themſelves (which they thought the fourth part was enough for all of us before) and left the reſt of the Lotteryes to ſome other Officers which his Majeſty hath been pleaſed to give them to. I wiſh them happineſs in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them, and may prove to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; but our Truſtees are ſure of the Wheat, whatſoever the reſt proves. I am ſure <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57903:11"/>there's none of them can ſay, they are Indigent Officers now, whatſoever ſome of them could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were choſen Truſtees.</p>
            <p>But the number that choſe them were not many more then their ſelves, and if to chooſe again, would ſcarce give their Votes for half of you now, in a ſmaller buſineſs of truſt. I am ſo Charitable to think if ſome of the Truſtees had ſate at the Helm in your ſteed, that did, they would a ſteer'd a better courſe of Conſcience, than you that ſate twice a Week, and your Wills a Law, having the Purſe in your hand. Out of Conſcience I tell you this, for dealing ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcienceably by me and others, granting Power, and Authority, and receiving Rent, promiſing to vindicate men, and make them ſtand Tryals, to their utter Ruine, and will not be at a penny charge; yet allowing your ſelves ſuch Salleryes and Intereſt, tis a ſhame here to relate, (which will be proved) by the Plate Lotteries, which two of you took upon you to Manage, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of a party; where their Lot fell in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: One of theſe perſons hath Iumpt (ſince his name was in the Printed Book, amongſt the 5000. <hi>Indigent Officers</hi>) from a Cornet to a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and never headed Troop nor Company ſince, whatſoever he did before; nor I believe will never be Chronicled for his Acts of Piety, Charity, or Valour.</p>
            <p>To carry on his Deſigns as the party knows by experinnce; ſince he hath had the handling of the buſineſs, it is his Policy to truſt none of the Party with any buſineſs of our own, where he hath had the managing of it, neither in the <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57903:11"/>Plate Lotteries, or Royal Oak, but give good Salleries to others, which would a been a good Relief for ſome of us; that I believe was as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and as honeſt as any were implo'd, and would a given a good Satisfacton of your integrety to thoſe that were miſtruſtful of you; but you thought they were not fit for your Secrecy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not fit for your Service: But ſome of you (ſay we) are a diſcontented People, and never Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied what is done for us: Let all men that hath any Conſcience, or Chriſtian Reaſon in them, Judge, after I have as near as I can, caſt up how much you have been pleaſed to allow us, ſince you have been our Stewards; whether we have not had more Reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain than give you thanks for your pains and care you have taken for us this ſix Years: The firſt payment we had a 11 days pay from you, out of all the Lotteries, and 10 days &amp; 3 quarters pay ſince out of the <hi>Royal Oak;</hi> which makes not 22 days pay in all, caſt up for the time, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to about ſix pence a day, between a Colonel of Horſe, and a Collonel of Foot; other Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Officers, on with another, not Two-pence a day: A Captain of Horſe and Foot, Three half-pence a day, three pence between them. Leiutenant Enſigns, and Cornets, about a half-penny a day, one Officer with another, not two-pence a day to maintain them. I would have you reaſon with them, how they have ſpent and conſumed it, and not benefitted themſelves by it as you have done, but murmure at your actions: The Servants that you have imploy'd for the managing of our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, that you were intruſted for, hath made <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57903:12"/>their Saleryes many days better then a Regiment of Officers pay, hath been a day (and good keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by you beſides) I hope you have gain'd this ſix Years ſufficient enough by us; what we have gain'd by you, I have made it appear, I hope when it is known how we have been dealt withal, ſince his Majeſties Reſtauration, as this Book relates part, we cannot be blam'd formak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Grievances ſo much known, and have had ſo little done for us yet, and long of ſuch as have had the managing of our buſineſs.</p>
            <p>I hope you will give an Account what Moneys you have left in your Treaſury, of thoſe that are dead ſince, and either pay it to the Widows, Children, or to them that Relieved them (when you would not) Unleſs they would Adminiſter, and ſo it may be undo themſelves, for that little you would do for them. If you have not the Curſes of the Widows and Fatherleſs, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid you have the Prayers of very few; if you have done for us as you would be done to your ſelves you have done like Loyal Subjects, and good Chriſtians; and I wiſh your proſperity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, the ſame I wiſh to my ſelf: Give loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers leave to ſpeak the Truth, and not all neither, till occaſion ſerves. If I have drawn you out here with my Pen, it is not to the Life, for I have ſhadowed you; and it is well known to ſome of you your ſelves and to others; for the preſent I ſhall leave you, as you have left us: If we be thrown out of your Favours, which I am apt to believe you had never none for us (unleſs it were for your own ends) We hope we ſhall not be thrown out of his Majeſties favour, nor <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57903:12"/>none that truly loves thoſe that faithfully ſerved him; as I ſhall make it appear who they are, and how to be known, from thoſe that takes the Names and Titles, of <hi>Loyal Commiſſion'd Officers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is your <hi>Truly Loyal Commiſſion'd Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> and your <hi>Truly Loyal Indigent Officer.</hi> Two Titles, but one Subject; different in habits, but all one in Hearts: Some it may be hath ſome Livelihood, Credit, Subſiſtence, ſome Friends, in hopes of ſomthing to be done for them. Others may have Imployments during pleaſure (not Life) ſubject to be turned out, becauſe of their Age; but others again as I know hath neither, ſo indigent, and their wants ſo great, they are aſhamed to make it known; Men fit, deſerving Men to be truſted in honeſt Imployments, and as able to perform, which I believe his Majeſty knows not off: And there are them that knows thoſe things, but being provided for themſelves, grows for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of their Fellow-Sufferers: The pretended <hi>Loyal Commiſſion Officers,</hi> hath been the cauſe of thoſe things, and the Aſpertions that hath been laid upon us beſides: The <hi>Truly Loyal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd Officer,</hi> is he that can make himſelf out ſo, according to the Title and Command he had formerly: Having a Real Command of Men anſwerable, and able to perform the Duty of a Souldier; according to that Command; that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Prince for Loyalty, not Lucre; that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neither the Complaints of the Souldiers, nor the Countries to riſe againſt him, for abuſing, or wronging of them, that ſerved and ſuffered till <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57903:13"/>the laſt, without deſerting; that never was a ſhame to his King, nor the cauſe he undertook by his deboiſt living or behaviour, that ſtrived as much to ſerve God, as he did to honour and ſerve his King. Theſe are brave Principles (you will ſay) to be found in Commanders, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: Such as never wiſht his Majeſty nor his Armies well: ſay, there were very few then, and appears as few now, but it is well known to them that were in the Armies of either ſide that there were many ſuch in all parts of his Majeſties Armies; there is many lies now in the Earth, whoſe Memories will never dye on Earth: Some dyed in the Field of Honour; others Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered for their Loyalty. I will name none, but let Truth and Equity Judge; and then their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in all parts where they were known, will ſound their Fame to thoſe that are now living, and ſtrives to imitate them, which is no diſgrace to a Souldier to be Religious as well as Valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; ſome of thoſe men (I mean) though not declared here, had been brought up in other parts beyond the Sea; before they had occaſion to ſhow their Valour and knowledge here in his Majeſties Service, and were not aſhamed to own they were Commanded, before they came to Command, and knew what belong'd to a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier from a Sentinel, to a General, and of good Birth; which if now living, would not deſpiſe Age and Poverty, in Old deſerving Souldiers, (and Officers formerly) as ſome do; and lookt upon as ſuch pittiful fellows, that deſerves more diſgrace or ſhame to be thrown upon them, for their Loyalty and good Service, then either Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57903:13"/>or Equity, to be done for them; as for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Two that are now in good Offices (which I ſhall not name) and are imploy'd about buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that lyes in diſpute, concerning the <hi>Loyal Indigent Officers;</hi> one of them was pleaſed to ſay, What a ſtir there was about a Company of Idle Fellows; let them go to Work for 3 pence a day: The other ſpoke more inveterate words, which (I ſhall wave relating here) I know not what they have been, nor what their parents were (though now got in good Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) ſuch words they ſpoke, ſavours more of the Seed of Rebellion than Loyalty; and like to have good proceedings from ſuch Agents, if they could bear ſway: How ſuch men ought to be honoured with preferment, I leave it to all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Gentlemen, that belongs to the Courts of <hi>England</hi> to Judge of it; they have neither Law nor Goſpel of their ſide to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to belch out that hatred they have in their hearts againſt Souldiers, and Gentlemen that had Eſtates, and could a liv'd well without Working, (being never bred to it) before Rebellion got the upperhand. <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt King that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was,

            <p>When the Souldier askt <hi>John Baptist</hi> what they ſhould do, he did not abhor them but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſht them: <hi>Do violence to no Man, neither Accuſe any falſey,</hi>

            <p>Blame me not to Declare to the World how much <hi>True Loyalty</hi> is look'd upon in <hi>Indigency?</hi> Not only by them that were our Enemies? but likewiſe thoſe that hath profeſt themſelves our Friends, and ſuch as hath ſerved his Majeſty faithfully (it may be too) only got the ſtart of us; being prefer'd, or provided for; have they but good Cloaths and Money in their pockets, they will either ſhun ye, or look on one ſide, and take no notice of you, or give you a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, with your ſervant Sir, ſcorn you for your Cloaths ſake, fearing you ſhould diſgrace them, or put them to charge with your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; being puft in heart, as much as in habit; forgetting what you were, having forgot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not minding what ſhifts they nor we have been Put too in the time of Rebellion, leaving our own Country, and Habitations; taking any honeſt Courſes to live in Remote Places, where they knew not what we had bin, rather then deſert the <hi>Cauſe</hi> we Fought for, or make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of our <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Loyalty,</hi> either to Serve or adheer to our Enemies.

I muſt confeſs tis this ſort of Idle, Vapouring, <hi>Counterfeit-Officers,</hi> hath made us all fare alike; and it is thoſe that makes ſuch a number, his Majeſty knows not who to provide for.</p>
            <p>This raiſeth the diſcontent that is amongſt us: takes upon them the Titles of Collonels, that c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nnot prove they had a real Command of a Troop or Company; and if put to the Tryal, <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57903:15"/>know not how to Decipline either. It is as ſtrange to hear of a Leiutenant Collonel now amongſt us, as it was to hear of a Leiutenant beyond Sea, that went over after the VVars was done here, (ſome Majors) Captains indeed good ſtore: That Title is ſo common, that if you can get but a good Suit of Cloaths, and Money in your Pocket, you ſhall Raiſe a Company, ſhall adopt you Captain in the firſt Tavern you come to; and Seal your <hi>Commiſſion</hi> with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Damnme's:</hi> And in a VVeek or Fortnight Ranting with you, conceit your ſelf you are a Real Captain indeed; when an <hi>Indigent</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is aſham'd to own himſelf what he hath been in his Deplorable Garb and Countenance. He that was a Real Officer, will take it as a Jeer to be Coxt with Titles of higher Honour then what he hath been. I know ſome (and others beſides my ſelf) that owns themſelves to be Collonels, Majors, and Captains, that if come to the Teſt, cannot prove themſelves any ſuch men formerly, if they prove themſelves any thing at all: Yet ſome of theſe hath took upon them to inſpect others, and would not be inſpected themſelves by thoſe that knew them. Theſe may ſay we are diſcontented People, if we be with them we can ſhew very good Reaſons for it. I muſt confeſs theſe are thoſe that hath been the cauſe that ſuch Odiams hath been caſt upon us, by their Deboiſtneſs, Swearing, Domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Drinking: Some that hath vapour'd more with their words, then ever they did with their Swords formerly in the Army: Telling what Fights they have been in, and what Acts <pb n="17" facs="tcp:57903:15"/>they have done (when none to contradict them) binding it with horrid Oaths.</p>
            <p>Some hold themſelves no Souldiers, till they can Graceleſly, (as a Grace to them) thunder out Bloody Oaths; Common Swearing maketh one apt to forſwear himſelf, which is a fearfull ſin, not left unreveng'd of God; in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the abuſe of Gods Name by horrible Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

'Tis that which has been caſt upon the Kings Party formerly, though ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many Officers, and as ſtrictly reprooved and puniſht by them in their Souldiers. VVell may a Souldier plead Priviledge to it, when he ſees his Officers makes a Cuſtom of it: How can Parents Correct their Children for thoſe ſins which they may ſay, they learn'd of them. I wiſh it were not ſo much uſ'd amongſt the <hi>Loyal Party</hi> as it is: They ſay, <hi>Oppreſſion will make a Wiſe Man mad;</hi> we have had Oppreſſion enough by our Enemies, and abuſed ſufficiently, by our pretended Friends. I count it not wiſdom to abuſe God in Swearing, and Curſing of them, in thinking to Revenge our ſelf thereby: For mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Deboyſtneſs, and Drinking, which is laid upon the Party. For my part I know there hath been them that hath walkt from Morning till Night, and could ſcarce meet with a Breakfaſt, or Mornings Draught; though they have met <pb n="18" facs="tcp:57903:16"/>with them that could a Reliev'd them with both, (ſome of our Truſtees) nor lend them a ſhilling if they had askt them, though they know how to pay themſelves, unleſs you would ſell your Lot or Part to them; then they would find Money: as wants hath made many done of late, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Imployments, Trades, nor Credit; having wearied all our Friends, and Relations, with promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, hoping we ſhall have ſome ways provided for us, to ſatisfie them, and Relieve us: There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us I believe if they had it, would not ſee one another want. Many times we meet and are glad we can make our ſelves merry with Melancholly and hopes together, more than our Purſes are able to do in Drink! We that had little or nothing left, when his Majeſty was returned, cannot have that plenty now, as to waſte it in ſuperfluities of Meat and Drink: We have made hard ſhifts for Food and Raiment, and been content with little Drink: But it is none but a never contented Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that ſays we are a diſcontented Party, and would have nothing done for none but themſelves, unleſs they have a part in it, that will caſt Aſpertions upon thoſe they thinks will declare the Truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; thinking that by that favour they have got, to throw all out of favour but themſelves; and thoſe that can flatter with them for fear, or ſelf-ends. I hope thoſe that can appear before his Majeſty, or whom he ſhall appoint, and make themſelves cleerly out, That they have been <hi>Truly Loyal Commiſſioned Officers,</hi> and ſuch as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves to be in the Liſt, Faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to his Majeſty, from the firſt to the laſt; and no ſuch perſons of Carriage nor Behaviour, as ſome <pb n="19" facs="tcp:57903:16"/>are pleaſed to Render them: But ſuch, as when Examin'd, ſhall be found as deſerving Men (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Commands they had) as thoſe that hath been pleaſed to Report us ſuch perſons, becauſe of our Poverty, and nothing done for us; then it will be found it is more their Malice, and Covetouſneſs, than any Religion, or fear of God they have in them; as ſhall appear between their Actions and ours, e're long, when the Truth is made known to thoſe that may have the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: which is the cauſe I have VVrite this Book. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To acknowledg what his Majeſties Care and Love hath been for us, in providing as we thought, a ſubſiſtance for us, if it had been manag'd according to the intentions of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the performing of it. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> To make it appear we are no ſuch diſcontented perſons, but content, If not abuſed. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How much hath been done for us, and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it hath come to; and long of thoſe that hath been intruſted in the Managing of it. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If his Majeſty be Graciouſly pleaſed to do any thing for us, we deſire to make it known we are ſuch Men as we Report our ſelves to be, <hi>Truly Loyal Commiſſioned Officers,</hi> having had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Commands according to our Titles; very <hi>Indigent</hi> many of us, and not provided for; which we ſhall leave it to God and his Majeſty, to look upon us according to our Loyalty, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: Knowing none will be offended, that Truly Fears GOD, and Honours the KING.</p>
