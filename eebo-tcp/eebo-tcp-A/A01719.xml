            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14397:7"/>
and turned againe to the Lord his God. For the holie Scripture doth teſtifie, that <hi>Solomon</hi> did marrie outlandiſh women, which were Idolaters, they drew away his heart, ſo that he ſinned, and fell grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly. He was reproued of God for it,<note place="margin">1. Kings. 11.</note> as we read, <hi>1.

               </p>
               <p>I know it will be replied by ſome, that the word of God doth not any where teſtifie, that <hi>Solomon</hi> euer repented, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his great fall, but leaueth it in doubt: and to proue his repentance by this one title, by which hee doeth name himſelfe, is but a weake reaſon. For, let the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the name be certaine, yet is it vncertaine, whether he wrote this booke after his fall. To this I anſwere, that he did write it after the long triall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which he had made in all things vnder the ſunne, and no doubt, after his fall. For, touching his repentance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

it be not ſaid any where, in theſe expreſſe words, <hi>Solomon</hi> repented: yet may it bée proued by neceſſarie conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence out of the ſcriptures, that he did vnfaynedly repent.</p>
               <p>I reaſon thus.

ſay was this, euen to inſtruct men how to come vnto the true bleſſedneſſe. A worthy worke, and moſt profitable vnto al that thirſt and long for ſaluation. The whole worke conſiſteth of two partes.

Thoſe that ſet their hearts vpon the riches, the honors, the pleaſures, and the wiſdome vnder the ſunne, to ſéeke any felicitie or good in them, are in a wrong way. From this he perſuadeth: then he ſetteth forth the right way vnto bleſſedneſſe, which is in the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and feare of God.

For this is his propoſition, in which he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and affirmeth that, which after ward he manifeſteth &amp; proueth by arguments.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14397:10"/>
this (as we all may ſée) with a moſt vehement outcrie, and as it were with the ſhril ſound of a Trumpet. The dul harte of man doth force him thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For we are all by nature ſo earthly minded, ſo drowned and ouer whelmed in the luſts and pleaſures of this world, and our eares ſo ſtopped with earth, that we can hardly be made to heare. Nay to ſay the truth, let him ſpeak neuer ſo lowd and ſhrill, to draw mens heartes from this world, except God worke by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and giue eares, hee ſpeaketh vnto ſtones. Ponder wel in your minds with earneſt meditation, the waight of this phraſe, <hi>Vanitie of vanities,</hi> and the ſame doubled with this addition, <hi>all is vanitie,</hi> and ſée if yee can comprehende what the ſpirit of God doth here vtter, concerning the extréeme vanitie of all things in this worlde, for to quench the flames of our mad loue towardes the ſame. For I had rather thus exhort men vnto ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his words, then to ſtand in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his pharſe and manner of ſpeach. Conſider therfore that he contenteth not
<pb facs="tcp:14397:11"/>
himſelfe, to ſay all is vaine, but vanitie it ſelfe, yea the vanitie of vanities.</p>
               <p>And ſeing our vnbeléefe is ſuch, that we can not giue credite vnto the worde of God, where it doth but affirme, and the ſpirite of truth doth thus farre yéeld vnto vs, as to make proofe by reaſons and argumentes of that which hee here vttereth, let not vs be wanting on our parts through careleſſe negligence, and ſo heape ſinne vpon ſinne, vnto our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condemnation. For the more graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly hee applieth himſelfe for to heale our ſoules, we (refuſing or neglecting this bountifulnes) the more we heape vp ingratitude, yea the more iuſt and heauie is our damnation.</p>

He doeth not expreſſe euerie part of the argument, but the aſſumption onely. For the principle vpon which hée groundeth, is ſo cléere, that there is no head ſo dull, but doeth acknowledge it:

and therefore is omitted. Neuertheleſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for your helpe I will note it. This it is, about whatſoeuer there is labour ſpent, yea ſuch labour as carieth with it griefe, (for he vſeth a word that ſignifieth labor with moleſtation) and no profite ariſeth thereof, there all is extreme vanitie and miſery. Who is (I ſay) ſuch a dullard, yea ſuch a blocke, that he will denie this, or call it into queſtion? aſke a foole, and he can ſay, it is vanitie to labour ſore and receiue no profite thereby: then if it be prooued, that man of all his ſore labour wherein he laboureth &amp; vexeth himſelfe vnder the Sunne, (that is in worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires) receiueth no profite: ſhall it not follow that all theſe things are vanitie, yea euen vanitie of vanities?</p>
               <p>Thus wée are to conſider of the whole reaſon: the firſt part, which is the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of this argument, ſore toile with vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and no profite, is vanitie. as I ſaid, is ſo cléere that the blind doo ſée it, none denie it: men doo alſo féele and find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that worldly things are gotten and kept with great labour, trouble and
<pb facs="tcp:14397:12"/>
moleſtation. What néede he then ſtay to make any declaration of that, vnleſſe he would light a candle at none? But the other point, namely that man hath no profite of all his labours &amp; vexations, is not beléeued, For would the whole world be ſo mad as to ſtand to fill a bottomleſſe tub? We ſée all the world is buſied to get earthly things, if there be no profit enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is no better then to fill a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe tub. Would men take ſuch paines to heape vp riches, to clime to honours, to fill and ſtuffe themſelues with delights &amp; pleaſures, yea euen to ſell their ſoules and bodies to the Diuell to come by the ſame, if they thought there were no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite remaining vnto them? It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of all doubt, that men doo make their reckoning and caſt their account, to receiue great commodities and fruite by their laboures: this then being not belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but called in queſtion, he doth ſtande to proue it, and this one point being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, all the argument ſtandeth firme and manifeſt. And howſoeuer it ſéemeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mans blind nature, that there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14397:12"/>
and commoditie to be looked for in the trauaile for earthly things: yet becauſe he proueth and manifeſteth by two nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſons that there is none, hée doeth ſhake it of as it were in ſcorne, and ſaith not, there is no profite, but what profite is there vnto man of all his ſore trauaile, wher in he trauaileth vnder the ſunne?</p>
               <p>He vſeth in déed diuers reaſons after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for to perſwade men in this point wherein they are ſo madly blinded, but I ſay two, becauſe in the words next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing hée vſeth two generall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the one taken from the eſtate and condition that man is in which trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: the other fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eſtate of the things in which, and for which he doth trauaile. O that men could be brought to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aright, that they might ſée how they labor without all profit for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, they would not vex the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues &amp; deſtroy their ſoules for to get nothing.

Why doe they make account that their miſerie is aſſwaged, and mitigated by theſe? Doubtles there is no cauſe but blindnes, yea intollerable and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blindnes: as they know not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſo haue they no eyes to ſée in what caſe all creatures vnder heauen be. For if men could be brought to ſée in déede, but what this is, all theſe things are weary, man cannot vtter it, they would ſtay, and turne back their eyes, and not ſo gréedely and egarly purſue, and lay holde of thoſe poore creatures, to ſeeke ſuccour at their handes. They would ſay, we are wrong, theſe are wearie themſelues, they cannot refreſh vs: theſe are féeble, weake, and tranſitorie, how ſhal they ſupport &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs? They be in bondage and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14397:25"/>
ſhall they reléeue vs? Shall wee lay holde vpon them, for to ſtay vpon them, they wil fayle vs. We follow but a blaſt of wind, and gape to fill our bellies with the Eaſt winde. We goe about to ioyne vanitie vnto vanitie: for we ſéeke help of thoſe which are in miſerie as déep as our ſelues. I ſay it is an extreme blindnes, which cauſeth men not to perceiue this.</p>
               <p>What then beloued? there is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination in vs to ſéeke reléefe and helpe.

               <p>In the wordes which follow vnto the 12. verſe, he doth ſet forth the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with an amplification: <hi>The eye is not ſatisfied with ſeing, neither is the eare filled with hearing.</hi> The minde of man can not ſatiſfie it ſelfe nor reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented when it hath laid hold of all things vnder heauen.

The eare is ſhallow and were quickly filled, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind which ſetteth theſe a worke, is inſatiable. If men were not ſtarke blind, might they not reaſon thus, when a man hath heaped vp all the treaſures of the earth, when his wiſdome is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and he hath attained vnto the top of all the honour vnder heauen, yet is not his mind ſatiſfied, he coueteth ſtill to ſée,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14397:26"/>
he coueteth to heare, he coueteth to haue.</p>
               <p>Is it not a manifeſt proofe that all things vnder the Sunne, beyng in that vaine and tranſitorie eſtate which they be, are not able to eaſe the miſerie of mans mind? the fulneſſe of ioyes is in<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.</note> Gods preſence alone, &amp; at his right hand there is comely pleaſure for euer more. What is then the reaſon that men do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ceaſe when they haue attained great things, &amp; yet féele no eaſe? Here is their fooliſh blindneſſe, they ſtill ſéeks for new things, they imagine that by a further and déeper reach, they ſhall finde ſome good.</p>
               <p>Here come in new deuiſes, new ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, new pleaſures, new workes, all new. He meeteth with this and ſheweth that there is nothing new vnder the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens. When they haue gone as farre as they can, yet ſhall not their eye come to ſée, nor their eare to heare any new thing. That (ſaith he) that hath béen, is the ſame that ſhal be, and that which is done, is the ſame that ſhal be doone, neither is there any thing new vnder the ſunne. Is there

               <p>Yea but men finde out thinges that be new. That is but our ignorance, for (ſaith he) there is no remembraunce of former things, alſo of things to come which ſhall be doone, there ſhall be no remembrance, with thoſe that ſhall be after. There be things which ſéeme new (I ſpeake of ſuch as men ſéeke felicitie in) but it is becauſe they are forgotten: ſo that the eye is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſatiſfied, looking for new things, the eare that doth hearken after them: and thus are men inſatiable, but all in vaine, for in their new things where they ſéek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>13 I gaue my heart to inquire, and make ſearch in wiſdome concerning al that is wrought vnder the heauens. This euill trauaile hath God geuen to the ſonnes of men, to occupie them therein.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> was king, &amp;c. In the former part of this Chapter we haue had two reaſons: the one drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man himſelfe, the other from the things about which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth, to proue that a man hath no pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fite, nor good at all, which remayneth of
<pb facs="tcp:14397:29"/>
all his ſore trauaile vnder the ſunne, and therefore all is vanitie of vanities.</p>
               <p>Now he procéedeth forward, to ſhew that he himſelfe made triall in all things vnder heauen, and found by full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect experience, that in déede, in all thoſe workes vnder the ſunne, wherein men doe ſéeke ſome good, there is nothing els but vanitie, miſerie, and vexation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. This his procéeding is a plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that the diſeaſe (I meane of ſetting our hearts vpon things tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) hath not onely taken déep roote in vs, but is alſo moſt peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and deadly. For, if it might eaſilie be cured, what néede ſhould there be of heaping vp all manner of proofs, and perſwaſions to draw away our hearts? And if it were not moſt dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, why ſhould there be ſuch care taken about it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> did know right well by the holy ſpirite of the Lorde which guyded him, that all which can be ſaid, is little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in this caſe: nay, the moſt are ſo bewitched, that it doeth not help them at all. But the proofe which is brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:14397:29"/>
one mans experience, may ſéeme to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer weake and ſlender to moue all men in the world: euen the Princes, the riche, the wiſe and valiant, and to perſwade them to ceaſe from ſéeking good vnder the ſunne, for what is one man to try out all things to the full?</p>
               <p>In déede leaſt we ſhould thinke thus, before hee come to note what triall hee made, and ſo deliuer vnto vs what hee found, and what can be found, he ſpeaketh ſomewhat of his owne perſon, what hee was, and of what ablenes, and diligence.</p>
               <p>If it be ſuch a man which ſetteth forth his owne experience, as was throughlie able to ſearch out euerie matter, and alſo did it, and that in ſuch ſort, as all the men in the world (if they woulde ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) cannot come nigh him, then may we be perſwaded by his experience. For, he is a foole that will thinke to finde that which he could not. Nowe in very déede, ſuch a one was <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, he was a king, as he ſaith, <hi>I Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes was king.</hi> If any in the world be able and fitte for this worke, they bée
<pb facs="tcp:14397:30"/>
kings. For they poſſeſſe the flower of all wherein there ſéemeth to bee any good. There can be no experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that which a man hath not. He was king ouer Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el in Ieruſalem. This Iſrael was Gods choſen people, which he had magnified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all nations vnder heauen, and this was the citie of the great king, euen Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</p>
               <p>Here is a king higher then all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings of the earth. This man is not idle, but geueth himſelfe to ſearch out the workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne, to ſee what was in them. Yea, but hee might finde naught in ſome, &amp; yet in other ſome there might bee that which he ſawe not. Let no ſuch thought riſe in your minde, for looke whatſoeuer is done, or that all Princes in the worlde are able for to do, yea, and all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whatſoeuer, he did ſearch it. For ſo he ſaith, that he gaue his heart to ſearche out all the workes which are wrought vnder heauen. Doe not thinke, that yee can light vppon any one thing worth the ſearch, which he hath not ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:14397:30"/>It may be further obiected, he that ſearcheth ſo many things, how can he doo them all well? To this he ſaith, that hee did ſearch by wiſdome. He was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for wiſdome guided him in euery part, God gaue him both wiſdome and honour, and riches aboue all earthly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures. He is a man euen made fitte of God himſelfe, to find out, and to tell vs what is in all the workes which are wrought vnder the Sunne. Let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue him: lette vs not follow the vayne fooles of the world which giue no credit vnto him, but ſéeke to find good where he could find none. He ſaith, it is an euill tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile which God hath giuen to the ſons of men to be occupied in. He ſaith alſo, he beheld all, and all is vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.</p>
               <p>Do men I pray ye beléeue this? Why doo they then ſet their whole heart night and day vpon things that be tranſitorie? They labour, but bring not any thing to paſſe worth their ſore trauaile: they be vexed and tormented in vaine, (God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in his iuſtice for ſinne laid this euill
<pb facs="tcp:14397:31"/>
trauaile vppon Adams children) for hée ſaith, that which is crooked ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be made ſtraight, and that which is wanting can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not be numbred. There is imbecillitie in mans workes, and that ſo great, that hée can not make that ſtraight which is croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: there is ſuch imperfection, that the wants and defects are infinit. If he looke vpon the creatures, if he looke vpon him ſelfe, or vpon the ſucceſſe and euent of matters, all is crooked, he toileth but can not reforme it in any.</p>
               <p>All the creatures are wearie, ſubiect vnto vanitie, and vnto the bondage of corruption, they grone and trauaile in paine. Man laboureth in them to builde and ſet vp ſome ſure worke, but it will not be: for they decay, alter, and periſh. He can by no means withſtand or reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die this crookednes: his ſkill &amp; his power doo vtterly faile him herein. Man him ſelfe is more crooked, his mind depraued, full of vtter blindneſſe, the paſſions &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections moſt vile and corrupt, the bodie baſe and ſubiect vnto all diſeaſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrances: yea both mind and body e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14397:31"/>
way in ſuch crookedneſſe as is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable. There is nothing ſtraight in him, all goeth crooked and peruerſe, hée worketh vpon himſelfe, and can make no part ſtraight. For all the humane Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and wiſdome vnder the heauens (if it were poſſible for one man to attaine and poſſeſſe it) is not able to giue him any ſparke of true light and knowledge of God, nor to clenſe or rid his ſoule from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one drop of that diueliſh poiſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is infected &amp; depraued. Wiſe men might well, and did ſéeme to haue made themſelues much ſtraighter then the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, but in very déed their crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe remained ſtill within.</p>
               <p>I ſpeake not of ſuch as are regenerate by Gods holy ſpirite, but of thoſe who were ledde onely by the light of nature. All their riches, their honour and power not able (they imploing their trauaile) to eaſe or recouer their bodies, to reſcue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the gout, or from an ague. The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of things is ſo croſſe and vnlucky, they foreſeing what they can, their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by which they take many times
<pb facs="tcp:14397:32"/>
the wrong courſe, mans ſkil being ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, doth cauſe ſuch infinite defectes, that <hi>Solomon</hi> beholding this in all the works wrought vnder the ſunne, he doth pronounce that all is vanitie &amp; vexation of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>How cléere is this, man hath ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, wantes, and errours in his workes as can not be numbred, all is crooked within him, without him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and he can make no one thing ſtraight: therfore all his labours are loſt, they be vaine, &amp; miſerable, carying with them ſo ſore affliction and vexation of the minde. Thus hath hée in generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, what he found in al the deuices, ſtudies, and workes, which are wrought vnder heauen.</p>
               <p>Now he procéedeth vnto particuler declaration: for hée goeth from point to point, ſhewing that in all the excellenteſt things vnder heauen, wherein there is any appéera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or hope of good to be found, there did he make ſearch. And he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin firſt of all with wiſedome: Becauſe in very déede, of all things tranſitorie, ſhe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14397:32"/>
is the flower. It is ſhe that maketh men to differre moſt one from another, and to excel.</p>
               <p>It falleth out oftentimes, that ſtarke fooles are riche, and in place of great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The bruite beaſtes doe enioy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſures, as wel as men: but neither beaſt nor foole can poſſeſſe wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but onely the wiſe man. If there be any true worthines, felicitie, excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or good to be found in the creatures vnder the ſunne, it is in wiſdome: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, I applyed my hart to know wiſdome.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, that wiſdome, (euen humane wiſdome of which he now ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) is high and déepe: who can ſearche into her treaſures? who ſhall finde, or be able to value what ſhe can affoord? Moſt true it is, that wiſdome is no eaſie thing to try. He muſt be no foole nor ſimple per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: but he muſt poſſeſſe her, and that in excéeding great meaſure, which will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne what her riches and pleaſures be.</p>
               <p>Marke therefore what hée ſaith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doeth tell that he applyed his hart
<pb facs="tcp:14397:33"/>
to know wiſdome. I ſaid in mine heart (ſaith he) behold, I haue magnified, and increaſed wiſdome aboue all that haue béen before me in Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Alſo, my hart hath ſéen much wiſdom and knowledge, becauſe God had indued him with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wiſdome and knowledge, than any man vnder heauen, he doeth gather ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that hee was the fitteſt for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He doeth encourage himſelfe, and maketh it knowen vnto all, that he was thus ſet forward. He ſearcheth not at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, he ſearcheth not in the darke, he hath his rule and his candle in his hand, euen the light and direction of wiſdome her ſelfe. The wiſeſt man vnder heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſearcheth out wiſdome: yea, I may ſay more, let the wiſdome of al the wiſe men in the world be laid together, it commeth ſhort of his.</p>
               <p>Some haue béene greatly wiſe in the courſe of the heauens, ſome in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of nature in all creatures here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, ſome ſubtile Logicians, ſome elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Orators to perſwade; ſome poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike in making lawes to gouerne Cities

and commonwealths. Others haue béen famous and renowmed for the ſkill of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noble ſciences, as euery mans heart led him: ſome to one, and ſome to another. In all theſe he hath ſurmounted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> far, if they were layde together. Hee ſawe more, he did know more, and coulde tell more then all they. He was in déede the wonder of the world. The Quéen of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba wondered at his wiſdome, vntil there was no ſpirite in her, <hi>1. Kings 10.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing<note place="margin">1.

Hée excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the fame that went of him. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, here is the man which muſt tell vs what good is to be found in all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſkill of this worlde. He did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in al manner of wiſdome, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gaue his heart to know her.</p>
               <p>Moreouer as he was wiſe, ſo he tooke a good and perfect way to make a full ſearch. It is expreſſed in theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> words, I gaue my hart to know wiſdome, and the knowledge of extreme madneſſe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable after gréeuous ſickneſſe, the pure white ſheweth the brighter, when it is ſet by the blacke: euen ſo wiſdome ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the greater glory, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> extreme mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and follie are ſet by her.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe <hi>Solomon</hi> (to the end he might behold this goodly lady wiſdome in her full beautie, and commoditie,) ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by her extreme madneſſe and follie. For together with the ſight of this euill fauoured and deformed bedlem, with all her inconueniences, the vew of wiſdome doth ſet her out moſt excellently. All her brightneſſe, all that ſhe hath to delight, or to benefit, are diſplayed. We may ſée then what ladde him to applie his hart to know extreme madneſſe, or all kindes of madneſſe, (for he vſeth the word in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14397:34"/>
plurall number) and fooliſhneſſe. It was not any loue that he bare vnto them, but to finde out the perfection of wiſedome through the knowledge of theſe. For by the vglines of madneſſe &amp; follie, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant countenance of wiſdome is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome and amiable. The harmes, the inconueniences, and miſchiefes which grow from thoſe, to the annoyance of all mad raging fooles: doo make knowen and manifeſt, what good, what treaſures and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities this wiſdome doth bring vnto him that doth poſſeſſe her.</p>
               <p>May we not thinke that <hi>Solomon</hi> did now beholde as it were an Angell in brightneſſe and glorie, which might fill the mind with conſolation &amp; happineſſe: but marke what hée pronounceth in the next words following: <hi>I know alſo that this is affliction of ſpirite.</hi> What can be more plaine? There is a ſhew of good to be attained by humane wiſdome, &amp; men are wonderfullie allured and drawen in hope thereof: but when it commeth to the proofe, they haue loſt all their labour, there is naught but a méere illuſion, the
<pb facs="tcp:14397:35"/>
good is vaniſhed. What doe they find in ſtéed thereof? Looke what he fonnd, euen affliction of ſpirite, ſhall they find any better.</p>
               <p>It may ſéeme very ſtrange &amp; abſurd, that this wiſdome, which hath alwaies beene ſo extolled, magnified, and honored of all nations in the world: ſo loued and imbraced of kings: ſo ſet forth and bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with all the iewels and ornaments that might be by the ſkilfull and learned of all ſortes, ſhould thus be abaſed, as to be made but an illuſion and a vaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, which in ſtéed of good ſo ſought and hoped for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth bring nothing but afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſpirit. The wiſe men of this world haue in all ages thought their labours aboundantly recompenſed by wiſdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> which had more then they all, pronounceth, that it hath nothing but affliction of ſpirite. How commeth ſuch contrarietie of iudgement? Doubtleſſe from their blindneſſe, they ſaw not that which he ſaw. Their eyes were daſeled with preſent glory and commodities: he beheld that it could not further a man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14397:35"/>
true bleſſedneſſe in the kingdome of God. He did behold the weakeneſſe and imperfection which is in it, being vnable to make that ſtraight which is crooked, eſpecially in the depraued heart of man. So then let all her fréends ſet her out to the vttermoſt of their ſkill, &amp; paint forth her prayſes in the freſheſt colours that they can: yet ſhall the ſentence of this one man preuaile againſt them. He did know her more perfectly then all they, he giueth the right ſentence, they are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. They ſay there is great good, he ſaith I know that this alſo is affliction of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And he rendreth a reaſon thus: for in <hi>the aboundance of wiſdome, there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of indignation, and he that increaſeth knowledge increaſeth ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that would be in felicitie, muſt not ſéeke it in ſorrowes and griefes of minde and bodie: but in things that are ſwéete and pleaſant. Happineſſe is in ioy &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, bitterneſſe and anguiſh are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie thereunto. Then muſt it néeds fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that all thoſe are deceiued vtterly,
<pb facs="tcp:14397:36"/>
which ſéeke felicitie in humane wiſdome. Becauſe the more wiſdome aboundeth, the more doth indignation abound (as he did féele) and he that increaſeth his ſkill, it is with ſore trauaile, and it is full of ſorowes. There may be many cauſes of trouble and diſturbance of the mind with indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where wiſdome doth abound. For he ſhall ſée that there is no end, but an infinite trouble, queſtion vpon que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will ariſe, the wants &amp; the aukneſſe of matters will torment.</p>
               <p>Againe, with what infinite trauaile and care of mind and bodie, is knowledge come by? how haue men ſtudied and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried themſelues all the daies of their life, to get knowledge? who is able to expreſſe the paines which the Philoſophers did take, and yet none of them able to excell in all, but in ſome péeces as their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons chiefly drew them. He that will be a perfect Logician, to haue the full vſe of naturall reaſon in perfect rules, it is not the worke of a few daies, nor yet of a few yeares. It muſt be with long trauaile, euen all his life, &amp; yet he ſhal come ſhort.

Coſmographers, in deſcribing all partes of this world, the heauens, the earth, and the things that be in them, haue no ſmall worke in hande. Come to theſe which ſearch to knowe the nature &amp; properties of all creatures, where ſhall they euer come to ſée towarde an ende of their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile? They be in a bottomleſſe ſea with out ſhoare. How muſt thoſe ſtudie, how many hiſtories, volumes, &amp; bookes, muſt they turne ouer, which will come to bée ſound Politikes, to be furniſhed for the gouernment of Cities and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales, and for the warres? Looke vnto all others which trauaile in any ſcience, and the paines of ſuch as will excell in déede, are wonderfull. Here is trauaile, here is care, here is indignation, here is wearines and gréefe vpon gréefe, here is no ende, here is no perfection attayned, here is no ſetling, or quieting of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde, all doeth vaniſh as ſmoke, there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no good at all.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſée the ſentence of the wiſe man himſelfe, concerning all the ſkil and knowledge vnder the ſunne. I knowe
<pb facs="tcp:14397:37"/>
fleſh and bloud will here riſe vp. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome will not ſuffer this diſgrace, but will pleade for her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Firſt it will be obiected, that this is a weak reaſon, there is no wiſdome attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto but with ſorrowes, therefore wiſdome is vanitie, and vexation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Men may goe through infinite la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and gréefes willingly, to enioy ſo precious a iewell. Their laboures are wel ſpent, they be fully recompenced. To haue the eſtimation and honor of a wiſe man, is no ſmall benefite. Knowledge filleth the minde with delight, ſo that it forgetteth the ſorowes ſuſtayned in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayling.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that there are no labours, nor ſorrowes ſuſtained for true felicity, which can any thing impaire the ſame, the ioy of that will ſurmount them all: it is moſt happie labour that is ſo ſpent.

               <p>This will ſome ſay is nothing to the purpoſe, theſe were Heathen men whom ye haue named, they knew not God. A man may haue al this glory, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of heauen alſo, as many haue had.

beléeue which ſéeke glorie one of another, and ſéeke not the glorie which commeth of God alone? Whereby it is manifeſt, that ſuch as ſet their hearts to ſéeke the honour that is of men, be Infidels. The godly men, as king <hi>Dauid</hi> and others which had the glorie of this world, made it not their delight and glorie, but gloried in the Lord. Yet it will be ſaid, that this doctrine is abſurd: For is not wiſdome and knowledge in the noble Artes and Sciences, the gift of God? are they not helpes then, and furtherances to approch néerer vnto God, and vnto true glorie? I anſwere that they be good giftes of God, &amp; where the corrupt nature of man doth not hinder, they be helps vnto higher and better things.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not diſpute what this wiſdome is in it ſelfe, but whether a man can attaine any true felicitie by it? Which he denieth, for though it benefit a man for the preſent, as touching worldly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, yet it is no true good becauſe it is tranſitorie &amp; doth vaniſh.

this is more abſurde then the former, namely, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that euen humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is Gods gift, a thing therefore good and commendable, and withal to affirme that it doth not bring men néerer vnto God, but caſteth them further back. Can a good thing be the cauſe of euill? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: that a good thing cannot be blamed iuſtly to be the cauſe of euill. We doe not affirme that the knowledge and ſkill of all that is vnder the Sunne, is in it ſelfe the cauſe that menne are caried further from God, but mans corrupt nature is the cauſe which dooth peruert &amp; abuſe it, as it doth the beſt things of all vnto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. As for example, the law is good,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> the commandement is holy, iuſt, &amp; pure, ſaith the Apoſtle. And yet it is called the miniſtrie of condemnation, the letter that<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.</note> killeth, and the ſtrength of ſinne. Is that which is holy and ordeined for life, made<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> ſinne, or the cauſe of ſinne, or death? Looke how the Apoſtle anſwereth, <hi>Rom. 7.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> Sinne doth take occaſion, and worketh all manner of concupiſcence by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14397:41"/>It tooke occaſion by the law, and ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me, and ſiue me. Yea, he ſheweth that ſinne through the law doth become out of meaſure ſinfull. And what ſhall wee ſay further, doth not the vile nature of man abuſe the grace of God it ſelf? Why doth the Apoſtle ſay, ſhall we continue in ſin that grace may abound? God forbid. <hi>Ro. 6.</hi> Why doth he giue this admonition,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> brethren ye are called vnto libertie, only make not your libertie an occaſion to the fleſh. <hi>Gal. 5.</hi> but that there is ſo vile cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in men by nature, as that they will make the leſſe regard of committing ſinne, becauſe ſinnes are fréely pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the bloud of Chriſt. Shall wée then maruaile that the wiſdome of this world, though in it ſelf good, doo not bring men néerer vnto God, but carrie them further from him. Yet how will ſome man ſay?</p>
               <p>Firſt thus, the more a man is lifted vp in pride, &amp; doth glorie in him ſelfe, the further he is remooued from God. For God abhorreth the proude, and beholdeth him a farre of, yea he doth ſet himſelfe

               <p>Here will great diſpleaſure be taken. For will ſome wiſe men ſay, this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine doth tend to the deſtruction of all the noble ſciences: for who will take the paines if he may not haue the honour? Nay to heare that they doo carrie a man further from God. It will alſo be the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of commonwelths. For where ſhall become our wiſe politikes, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant warriours? If honour be brought into contempt, then farewell al. We ſhal
<pb facs="tcp:14397:42"/>
haue none but fooles and cowardes. Will men aduenture their liues if it were not for glorie wil they ſtudie if they may not haue praiſe? Is not this ſuch a miſchiefe as is intollerable? I anſwere, that in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie déed, to ouerthrow common-wealths, or to deſtroy noble ſciences, is a miſchiefe intollerable. But to ſay that it will be ſo, vnleſſe men may ſéeke the praiſe and glory of the world, is a reaſon not good among chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Among Turkes or Heathen where there is no other thing to lead them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it might well be allowed: among vs it is to be accounted as flat Atheiſme: we are to ſéeke the glory of God, and not vaine glorie. I may reaſon thus: If a Pagan would take ſuch paines in ſtudie, for ſkill &amp; wiſdome, &amp; adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture his life in the wars for the glorie and praiſe of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. How much more ought a chriſtian man, to do the like to glorifie &amp; ſerue his God? God ſaith he will honour thoſe which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour<note place="margin">1.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Said in my heart, goe to now, I will powre foorth with mirth, therefore take thou pleaſure in that that is pleaſant. But behold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, this is vanitie.</p>
                     <p>2 I ſaid of laughter, it is mad, and of mirth, what is it that ſhe doeth?</p>
                     <p>3 I ſought in my minde to draw out my fleſh in wine, and leading my heart in wiſdome, and to take holde of follie, vntill I ſawe whether this be the good to the ſonnes of men, which they are to doe vnder the heauens, the number of the dayes of their life.</p>
                     <p>4 I made my works great, I built me houſes, I planted me vineyardes.</p>
                     <p>5 I made me gardens, and orchardes,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14397:44"/>
in which I planted trees of all manner of fruite.</p>
                     <p>6 I made me ciſterns of water, to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therewith the wood, ſpringing vp with trees.</p>
                     <p>7 I gate me menſeruants, and maide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruants, and had children borne in the houſe: alſo, I had poſſeſsion of cattle, &amp; flockes, great aboue all that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me in Ieruſalem.</p>
                     <p>8 I heaped vp for me alſo ſiluer and golde, and the peculiar of kings, and of the prouinces: I gate me men ſingers, and women ſingers, the delightes of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men, all manner of harmony.</p>
                     <p>9 And I was great, and increaſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all that were before me in Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: alſo, my wiſdome did abide with me.</p>
                     <p>10 And whatſoeuer mine eyes deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I withhelde it not from them, I kept not back my hart from any ioy, but my heart reioyced ouer all my labour, and this was my portion of all my trauel.</p>
                     <p>11 I looked then vnto al the workes which my hands had wrought, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <p>12 Then I turned to beholde wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and extreme madnes and follie, for, what ſhall the man doe that ſhal fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the king? euen that which is done alreadie.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Saide in my heart, goe to now, &amp;c.</hi> We haue alreadie ſéene in the former Chapter, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> firſt of all, ſearched out wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14397:45"/>
and found no good therein, but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes. Now therfore, he turneth to ſéek elſwhere. And firſt vnto pleſures, which he ſtaieth not in, but by and by deteſteth. And ſo he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to a third courſe, which is this. He mixed wiſdome and pleaſures together. But he doeth conclude, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he found in this way ſome good in both, yet not ſuch, but that he ſawe all to be vanitie, and vexation of ſpirit. For the good be founde, is but for the preſent time.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to his words for that former, he ſtirreth vp himſelfe vnto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and pleaſures, to ſée whether ther be in them the felicitie that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall haue vnder the heauens. And to the ende wée may vnderſtande that he ſearched euen to the bottome of al pleaſures &amp; delights, he vſeth a ſpéech to expreſſe the ſame as vehemently as might be. For hee doeth not ſay, I wil geue my ſelfe to pleaſure, which might be done with ſome modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo he ſhoulde not ſearch déepe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: but he ſaith, <hi>I will powre foorth with pleaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that is, he wil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wholy giue
<pb facs="tcp:14397:46"/>
ouer, or power foorth himſelf, or his hart vnto pleaſure. And ſo he willeth his hart (euen as it were letting loſe al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raines) to take pleaſure in that which is pleſant. This is very néedefull to be conſidered, becauſe our nature is addicted vnto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and pleaſures, and men do greatly couet them, imagining that there is feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie in them, they be ſo ſwéete vnto the fleſh.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Solomon</hi> had but taſted, or vſed moderation in pleaſures, we might haue ſaid, what can he tel how great good there is to be found in delights? But when hée poured foorth, and gaue ouer him ſelfe whollie (for the time) vnto them, what doubt remayneth, or can remaine? He was a great king, wanting nought, but hauing at wil and commandement what he would for all lawfull delights. No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther king in the world able to doe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like. He put foorth himſelfe, &amp; did what might be done. And now hauing proued, marke what he ſaith: <hi>Beholde, this alſo is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſtayeth not here, in pronouneing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14397:46"/>
all carnall delights and pleaſures to bée vanitie, but ſheweth alſo, that he did eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ldath them with contempt and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of laughter, it is mad, and of mirth, what doeth ſhe?</hi> Being marueylous wiſe, it gréeued him excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to be carried ſo farre awrie, and out of the way, as to be made a foole, a mad man, or a beaſt. Nowe he ſaw that pleaſures, (which he vnderſtandeth by laughter) doe in déede make thoſe euen brutiſh, and mad fooles, which are geuen ouer vnto them. That is the cauſe why he ſaith laughter is mad, which is not to be vnderſtoode only what it is in it ſelfe, but what it maketh men. It carieth men which are poured foorth thereunto, euen to the forgetfulnes of God, and to que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch all light of true vnderſtanding in them. Thus then he reaſoneth: felicity, or good, is not to be ſought in that which maketh a man forget God, quencheth the light of reaſon, turneth him into a beaſt, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him mad. But carnall pleaſures do all theſe, when a man doeth poure foorth
<pb facs="tcp:14397:47"/>
him ſelfe vnto them, therefore they are to be deſpiſed, abhorred, and reiected.</p>
               <p>A wiſe man may wel ſay of mirth as he doeth: what doeth ſhe? as if it ſhould be ſaid, ſhe doeth marre at, leadeth cleane awry, and leaueth no good. In this point there is little credite giuen, or like to bée giuen vnto <hi>Solomon.</hi> For almoſt the whole world doth giue ouer it ſelfe vnto vaine mirth and pleaſures. There is ſuch a ſwéetneſſe in them vnto the fleſh, that ye ſhall ſcarce find the tenth man, among noble or baſe, which doth not thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe euen after a ſort happie, if he may inioy euen the ſcumme or dregges of them.</p>
               <p>I ſpeake thus, becauſe in compariſon of <hi>Solomons</hi> pleaſant delights, all the pleaſures which the common ſort of men attaine vnto, are but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the ſcumme. And what is the cauſe that we can not beléeue him, but doo ſtill follow after car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall pleaſures, as gréedily as euer hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry fiſhes doo catch at the bait? Surely this is the cauſe, men are fooles, and ſo it gréeueth them not to be made beaſtes or
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14397:47"/>
madde men, as it gréeued him being wiſe. Is this the way to happineſſe? O miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable blindnes. Men are now (as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtle prophecied, they ſhould be in the laſt daies) louers of pleaſures, more then louers of God. <hi>2. Timoth. 3.</hi> Let vs<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> take héed of it, ſeing it is but a vaine illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and no more but as the dreame of a ſick man. He dreameth that he ſéeth plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſights, &amp; heareth goodly ſongs which delight him, but when he awaketh, he is in his bed full of paine: pleaſures for the time carrie men on as happie, but in the end they ſhall find they were deluded.</p>
               <p>I may here reaſon by compariſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſort: If lawfull mirth or that which is indifferent in it ſelfe, doo make men to become madde and baſe minded, when they be giuen ouer thereunto, not kéeping moderation, for power forth thy ſelfe and thou ſhalt become madde, how much more ſhall filthie and vnlawfull, or impure delights make them brutiſh? for we muſt not thinke that king <hi>Solomon</hi> did poure foorth himſelfe vnto vncleane mirth: but vnto ſuch pleaſures as are
<pb facs="tcp:14397:48"/>
déemed honeſt. And they that are carried away with theſe become madde, and baſe minded, their felicitie being all one with the beaſts. Then wée know not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto for to like<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe which make a ſport of ſinne, and ſport themſelues with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe. Some of them delight in pride, painting forth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by all the waies and meanes which they can, that they may ſéeme goodly in the eyes of men. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers follow gluttonie and drunkennes, cramming and ſtuffing their bellies like ſwine. Others ſolace the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp; vncleannes, theſe be their ſwéet delights. <hi>Solomon</hi> did not giue himſelfe to ſuch pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Theſe be more then madde, for they drinke in poiſon only becauſe it is ſwéet, euen the moſt peſtilent and deadly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and bane, both of ſoule &amp; body: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, the foole maketh a ſporte of ſinne. <hi>Moſes</hi> is commended for great wiſdome, <hi>Hebr. 11.</hi> When he did refuſe<note place="margin">Hebr 11.</note> to be called the ſonne of <hi>Pharoes</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, chooſing rather to ſuffer afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the people of God, then to inioy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14397:48"/>
of ſinne for a ſeaſon, eſtéeming the rebuke of Chriſt greater riches, then the<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> treaſures of Egipt. I would all kings, princes, nobles, &amp; great men of the earth, did know that which king <hi>Solomon</hi> doth teach in this place. Yea I would all men did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider it a right. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould we not haue the deuiſers of vaine delights ſo much made of, wée ſhould not haue ſo much coſt &amp; ſo much time ſpent in vaine mirth.</p>
               <p>I will now procéede vnto that which doth follow, beyng the third ſearch that he made to find good. He ſaith he tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to dra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>we forth his fleſh in wine (that is to my ſwéete delights and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures) for wine being one of the chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licates, is as a parte vſed for the whole. But he would doe this (as he ſaith) lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his hart in wiſdome and taking hold of follie. That is he will ioyne wiſdome and delights together. The ſtudie of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did carrie with it as much increaſe of indignation and ſorrow, as of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo the more knowledge, the more ſorrow, and being tranſitorie how ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:14397:49"/>
it bring felicitie or good, yea euen for the time preſent? felicity, as was ſaid before, is a ſwéete thing, it is not in griefes and vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. To come then vnto pleaſures, there may be felicitie in them, for they are ſwéete &amp; delicate, they bring delight. He powreth forth his heart vnto them, they make him madde. If felicitie be to be found in brutiſh madneſſe, they can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford it.</p>
               <p>Whether ſhall he ſéeke now, he hath failed in theſe two former? he doth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take a third courſe, and doth make a mixture, and ioyne them both together. The pleaſures &amp; delights ſhall aſſwage, and delay the ſorrowes which goe with the increaſe of wiſdome: and ſo the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of them ſhall not be felt. Againe, wiſdome ſhall be as a bridle to moderate the pleaſures, to auoid the fooliſh madnes, which other wiſe they doo bring. So that now he goeth about to prooue what is in theſe, when both thoſe former euils are ſalued. He will neither be beſotted, or made abrutiſh foole by the one, neither tormented by ſorrowes with the other.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14397:49"/>
Here ye ſée a moſt excellent wiſe way, and in déede as we ſhall ſée afterward, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good that is to be found is in this courſe.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, that he, ioyning them thus together, the one might be an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to the other. For either his abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant wiſdome would not ſuffer him to take pleaſure (filling him full of moroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) or elſe his great pleaſures could not but carrie him awrie from wiſdomes lore: therefore marke what he ſaith, for in déed neither of them hindred the other. His pleaſures ſhould be to the full, and wheras he profeſſeth, for he would draw out or continue his fleſh in wine, that is in delights. He would alſo lead his heart in wiſdome, and take hold of follie, then pleaſure ſhall not make him madde: wée haue ſéene before why this is added, that hée would take hold of follie.</p>
               <p>And ſo here he doth let vs vnderſtand, that in both theſe together he waded déep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea moſt déepely, vntill (as he ſaith) he might ſée whether this be the good that the ſonnes of men are to inioy vnder the heauens, the number of the daies of their
<pb facs="tcp:14397:50"/>
life, whether a man may find good vnder the heauens in wiſedome, and delights mixed together?</p>
               <p>Thus hauing declared the purpoſe of his minde, he ſheweth how he did prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the ſame. For looke what ſerued for honour, for royaltie, and magnificence, he ſet it vp. Nothing was omitted which might miniſter comfort and ioy, in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and honeſt delightes. Wiſdome alſo ſhewed her ſelfe euery where in all his labours. For, according to the power of a king, and the ſame the greateſt in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, riches, and wiſdome vnder heauen, he made his workes great and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. He did builde faire and ſtately Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, goodly houſes, none ſuch (in euerie reſpect) to be ſéene in the world. He plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vineyardes, he made him gardens &amp; orchards, in which he planted al manner of fruitful trees, euen of all the beſt fruits that could be gotten in the earth. Into theſe the pleaſant ſwéet ſtreams of freſh waters, were deuided by conductes, or pipes, into ciſterns, for to water the trées and plants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:14397:50"/>He had (as he ſaith) great riches, aboue all that were before him in Ieruſalem, He had a great familie, of men ſeruants, maidſeruants, and children born of them in the houſe. He had ſtore of cattle, as, of ſhéepe and oxen. He heaped vp golde and ſiluer, &amp;. the peculiar treaſures of kinges, and of the prouinces: euen ſuch treaſures as none but kings and potentates are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to poſſeſſe, for the great price of them.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, he had the ſwéeteſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodie that might be: for he had men ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſingers, and (as he ſaith) the delights of the children of men, all maner of muſicall harmonie: which is tranſlated in our engliſh bible, a woman taken captiue, &amp; women taken captiues. The words be <hi>Schiddah,</hi> and <hi>Schiddoth</hi> Now, <hi>Schadad</hi> is to ſpoyl, and lay waſt, but here it is vnfitly taken in that ſence, of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or women take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> captiues. He ſpake of men ſingers, and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſingers, and then no doubt hee addeth the muſike of the inſtrumentes, which was vſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their voice. And to note that
<pb facs="tcp:14397:51"/>
he had not common muſike, he ſaith, <hi>the delights of the children of men,</hi> harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and harmonies: as much as to ſay, all maner of harmonie, and noyſes of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſike, the ſwéeteſt inſtruments that might be, being ioyned together. And the words which he vſeth, doo very fitly expreſſe the matter, becauſe in the harmonie of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſike, many diuers ſoundes meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are (as it were) waſted eache of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and doe make all one tune. And ſo he calleth it <hi>Schiddah,</hi> and <hi>Schiddoth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we may ſee, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnder the heauens, either beutifull vnto the eye, ſweete and pleaſant to the taſte, or delight ſome vnto the eare, but he had it. And for the ſame purpoſe he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth more then once, <hi>I was great, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed aboue all that were before mee in Ieruſalem.</hi> But doeth he (as he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) inioy pleaſures, and yet lead his hart in wiſdome, for that is the thing he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to vndertake. He affirmeth that he did. His delights did not carie him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fooliſh madnes, for he ſaith, <hi>verſe 10. yet my wiſdom did abide ſtill with mee.</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:14397:51"/>
But did not his wiſdome withholde him from taking ſolace? In no wiſe, for hee ſaith, <hi>All that mine eyes deſired, I kept not back from them, I witheld not my hart from any ioy.</hi> Behold then, as hee purpoſed, ſo doeth he bring to paſſe. Hée ioyneth wiſdome and delights together. Mirth and laughter ſhall not make him mad. He wil not ſo forget himſelfe, to be caried with ſenſualitie and voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as to be made a beaſt. His wiſdome did ſtill continue with him, and guide his heart.</p>
               <p>Againe, he did not vexe himſelfe with indignation and ſorow, for the multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of knowledge, and ſo withdrawe him ſelfe from pleaſures. For, whatſoeuer his eye deſired, whatſoeuer his heart wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for in any lawfull mirth, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to haue what he would, he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the ſame.</p>
               <p>Sée then how he was lifted vp tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching all the excellent thinges vnder the ſunne. He did flow, and ſwim in wealth, in pleaſures, in honour, and wiſdome. He had al that hart can wiſh. If theſe things
<pb facs="tcp:14397:52"/>
be able to reléeue, or to eaſe mans miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he is happie by them. He wanteth not, nor is not ſcanted. Let all kings and princes now looke vpon him, and harken what he ſaith, for he commeth now to tel what he found in all theſe.</p>
               <p>He confeſſeth in déede, that in this way he receiued commoditie. And firſt touching the delights, that he withhelde not his heart from any ioy. He ſaith it was his portion of all his labour. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doeth vs to witte, that there is no more to be had but for a temporall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. He is to haue but his part, and then when he hath lefte all behinde, another doeth take his part: and ſo along ſtil from one to another. There is no man which will maintayne, that after death any one is the better ſor the delights which he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in. For the preſent time there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, being vſed in ſuch ſort, as that they doe not quench the light of the mind, and drowne it in ſecuritie, and other filthie ſinnes. For God hath geuen men y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vſe of his creatures, not onely for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, but alſo for delight and pleaſure.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14397:52"/>
As he hath appointed that we ſhall labor and trauaile, ſo alſo we are to take parte of our labors, it is our portion vnder the ſunne. But withall wee muſt obſerue, that when he ſaith, <hi>this is my portion of all my labor,</hi> he doeth ſpeake as of a ſmal thing, and not to be wayed or eſtéemed as the chéefe and principal matter which man is to ſéek. For it is as if he had ſaid, my labors are great, I haue no more for my portion but delight and pleaſure for the time.</p>
               <p>For when hee doeth well way what this portion is, he maketh it nothing. He had as much ioy and pleaſure as could be had in all earthly creatures: and doeth he ſay, <hi>Haue I no more for my portion but this?</hi> Doeth he make ſo light of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? There be multitudes, which if they could come but vnto the tenth part of his glorie, riches, and pleaſures, woulde not ſet ſo light by them. They would thinke their labours wel beſtowed, and take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues very happie men, if they might but ſwil themſelues in the dregs of thoſe pleaſures which he did ſwim in. If ſome
<pb facs="tcp:14397:53"/>
man had but one of his goodly houſes, it would cauſe him to looke aloft.</p>
               <p>It ſheweth that this noble king had a farre better ſight, to diſcerne and iudge of theſe earthly thinges, then men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly haue. For the world is blinde, and countes it gaine to liue deliciouſly for a ſeaſon. He ſaith in the next words, <hi>I loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto all my works which my hands had done, and vnto the labour which I had trauailed for to doe, and behold, all is vanitie, and vexation of ſpirite, and there is no profite vnder the ſunne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then we ſée, his portion was not ſuch, but that all ſtil was vanitie. A worthie thing to be conſidered of all men, that hée could enioy to the ful the good which is to be found in all things vnder heauen, and yet ſée ſo cléer that all is vanitie, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſpirite, and no profite at all. For he dooth now ſpeake of ſome profit which remayneth. Then we might ſée by him, that if we had our portion in all the beſt things vnder the ſunne, yet it ſhall not make vs one iotte the néerer vnto happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: yet fooliſh people wilſay, he hath all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14397:53"/>
things at will, he is happie.</p>
               <p>Let vs here make compariſon. The great magnificall workes of king <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> with all his royaltie, and glory, and pleaſures, are vanitie, and vexation of ſpirite. What is then to be thought of the workes of meaner perſons, yea, let it bée euen of kings? Their works are not com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parable vnto his. All his haue vaniſhed, and ſhall not theirs? He founde no good, and ſhall they finde any? Behold then, a man ſet vp in the height and toppe of all excellencie for this world, who alſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made ſearch euery way to the full, to finde good, doeth proclaime, and cry out aloud vnto all other whom he beholdeth from aloft, ſtriuing below, and labouring themſelues euen out of breath, to clime vp vnto him, that they doe but loſe their labour, and wearie themſelues in vaine. For when they haue gotten euen to the higheſt degrée of wealth, of dignitie, and pleaſures, they ſhall finde naught but méere vanitie. There is no credite geuen vnto this, which ſheweth, that the worldlings are too too ſhamefully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted
<pb facs="tcp:14397:54"/>
and be witched, for they labour as earneſtly to clime aloft in the worlde, as if the fulnes of ioy and felicitie were therby to be attained. They haue nothing the like care to ſéeke the kingdome of God, where in déed alone is the true bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes. They ſpill both bodie and ſoule, to come by that which can doe them no good at all. They builde their houſes in bloud, in craft and deceite, with briberie, extortion, yea with all maner of vniuſt dealing, haue they increaſed their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>If they coulde riſe vp as lawfully as <hi>Solomon,</hi> it were much néerer, yet all vanitie. What is their miſerie then, which they haue doubled by their wicked couetouſnes, and ambition? If they looke to goe beyonde <hi>Solomon,</hi> they be madde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If they looke to be equall with him, they be fooles, they ſhall neuer come nigh him by many degrées. If they thinke to find good, then it muſt be in the ſcraps, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he could neuer finde, but denieth it to be in the full furniture of the table.</p>
               <p>This might ſtay our courſe when we
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14397:54"/>
runne ſo gréedily and ambiciouſly after the world. If we had the grace and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome but to be thinke vs, that we are told by one which hath proued that all is but labour loſt. We run fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God whom we ſhould ſéeke and ſtay vpon: and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after that which can not helpe vs at all. We leane vpon a broken ſtaffe and ſtay vpon a réed. If God giue vs riches and honor, vſe them to his glorie, account of them as things tranſitorie. We muſt ſet our hearts vpon better things. If I could be equall with <hi>Solomon</hi> in glorie and royaltie, I perceiue by him it were nought worth. Why ſhould I depriue my ſelf of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioies of heauen, by a likerouſnes of that which is vtterly vaine? I can not ſerue God and Mammon. I can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in this world, and delight in God alſo. He that doth but deſire to be rich falleth into many noyſome luſtes, which drowne men in deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and perdition.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> I will firſt, as I am commaunded, ſéeke the kingdome of God, and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I will not labour for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meat which periſheth, but for the meate which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb facs="tcp:14397:55"/>
vnto eternall life. Vnto this I ſay we be admoniſhed.</p>
               <p>Then to conclude this point, I wiſh that kings, princes, nobles, rich men, and all other would take the vew of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> workes: his ſtately palaces, his pleaſant gardens, and orchyards, his gold and ſiluer, with al his honors &amp; delights: and with all marke wel and beléeue that he ſaith, <hi>all is vanitie and vexation of ſpirite, there is no profit vnder the ſun.</hi> This would doo them much good: they ſhould not be drowned and ſwalowed vp in earthly cares and pleaſures. Now he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the other part. <hi>I turned</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to behold wiſdome, and madneſſe, and follie.</hi> It may be demaunded, did he not behold wiſdome before, comparing her with madneſſe and follie, why doeth he then now turne to behold her againe? He did behold wiſdome before, and did ſearch her out by her ſelfe, &amp; found much indignation and ſorrow. Now he doeth behold what commoditie he receiued by her beyng mixed with delights, ſhe gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his hart, through pleaſures. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14397:55"/>
he ſpeaketh of euery thing ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, before he doo procéede any further, he preuenteth an obiection, for it might be ſaid, who is <hi>Solomon</hi> that we ſhould ſtand to his ſentence, is his experience ſo perfect aboue all others?</p>
               <p>To this he maketh anſwere, what ſhall the man doo which ſhall follow the king? that is, which will ſearch out mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which he hath ſearched. And he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, euen that which they haue doone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie. But the phraſe of the Hebrew tongue doth beare to ſay, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is doone already. As if he ſhould ſay, let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man what ſoeuer he be vnder heauen, take vpon him to follow me, and to make triall in any one thing, he ſhall not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond me, he ſhal doo no more then I haue already doone. When he ſaith who is the man, it is to ſhewe that he is not to be found. All kings, princes, rich and wiſe men in the earth ioyning together can not match him. God made him euen for the purpoſe, ſuch as hée neuer made any before nor after him.</p>
               <p>Then I ſaw (ſaith he) that there is
<pb facs="tcp:14397:56"/>
profit in wiſdome, more then in follie: as there is profit in light more then in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The wiſe mans eyes are in his head, but the foole walketh in the darke. He ſhewed before that to take delight in his trauaile (his hart beyng guided in wiſdome) had ſome commoditie in it, but yet all vanitie, it was but his portion for the preſent time. So now he declareth that he did alſo find profit in wiſdome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus tempered, neuertheleſſe all is but vanitie, as he ſheweth by reaſons.</p>
               <p>But firſt ſée, how he doth lay open the commoditie of wiſdome aboue follie, by a compariſon. It is ſo much more benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and good, as the light is aboue the darkeneſſe: compare then theſe two, the light and the darkneſſe, and ye haue the difference of the other. It is not in euery mans power to match wiſdome and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie together, for how ſhall men iudge of that which they know not, nor neuer ſaw? they are acquainted with follie, but wiſdome is hid from them. For this cauſe he giueth a rule which is common. All men can tell what profit there is in light
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14397:56"/>
aboue darkneſſe. And hee ſheweth that thereby wee may take a iuſt meaſure what profit there is in wiſdome more then in follie, when he ſaith it is as in the light aboue the darkeneſſe, Well then let vs hold vs to the rule, which he giueth to take the true meaſure and to ſcanne this matter withall: becauſe there is no man that poſſeſſeth wiſdome: but ſome hath one péece, and ſome an other more then the common ſort.</p>
               <p>But we inioy the light and are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thereof eftſoones by the darke: this is common to the foole and to the wiſe. He that walketh in the light doth not ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for it ſheweth him his way. He that goeth in the darke knoweth not whether he goeth, he ſteppeth into the ditch. The light is comfortable, and ſheweth vnto a man many chéerefull and delightſome things. Darkeneſſe is dolefull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, couering the bewtie of all goodly things, when a man is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of them. By the light men ſée to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their worke and doo it well: In the darke they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doo nothing but marre that
<pb facs="tcp:14397:57"/>
they take in hand.</p>
               <p>We ſée that the eyes are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light of the bodie, they be placed aboue in the head as in a watch to wer, and ſo behold round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and a farre of. If there be any good to be gotten they ſhew where the way lieth toward it. If any daunger approch, they tell how to ſhunne and auoid the ſame. To this he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth the wiſdome of the wiſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, the wiſe mans eyes are in his head, but he likeneth a foole to a blind man: the foole (ſaith he) doth walke in darkneſſe. Then we may ſée his minde is this, a wiſe man touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matters of this world (for he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth here but of the worldly wiſdome, which can ſée no iotte beyond worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires) hath his ſkill and knowledge for a light, euen, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies be in a mans head.</p>
               <p>The benefit hereof is ſuch, that it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth all his waies. He doth eſchew dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, miſchiefs, inconueniences, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hurtfull thing. He procureth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on all ſides. He hath delight &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the worke of his hands. The foole is blind, &amp; if he haue not one which hath
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14397:57"/>
eies to lead him, falleth into the ditch on euery ſide: he daſheth his head againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery poſt: he wrappeth himſelfe among buſhes and briers, and is rent and torne: If he ſtruggle out, he is neuer the néere, becauſe he is by and by in new dangers. Thus we may ſée what is the proſite of wiſdome aboue follie. Let vs note here then firſt, that <hi>Solomon</hi> doeth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne humane wiſdome, but commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it as a thing profitable, when it is rightly vſed, as conteyning it ſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of worldly matters. For when ſhe medleth with heauenly &amp; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall thinges, ſhe is aboue her reach, ſhée doth ſteppe out of her owne ſhop: though ſhe be as a cléere eye for this preſent world, yet for heauenly things ſhée is ſtarke blinde, and a very madde bedlem, condemning the wiſdome of God &amp; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> myſteries to be follie, becauſe they agrée not with her.</p>
               <p>Let vs alſo marke in this place, that it is little maruaile, though the wiſe men of this world make wonderfull account of their wiſdome: they take pleaſure in
<pb facs="tcp:14397:58"/>
the commodities which they reape there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. They laugh ſlilie to ſée others in the briers and plagued through their follie. But this is aboue their ſkill, and herein they erre, that when a man for to kéepe a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> falleth into da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers &amp; miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in this world, they iudge him a foole. Al their wiſdom is to kéep this world, the loſſe of it they eſtéem madnes. It is far of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wiſdome of fleſh &amp; bloud to teach a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to deny himſelf, to renounce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, and to take vp his croſſe. And this is the only way vnto true bleſſedneſſe.</p>

               <p>Moreouer, we muſt beware that wée doo not miſunderſtand <hi>Solomon</hi> in this place, when he doth ſpeake of wiſdome, comparing her to the light, &amp; to the eies in the head. We may not iudge that hée doth ſpeake this of craft and ſubtiltie, but of ſuch knowledge as is good in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſelfe, and in the right vſe doth bring commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: now a daies, though there-be fewe wiſe men (for it is attained with great &amp; long trauaile) yet there be many that thinke themſelues wiſe, and are offended if men doo not ſo déeme them. When as in déede the greateſt part of their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, doth reſt in a naughtie diſſembling craftines and falſhood. They haue no ſkil in good ſciences, and yet becauſe they can
<pb facs="tcp:14397:59"/>
with ſubtill ſhiftes and very couſening tricks ouer reach other, they glory much, and take themſelues to be the onely poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes of the world. Theſe men are none of thoſe of whom he ſpeaketh, when he ſaith, <hi>the wiſe mans eyes are in his head,</hi> this kind of ſkill is gotten without ſore trauaile and ſorrow. It is an eaſie thing for mans corrupt nature to put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe this diueliſh art: who can not faine, lie, and diſſemble?</p>

For ſome are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſay, that he which will liue in theſe dayes, muſt diſſemble, and vſe craft For priuate affaires, and for publike bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines in gouernment of commonwelths, if a man do not vſe craft, if he do not fain and diſſemble, he ſhalbe made a foole, hée muſt ſtudie with ſubtiltie to repell ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie, and ſo faſhion himſelfe to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the world.</p>
               <p>Alas, is wiſdome become ſo weake, that ſhe cannot defende her ſelfe againſt falſhode? Certainly, there is no falſe pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the worlde, but wiſdome is able both to eſpie it, and to incounter it. Make a difference therefore (my brethren) bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe ſortes of men. Count not the wiſdome of this world to be fraude and guile. No; it is ſimple and plaine, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is but the abuſe thereof.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know alſo, &amp;c.</hi> In the former part of this Chapter, wée haue ſéene how hee ſearched for good in pleaſures and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:14397:62"/>
and in all excellent and magnificall workes, which ſerued for either of them. We haue alſo heard what profit he found this way.</p>
               <p>Now commeth he to ſhew by reaſons why yet all is vanitie, and firſt for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. It hath profite in it aboue follie, as much as the light hath aboue darkeneſſe: but yet there remayneth no good by it. For the light of the ſunne which we doe now enioy, doeth ſerue but for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vſe. For when death commeth, and the eyes be cloaſed vp, what good remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, can it make a man happie? Euen ſo is it with humane wiſdome, it doeth a man much good for a little time: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, as the blind man, and he which hath his eyes, are made alike: ſo the wiſe and the fool méete together, and are made equall in one condition. For that reaſon he bringeth, <hi>I knowe alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that one condition befalleth to them all.</hi> If all the wiſdome vnder the ſunne can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce the poſſeſſor thereof no more, but that he muſt méete in the ſelfe ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with the foole, yea euen with the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14397:62"/>
moſt dullarde which liueth, what profite doeth remaine?</p>
               <p>Sée I pray you, how hee reaſoned in himſelfe about this poynt, <hi>I ſaide in my heart, it befalleth to me as it befalleth to the foole, why then doe I labour to bee more wiſe? I ſaid in my heart, that this alſo is vanitie.</hi> What a goodly gifte was this: yea, what a grace of god in him, that he could in his mind haue this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it came not from the wiſdom of fleſh and bloud, for that doeth blinde men, and puffe them vp in a vaine opinion. They imagine themſelues to be petie Gods in compariſon of the ſimple meane people. It doeth not enter into them to ſay in their heart, what good ſhall all my wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doe me? The fool ſhalbe in the ſame condition, the ſame ſhall befall vnto mée, which befalleth vnto him. Shal I glory in that which cannot exalt me one ſteppe aboue the pooreſt, the ſimpleſt, and vileſt foole?</p>
               <p>To what end ſhould Ilabour ſo much to abound in wiſdome? It is méere vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſéeing no good commeth thereby. It is
<pb facs="tcp:14397:63"/>
the beſt way for me to ſéek for that which will ſtick by me, and aduaunce me vnto glorie perpetuall. This wiſdome peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, and all the glorie of it doeth vaniſh in a moment. I ſay, if men had the grace to reaſon thus with <hi>Solomon,</hi> it were a goodly matter. Some wil replie here, and ſay, that the wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaueth a fame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and is renowmed for euer, and therein his condition is not all one with the foole. True it is in déede, that many wiſe men leaue a fame behind them, and ſome fewe leaue in record ſuch teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their ſkill, that their praiſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth.</p>
               <p>But alas it is ſo poore a remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and ſo vaine a thing, that he ſaith, there is no remembrance of the wiſe, and of the foole for euer: in the daies that ſhal come all that is now ſhall be forgotten. Thus we ſée the wiſe man and the foole wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vnder one couerlet, ouer whelmed in obliuion. <hi>Solomon</hi> beholding this in his mind, louing and fauoring wiſdome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe very wiſe, and deſpiſing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, he crieth out with great diſdaine, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14397:63"/>
ſaith, how dieth the wiſe with the foole? Whatſoeuer aduantage he hath in his life time, at his death he is made euen with the foole.</p>
               <p>It may be obiected, that if this be a ſufficient reaſon to prooue that wiſdome is vanitie, becauſe the wiſe dieth as the foole: then the ſame reaſon may hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the true, heauenly, and ſpirituall wiſdom. For the true knowledge of God, and his feare doo not ſo priueledge any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that he dieth as others doo. What hath the godly man at his death more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wicked? I anſwere, that here is the difference: the wiſe man for this world hath had all that he can haue by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. It for ſaketh him when death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. There remaine no matters in the world that is to come, wherein he may imploy his ſkill, or haue any vſe of his knowledge. Thus doth his wiſdome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and come to an end at his death.</p>
               <p>On the contrarie, then beginneth the fruit &amp; commoditie of the heauenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome when a man dieth. For the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God which is here but in part,
<pb facs="tcp:14397:64"/>
ſhall be perfected in the life to come, and ſhall neuer vaniſh. That man ſhall reap endleſſe fruit by his wiſdome. Out ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for his departure from this world, he differeth not from the foole, but with God there is a great difference. Hauing told vs how he reaſoned in himſelfe about the wiſe man &amp; the foole, thus by death made equall, now hée vttereth what effect it wrought in him. <hi>I hated life</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the worke that is done vnder the funne ſeemed euill vnto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this manner of ſpéech, he declareth a wonderful miſliking which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in his minde of the ſtate of this preſent life: partly for that the wiſe and the foole end a like, and it befalleth to the one, as it befalleth to the other, and they doo méete together in an equall condition, and partly for that which followeth in this chapter. He taketh ſuch diſpleaſure, that it ſhould be all one with the foole as with him, that he is wearie of his life, yea he hateth this life. For all the worke that is wrought vnder the ſunne, ſéemed euill vnto him, becauſe al is vanitie, and vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14397:64"/>
of the ſpirit. A notable place to teach vs whence it commeth that men can ſo well away with this preſent life.</p>
               <p>If they were not fooles and blinde, if they had wiſdome to diſcuſſe, as he deeth here, though they had all his glory and riches, they ſhould abhorre this life and be diſcontented with it. Such as be in trouble and vexation, preſſed with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie and other grieuances can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to depart: but how grieuous is the remembrance of death vnto ſuch as haue aboundance and liue in pleaſures? If they be wiſe in this their loue of preſent life, if they be right, <hi>Solomon</hi> was a foole, &amp; went wrong out of the way, for he is of a contrarie minde. He ſaw the vanitie of this life to be ſuch, that he hated life.</p>
               <p>It may be demaunded whether he did well in this, that he ſaith he hated life: for life in it ſelfe is a precious thing, it is Gods gift, for which we are to giue him great thankes: and how ſhould he ſay he hated life? We muſt not take it that hée hated life it ſelfe, but the things which are annexed vnto it: as vanitie, vexation
<pb facs="tcp:14397:65"/>
of ſpirite and miſerie. Theſe are inſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably annexed vnto this preſent life, and therfore he nameth the life it ſelfe, which he can not inioy without theſe. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith likewiſe <hi>Iohn. 12.</hi> he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.</note> his life in this world ſhall looſe it, and he that hateth his life, ſhall kéepe it vnto eternal life. Tuſh wil ſome thinke, <hi>Solomon</hi> was ouer wiſe, his wiſdome made him full of moroſitie, it did hinder him.</p>
               <p>If I had but the one halfe, or a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yea the hundreth part of that which he had, I would liue merily, I would I might liue vntil I hated my life, or were wearie of it. To ſuch men I ſay, if he were ouer wiſe, they come as far ſhort. He had not ſo much, but they haue as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. It were well for theſe Epicures, if they had ſome hundreth part of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, with the like portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe things which he poſſeſſed: which becauſe they want, they are like vnto the oxe which is fed in ſwéete paſture, he is wanton &amp; kic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp his héeles, there is no thought of the butchers ax. Theſe looke for no iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14397:65"/>
to come. Set this before your eyes, labour not to finde a pleaſant life here: But rather learne of this king in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of all aboundance to meditate, to ſearch out the vanitie of all theſe things, and ſo to draw our harts from them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this preſent eſtate doo miſtike vs, we can not ſigh &amp; grone for a better. Which thoſe do that haue receiued the firſt fruits of the ſpirite, as wee are taught <hi>Rom. 8.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> Let not deceiuéable things blind our eies Whoſoeuer he be that doeth not miſtike this preſent eſtate, yea hate life, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of eternall life, he ſhall neuer taſt of the ioyes of heauen.</p>
               <p>Thus he hath concluded touching wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Now he commeth vnto thoſe his great workes, which ſerued for honour &amp; pleaſure. He had his portion in them for the time: but he doth ſhewe by reaſons that there was nothing in them but fore and extreme vanitie: theſe be his words. I hated alſo all my labour in which I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour vnder the ſunne. As he hated life, ſo he hated all his labour, and why? becauſe he muſt leaue it vnto an other man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14397:66"/>It may ſéeme that in this he went too farre: for ſhould that grieue him: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth teach men to loue their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and poſteritie, and ſo to prouide for them as for their owne bowels. That maketh men trauaile ſo willingly to get poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they may conuey vnto their children, and beyng done with equitie &amp; moderation is a thing very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Is <hi>Solomon</hi> then become vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that it grieueth him becauſe he hath laboured for his ſonne? For he ſaith, I hated all my labour, in which I laboured vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhall leaue it to the man that ſhall be after mée. Wée may not take it ſo. For doubtleſſe he had naturall affection &amp; loue to his children. But here is his griefe, and this is that which doth ſtick ſo nigh him, and cauſeth him to hate his labour, that hée can not tell whether the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom he ſhal make his heire and leaue all his workes vnto, will proue wiſe or a foole. He muſt haue all, though hée be a foole. He muſt rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all his labours wherein he hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured and ſhewed wiſedome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:14397:66"/>This is the vanitie. Here is the ſore and griefe. He ſhewed excéeding great wiſdome in all his workes, he delighted in wiſdome, he diſdained follie: and now can he not tell whether all his workes wrought in wiſdome, ſhall come into the hands of a foole. And in déed his ſonne <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi> did not proue very wiſe, when he forſooke the counſell of the old men, and followed the counſell of the yoong men. And when he forſoke the way of <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; <hi>Solomon,</hi> (that is, the way of the Lord) and ſet vp Idolatrie, and falſe worſhip. <hi>2. Chro. 11.</hi> It is a thing which<note place="margin">2. Chr. 11.</note> commeth vſually to paſſe among men: that the father is wiſe, and the ſonne a foole. But let it be that a man perceiueth his ſonne, (vnto whom he ſhall commit ouer all his good and poſſeſſions) is wiſe, yet he doth not know what his ſonne or his ſonnes ſonne ſhal be. For it doth fall but that certaine generations are wiſe in their worldly affaires, and doo increaſe their ſubſtance: &amp; after riſeth vp a foole, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:14397:67"/>
to the next heire, when he ſaith, I ſhall leaue it to the man that ſhall be after me: and who doth know whether he ſhall be wiſe, or a foole?</p>
               <p>Marke one thing then in this place. If thoſe works which are wrought wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, haue no certaintie in the heires which ſuccéede, but may come into the handes of a foole? and doo very often: what ſhall we ſay of thoſe houſes and landes which are gotten vniuſtly, and by hard dealing: as by couetouſnes, by extortion, by bryberie, by deceipt, and violence? He doeth not meane that ſuch men as come by their goods ſo naughtily, doo ſhe we themſelues wiſe in their laboures, for wiſdome is with vprightnes and truth. What mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile is it then, though ſuch poſſeſſions do come to naught, for by the iuſt iudgement of God they come into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of fooles? couetouſe ambitious fooles gat them, and prodigall riotous fooles doe ſpend them. Yea, but we ſée ſuch goods and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtand as firme (to mans thinking) as the earth, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueied from heire to heire, for hundreths of yéeres in continuance.</p>
               <p>

It is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle prolonging of time, but it paſſeth as a ſhadow. Their houſes, their memoriall, and their glory periſheth. If we did liue but a thouſand yeares we ſhould ſée much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this point. We liue thrée ſcore and ten, and in this we ſée ſomewhat.

               <p>By this the Lord doth teach vs, what ſhal be the end of thoſe other, which ſéeme to ſtand as faſt as the mountaines, and to endure all ſtormes and tempeſtes which do ariſe? thus might we ſee what the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable gréedineſſe of man commeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Man walketh (ſaith the Prophete in the <hi>Pſalme</hi>) in a ſhadow, he diſquieteth him ſelfe in vaine: he heapeth vp riches and can not tell who ſhall gather them, for oftentimes it falleth out that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riches which he hath heaped vp, come not onely into the handes of a foole, but of a foole
<pb facs="tcp:14397:68"/>
which is not of his kindred.</p>
               <p>Shall we then ſo hate all labour as to giue it ouer, is that <hi>Solomons</hi> purpoſe? No, in no wiſe. It is not his meaning, that a man ſhould not trauaile for his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, becauſe his ſonne may proue a foole. But he would not haue men ſo to labour, and ſo to ſet their harts as vpon a matter of value. Labour in ſuch ſort as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that which is vaine and tranſitorie, ſeruing but for preſent neceſſitie. Iudge and eſtéeme theſe worldly things to bée moſt vaine and vncertaine: let them not hinder better things. Labour &amp; poſſeſſe, but yet as though ye poſſeſſed not. <hi>1.

But yet ſée and know that all your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures are ſubiect vnto vanitie. And ſo may yée come to that which hée ſaith, <hi>I hated all my labour.</hi> Set your delight and loue vpon the labour for the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and true treaſure: lift vp your minds to ſéeke heauen and heauenly things.</p>
               <p>Wel, he goeth yet a ſtep further, and ſaith, <hi>Therefore I turned away, to make

my heart to be without hope,</hi> or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, <hi>concerning all my trauaile vnder the ſunne:</hi> for ſo he ſpeaketh. This tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away, is the turning away of his minde, &amp; affection from his workes. For, to the ende he might ſearch duely, bee ſet his delight for a time vpon them. Now, to draw away the ſame more forciblie, he cauſeth his heart to deſpaire, or to haue no hope to receiue any good in all his ſore trauaile, wherein he trauailed vnder the ſunne.</p>
               <p>Here is an example for all wiſe men to follow, euen by déepe meditation, and a full inſight into thinges, to perſwade their hearts by ſound reaſons, that they may neuer hope for any good to remaine of their worldly trauails. For if men did this, they could not be ſo blinded with a vaine hope, and caried away, as if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities were incomparable which they ſhal reap by their labors. Men are blind herein by nature, and the deuil doth blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde them: he wil not let them ſée that which made <hi>Solomon</hi> turne away, and make his heart deſpaire of his laboures.
<pb facs="tcp:14397:69"/>
And to ſée what are other mens workes in compariſon of his. Hee doeth (as it were) fiſh in the maine ſea, and they in little ditches. If his nets come vp emty, how then?</p>
               <p>Touching this matter he hath hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſpoken of himſelfe, now he doeth am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie it by a kinde of compariſon. It is taken from the meaner ſort of men, there is none of them, but if he haue laboured in wiſdome, knowledge and equitie, but it may gréeue him, that he muſt leaue it to another man which hath not trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therein, for his portion. This he ſaith is vanitie, and a great euill. For by this it commeth to paſſe, that one man tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth, and another receiueth all the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fite and commoditie. The father, to make his ſonne rich, ſo turmoyleth and pyneth himſelfe, that he hath no pleaſure of his life: the ſonne, when he is a father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doeth the like for his childe, and ſo euerie one defraudeth himſelfe.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14397:69"/>
how hee ioyneth gréefe with mans tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle. For he addeth in the next words, that <hi>all his daies are ſorrowes, and his trauaile greefe, his heart alſo reſteth not in the night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He doeth in few wordes paynt out a miſerable condition of ſuch as be world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and gréedie of gaine. A couetous man hath tortures and ſorowes ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in him. They cannot gather riches, and kéep them, but with ſorrowes and gréefs. Yea all times, &amp; continually, for he ſaith, <hi>all their daies are ſorowes.</hi> It agréeth with that which I alledged out of Saint <hi>Paul 1. Tim. 6.</hi> when he ſaith, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> of money is the roote of all euill: which while ſome haue luſted after, they haue erred from the faith, and pearced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues through with many ſorowes. But this which he addeth laſt, goeth beyonde all, that the heart doeth not lie downe, or reſt in the night. The night is made for reſt, when men haue on the day time tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uailed and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wearied themſelues, the body cannot endure without reſt. Now when that is laid down, the heart or mind doth
<pb facs="tcp:14397:70"/>
not lie downe, but walketh about all the night long.</p>
               <p>It is the chéef part of man, but in this reſpect, in worſe caſe then the bodie, that it walketh al about, and taketh no reſt in the night. In the day time it is buſied, and ſetteth the body a worke: if the bodie could holde out, it would alſo, and neuer reſt: but it cannot, and therefore in the night the heart doeth wander, and folowe the buſines alone.</p>
               <p>Here is great inſtruction for couetous ambitious worldlings, if they might haue their eies opened: certainly they be ſtark foles which couet to be rich. If they were not blinde as ſtones, they muſt néedes féele that which he vttereth here, &amp; haue theſe thoughts in themſelues. I deſire, and I labour to gather riches, all my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are full of gréefes and ſorowes. I haue ſuch hindrances and loſſes, &amp; méete with ſo many croſſe matters, that it vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and diſquieth my heart. I haue ſuch care to increaſe and kéepe that which I haue, that my hart reſteth not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night. I haue ſo many enemies, and that great
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14397:70"/>
men, which lie in wayte to pluck me. I am to buy a péece of lande, for which I muſt diſburſe a great deale of money, if I loſe it, I am euen halfe vndone: If the title ſhould not be good, or if my euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces ſhould be made vnſkilfullie, there is ſuch craftie dealing in the world, that I ſhalbe ſure to loſe it. This troubleth my minde day and night, I cannot ſléepe quietly, I labour all the day, euen while my bones ake. When night commeth I am afraide of théeues. For, my cattle, my corne, or my money lyeth in danger. My heart, when I lie in my bed, is either vpon my goods in the fields, or deuiſing where I may light vpon ſome good bargaine. I haue light vpon euil creditors, and crafty dealing felowes, I am afraide I ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come by mine owne. But why doe I goe about to reckon vp all particulars, a man were almoſt as good take vpon him to number the ſtars. My ſorrowes and cares are infinite. I dreame of théeues, I am troubled in my ſléepe with this and that buſines. I perceiue that my hart ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lieth downe, neuer taketh any reſt,
<pb facs="tcp:14397:71"/>
but when my bodie is a ſléepe, that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth about. In the morning (my body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refreſhed) I am carried abroad again ſo long as I am able to indure. My ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes doe laſt continuallie, and haue no ende, I am a night-walker, what ſhal I get? When I haue laboured, and heaped vp all that I can, another which hath not trauayled therein muſt haue my portion. I haue dealt wiſely to get riches, which I leaue behinde me in great plentie. It may be they ſhal come into the handes of a foole, which will ſcatter them abroade. What a wretched foole am I, thus to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente and diſquiet my ſelfe in vaine? Gréefe, and care, and ſorrowes, &amp; toyle night and day, and no good remaine. I wiſh it from the very bottom of my hart, and I doe inſtantly begge it of God, that mens eyes might be opened, to ſée cléere in this poynt, &amp; that they would déepely meditate vpon this doctrine. For I doe not hope to ſée any great fruite of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſo long as men be ſo gréedie of this world. Ye ſhall ſée hote profeſſors of gods word, both of prechers and people, which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14397:71"/>
in fewe yeres ſetting their heartes vpon riches, become colde inough.</p>
               <p>Alas, it is not poſſible they ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue vpright, vnleſſe we will imagine that the ſcripture is not true, which ſaith, Ye cannot ſerue God and riches.</p>
               <p>And here again geue me leaue to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a little by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon. King <hi>Solomon</hi> hated life, hated all his workes, turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his heart, to make it deſpaire of his trauaile, in the middeſt of riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor lawfullie gotten, crieth out that all is vanitie, ſorowes, and gréefes, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall vexation of minde, and no good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth. What ſhal we thinke then of ſuch as get their goods vnlawfully? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie doe ſcrape, and catch on all ſides, ſo they may lay holde, they care not how, whether it be by violence or by fraude. Yea they pluck it eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the poore and néedie, from the fatherles &amp; from the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, for ſuch wretched men there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in theſe daies.</p>
               <p>Now, beſide all ſuch miſeries and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes as he hath ſpoken of, accurſed are ſuch riches, yea, the heauie curſe of God
<pb facs="tcp:14397:72"/>
hangeth ouer thoſe men, which clime to wealth and honour that way. For ſake it people, forſake it, &amp; deale vprightly eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man with his neighbor. If ye haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houſe or land y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> commeth not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, or any goods euill gotten, reſtore all to the true owners. Wilt thou appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy iudge, or dareſt thou come into his preſence to holde vp giltie handes? Wilt thou damne thine owne ſoule for a little worldly wealth? For, how wilt thou eſcape damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if thou haſt hidden ſtolne gooddes among thy ſtuffe? If thou haſt not repented, how wilt thou be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? If thou reſerue that which thou knoweſt to bee none of thine, how dooſt thou repent?</p>
               <p>At this I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but wonder, how men dare (when they die) make gifte to their children of euill gotten goods? I doe not maruaile to ſee men deceiue and defraude one another while they liue. The nature of man is ſo licouriſh of gaine, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill leadeth men on in a forgetfulneſſe, that they ſhal euer be brought to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reckoning. Againe, they be ſo afraide
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14397:72"/>
that they ſhall want to ſerue their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities before they die. But when they lie ſicke, and can ſée no remedie but death, knowing they muſt come to iudgement, and would faine be ſaued, and therefore doo crie for mercie: I ſaie it is verie ſtrange, that they will then depart, and carrie the ſtolen goods before the iudge, and damne their owne ſoules. For many a one doth remember euen at that time, this ſame houſe, or ſuch a péece of land is none of mine. My father gatte it, and held it vnlawfullie in my knowledge, it is ſuch a mans, if he had his right.</p>
               <p>I remember I did deceiue many, and oppreſſed them: I haue hindred them for to enrich my ſelfe. I haue taken vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gaine: I haue griped the poore that ſold for néed, I haue ſold them hard peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthes. Well God haue mercie vpon mée, I will not reſtore it, I will giue it to mine heire. How horrible is the eſtate of theſe men? How wretched are they which grow great and féede vpon brybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? it is beſt to kéepe thy hands vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from one penie of wrong gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goods:
<pb facs="tcp:14397:73"/>
but if thou haſt dealt vniuſtly, repent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it, &amp; leaue it not behind thée among thy ſubſtance, when thou goeſt to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the iudge will ſend to thy tent and fetch it, and lay it before thée: thou ſhalt be found guiltie, and not able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. Thus I conclude then, there is no good remaineth to a man of al his works wherein he hath dealt wiſely &amp; vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though his goods ſo gotten be manie &amp; his honour great, yet after al his ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full daies he muſt forgoe all, an other muſt haue that which he hath trauailed in: thoſe goods and honours euill gotten are much worſe.</p>
               <p>Vpon occaſion of theſe former reaſons he doth repeat againe, what is all the good which a man can haue of his laboures: that is to eat and drinke, and to delight his ſoule with the profit of al his labour. He ſaith before in this chapter, that hée withheld his heart from no ioy, and that was his portion of all his labour. He had nothing elſe. And now he telleth that it is al, which any man can haue by his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. For by eating and drinking, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14397:73"/>
delighting his ſoule, he meaneth all the vſe of mans works, and of his riches. Let a man take part of them while he liueth, and vſe them in ſuch ſort, as that his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and dexations may be mitigated. We may not take it that he ſtirreth men vp here vnto exceſſe, vnto gluttonie and drunkenneſſe, or to become belligods and Epicures. Neither is it his mind to ſhew here what the fleſh iudgeth: for the next words doo ſhew that he ſpeaketh of a good thing. For elſe how ſhould it be ſaid, I law that this is of the hand of God? it is Gods gift vnto a man, when he can eat and drinke, and delight his ſoule with the good of his trauaile.</p>
               <p>Yee haue ſéene before how he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned eating and drinking, and pleaſures, when a man doth power forth him ſelfe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> riotouſly: they make men mad, &amp; to become beaſts. But God hath made &amp; ordeined many things not only to ſerue neceſſitie, but alſo for pleaſure &amp; delight of his children, which they be to vſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately and wiſely. They differ much from the carnal man. For he doth delight
<pb facs="tcp:14397:74"/>
his ſoule in eating and drinking, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God, and drowned in theſe things. But they ſolace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> themſelues ſo in theſe thinges, that their hartes delight is not drawen from God. For they beholde his bleſſing, fauour and good will in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of which they take their part: And this in déed is of the hand of God. The delight which the Epicure hath in filling his belly, is nothing beyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with this. It is but as the beaſts doo. God muſt be our delight, we may not delight in the creatures further then thus, that he hath giuen them vs as our portion here. Wée reioyce in the Lord, when wée reioyce in them ſo.</p>
               <p>The other ſort are far from this. For they doo delight themſelues, and imagine that they take their part, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, but if the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of God come in the way, all is marred: their pleaſure is in vanities and ſinnes. Do but ſpeake of death, of the day of iudgement, or of Gods diſpleaſure againſt ſinners, &amp; they take it euill, and be angrie. They ſay it is no time nor place to ſpeak of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14397:74"/>
they came to be merie. Kuffians and riotous beaſts ſolace themſelues and are merie, but yet it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not nigh this gift of God. This is in no mans power, but where the giuer doth beſtow it.</p>
               <p>Some man hath great plentie, and doeth grudge at his owne bellie, this man is miſerable couetous, if clay would nouriſh him, he would eate it to ſpare his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: yea, he would eat worſe for need.</p>
               <p>Another hath aboundance, and ſaith to his ſoul, eate, drinke, and be merrie, thou haſt goods inough laide vp for many yeres. Why doeth not this man right? He is couetous, and ſtayeth vpon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he delighteth in them. Read the 12. Chapter of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and there ye ſhall ſée how our Souiour ſetteth him out, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe his barnes, &amp; building grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>This then is Gods gift, with peace of conſcience with ioy in God, for a man to take his part, and to delight himſelfe in his labours. This is not in euery man which hath riches. For if a man ſtay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, their torment is neuer ended,
<pb facs="tcp:14397:75"/>
they can neuer be ſatiſfied. For, when he hath all, his ſtay is doubtfull and therfore he ſéeketh to heap vp ſtill, ſuppoſing that in greater aboundance he ſhall quiet his minde. O ſaith one, if I had but two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth pounds of good land, by the yeare, I would be fully contented. It falleth out that hee hath two &amp; two, and as his goods are increaſed, ſo is his minde more grupple. He is leſſe ſatiſfied then, when he was poore. Let vs ſtay vpon God, and vſe that he geueth with a chereful mind. The worldlings doe reioyce, but it is a madde ioy: for there be ſtinges within in their conſcience, which doe marre their mirth. Euen in laughter the heart is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, and the end of that mirth is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines,<note place="margin">Prou. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Pro. 14.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, how coulde <hi>Solomon</hi> tell this? he might know his own heart, but coulde hée iudge of other men? To this he maketh anſwere: Who could eat, and who could haſt vnto outward things more then I? As if he ſhould ſay, I know there is no man vnder heauen, which can of him ſelfe, or by any gifte of nature
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14397:75"/>
that is in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eate and drink, and delight his heart in his labour, for if any man were able, it was my ſelfe: but I coulde not, therefore I am ſure no other coulde, vnleſſe it were geuen him of God, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by a worke of grace. I was rich, I was in honor, I had wiſdome aboue all other, I had as little to care for as any, and yet could not I doe this without a ſpeciall gift and grace of God.</p>
               <p>The next verſe doeth more cléerly lay open this matter, by expreſſing the cauſe on both ſides. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the man that is good in his ſight, God geueth wiſdome, knowledge, and ioy: but to the ſinner he geueth paine, to gather &amp; to heape vp, to geue to him that is good before God.</hi> The Lord is gratious and bountifull vnto whome it pleaſeth him. The man that findeth fauour in his ſight, or vpon whom he ſetteth his heart, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth from him all bleſſings. For vnto him he geueth wiſdome, and knowledge, and ioy.</p>
               <p>He ſpeaketh not here of the worldlie wiſdom and knowledge, of which he ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:14397:76"/>
before, <hi>in the multitude of wiſdome is much indignation, and he that increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow.</hi> For we ſee, that the wiſdome and knowledge whereof he ſpeaketh here, haue ioy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying them. This is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of holy things, the feare of God, the truſt, &amp; delight in him. From hence dooth ſpring the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of this preſent world, the treading downe of immoderate cares and ſorowes about it, and the frée vſe with ioy and gladnes of all Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites. This is it of which it is ſaid in the Pſalme, <hi>It is in vaine to riſe vp early, &amp; late to take reſt, eating the bread of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, he doeth ſurely geue his beloued ſleepe.</hi> There he calleth it ſléepe, and here he doeth call it ioy. For he ſpeaketh not of that ſléepe of the bodie, ſo much as of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quietnes of minde which the godly man enioyeth, whether he be rich or poore.</p>
               <p>Let vs obſerue further, that it is not onely Gods gift, to vſe the things of this world aright, with ſound comfort, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a ſpeciall gift of wiſdome and true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, wherby the man is directed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:14397:76"/>As this is Gods mercie to the good, ſo the contrarie, that is, to be a drudge in the world, to be vexed, moleſted and formen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with cares, to eate the bread of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, for to heape vp, and increaſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, is a puniſhment and iudgement of God vpon wicked men. For he ſaith, that God geueth torment or paine to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to gather and to heape vp. And as the other is wiſdome, ſo this is follie. The good man (through the true knowledge of God) deſpiſeth the world: the worldlie man is blinded with follie, and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe for the world.</p>
               <p>It is true that a penaltie is layd vpon all Adams children, that with the ſweat of their browes they ſhall eat bread: but the bleſſing of God doeth aſſwage the gréeuouſneſſe thereof, vnto the faithfull. His curſe (as wee may gather by this place) doeth double it vpon the wicked. For when it is ſaide, <hi>God geueth him paine,</hi> it muſt néedes be more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
               <p>A very notable place to be conſidered of all men: to teach them whence all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtations

doe ſpring, for the mainteining of this preſent life. We ſée many haue a ſore burthen vpon them, and are troubled in ſuch wiſe to get their liuing, that they be euen wearie of life. They put to all the trauell of their bodies, and ſtudie and deuiſes of their minds, to winde out, but all will not ſerue. They grudge &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, they catch on euery ſide what they can lay hold of, they deale deceitfully, they vſe couſenage, but neuer the néere. What doo they ſay at the laſt? this is an harde world: they haue not the wiſdome to ſée that God doeth accurſe them. And why? Becauſe they be wicked ſinners.</p>
               <p>Others there be which know no end of their goods, and of thoſe <hi>Solomon</hi> doth here particularly ſpeake, which yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding are neuer ſatiſfied: they haue ſo much care to gather and ſtill to heape vp, that they defraud their owne ſoules of good, they doo not inioy that which they haue. The world is full of theſe: a man that looketh vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would thinke them iolly fellowes: they can not doo amiſſe, they haue plentie. Aſke how
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14397:77"/>
doth ſuch a man: anſwere is made, hée can not but doe well, hée doth liue at his hearts eaſe: hée may diſpend fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth pounds by the yeare. When as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe his heart is in little eaſe: for cares doe pinch him: he doeth ſtill tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moile him ſelfe for to heape vp more: he doeth rob his owne bellie: he doth grudge to laie out any thing vpon himſelfe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is looth to diminiſh his ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>This puniſhment (which he in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe can not perceiue) hath God laied vpon him. For he is worthie to be thus puniſhed, beyng one which hath let goe the feare of the Lord. Thus we ſée that the righteous iudge doth puniſh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his lawes, both in this world and in that which is to come. Now the vexation and trouble both of bodie and minde, which men doe ſuſteine: in the world to come, the euerlaſting paines of hell. It is not againſt this doctrine, which is ſaid to the rich glutton in hell, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuedſt good in thy life, &amp; <hi>Lazarus</hi> paine, and now contrariwiſe hée is comforted, and thou art tormented. For this rich ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14397:78"/>
which was ſo daintily kept, both for his apparell &amp; diet, thought he receiued good (when it was no more but ſuch pleaſure as brute beaſts inioy) which he had in all his aboundance: and wanting faith to reſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, he was not without his cares: for riotous men, and delicate Epicures, be very couetous and gréedie of gaine: for if they had a ſea of wealth, they are in doubt it will be dried vp.</p>
               <p>How happie are thoſe which find fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in Gods ſight, which haue a portion in this life, and afterward inherite eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory. This is it which Saint Paule ſaith, godlineſſe is great riches, which of it ſelfe doeth being contentation, and is fully ſufficient: for it hath the promiſes of this life and the life to come. There is an other thing which hée ſaith is a vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which God alſo doeth lay vpon the wicked: that they with vexation doo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell to gather riches (not for themſelues) but to giue vnto the righteous. They haue laboured, but full little doo they know vnto whom the fruite of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhall come. The Aſſe doeth carrie
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14397:78"/>
great waight of treaſure vpon his backe, but not for him ſelfe, or vnto any vſe of his owne, but for his maiſter. Euen ſo theſe doe grone, and are burthened, and carrie the waight vntill they bring it where God will beſtow the ſame. Thus he hath laid open what me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> find in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſions. Let vs carefully remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his doctrine.</p>

But ſéeing our naughtineſſe is ſuch, that we faſten our loue, and put our truſt in things tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, although we know them to be ſuch:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14397:80"/>
the wiſe man goeth on with further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions to recouer vs (if it be poſſible) from this accurſed and damnable way. He made triall in him ſelfe, being the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt man that euer was, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vſe of all excellent thinges vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heauen: and proclaimeth that <hi>there is nothing but vanitie, &amp; affliction of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall now haue the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, euils and miſchéefes, which he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to fall vpon other menne, which hee was frée from, (the firſt which hee now dealeth in excepted) and which in déede doe make this life excéeding miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. For if <hi>Solomon</hi> with all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in the middeſt of his great riches and pleaſures, found no good, what ſhall wée ſay of the life of thoſe, (which are farre the greateſt part of the world) that in the ſteade of his delightes, are laden with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils? I ſuppoſe there is no man ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but can reaſon thus: If the life of <hi>Solomon</hi> were vexation, what is the life of other men? He was frée from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gréefes that light vpon all other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14397:81"/>Theſe gréefes did he obſerue, &amp; ſome of them he noteth. But firſt he vſeth one generall argument, as the grounde and foundation therof, which doeth alſo ſerue for confirmation of his former diſcours: which (as I ſaid) he himſelfe, and all his works are ſubiect vnto. It is taken from the time: all things vnder heauen are in time, and therefore changeable w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time. No maruaile therfore, that al creatures, all workes, ſtudies, indeuours, councels, and deſires, be vaine, and no profite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning, ſéeing time eateth them vp quite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To all things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, and a ſeaſon for euerie purpoſe vnder heauen.</hi> All things vnder the ſunne, or, as the holy Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>2. Cor. 4.</hi> the things which are ſéen, are temporall: and for this cauſe they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they varie, they change, they ſuccéeds one another, there is nothing but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall turning, and tumbling vp and downe of all, euen as times doe turne and alter. There is nothing conſtant and durable, but it hath a ſeaſon, and then the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14397:81"/>
contrarie thereunto hath the time alſo, and expelleth it.</p>
               <p>It were infinite to gather euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but he gathereth ſo many as may leade vs to the contemplation and ſight of all the reſt. <hi>There is a time to bring forth or to be borne, and a time to die.</hi> Theſe two are ſet the one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A man, and each liuing thing hath a time when it commeth foorth into the world, and after certaine daies or yeares that turne about, the time for death dooth come. Who, or what can withſtand this? The like is for all works y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are wrought: there is a time for their making, there commeth a time for their marring. We muſt take this by the way, that he doeth not minde to ſhew what is lawfull and right to bee done, but what is done by change of time.</p>
               <p>Men plant trées, which grow and liue many yeres: but trées waxe ſo olde, that they be plucked vp againe. There com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a time of ſlaughter and killing, and a time to heale the wounded. The migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier ſort build great houſes, &amp; ſo ſtrong,
<pb facs="tcp:14397:82"/>
as it ſéemeth they ſhould continue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: but they weare out with age, &amp; the time commeth when other doe pluck the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe, and build new. Thus is it in all workes vnder heauen. There is nothing but continuall doing, and vndoing that which was done before.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo commeth it to paſſe in all mans affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and deſires in his works, and in the ſucceſſe of matters. There is proſperitie, health, and good ſucceſſe. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doeth he reioyce and laugh, then doeth hée daunce and ſkip for ioy. Aduerſitie follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in her time, then doeth he wéepe, then doeth he mourn and lament: this we al know by experience. But becauſe he ſaith, <hi>There is a time to daunce,</hi> I muſt ſpeake ſome what of that. There be ſome which mainteine daunſing, &amp; theſe be their words: Wee can proue by the Scripture y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> daunſing is allowed, <hi>there is a time</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) to daunce.</hi> I noted before, &amp; they which obſerue well the courſe of things here ſpoken, ſhal find it true, that he diſputeth not what is done lawfullie, but what is done. But I will
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14397:82"/>
not holde them in this ſtraight, I will graunt in this one particular of danſing, that he ſpeaketh of a thing lawfull: yet ſhall ye ſée that they doe fouly abuſe gods word in the ſence they alledge it. There are more kindes of daunſing than one. If they will haue this Scripture ſerue their turne, they muſt ſhewe that ſuch daunſing as is vſed now a daies: wanton danſing, by which men and women nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and féede their fleſhly luſtes, is here mainteyned. By ſuch dauncing ſinne is much increaſed, God is not glorified by it.</p>
               <p>Are they not then aſhamed to make Gods word alow it, &amp; ſo to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to it ſelfe? For Gods word doth condemne chambering and wantonneſſe. <hi>Rom. 13.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> If any replie, and ſay we can doo it with a chaſt mind, onely for recreation, and in ſober maner, when at a marriage ſuch mirth is to be vſed. I anſwere, that ſuch are not to be ſo diſalowed as the reſt.</p>
               <p>But yet with all wée muſt take this, that euery one is to haue regard not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his owne chaſtitie, but alſo for the
<pb facs="tcp:14397:83"/>
preſeruation of the chaſtitie of all other. If thou doo that which is a baite to ſtirre vp, and kindle euill luſtes in other, thou doeſt breake the rule of loue, thou doeſt hurt thy neighbour, therefore take heed how thou daunce. But let this paſſe, that we may goe on: There be many workes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which in their ſeaſon are wrought and haue their time, when their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſuccéedeth and they vaniſh: There is a time to caſt away ſtones, and a time to gather ſtones. This is not to be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto the particuler expreſſed, but may repreſent many actions of mans life which he doth, and vndoeth of him ſelfe: for the mind doth alter and change often with the times. There is a time to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, that is for marriage, and there is a time to abſtaine. He noteth diuers other things, as a time to find, to loſe, to kéepe, to caſt away, to rent in péeces, &amp; to ſewe together, to kéepe ſilence, and to ſpeake, to loue, to hate, of warre and of peace.</p>
               <p>What doo al theſe, and a thouſand ſuch like, but ſhew that we are ſhut vp in time, the times doo change, and wée are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14397:83"/>
changed in them. We haue good ſpéed, we haue euill ſpéed, we make, we marre, we alter, we change, we loue, we like, we loath, we miſlike, we are in quiet to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day, tomorow in trouble, we neuer ceaſe turmoiling, and can make nothing ſtand conſtant, either within vs, as in our mindes, or without vs, in our workes. Whereat he breaketh forth into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, what profit hath he that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the thing wherein he trauaileth? If we could faſten the eyes of our mind, vpon this which he hath ſet forth in ſome particulers, euen to behold the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, the alterations, the change of all creatures, of all workes, of counſels, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes, enterpriſes, euents, affections, and deſires, we ſhould ſée that in déed there is no profit remaining of al the ſore trauaile wherein men forment the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. When peace laſteth ſome clime vp in honour, ſome build, ſome plant: as we ſée the litle Ants buſie to caſt vp their hill, a man doth ſpurne it with his foot, al is ſcattred, thoſe that were in the top, are caſt downe with the loweſt. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo when the wars
<pb facs="tcp:14397:84"/>
doo come, there is a new face of al things, there is caſting downe from dignitie, breaking downe, and rooting vp, yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grieuous and horrible ſpectakels doo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where appeare.</p>
               <p>Here may we conſider againe, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition which our Sauiour doth giue, <hi>Math. 6.</hi> Lay not vp for your ſelues trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in earth, where moth and ruſt doo corrupt, &amp; where théeues breake through and ſteale. But lay vp for your ſelues treaſures in heauen, where neither the moth nor ruſt moth corrupt, &amp; where the théeues doo not breake through &amp; ſteale. Here may wée alſo remember what S.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> Paul ſaith <hi>1. Tim. 6.</hi> Charge thoſe that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, and that they truſt not in vncertaine riches: for as all other things haue but their time, ſo is it with riches. There be many waies for men to loſe them, as times doe fall out.</p>
               <p>It is néedleſſe to make rehearſal in the particulars: but I will rather put you in minde of that exhortation which the holy Ghoſt maketh, <hi>Pro. 23.</hi> Weary not thy<note place="margin">Prou. 23.</note>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:14397:84"/>
ſelfe ſaith he to be rich: ceaſe from thine owne vnderſtanding. Wilt thou caſt thine eyes vpon them, for ſtraight way they are not. For riches make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wings, they flie away as an Egle toward the heauens. The rich man doth kéepe them but as a bird in a cage, the dore is no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner open, but they whip out &amp; are gone: they mount vp toward the heauens, that is, where the owner can not follow to lay hold of them againe. O yée rich men can ye pull the feathers, or clip the wings of your riches? can ye make them as tame foules to tarrie with yée for euer? they be vncertaine, they haue but their time, doo what yée can to make them ſure.</p>
               <p>I may ſay the like for honours and dignities, for bewtie and fauour, yea for all things vnder the ſunne: they haue but their time, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come to naught. Looke vp then vnto the eternall and euer liuing God, he is before and after all time, he is alwaies the ſame. Séeke for to poſſeſſe him for your inheritance: with him there be durable riches: hee will neuer fayle ye. Pray vnto God to teach ye to number
<pb facs="tcp:14397:85"/>
your daies, that ye may apply your harts vnto wiſdome. For to your ſelues, and to your workes there is but a time. It is not in vaine that the prophet ſaith, teach vs to number our daies, that we may applie our harts to wiſdome. For though the times be thus apparantly variable, and inconſtant, yet men are foliſhly blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For it will be ſaid, that although a man liue but a time, yet his workes may continue long. For ther be ſome whoſe houſes and auncetrie haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued fiue hundred yeares, ſome ſay they can ſhew for a thouſand yéeres. Theſe haue ſtood as mightie Cedars, yea as the mountaines themſelues in the middeſt of all ſtormes and tempeſtes. They continue for all the broiles that haue béen in the reuolutions of times: Men may make their workes ſo ſtrong, that they may ſtand for euer. What a goodly thing is it, if their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may floriſh in honour for a thouſand yeares.</p>
               <p>Alas poore fooles, who is able to make ſound or due proofe of a thouſand yeares? there be many which ſet vp their briſtles
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14397:85"/>
and looke a loft, if they can find that their auncetors haue béene men of worſhip, &amp; continued fiue or ſixe hundreth yeares: let it be a thouſand, how little a part haue they of it. Their fathers daies did not profit them, nor theirs on the other ſide do them any good. They haue not learned that a thouſand yeares are but as yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. They are but as a watch in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night when they be paſt: yea euen as a tale that is told. We ſée alſo that the mightie ſtrong kingdomes and monarchies of the world, had but their time and are fallen. And ſhall any man be able to make his workes ſo ſure, that they ſhall not haue their time to be broken downe? men doo reach at ſuch a thing, but all in vaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtate of the world ſhal continue ſtill the ſame, the times ſhall fall out as they haue doone. The wiſe men of the world doe read the hiſtories of former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: they ſée examples ſet before them of all ſortes, which do as it were in a glaſſe repreſent vnto them the truth of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
               <p>For they ſée that all the mighty kings
<pb facs="tcp:14397:86"/>
with their nobles and wiſe counſellors haue laboured in vaine: their thoughts, their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels, their works, together with their glorie, are vaniſhed and come to naught: what profit haue they of all their trauaile, more then to be pictured in the Catalogue of kings? and yet theſe labour ſtill, as if their works ſhould ſtand for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Either they be deceiued with this, that their wiſdome and policies ſhall be able to doe more, or elſe they be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amiſſe, that the times to come wil not be ſo variable. For out of al doubt, if they were thus perſwaded, the mightie men and men of renoune that were before vs, did as much as was poſſible by power or wiſdome to be done, that their workes might be dureable, and yet wée ſée all is gone. The changes and alterations of times haue ouerturned them quite.</p>
               <p>This variableneſſe of time will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill: they would not for a thing of naught caſt away themſelues, I meane by ſetting their harts ſo vpon this world that they loſe eternall glory. And if they yéeld thus farre, that the men of former
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14397:86"/>
ages did as much as they can poſſibly do, but they thinke the times may be better: let them conſider that which <hi>Solomon</hi> here addeth, concerning this variablenes and change of times. For he doth note di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers points touching this matter.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that God himſelfe hath done it. <hi>I ſaw</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the trauaile which God hath geuen to the ſonnes of men, to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie and buſie them therein.</hi> It is not the whéele of blinde fortune, whereby al things are ſo toſſed and turned here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſunne. It commeth not by chance or aduenture, that man and al his doings are ſubiect to the changeablenes of time. It is God, the maker and ruler of heauen and earth, that hath giuen or appointed vnto man, to toile himſelfe, and to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in this ſort.</p>
               <p>All men muſt be occupied, therefore the old things decay, or be deſtroyed, that new may be done. If there were no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, nor no vndoing of things doon in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, there would haue béen inough done long agoe, to ſuffice all that ſhoulde follow. But as he ſaid, <hi>there is a time
<pb facs="tcp:14397:87"/>
to plant, and a time to plucke vp that which is planted: a time to break down, and a time to builde.</hi> Some vndoe and deſtroy, as falt as other ſet vp. Thus ſhall it continue to the worlds ende, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath thus decréed, and ſet it vpon the children of men. The wiſe man beholding this, with other things before mentioned, was clean out of hope, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of all his goodly works, wrought with ſuch wiſdome, ſhould continue: For who can withſtand Gods decrée?</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſheweth that this is done of God by a goodly, excellent, and iuſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, he vttereth it in theſe words: <hi>he hath made euery thing bewtifull in his time.</hi> We haue ſéene certaine parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, whereby he declared that euerie thing hath his time, and their contraries ſuccéede. <hi>A time to be borne, a time to die, a time of warre, a time of peace, a time to loue, a time to hate.</hi> Goe through all things vnder heauen, and it is ſo.</p>
               <p>He ſaith alſo, that God hath ſet it thus. It might ariſe in mens minds, how can theſe thinges come from God, are they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14397:87"/>
beſéeming his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? Many things are vglie, and horrible to behold. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that he hath made them all be w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in their time. In the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance there be a thouſand euil fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſights in the miſchéefes, the miſeries, and calamities that light vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men: there be monſtrous exploites, loathſome to bée ſpoaken, wherby men are oppreſſed, and their eſtate made miſerable. Come theſe from Gods appointment? Can it agrée with his holy gouernment? Yea (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) how ſo euer the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance be, if men had eyes to ſée, if men were lightened with Gods ſpirite, it ſhould be apparant vnto them, that all theſe deformed miſchéefes and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are not onely ſent from God for iuſt cauſe, but alſo very bewtifull in their time.</p>
               <p>I muſt here enter into ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that it may be cléere, for I knowe this doctrine wil ſéeme ſtrange to the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ſort. He ſaid before, that <hi>there is a time of warre, and a time of peace.</hi> The one of them, that is to ſay, the time of
<pb facs="tcp:14397:88"/>
peace, is bewtifull. All men ſée the bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of peace and commend it, for then m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> increaſe and proſper. They plant Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardes, they buyld faire houſes. Then kingdomes and cities doe flouriſh. But can this be ſaid of the other, namely, of the time of warre. Is it a bewtifull ſight to ſée men ſlaine, to haue their bloud run in the ſtréetes? Is it pleaſant to beholde faire houſes broken downe, Cities and townes burnt and conſumed, the Corne fieldes and Orchardes laid waſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed? Is it delightſome for men to looke vpon the ſauage barbarous Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, when they take their wiues and daughters, euen the ſober matrones, and bewtiful virgins, to rauiſh and defile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen before their face? Can any take pleaſure, when the ſwordes, the daggers and ſpeares, are thruſt into the young in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, the litle babes, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their daughters and their ſonnes, their tender bodies caſt foorth into the ſtréetes, and troaden like mire with the horſes. Is not this lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table? Shall we ſay that God hath made theſe bewtifull in their time? He ſaith
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14397:88"/>
ſo, and we muſt beléeue him. In like ſort hee ſaid, <hi>There is a time to caſt away ſtones, and a time to gather ſtones toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: a time to find, a time to loſe: a time to keepe, a time to caſt away.</hi> The one part, that is to gather, to find, to kéepe, may ſéeme bewtifull, but not their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries: As for example, a man gathereth goods, heapeth vp riches, buildeth houſes, and purchaſeth landes. His ſonne doeth come after, and he addeth double and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he goeth beyoond his father. It conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth thus for certain generations, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the heaps are great: at laſt their ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth in one that ſcattreth all abroad. He is a ruffian, he is riotous, he is a dicer, he haunteth harlots, and ſo conſumeth all that his Auncetors did gather. Is this bewtifull? is this a good ſight? I might go through a number of particulars, but theſe may ſuffiſe to lay open the doctrine which <hi>Solomon</hi> doeth here teach. I will make theſe manifeſt, &amp; ſo we may iudge of all other contraries, which in their times fall out by Gods prouidence, how he hath made them bewtifull.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14397:89"/>I know it will be ſaid, how can theſe things be bewtifull? Is riot, whoredom, ruffian liues, dicing, or waſting goods and patrimonie, bewtifull? are murthers, bloudſheds, cruelties, rauiſhings of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones and virgins, waſting &amp; burning all pleaſant things, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable to behold? Theſe and a number moe are vglie, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, and dolefull to behold. They be ſins euen of Heathen men condemned. God is holie, iuſt, pure, and righteous, he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth &amp; condemneth all ſinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, how can it be ſaid, that he doeth make theſe bewtifull in their time? ſhall moſt foule ſinnes be bewtifull, or ſhall we ſay that God doth approue them?</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that neither doth God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue ſinne, neither is ſinne bewtifull of it ſelfe at any time, and yet this ſtandeth true, he hath made euery thing bewtifull in his time. Wée muſt therefore diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh thus: God is the Aucthor of all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the ſinne of the actions commeth not néere him: For hée is infinitely holy and pure, and hateth all wickednes. Hée doth in his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vſe as inſtruments,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14397:89"/>
both men and deuils, to bring the works to paſſe, and the ſinne cleaueth onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. The actions arè good as they bée from the moſt bleſſed and holy God, but theſe inſtruments doo ſinne, and are iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned. Moreouer, if we reſpect the ſinne it ſelfe, it is fond, it is lothſome, it is ſorowfull to behold: for who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the rauiſhment of women, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of men and children, the burning of cities and townes, &amp; not powre forth teares? Who can ſee theftes, robberies, and ſpoiles, yea all kind of wickednes in ſuch manner committed, as if all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils in hell were loſed, and walked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth in mans apparell, and not mourne? In this the things are not bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull.</p>
               <p>But now in an other reſpect, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, wée ſhall ſée they be all be wtifull in their time: and that is, as they be ſent as iuſt and due puniſhments from God, as the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his wrath, and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the wickednes of the world, and for the triall of the faith and pacience of his ſeruants. Looke in the time of peace
<pb facs="tcp:14397:90"/>
what ſecuritie there is, what vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, what pride, what abuſing of all Gods creatures vnto riot and exceſſe, and ye ſhall ſée, that the ſword, the famine, the peſtilence, and al kinde of miſerable vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations are iuſtly ſent of God, and in that reſpect are bewtifull in their tune. Wée ſée how many doo gette their goods, with couetouſneſſe, with vniuſt dealing, by extortion, briberie, and deceit, vſurie, vnmercifulneſſe to the poore, yea euen to the widow and the fatherles, doo fill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mens purſes.</p>
               <p>Is it not a iuſt reuenge from God, and a due executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and in that reſpect a thing bewtifull, that a ruffian, or an vnthrift, doe riſe vp and riotouſly waſt the goods that haue béene ſo naughtily gotten?

cauſeth a tent to be ſpread, and in the ſight of all the people, went in and lay with his fathers wiues.

When he ſaith, God hath ſet the world in their heart, hée expoundeth what hée meaneth by the world, euen the worke of God, which hée worketh from the beginning to the end. That is to ſay, euen the whole worke of God, for the turmoiles that be among the nations of the world: ſauing that he hath made an exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the way, for he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in, except that which man can not find.

For menne doo worke it all, except that which man findeth not out, which God hath reſerued to him ſelfe. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he hath at all times ſo gouerned the world, that he doeth many things of him ſelfe without the meanes of men, both in deliuerances of ſome particular perſons, and alſo in preſeruation of his whole Church. He hath ſhewed great wonders aboue mans reach. He doeth ſend dearths and famines, and peſtilences to plague &amp; puniſh the wicked. Theſe and ſuch like excepted: It is in mans hart to doo all the reſt. All the labour and turmoile of doing and vndoing, of making &amp; marring, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp and deſtroying, wee ſée is in the heart and minde of man.

               <p>The fourth and laſte poynt now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth, which is, that God hath (by an vnchangeable decrée) done all this which he hath ſhewed of the variablenes of all things in time, and with time. There is at one time doing, at another time vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing. There is good ſucceſſe to day, and as euill to morow. Now mirth, then ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe: proſperitie, and aduerſitie. This hath God ſo appointed, that it cannot bée altered. Marke what he ſaith, <hi>I knowe that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, it ſhal be for euer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to it can no man adde, &amp; from it can no man diminiſh.</hi> Theſe wordes be effectuall, and plaine, to teach vs, that God almightie which hath made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world and doeth gouerne it, hath compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and ſhutte many vp in vanities, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities

and miſeries, which are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, euen as it were within walles of braſſe. There is no way to wind out, no way to alter any thing, either to adde, or to diminiſh. No man can change that which God hath determined. He hath in his manifold and vnſearchable wiſdome ſet this courſe and order in the world, to continue to the end. No thing, no purpoſe whatſoeuer vnder heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhal haue more then the ſeaſon, and then geue place.</p>
               <p>By this we may be taught to beholde the madnes of the children of this world, they ſtriue and indeuour againſt God, no wiſelier, then if one ſhould run his head againſt a thicke wall of braſſe to breake through it. They applie all their ſtudie, wiſdome and power, to make their eſtate firme vnchangeable, and not ſubiect vnto vanitie.</p>
               <p>What inuentions and deuiſes there be, to make themſelues glorious in the earth for euer: what hope to make their poſteritie flouriſh, and their workes (for the greatnes of them) to ſtande euen to the laſt day. Alas poore blinde men, they

forment themſelues in vaine, for God hath decréed before what ſhall become of them, and of all their thoughts. He hath ſet al vnder time to paſſe away, and will they goe about to alter his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Here is comfort to the godly, when he ſaith, <hi>all that God doeth ſhall ſtand for euer, to it can no man adde, from it can no man diminiſh.</hi> For this doeth teach, that things fall not out at the wil &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of men, but are wholy ordered by God himſelfe, which cauſeth all thinges<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> to work together for the beſt to thoſe that loue him. The world doth rage, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie tyrants are in a furie, and doe threate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſtruction to the church. Many troubles and miſeries ariſe, it ſéemeth there will be no end nor meaſure: ſo ſtrong they be which trouble all, that they appeare to haue the whole ſway of the earth at their commandement. But when they haue done what they can, they goe not one iot or one haire breadth beyonde that which God had before appointed.</p>
               <p>Herein the world is like the ſea, in which God hath laide the waters vppon

But God hath ſet the ſhoare, hee hath appoynted them their boundes and limittes, which they cannot paſſe. Hether ſhalt y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> come, and not further, here ſhalt thou lay down thy proud waues. The deuill ſtirreth vp the tempeſtes, and ſetteth all in a broyle vpon the land.

               <p>The next words in the text doe ſhew to what ende and purpoſe God doeth all this: and that is, <hi>that men ſhoulde feare before him.</hi> A moſt worthie ende, both for his glorie, and for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s good. He ought to be feared and honoured, and it is true bleſſednes vnto thoſe which do it. Behold then the excellent wiſdome and goodnes of God, which bringeth light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

He hath ſet ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this vaine eſtate, tranſitory and full of calamities, to drawe his minde vp to his God, to feare, to worſhip, and to depende vpon him, ſéeing vnder heauen there is nothing to ſtay vpon, there is nothing to help or comfort.</p>
               <p>What dulnes is in vs when we finde that all is like a ſea of miſerie? if we look vpon the ages paſt, or the time preſent, and when we are tolde it ſhalbe ſo in the time to come, yet cannot our heartes bée drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away from it vnto God? He doth it that we ſhould feare before him, but we perceue it not. He leaueth vs nothing here that is worth the caſting our eyes vpon, becauſe we ſhould turne them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. He is conſtant, always the ſame, but the works of man decay, and newe are ſet vp in their ſteade. He demandeth what it is that hath béene, and maketh anſwere, that which is now: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which ſhalbe is that that hath béene, for God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that which is paſt. All thinges are either paſt, preſent, or to come. Men in times paſt did labour, they are all ſet
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14397:95"/>
a work that liue now, and thoſe that riſe vp after vs ſhall doe the like. They that went before, their workes are decaid and fallen, we doe but the ſame again. Thoſe that come laſt, and fall to it a freſh, when our workes are vaniſhed, ſhall doo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which hath béene done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Thus all turneth round as a whéele, which hee expreſſeth further in theſe wordes, <hi>God requireth that which is paſt.</hi> This is not Fortunes whéele, it is God, when men turmoyle, which ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the matter, that they can doe no more but that hath alreadie béene done. For when he ſaith, <hi>God requireth,</hi> it is as much as to ſay, God bringeth back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that which is paſt.</p>
               <p>Oh poore creatures what do ye? Open your eyes and behold with déepe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that which is here ſet before you. Conſider the workes of the ages that are paſt, what is become of them? what ſhall then become of your workes hereafter? God hath decréed, and no man can alter it, that this eſtate of things ſhal continue
<pb facs="tcp:14397:96"/>
to the end. Turne then vnto him, feare him, and forſake theſe vanities, and yée ſhall be bleſſed for euer.</p>

               <p>I noted the laſt time, that he wold ſhew ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the euils

and miſchéefes which hee obſerued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to fall vpon others, which doe increaſe the miſeries of this life. Now hee commeth to them, and firſt beginneth with the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, and the oppreſſed. God hath made all the inhabitants of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of one bloud. He willeth them to dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in concord and loue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to deale iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vprightly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with equitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and none to hurt, but to doe good each to other.

               <p>For to méete with this, and for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of mankind the Lorde hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned the ciuill power, hee hath erected the ſeate of iudgement and iuſtice vppon earth, he hath put his ſword into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of Iudges and ruler <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They are by duetie of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and place to reſcue the innocent, to deltuer the oppreſſed, and to puniſh the wrong doers; This doeth bring much eaſe and quiet vnto the Inhabitantes of the earth: for without it, no ſocietie, or
<pb facs="tcp:14397:98"/>
common wealth can ſtand. There wold be nothing but théeuing, killing and ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling. If this were not ſome what at all times peruerted, there might be much more comfort and reléef to the oppreſſed. But it falleth out as he ſaith, <hi>I haue ſeen vnder the ſunne the place of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, there is iniquitie, the place of iuſtice, there is wickednes.</hi> The wicked ſhould there be puniſhed, and the innocent reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued, and it falleth out contrarie. The Lord complayneth of this <hi>Pſal. 82.</hi> How<note place="margin">Pſal. 82.</note> long will ye iudge vniuſtly, and accepts the perſon of the wicked? He crieth vnto them to iudge the fatherles and poor, but they heare not.</p>
               <p>I know ſome take it that <hi>Solomon</hi> doeth not ſpeake here of the iudgement ſeate, but by the word place, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as much as to ſay, in ſteade. Then is it thus, that the people in place, that is, in ſteade of iuſtice, doe iniury &amp; wrong one another. I could yeald vnto this, but that hee ſpeaketh in this manner, the place of iudgement there is iniquitie, which agréeth rather to a very place, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:14397:98"/>
to ſay in ſteade. But it may be obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſaide, where did Solomon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this corrupting of iuſtice in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeate of iudgement? was not hée the<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.</note> chéefe Iudge in his kingdome? Did hée, or coulde hee beholde ſuch a thing in his his owne daies, and not remedy it? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that he ſpeaketh not of that which he had ſéene in one kingdome, or at one time, or which he behelde ſo much with outward ſight. But by an inward light and knowledge he beheld this great euill in all dominions vnder the ſunne, and at all times.</p>
               <p>He did know right wel the great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of man, that tyrants ſhould ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſitte vpon the higheſt ſeates of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And moreouer, that though the king him ſelfe be iuſt, yet his ſubſtitutes, and ſuch as are put in truſt vnder him, would peruert iudgement many times. For when they ſhould look vprightly into the cauſe, they be drawen awrie by manyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes: for there be many thinges which haue force and ſtrength in them to draw a man awrie from miniſtring true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
<pb facs="tcp:14397:99"/>
Sometime a gift doeth blinde their eyes, for the Lord ſaith, a gift doeth blind the eyes, and peruert the iudgement of the wiſe. Sometime they accept the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the wocked, for ſome friendſhip, if not toward them, yet for ſome friend which intreateth that fauor may bee ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, as it is vſuall in waightie cauſes that great men write vnto Iudges, and then downe goeth the innocent very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, vnles the Iudge be of great courage, and feare God.</p>
               <p>Sometime there is hatred toward the perſon, for religion. When the iudge is corrupt in opinion that way, as it falleth ont often, becauſe many iudges are ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the ſtudie of worldly matters, and ſo wiſe in their owne eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they muſt haue Gods matters ſquared by their rule: the wiſdome of the fleſh is their rule. Somtime feare carieth awrie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſome great perſon of honour doth ſpeake or write in fauour of the guiltie. The Iudges would be loth to diſpleaſe ſuch, &amp; ſo in the place of iudgement there is iniquitie: iudgement commeth foorth
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14397:99"/>
wreſted, as the Prophet complaineth. This increaſeth greatly the miſerie of the life preſent, when as we lie open co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vnto a thouſand oppreſſions, where our refuge ſhould be, there we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes find diſcouragement. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and wicked man doeth deale with the innocent euen at his pleaſure, the rich doth iniurie the poore, and when they rome before the iudges, or thoſe that ſhould miniſter iuſtice, euen as if the power were ſet vp for countenance of the vngodly, they are praiſed: the other are rebuked and checked.</p>
               <p>Alas what ſhall men doo, where ſhall they ſéeke comfort? is not this life miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? the world is euer full (and neuer more then at this day) of oppreſſions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, wrongs, and violence, &amp; the place of iuſtice that ſhould right it, doeth often increaſe the ſame. Who is he that hath a peaceable minde, but had rather loſe a great part, if he might chooſe, then goe to the law for to ſéeke iuſtice? how many are vndoone, by going to law, how many are there which with long ſuite &amp; great
<pb facs="tcp:14397:100"/>
expences ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer attaine to their right? If he be rich or mighty that doeth the wrong, let him take away houſe or land wrongfully, we doo account it follie for a meane ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſeeke for iuſtice. The world is miſerably corrupted this way now, what remedie, what comfort? Doubtles none but that <hi>Solomon</hi> doth ſet foorth in the next verſe, <hi>I ſaid in my heart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a time for euery purpoſe, and ouer euery worke there.</hi> The Lord hath made all men to dwell together vpon the face of the earth: hée is the iudge of the whole world: hée is a iudge by nature: he is iuſtice and truth it ſelfe: he can not doo wrong vnto any: he muſt néedes reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue and deliuer the iuſt, and execute ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vpon the wicked.</p>
               <p>Herevpon <hi>Solomon</hi> doth gather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding withall the confuſion of matters vnder the ſunne, that there ſhall be a day of generall iudgement, when as all both good and bad ſhall come to their account, and when as euery man ſhall receiue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his déedes. It ſhall not euer be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14397:100"/>
thus: Violence, oppreſſion, and iniuries haue but their time, and there is alſo the time for iuſtice, as he ſaith, there is a time for euery purpoſe. The laſt clauſe of this ſentence may be taken diuers waies, as namely, that the iudgement ſhall be ouer euery worke: or thus, he that is ouer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery worke is there. The ſenſe both waies is true, and tendeth to one pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for it is moſt certaine by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that euery worke both good &amp; bad, ſhalbe brought vnto iudgement, and it is God, who is ouer al, that ſhall iudge.</p>
               <p>Let vs here learne of the wiſe man, when we behold oppreſſion and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of iuſtice, to gather aſſuredly that there is a time when things ſhal be ſet in better frame. Let vs not be caſt downe &amp; diſcouraged, when wée ſuffer wrong, and can find no help at the ſeats of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and places of iuſtice: for the time commeth when the high iudge will take our cauſe into his hand. Becauſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters now go ſo farre awrie, be ſure there is a day appointed for better order. It ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not ſtand with Gods iuſtice that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:14397:101"/>
ſhould thus go cléere away.</p>
               <p>The wicked doo not reaſon thus: but becauſe the Lord doth let them alone, and men doo eſcape with foule factes, they be the bolder, euen as if God did not regard<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> the thing at all. This I ſay: is a wrong collection, for that God now winketh at oppreſſion, and at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peruerting of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is a ſtrong reaſon to proue that he hath ſet a time vnto which he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue all cauſes, wée ſhall all come there both the oppreſſor and the oppreſſed. Let vs proceed to that which followeth: <hi>I ſaid in my heart concerning the order of the children of men, that God hath giuen them dignitie, and to ſee to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are beaſtes to themſelues.</hi> This ſentence is hard &amp; difficult, by reaſon of ſome words in it, which may bée conſtrued diuers waies, and therefore no meruaile though it be vnderſtood diuerſly.</p>
               <p>But to let paſſe how it is tranſlated in others, I will ſhew the cauſe why I take it thus, as I haue ſet it downe. Firſt, here is one word, <hi>Dibrath</hi> which in the <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 110.</note> 
                  <hi>110.</hi> is vſed for order: in this ſentence of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14397:101"/>
the Pſalme, the Lord hath ſworne and will not repent, thou art a prieſt for euer after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> This I take here to ſignifie the ſtate and order of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Here is an other word, &amp; that is <hi>Barar,</hi> which ſignifieth to chooſe, to purge, to declare. I take it here in the firſt ſence or the ſecond, that God hath choſen men or purged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that is to ſay, he hath ſet them vp &amp; adorned them with dignitie and honour, and yet to ſée to they be beaſts to themſelues. For choiſe men, ſet vp in dignitie, are called in the holy ſcripture <hi>Berurim,</hi> which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of the ſame word <hi>Barar.</hi> And the Scripture ſaith <hi>Pſal. 49.</hi> Man is in honour, but ſhall not continue, he is like the beaſtes that periſh. So then touching the ſtate or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the children of men, God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them dignitie and honour, but yet they be but as the beaſts to themſelues, as he ſheweth by reaſons afterward. This is ſpoken to pull downe the pride and loftines of mans nature, which doth ſo glory of an excellencie here in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. For looke wel vpon it, and we ſhall ſée,
<pb facs="tcp:14397:102"/>
that this honour and dignitie doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, but man becommeth euen as the beaſts. The beaſts haue no order among them, they haue no magiſtracie, no ſeats of iuſtice or ſuch like. But the ſtronger doo oppreſſe the weaker, the wild do pray vpon the tame, there is no place of refuge or ſuccour among them.</p>
               <p>Among men, this is a goodly dignitie, a goodly order, that God giueth the ciuill power, princes and iudges, and men of honour. There are lawes, there be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, there is authoritie to reſtrayne wrongs and oppreſſions, that they may not be as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſts to deuour one another. Yet do they partly in this become beaſts to themſelues, when the ſtronger do puſh the weaker, and when the ſeat of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth vphold wickednes. Men are cruell and ſauage beaſts one to an other many waies: but chiefly in death their dignitie doth vaniſh, and they differ not from the beaſts that periſh, as I alledged before, <hi>Pſalm. 49.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore he ſaith, the condition of the children of men, and the condition of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14397:102"/>
beaſts, is euen as one condition to them: as the one dieth, ſo dieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, for they haue all one breath, and there is no excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of man aboue the beaſt, <hi>for al is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. All go to one place</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſée hée proueth them not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their dignitie, to be as the beaſts, becauſe the euent falleth out to be all one, no difference at all appearing. To day a iudge, a ruler, a mightie king, to morrow all one in condition with the vileſt beaſt. Both die alike, age, or ſome ſickneſſe or hurt, doeth cauſe the bodie to pine and languiſh, ſtrength faileth, they abhorre meate, and yéeld vp the breath. The ſame alſo is a like, for both haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels to draw in the aire, both man and beaſt gaſpe, and yéeld vp the ſame after one ſorte: the beaſt doeth rotte and turne to duſt, &amp; ſo doth the man, for both were made of the duſt, and both returne to the duſt. In all theſe here is as he ſaith, <hi>no excellencie of man aboue the beaſt, for all is vanitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14397:103"/>Thus we ſée man is in honour, but doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue, he is like the beaſts that periſh.</p>
               <p>The holy Scripture when it will abate mans high ſtomake, doeth put him in mind, that <hi>his breath is in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels, he is but duſt and ſhall die, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to duſt.</hi> Now becauſe this fooliſh vaine glory that men haue in themſelues and in the vanities of this world, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſo faſt, <hi>Solomon</hi> vrgeth the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> very ſore, when he maketh no difference at al, nor no excellencie of man aboue the beaſt.</p>
               <p>Let men conſider well of this, and it muſt néedes make them leſſe eſtéeme the glorie of this worlde. Now if they haue riches and be a ſteppe or two in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour aboue other, it fareth with them as if they were of an other kindred, yea as if they were petie gods. But if it could enter into their mind to thinke, I haue honour and dignitie, and glorie here in the world. I am ſet vp aboue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, but ſhal this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwéene me and them continue? Surelie no: I
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14397:103"/>

and doo in that reſpect farre excell the beaſt. But touching this world (about the vanitie and miſerie wherof <hi>Solomon</hi> diſputeth) there is no difference nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, nor priuiledge aboue the beaſt. For the men which haue imbraced this preſent world, they haue a ſoule in deede that liueth, but it were a thouſand times better for them, if they had not, but did wholy periſh as the beaſtes. Here is no colour of matter in this ſentence, to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the wicked opinion of thoſe deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble monſters, which denis the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the ſoule. When they alleadge this ſaying of <hi>Solomon,</hi> yée ſée it is but wreſted.</p>
               <p>Againe, here is no cauſe to moue vs, for feare leaſt we ſhould ſtrengthen that wicked opinion, to take it that <hi>Solomon</hi> doeth here ſhew what hée iudged by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome: for humane reaſon hath not ſo iudged, that men differ nothing at all from beaſts after death. The humane reaſon is ſo blinde, that it will not bée brought to make ſuch a proofe as this, that man doeth not differ from the beaſt,
<pb facs="tcp:14397:105"/>
becauſe all is vanitie, as we ſee he ſaith a litle before in this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore it is out of all doubt a matter propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by <hi>Solomon,</hi> through the due contemplation wherof, the proud and loftie mind of man may be brought downe, that he may thirſt for a better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and ſéeke it: that he may leſſe regard theſe tranſitorie things, in which his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doeth fall out very ſoone to be all one with the beaſtes. And here we may remember by the way, how abiect and baſe the proud mindes of men be which know not God. They be as loftie in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, as if all fortitude and magnanimitie were in them: yea they would ſéeme to be gloriouſe, and yet looke well vpon the matter, and yée ſhall ſée they haue bowed downe themſelues to a baſe condition? when their heart is ſet vpon earthly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which can not long lift them vp aboue the beaſt. In déede this is the valiant mind, to diſpiſe, to tread downe the vaine pomye of this world, to eſtéeme baſely of things tranſitorie, to long for that bleſſed eſtate in which there ſhall no baſenes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14397:105"/>
And in which it ſhall not be ſaide, man is in honour, and ſhal not continue, <hi>he is like the beaſtes that peariſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the ſonnes of great Princes, which are borne to honor and dignitie, ſhould be ſo baſely minded, as to let goe all regarde of their birth and place, and chooſe rather to be ſhepheards, or Plowmen, it would be wondered at. But when God calleth vs to a farre greater glorie, and wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéeme it not, but ſet our mindes vpon the beggarlie pompe of this world, it ſéemeth no maruaile at all, yet the trueth is, that theſe latter are much more to be wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe other, they be baſer min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Let vs goe for ward, it followeth in the next verſe, <hi>Therefore I ſee there is nothing good, but that a man doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in his workes, becauſe that is his portion: for who ſhall bring him to ſee what ſhalbe after him?</hi> He hath vttered this diuers times, in which he affirmeth, that there remayneth no good vnto man of all his trauaile after death. To reioice in his workes, to take part while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, is all the portion that he can haue of
<pb facs="tcp:14397:106"/>
things vnder the ſunne, for he ſhall neuer be brought againe ſo much as to haue the ſight of any thing that ſhalbe after him. God hath ordeyned that we ſhal haue the vſe of his creatures to ſerue for preſent neceſſitie, which we may reioyce in, not like gluttons, epicures, or riotous folke, but by them to haue our hearts lifted vp to the geuer.</p>
               <p>Mans nature is not onely able to doe the former, namely, gluttonie and exceſſe: but is prone thereunto. But this later is the ſpeciall gift of God, as hee taught vs in the ſecond Chapter: ſuch as haue not this, haue no portion at all of the riches &amp; goods which they poſſeſſe, bee they neuer ſo wealthie: Unleſſe we will account it a portion which differeth not from that which bruite beaſtes doe equally enioy. For they take pleaſure in ſwéet paſtures they haue their delights. Contrariwiſe, ſuch as haue a portion in the creatures, reioiſing in them, as by them being lifted vp to reioyce in God, are not hindered, though they haue little. For it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a ſmall thing which the righteous haue,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14397:106"/>
is better then the great reuenewes of the<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.</note> wicked, <hi>Pſal. 37.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It followeth, <hi>I turned and behelde all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne, &amp;c.</hi> I noted vnto you that hée dealeth with the oppreſſors, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and hauing firſt propounded what he beheld the ſtate of mans life to be in that former, now hee commeth to that other.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14397:110"/>
The wicked goeth through many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in this world, yet when he is dead &amp; freed from them he is not in better, but in worſe caſe, feeling aſſuredly, that he is da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The godly, although of all other the moſt miſerable in this world, (if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waight of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) yet they be in ioy after death, are happy that euer they were borne, &amp; therfore it can not be ſaid, that he which hath not yet béene is better then they. I anſwere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not reſpect any thing in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but that which is vnder the ſun. He doeth proue that vnder heauen, there is naught but vanitie.</p>
               <p>He doeth not in this place medle with that which is out of the world: that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſaluation or damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We ſée the men that ſéeke good in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, doe ſet thoſe reſpects alſo aſide: ſo that he dealeth now within their compaſſe. Is this true, that reſpecting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſeries of this world, the dead be in better caſe then the liuing, &amp; he that hath neuer béene borne better at eaſe then they both? Is it not then alſo true, that he ſaid, <hi>vanitie of vanities, all is
<pb facs="tcp:14397:111"/>
vanitie, there is no profit to a man of all his trauaile vnder the ſunne?</hi> Why then doo men ſet their heart vpon this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life? what will they find in it?</p>
               <p>The next ſentence ſetteth foorth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euill which might make this life vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, when he ſaith, <hi>I ſaw all trauaile and al perfection of the worke, that this is the enuie of a man from his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, this alſo is vanitie, and affliction of ſpirite.</hi> Wee haue heard how miſerable he iudged this life by reaſon of oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: now hee ſpeaketh of that which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth further miſerie. It is but a ſmall thing which man hath allotted him here, euen to reioyce in his workes, and yet he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not enioy the ſame quietly, or without vexation. God geueth ſkill in all maner of workes which are wrought vnder the ſunne. The greater giftes he geueth, the greater perfection doe they ſhew in their workes that haue them. It is (after a ſort) to be iniurious to God himſelf, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men doe not geue the due praiſe vnto ſuch men that doe ſo excell in giftes of ſkill. They ſhould be honoured, and haue mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14397:111"/>
to reioyce, but they be enuyed. The more perfect they be, the more dooth enuie repine. This ſpringeth from vainglorie, and couetouſnes withall.</p>
               <p>Men would be prayſed, and haue the chéefe fame and profite of their ſcience. If God haue geuen more perfection vnto an other, it gréeueth them, they depraue, and diſgrace all that euer they can. From hence doe flow foorth many annoyances, which make this life gréeuous.</p>
               <p>To conclude then (beloued) ye may ſée alſo out of this portion of Scripture that I haue now handled, that the vanitie and vexation of this life is very great, &amp; ſhall euer continue. God geue vs grace to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it, and to be ſo much further dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen from things tranſitorie.</p>

He beginneth with the ſlouthfull, becauſe he had ſpoken of the perfection of trauaile in the former verſe. Let a man trauaile with wiſdome and perfection, he ſhal be enuied: let him ceaſe &amp; be ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it is his deſtruction, as we ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by that which is here taught.

hath alſo giuen hands to that purpoſe. He that worketh is ſaid to lay to his hands, &amp; the works are called the works of our hands. Contrariwiſe, he that is idle is ſaid to fold together his hands. It may then be demaunded why hée doeth not name the ſluggard, but vſe ſo generall a name as foole? It is for ſpeciall cauſes, for the idle which foldeth his handes, is almoſt a foole alone. Againe: In the Prouerbes he ſaith, the ſluggard is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer in his owne conceipt, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon. He taketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the wiſeſt of many, that hée doeth ſpare his body, when other take paines, and he is deceiued, for it is to his great miſerie and deſtruction. The holy ghoſt doth of purpoſe ſet him forth to be cleane contrarie vnto that which he boaſteth of, and that doth nippe ſore.</p>
               <p>For ſo dealeth S. Paule with thoſe which let goe wholeſome doctrine, and giue themſelues to vaine ſpeculations. He ſaith they be vainely puffed vp and know nothing. <hi>1. Timoth. 6.</hi> What can grieue ſuch men more, then when they

doo looke to be accounted the wiſeſt of all, and to know more then any (he ſaith) they be puffed vp and know nothing. So the ſluggard ſéemeth to be very wiſe, and therfore he noteth him by the word foole, as by his proper name, for he hath a chief place among fooles, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there be any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter folly, then to bring ſo great miſerie vpon himſelf, that he eat his owne fleſh. Wée all doo know that it is a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitis which canſeth a man to bite and eat the fleſh from his owne armes. With ſuch doth he compare the idle, becauſe he doth deuour himſelfe.

               <p>This ſentence may be vnderſtood two wayes: for eyther <hi>Solomon</hi> ſetteth it downe as a doctrine, and then the ſence is this, that it is better to haue a ſmaller portion of riches with moderate care and trauaile, then to haue great aboundance with toyle and vexation of ſpirite: and that is very true, and then is it ſet down as the meane betwéene the ſlouthful and the miſerable drudge, ſpoken of next: or els he ſpeaketh in the perſon of the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſhewing how he perſwadeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto idlenes, that he had rather fare thinly and take his eaſe, then to wearie himſelfe with labour, for to get riches. It is a true ſaying, when it is applied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an ouer gréedie deſire or riches: yet is it a bad reaſon, as the ſluggard vſeth it, to his purpoſe. For, he carrieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by it, not vnto moderate care and trauaile to prouide things neceſſarie, but in déede into idlenes, and beggeris. Hée ſaith, <hi>One handfull,</hi> (that is, a little,) <hi>is better with quiet reſt, than two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls with labour:</hi> But he hath not that

The prodigall ruffian beholdeth the couetbus niggard, and what ſaith he? There is a miſerable caitife, he maketh his money his god. I will neuer (ſaith he) be a ſlaus to my purſe, I will make golde my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, andiſo he poureth foorth ſo long as he hath any, and that riotouſlie, where there is no néed.

               <p>Thus doe men with true ſentences ſéeke to colour their ſinnes, and are cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into extremities, and ſo doeth the idle foole here. He ſéeth men labour, and take paines for their ſuſtenaunce, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide ſomwhat for their children. O (thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth he) theſe are fooliſh men, they vexe &amp; wearie themſelues, I had rather haue a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14397:117"/>
cup of béere and a morſel of bread with eaſe, then to haue all their good cheare with the paines which they take. This no doubt, is a ſwéet reaſon vnto fleſh and bloud, which ſhunneth labour, and is prone vnto idlenes and luſte. It cauſeth thouſands to ſéek eaſie occupations. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, withſtand this temptation, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that God hath laide vpon euery man that he ſhall trauaile carefully in his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. As no man ought to ſet his heart vpon riches, ſo ought all to beware of ſlouthfulnes, for it is a follie that brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth great calamitie in the end.</p>
               <p>Thus haue we ſéene one ſorte of men that plague themſelues: now followeth another. <hi>I behelde a vanitie vnder the ſunne, there is one, and there is not a ſecond, &amp;c.</hi> He deſcribeth ſuch a man as puniſheth himſelf with extreme care and labours to heape vp riches, and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer haue his eye ſatiſfied: yea ſuch a one as is a nigard to his owne bellie, and doeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen grudge to beſtow any good thing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe. When a man hath a wife and children, brethren or kinred, there
<pb facs="tcp:14397:118"/>
bee ſome bondes of naturall affection, which may moue him to lay vp ſom what to geue vnto them. When it is ſo, there ſeemeth to be a iuſt excuſe, (as in déede it is comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dable where meaſure is kept) but this is to be wondered at, that there ſhoulde be ſo cruell a ſicknes in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that a man being alone, hauing no ſonne, nor any kinred to prouide for, is yet ſo inſatiable, that he can neuer think he hath inough, but doeth continuallie whippe and torment himſelfe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoghts and ſorowful cares, and with paines and nigardly pinching.</p>
               <p>He doeth alſo geue vs to vnderſtand, how blinde and fooliſh this man is. For, he hath not the wiſdome to thinke in him ſelfe, for whom doe I toile, and defraude my ſoule of good? If a man could but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus in his heart, I haue plentie of riches, I haue no childe, I haue no néere kinſman, for whome doe I torment my ſelfe with care to get riches? Why ſhold not I enioy part of them my ſelfe? It would a little eaſe him of his burthen. Peraduenture it will be ſaid, there bee
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14397:118"/>
fewe thus miſerable. If a man woulde ſéeke, he ſhoulde hardly finde tenne ſuch in a whole ſhire: why then doeth <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> bring it in to declare the miſerie of this life, ſéeing it lighteth but vpon here and there an odde perſon? I aunſwere, that in déede there be fewe to be found which haue no childe, nor nigh kinred, and yet are extreme néedie, and of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerablé nigardlines. But we muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande that he ſpeaketh of a common infection. It is in many thouſandes, but he doeth declare it, chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ng ſuch a perſon to ſet it foorth in, as in whom the diſeaſe is broken foorth, and hath nothing to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it.</p>
               <p>Shall we thinke, that to want childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and kinred, doe bréede this vile maladie, nay that doeth but detect it: As the world doeth ſwarme full of idle fooles, ſo is it certaine, that there be thouſands of theſe miſerable hard men, which moyle in the world as baſe drudges, to get and heape vp riches for their children, which if they had no children, yet their diſeaſe woulde remayne with them. He ſaith this is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<pb facs="tcp:14397:119"/>
and this is an euill affliction. And doubtles who can deny but that the life of ſuch men is moſt miſerable.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe this miſer, though hée be among men, yet liueth (if it may bée called a life) vnto himſelfe, as he ſaith, <hi>he is one,</hi> and his minde cannot admit any fellow in that he poſſeſſeth, in which hée pincheth his owne bellie, and ſaith it nay euen when it cryeth vnto him for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what. He wil ſet foorth further euils and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences of his life by ſhewing the good which commeth of the contrary, that is, the ſocietie and felowſhip of life. Two are better than one, they can doe more work, and many works together which one cannot, and ſo they haue a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for their labour.</p>
               <p>There be many commodities in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring together. Companions are in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, if one of them fal, his fellow lifteth him vp. But he which is alone and doth fall, wo be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to him, there is no helpe for him. If two lie together they are warm, but one alone can not be warme, if any doe ſet vpon one and would be to ſtrong
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14397:119"/>
for him, two will be able to reſiſt: and a thréefold cord is not eaſily broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Where men are linked together in ſocietie and friendſhip, they be ſtrong and can not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be iniuried. By theſe his meaning is to ſhewe the manifold miſchisfes which the worldly drudge coueting to liue by himſelfe, doth fall into.</p>
               <p>Let vs note thus much, that men are diſſociate and liue a ſunder, gréedineſſe of wealth is a great cauſe of it. They can not abide that one ſhould haue any gaine by another, they will beſtow nothing vpon any to noriſh loue. And thus they draw euils vpon themſelues, and make their life full of miſeries. Where he ſaith of the worldly drudge, that <hi>there is no end of all his labour,</hi> alſo his eye is not ſatiſfied with riches, though he haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſonne nor brother, I feare many wil take none but ſuch to be couetous: leaſt any ſhould be deceiued in taking this to be the onely deſcription of a couetous man, I will ſtand ſomewhat vpon it. In déed it is the deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a couetous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but yet of one that is in a déepe degrée of
<pb facs="tcp:14397:120"/>
couetouſnes, yea of an extreme miſer and drudge. A man may come certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées ſhort of him, and yet be couetouſe, and ſo couetouſe that ſhe Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him an Idolater, making riches his truſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo his God, he ſhal not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if a man haue many children for which he is bound to prouide by his trauaile, and to teach them to worke, yet to haue an inſatiable deſire for riches, to toyle without end, is condemned, it is a ſauage thing, to liue (which many doe,) without ſocietie of neighbors, as ye ſhall ſee many ſo couetous that they admit no companions. I will ſay further, though he doo not defraud his ſoule of good, but doo féed of them, yea though he come to be after a ſort ſatiſfied and haue enough, yet he may be couetouſe: for couetouſneſſe is not onely in the gréedie deſire of hauing more, or in pinching the bellie, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in truſting in riches. God hath giuen vs our life, he hath commaunded vs to trauaile for ſuſtenance, but yet ſo as that we depend vpon him, and know that he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14397:120"/>
doth féed vs, &amp; maintaine our life. Faith in him, is ſhe keye of our ſtore houſe, if we ſtay vpon riches, as though our life were maintained by them, be guiltie of couètouſnes.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour ſaith, take héed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of couetouſneſſe, Luke 12. and then for example bringeth in a man, whoſe garners brought foorth ſuch ſtoare, that he had not roome to lay it vp: hee pulled downe his barnes, and builded greater, and then he ſaid, Soul thou haſt enough laide vp in ſtore for many yeres, eate, drinke, and be merie. Thou foole, this night ſhall they take away thy ſoule, &amp;c. Here is one ye ſée, doeth eate, drinke, and is merrie; hath enough for many yeres, and yet condemned as couetous. The wretched drudge here deſcribed by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> goeth farre beyond this, and yet this is not excuſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>We haue now in our daies, it may be, but here and there one, which fitly in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery reſpect agréed with this deſcription. For though there be many that cannot be ſatiſfied wiſh goodes, that neuer reſt
<pb facs="tcp:14397:121"/>
toyling, that robbe their own bellies, yet fewe of them be without children or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Well, let it be they differ ſome what, yet they be but baſe drudges. Of the laſt ſort, that is, ſuch as ſtay and truſt vppon riches, there be infinite: for all are ſuch, vntil God worke in them the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Ye ſhall heare many ſay, I thanke God I am not conetous, If I were ſure to haue inough but to liue withall. I woulde haue leſſe care, and take leſſe paines. It is in ſome ſence, and as ſome ſpeake it, as much as to ſay, if I were ſure that Mammon my God were ſo great to kéep me, I would wiſh no more. Theſe men are afraid their riches will not ſuffice them and their poſteritie. For they imagine that their children can not liue but by them.</p>
               <p>It wil here be obiected, that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and requiſite to make prouiſion, and to lay vp for the children: and dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doeth teach, that ſuch as haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing left, doe ful ill. I anſwere, we muſt ſo lay vp, that we yet truſt not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14397:121"/>
to the riches which be vncertaine, but to the liuing Lord. Our life dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſo doe the liues of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And where it is ſaid, they doe ful il which haue little or nothing left them, that is through vnbeléefe. Is it maruell though the Lord ſuffer thouſands of ſuch as truſt in riches, to be depriued of his bleſſing? They fayle of riches, and haue no God to ſtay: vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſo doe pilfer and ſteale. But ſuch as feare the Lorde, and truſt in him, ſhall ve fed in the time of dearth. I haue béene young, and now am olde (ſaith the Prophet) yet ſaw I neuer the righteous forſaken, and his ſeed beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their bread.</p>
               <p>We ſée alſo many left in wealth that come to beggerie, and thouſandes lefte with nothing, which come to be wel able to liue. The parents which prouide that their children may haue prouiſion made for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſtes thereof, doe often geue them a knife to cutte their owne throate. For they be idle, and rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and learn no good trade to get their liuing. If that be once ſpent which was
<pb facs="tcp:14397:122"/>
left, they muſt begge, or ſteale. Thus I haue ſtoode ſomewhat largely, leaſt any ſhould take none to be couetous, but ſuch as to whom in euery reſpect the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here made by <hi>Solomon</hi> doeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>We muſt now come to the third ſort of men which do plague the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. Wée haue dealt with the idle, &amp; with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable couetouſe: there remaineth that foole which is wilfull and conceipted. He deſcribeth him in theſe wordes, that knoweth not to bee admoniſhed any more. He hath ſuch an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his owne wiſdome, and is ſo addicted to follow his owne braine, that let neuer ſo good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and admonition be giuen, he will not follow it. To make manifeſt how great the harme and dammage is, which this man doeth draw vpon himſelfe, and the miſchiefes and ſnares into which he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, <hi>Solomon</hi> doth very excellently ſet it foorth by compariſon.</p>
               <p>This foole (for ſo he termeth him) let him haue all the aduantages that may be to ſuch an one, yet ſhall they not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

him. Age is a great matter to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and a great helpe to goe through, becauſe it hath ſéene much. Riches and honour, and authoritie eſpecially when they be with the greateſt, as in kings, muſt néedes doo excéeding much. But yet all theſe, that is, age, riches, honor, power or authoritie, ſhall not be able to deliuer the wilful conceipted foole, that knoweth not to be admoniſhed, any more, from miſeries and dangers, no though hée be a king.</p>
               <p>This is the cauſe why he ſaith, <hi>better is a poore child that is wiſe, then an old king which is a foole, and knoweth not to be admoniſhed.</hi> And to ſhew how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ild, yet is he better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other. Thus
<pb facs="tcp:14397:123"/>
are we taught what miſchiefe hedſtrong follie doth carrie with it.</p>
               <p>But I muſt here make the matter a little plainer. It will be ſaid, what is this to declare the vanitie of life preſent. We ſhall ſeldome find ſuch a king, and if it fall out oftenner, yet doeth it touch but a few. I anſwer firſt that when this is a king, all the whole realme doth ſmart for it. A wiſe king is a great bleſſing vnto all his ſubiects. On the contrary ſuch a foole as is here deſcribed to be wilfull, and not knowing to be admoniſhed by wiſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, doeth not onely harme himſelfe, but wrappeth all his kingdome in cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. Great menne draw many with them, they fall not alone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwere that <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not meane to ſpeake this onely of a king, but by way of compariſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all other degrées of men. For thus muſt we reaſon, <hi>If an old king that is a foole, and knoweth not to be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed any more,</hi> be through his wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; headie conceipt, in worſe caſe then a poore childe, then other menne of leſſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14397:123"/>
power and wealth, though they be noble and rich can not be ſafe, and how ſhal the inferiour ſort of people then eſcape, I meane ſuch as be wilfull?</p>
               <p>Thus wée ſée how it concludeth all ſorts of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be addicted to their owne will, and be ſo wiſe in their owne eyes, that they wil not be counſelled. Now let vs ſée the difference betwéene them, by which is laid open the harme which hée doth to himſelfe. The one he ſaith (which is the poore childe) commeth out of priſon to raigne, alſo the other (that is the king which is a foole, and knoweth not to bée admoniſhed) is borne poore in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Here is wonderfull difference: the one out of pouertie and afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> riſeth vp into princely eſtate: the other doeth fall downe from his dignitie and power into calamitie. We haue example of this in holy ſcripture, poore <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was ſold for a bond man, he was caſt into priſon, and from thence he was lifted vp to be ruler ouer all Egipt. <hi>Sedekiah</hi> did not humble himſelfe before <hi>Ieremie</hi> the prophet at the mouth of the Lord, <hi>2. Chron. 36.</hi> and

therefore he was caſt downe. All wilfull fooles are not kings or princes, and ſo can not fall ſo high. But miſerable are the plagues if we behold them, among the children of men, which are wrought by wilfull conceipted fooles. It is a common ſicknes, euery man almoſt is wiſe, and many are ſo full with the opinion of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that they deſpiſe good councell, and good admonition. Looke what they ſet vpon, they go through with it in a gard, they plague others &amp; vndoo themſelues, they be vnrecouerable.</p>
               <p>For in the prouerbes <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thus: If thou braie a foole in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a peſtle among wheat, yet will not his fooliſhnes depart from him. This is to be vnderſtood of the ſimple foole, there is no tawing that can bring him to any paſſe: inſtruction or ſtripes and all will not ſerue: a foole will be a foole ſtill doe what ye can. In an other place of the Prouerbes, he ſaith thus, ſéeſt thou a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is wiſe in his owne conceipt, there is more hope of a foole then of him. Yée ſée he leaueth litle hope of a foole, when
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14397:124"/>
braying in a morter wil not ſerue. What hope is there then of this other kinde of foole, that is of him that is wiſe in his owne eies, whom he affirmeth to be the harder.</p>
               <p>In this place he is called a foole, not that he is ſo ſelie as to want common ſence, but becauſe there is no greater fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie then for a man to be wiſe in his owne eies. There be many of theſe fooles which be craftie fooles, they be déepe in fetches, ſuſpicious, vaineglorious, and proude. It is not poſſible with wordes to expreſſe what inconueniences and plagues theſe bring vnto countries, townes, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies where they beare ſway: ye ſhall ſée them like vnto vnbrideled coltes. It is no meruaile though <hi>Solomon</hi> did behold theſe, and bring them in as a part of the plagues which are vnder the ſun. There be an innumerable rabblement of idle fooles, which fold vp their hands, and eat their owne fleſh. There be many miſers which turmoile without end to heape vp riches for they can not tell whom: they pinch their owne bellies. There be alſo
<pb facs="tcp:14397:125"/>
as we may well perceiue, if we looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the quarrels in law, and contentions among ſocieties and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies, that there be alſo very many conceipted fooles, all is full of fooles, the whole world is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with fooles.

to true bleſſednes. I did alſo note that it conſiſteth of two partes.

                  </gap>licitie is in god, he is the fountaine of happines. We haue this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo engrauen in our mindes, that ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are bleſſed as be in Gods fauor, and therfore he muſt be worſhipped, and his diſpleaſure muſt be appeaſed.</p>
               <p>Theſe pointes <hi>Solomon</hi> doeth not touch at all, for he néeded not: but how to ſéeke God aright, and to worſhip him as he may accept and be pleaſed, that is the
<pb facs="tcp:14397:128"/>
thing. For when it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to this, men faile and are fooliſh: they ſéeke him, they worſhip him, faine they would haue his anger appeaſed towards them, and be in his fauour, but they doe it ſo fondly, that they be neuer the better but the worſe. Let vs therfore be taught here by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> how to auoyde ſo intollerable a miſchiefe, which we be all ready is run into.</p>

and now is, that neither at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, neither in this mountaine ye ſhall worſhip the father. And againe he ſaith, that the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip in ſpirite and truth.

               <p>But yet neuertheleſſe theſe words do ſtand ſtill vnto vs. We haue Gods houſe where he is chiefly to be ſought and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, euen the publike aſſembly. For God hath ordeyned ſhepeheards and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to call the flocke together, &amp; to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Where two or thrée are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middeſt of them. <hi>Matth. 19.</hi> The holy<note place="margin">Math. 19.</note> prophete of God did ſtagger when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the proſperitie of the wicked, and the affliction of the iuſt, <hi>Pſalm. 73.</hi> He could<note place="margin">Pſalm. 73.</note> not tell how to be ſatiſfied, vntil he went (as he ſaith) into the ſanctuaries of God, there God reſolued him of his great doubt. We muſt therefore goe to Gods houſe to ſéeke ſuch bleſſings, and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb facs="tcp:14397:129"/>
and praiſe God together. No man can be a right worſhipper of God in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, that doeth not frequent the publike aſſemblies, where God ſpeaketh to his people. We muſt all of vs, if we be wiſe, goe to Gods houſe: but that is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, marke what he giueth in precept: <hi>take heed to thy feete.</hi> This muſt néeds be a borowed ſpéech: for wée may not be ſo ſimple, as to vnderſtand it of the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly féet. He doeth not ſet downe a charge to will men to looke how they ſtep in the way when they goe to the Church. It is to be vnderſtood of the hart and mind, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to ſéeke and worſhip God.</p>
               <p>It is therfore as much as to ſay, when thou wilt ſéeke God &amp; worſhip him, take héed how thy heart and minde do come, for thou mayeſt goe awry. There is a right way, and there is a wrong way: if thou goe in the right way, thou art bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: if thou goe in the wrong way thou doeſt marre all, thou ſhalt kindle Gods wrath againſt thée. Then next he doeth in generall expreſſe which is the right way, and which is the wrong. The one
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14397:129"/>
is in theſe words, <hi>draw neare to heare.</hi> The other in theſe, <hi>rather then to offer the ſacrifice of fooles, for they perceiue not that they do euill. Solomon</hi> doeth in a worde ſet downe that which Moſes and the Prophetes doo ſo much and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vrge, namely that the true worſhip of God hath for the ground &amp; foundation, ſincere obedience. Harken to the voice of the Lord thy God in all that he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thée: thou ſhalt walke in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, his ſtatutes, ordinances and lawes. Thou ſhalt adde nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his word, thou ſhalt take nothing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fro.</p>
               <p>In this place he ſaith, <hi>draw neare to hearken:</hi> that is to be vnderſtood that we muſt giue eare vnto y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: for there ought to be no voice in Gods houſe but his owne. It is high ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge for any other voice but Gods to be vttered there. And Chriſt ſaith hée is the true ſhéepeheard, his ſhéepe heare his voice, but a ſtranger they will not heare. The true and faithful paſtors, when they preach, vttering nothing but Gods word,
<pb facs="tcp:14397:130"/>
it is not their owne voice, but his. There is one lawe giuer, which is able to ſaue and to deſtroy, wée haue then one ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lord and King, euen the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: and firſt wée muſt begin with this, to giue eare vnto his voice. We know not how to worſhip him: we may not worſhip him after our owne deuiſes, for of ſuch hée ſaith, they worſhip me in vaine, teaching for doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines mens precepts, he hath preſcribed fully and perfectly in euery point, how we ſhall worſhip him.</p>
               <p>We are therfore willed to draw neare to heare. For if we faile in this, and will be worſhippers, not regarding to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, we faile in the foundation and goe awrie out of the waie in all that we doo. Therefore herein, <hi>take heed to thy feet when thou goeſt to Gods houſe:</hi> to heare and not to doo, is not worth ought. Be ye doers of the word and not hearers onely, deceiuing your ſelues. <hi>Iam. 1.</hi> And our ſauiour ſaith, if any heare my words &amp; doo them not, I will liken him to a man that buildeth his houſe vpon the ſande<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:14397:130"/>
great is the fall of that houſe, <hi>Matth. 7.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> The holy Scripture doth not account it worth the name of hearing, vnles a man be a doer.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, this is to be wel obſerued when he ſaith, <hi>drawe neere to hearken,</hi> for it teacheth that the true worſhippers muſt haue a readie and chearefull minde to hearken. Loue and reuerence to their God, doeth make them delight in his voyce, and not that onely, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which we receiue by his worde, he doeth beget vs by it, to be his children, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith. We are borne, not of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, but of immortall ſéede, the worde of God which indureth for euer. Of his owne good will (ſaith S. <hi>Iames</hi>) hath hée begotten vs with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of trueth: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let euery man be ſwift to heare. By hearing the holy word, wee become the ſonnes and daughters of God. If wée be ſwift to heare, and kéepe, happie are we. For our Sauiour ſaith, Bleſſed are they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat heare the word of God, and kéepe it. To make this yet more plaine, why wée <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hould drawe nigh to hearken, I will
<pb facs="tcp:14397:131"/>
ſpeake ſome what more of the new birth which is wrought thereby. We are all dy nature the children of wrath, in as much as we be borne in ſinne. All that is in vs is but fleſh, that is to be crucified with the luſts and concupiſcences. This mortification of the fleſh through the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, is called the putting off the old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is wrought by learning, God hath appointed his worde for to purge vs. All our vncleannes is to be cleanſed away by the pure word. Ignorance, hereſie, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, darkenes, and vnbeléefe, are expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by it.</p>
               <p>Then further, there is the true image of God to be ſet vp, which is called the putting on of the new man, which after God is created in righteouſnes and true holines. The bleſſed ſpirite of grace breathing life and all good thinges into our ſoules, doeth it by hearing the word. It is therefore the ſwéete foode of our ſoules, the Preachers are called Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, which féede the Lords flock. We may well ſee there is no comming to ſéek God, and to worſhip him, but this way.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14397:131"/>
This is the right way, take héede to thy féet for to walke in it, draw néere to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Learne by the word of the Lorde how thou mayſt worſhip him aright.</p>
               <p>I will come now to the other parte, which is the worſhippe diſalowed, called the ſacrifice of fooles. In olde time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comming of Chriſt, God inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many ceremonies &amp; ſacrifices, which did ſhadow things to come. Theſe was the Church then to be exerciſed in. Not that he eſtéemed the doing of thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things ſo much, or accounted his worſhip to conſiſt therein: but he regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the inward faith, and integritie of heart.</p>
               <p>Thoſe outward ordinances were but for helpes to further faith: and true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. When they offered ſlayne beaſts in ſacrifice, Chriſt was repreſented, and withall, the offerer did declare his faith and repentance thereby. This was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, or not regarded of many, and ſo they offered their ſacrifices, omitting the chiefe vſe, as though they had doone the Lord a pleaſure. This wee may ſée by
<pb facs="tcp:14397:132"/>
the <hi>Pſalm. 50.</hi> And many are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> of the prophets againſt ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers. They neglect the holy doctrine of God, and be ignorant and vnſkilfull in his waies, for which he calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fooles in this place. He doth wiſh men to take héed of it, becauſe theſe fooles doo nothing but ſinne, when they come to worſhip God. Al that they doo is accurſed and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, yea euen their praiers &amp; whols worſhip, yet (he ſaith) they doo not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that they doo euill. Their blind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſéeke God ſéemeth to themſelues a goodly ie well, and that is one great part of their follie. Thus we ſée the ſenſe of his wordes.</p>
               <p>Now will I come to apply this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine more particularly, that wée may know who they be that erre, &amp; how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable their eſtate is. And firſt I will beginne with the church of Rome and all Papiſts. This doctrine doth ouerthrow them, for this beyng true, they can not be the Church of God. There is no draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing néere to hearken to the word of God among them, they haue baniſhed it and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14397:132"/>
buried it. God ſpeaketh not in their ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoges, but the deuiſes of men are ſet vp: therefore all their worſhip is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of fooles. They do ſinne, they be abominable and accurſed in all their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>It is a vaine excuſe when they alledge, wée worſhip none but the true God, we worſhip Chriſt. When ye ſée it plaine that a man may goe to Gods owne houſe where his worde is purely taught, and ſéeks to worſhip the very true God, and yet offer the ſacrifice of fooles, if he giue not eare to be taught in the holy doctrine.

               <p>I know it will be here replied, that the Scripture doeth promiſe, that he which calleth vpon God ſhalbe heard, and at what time ſoeuer a ſinner doeth repents him of his ſinne, all his wickednes ſhall be done away. This muſt néeds be true, but yet wee muſt vnderſtande, that the prayer and repentance which are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before God, procéed from faith, which is Gods gifte, the work of the holy ghoſt, and not in a mans owne power.

And this is by the worde, as he ſaith in the ſame place, if ye abide in me, and my word abide in you, aſke what ye will, and it ſhall be done vnto you.</p>
               <p>Wherefore brethren, receiue this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Solomon, Take heede to thy feet when thou goeſt to Gods houſe, &amp; drawe neere to hearken, rather then to offer the ſacrifice of fooles.</hi> Bow down with reuerence, with feare &amp; trembling, to heare the voyce of your God, and to know and obey his will: then crie, &amp; he will he are you, your prayer ſhal come vp before him as ſwéete incenſe.

               <p>Now in this he giueth rules how we are to ſpeake vnto him. For in Gods houſe, the Lord God ſpeaketh vnto vs, &amp; againe we ſpeake vnto him. He ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth when the faithfull ſhéepheards doo declare his word. We ſpeake in prayer, in thankeſgiuing, in making promiſes &amp; vowes.

Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe we be corrupt, and all that we ſpeake is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and vile, vnleſſe it be ordered by his holy ſpirit. Therfore we muſt be taught of him how to ſpeake: we may not come at aduenture before the Lord to ſpeake vnto him, for he is a great king, and wée are poore and baſe wormes. He is full of glory, power, and heauenly maieſtie, we are duſt &amp; aſhes. We ought to conſider therefore into whoſe preſence we come, and vnto whom we ſpeake: and this is it which he ſaith, <hi>God is in heauen, and thou art vpon the earth.</hi>

there is no man would take it well, but thinke he were mocked and deſpiſed as a foole, if men ſhould ſpeake ſo vnto him, as they do vnto God. It is true that there be ſome outward ſignes of reuerence, as knéeling or vowing, which is méete, but God doth looke vpon the hart.

I ſay what a great and glorious God hee is. His maieſtie and power are aboue the heauens. He is iuſt, holy and good, a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all iniquitie and vncleanneſſe: the fountaine and giuer of all good things: lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the faithfull, and a moſt terrible God to the wicked. Then looke vpon thy ſelfe, remember that he ſaith here, <hi>thou art vpon earth.</hi> Thou art weake, baſe, ſinfull and miſerable.

Looke what he doeth promiſe to giue, craue it earneſtly with ſtedfaſt faith, and with a groning ſpirite. Not thus when they come to ſpeake vnto God, are raſhe &amp; fooliſh, they imagine that the very bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of words is a ſeruice of God, and as the blind Papiſtes thought, if a man did one day ſay more then his ordinarie ſtint, God was in his debte: and wée ſée how the fooliſh pardons are granted from the biſhop of Rome, with condition that a

The hungrie and thirſtie ſoule doth make as great haſt vnto God, and doth vehemently crie out to be refreſhed: ſuch doth God call for, ſuch onely doth he heare, all other doo not pray, but babble. The prophet <hi>Ieſay</hi> chapt. 55. doth in the<note place="margin">Ieſay. 55.</note> name of the Lord proclaime, Come to the waters all that be a thirſt.

               <p>All this is to be done as he willeth in fewe words, for it followeth after he had ſaid, God is in heauen and thou art vpon the earth, therfore let thy words be few. The faithful ſoule doth crie continuallie vnto God: for being in continuall néede, it watcheth vnto prayer. But yet the words are fewe.

               <p>In old time ſome of the kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> did cauſe the people to ſweare, that they would ſerue the Lord &amp; cleane vnto him, and renounce the worſhip of idols. Holy men of God in their afflictions did vow and promiſe to God, that when he ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:14397:140"/>
deliuer them, they would openly declare his praiſe. We haue in baptiſme vowed to conſecrate our ſelues, euen our ſoules &amp; our bodies to God, by renouncing the diuell, the world, and the fleſh. If we goe backe from this our vowe, how can we come rightly to Gods table? for there we doe alſo renew the ſame: wée bind our ſelues with promiſes vnto God. There be alſo particuler vowes &amp; promiſes, as euery man hath cauſe. If we féele our ſelues ſlacke vnto good duties, we are to ſtirre vp our ſelues, &amp; to bind our ſelues by ſome earneſt promiſe to God. If we be inclined to any vice, we are to doo the like When we be in diſtres &amp; ſéeke helpe at Gods hands, we promiſe vpon our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance to be thankefull and obedient. We muſt take héed in al theſe that we be not raſh with our mouth, nor let our hart make haſt to vtter a promiſe. We muſt be well aduiſed what we ſweare &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to God. What a fault is it accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in ſuch as will promiſe much vnto men, &amp; performe little? do not all deſpiſe ſuch perſons? the fault is much greater when
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14397:140"/>
there is promiſe made vnto God and not performed. He willeth therefore that he which hath vowed be not flacke to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his vow: they be vaine fooles which make promiſe and pay it not: &amp; God is not delighted in fooles, God is delighted in his true worſhippers.</p>
               <p>Vow therefore and performe. For he ſaith, it is better not to vow, then to vow and not to performe: we are to vow vnto God, and therefore it is euill not to vow: but it is a greater euill to vow, &amp; not to doo that we haue vowed. Men are raſh &amp; afterward doo repent, then ſéeke they to excuſe the matter that they did ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but this will not ſerue, for he ſaith, <hi>Suffer not thy mouth to cauſe thy fleſh to ſinne, and ſay not before the Angell that it is an errour: why ſhould God be angrie at thy voice &amp; deſtroy the worke of thy handes.</hi> He that raſhly maketh vowes to God, may very well be ſaid to ſuffer his mouth to cauſe his fleſh to ſin, that is himſelfe, a part being put for the whole.

health againe, and geue mee life, I will neuer be the man I haue béene. I haue liued a naughtie life, I haue diſhonoured God, I haue deſpiſed his worde, I will harken to his voice, &amp; leaue my naughty vices, and liue to Gods glorie.

What ſhall wee ſay of theſe men, are they not gréeuous offenders? I haue obſerued ſome very wicked liuers: God hath ſtricken them, and terrified them, ſo that with teares they haue confeſſed their vngodly beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. They haue promiſed and vowed, if God would reſtore them, to become new men. They haue recouered, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as vile in ſinne as before. God hath ſtricken them againe, and they haue died in fury and rage, without any apparance of grace, or remorſe. Doth not this ſhew that Gods wrath is heauie againſt ſuch faithleſſe vow breakers?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:14397:142"/>Let men (as he ſaith) feare God. Let them take héede how they dallie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, for ſure God will deſtroy ſuch, and al the worke of their handes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith <hi>pay that thou voweſt,</hi> hee condemneth all thoſe raſhe vowes which are not agréeable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule of Gods word, which be not to his glory, or that be not in our power. For ſuch vowes are not to be performed. King <hi>He rod</hi> promiſed with an oath to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Herodias,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would geue what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhe ſhould aſke, to the halfe of his kingdome. She aſked the head of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, it had béene much better for him to haue repented of his raſh oath, &amp; not haue performed it, then to ſhedde the innocent bloud of ſo great a ſeruant of God. <hi>Iephtha</hi> vowed when hee went to warre, that if the Lord ſhould geue him victorie, at his returne that which ſhould firſt come out at his dores to méete him, ſhould be the Lords, or els he would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it for a burnt offering.

to the Lord. What warrant had he to make ſuch a vowe? how ſhould it be to Gods glorie? He was puniſhed, for his daughter (being his onely child) firſt met him, and though it were gréeuous, he did with her as he had vowed: ſhe was let go a time to bewayle her virginitie, &amp; then put a parte to the Lorde, and reſtrayned from mariage, for ſo they thought it muſt be, and it is ſaid ſhe knew no man: and by a decrée the daughters of Iſrael went yere by yere, foure dayes in the yere, to talke with the daughter of <hi>Iephtha:</hi> for it is too hard to charge a faithfull man w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſlaying his daughter in ſacrifice. Many haue béene deceiued in ſo thinking, the Church of Rome wil haue men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vow virginitie. Our Sauiour ſaith all men are not able to doe ſo, to liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, but thoſe to whom it is geuen. To the ſame effect teacheth Saint <hi>Paul, 1. Cor. 7.</hi> They againe replie and ſay, let<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> a man aſke, and he ſhall receiue.</p>
               <p>But this is true againſt them, that he which receiueth that he doeth aſke, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that which God hath promiſed to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14397:143"/>
geue him: or els, if hee take vpon him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which God doeth not promiſe to make him able to performe, he may aſke, &amp; not receiue, for he tempteth God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth a gréeuous ſinne. And we may ſée by lamentable experience, how God hath puniſhed ſuch raſh vowes: when the ſtink of that horrible filthines which was committed euery where by monks, friers, nunnes, &amp; prieſtes, is not yet out of our noſes. All ſuch vowes are abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable. Vow according to Gods holie wil, to his glory and praiſe, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he hath promiſed to inhable vs by his grace to performe, and pay it.</p>
               <p>It is a ſinne not to vow ſuch things: it is a greater ſinne, to vowe and not to performe them. I will here end, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into that ſea of fooliſh, raſh, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcrete vowes, which vpon euery occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion both men and women doo take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not conſidering to whom they ſpeak.
