         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pariſh.</speaker>
               <p>SIR, though I juſtly eſteem my ſelf, who am ſo
great a ſinner, unworthy of the honour to ſuffer
for the Name of Chriſt, yet I know it is my Duty
to be prepared in Spirit for it, if God vouchſafe
to call me to it. I requeſt therefore your Paſtoral aſſiſtance
herein, that whether I live, I may live unto the Lord; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I die, I may die unto the Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>I bleſs God (Dear Sir) who inclines your heart to ſeek
after ſuch holy diſpoſitions as are required in thoſe whom Chriſt
will honour in calling them to ſuffer for his Name. But, I pray,
tell me, Why you are at this time ſo ſollicitous to gather up your
Spirit into that frame?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pariſh.</speaker>
               <p>There need no account be given of that, betwixt you
and I, who have been fellow-ſufferers in the late times, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to the cauſe of our Soveraign, and of the Proteſtant
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95460:3"/>
Church of <hi>England;</hi> and whoſe Perſons and Fortunes do yet
wear the Scars of their Loyalty: and we are not ſecure, that we
may not be called to ſuffer on the ſame account again.</p>
               <p>And though neither of us have at any time (bleſſed be God)
made any unkind returns to thoſe who then Perſecuted us, nor
have ſince gained any thing by our Loyalty but our loſſes; yet if
the like times ſhould return again, we are like to be in the firſt
rank of Sufferers.</p>
               <p>But I confeſs, that though the Cauſe we then undertook and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for, was as juſt a Cauſe as any could fall out in a Chriſtian
Nation, yet I then both acted and ſuffered in another manner of
Spirit, than I now ſee reaſon to deſire to be acted by. I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
think then, and do ſo ſtill, that I was bound in conſcience
to do my utmoſt to ſecure the Perſon and Honour of my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
and to maintain the Laws both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical
then in being, till they ſhould be orderly changed by the Conſent
and Authority of my Soveraign in Parliament; yet I did (as I
fear too many of our ſide did) eſpouſe an humour of Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
in oppoſition to that Profeſſion of Godlineſs, which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncharitably
thought, that all on the other ſide did make only to
drive on Rebellious Deſigns: which probably the great Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of our troubles did do. And certainly we Royaliſts, by
the overſpreading of prophaneneſs amongſt us, ruined the beſt
Cauſe that ever Loyal Subjects undertook to bear up upon the
points of their Swords. But it is another manner of Spirit I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
now to be baptiſed into; namely, that whereinto our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lord and Saviour, and his Holy Apoſtles and Martyrs were
baptiſed.</p>
               <p>And to deal plainly, I do not think the next Tempeſt that will
Aſſault us will come from that Quarter.</p>
               <p>My chief fears therefore are, from the ſucceſs of Popiſh Arms
abroad, (eſpecially under the Conduct of that Great Monarch
who ſeems to have ſworn the utter extirpation of the Proteſtant
Name) and the prevailing of Popiſh Arts at home to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of us, with Diviſion upon Diviſion. Theſe, I ſay, with the
loud crying ſins done and countenanced amongſt us, makes me
expect a Storm, and I deſire to be prepared for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>I hope God will bleſs the unwearied endeavours of our
Gracious Soveraign, and his moſt Honourable Privy Council at
preſent, and of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, (when one ſhall by his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95460:3"/>
Sacred Majeſty be called) to fruſtrate the Attempts of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Adverſaries both at home and abroad.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pariſh.</speaker>
               <p>I thankfully acknowledg, that by the bleſſing of God
on the Prudent Conduct of publick Affairs by his Sacred Majeſty,
we yet enjoy Peace, when many of the neighbouring Nations
round about us feel the ſad miſeries of War: ſo that if our ſins
ſtood neuter, and did not ſtrike in with our Enemies, I would
not fear either their Forces or Conſults: but alas! there can be
no Fencing or Walling betwixt us and Heaven, to which our ſins
cry aloud for vengeance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>It is very true, we are great ſinners, but not greater than
other Nations whom God is pleaſed yet to reſpit; what ſins
therefore of this Nation ſeem to you ſo ripe for vengeance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pariſh.</speaker>
               <p>Truly there are many of them, and ſome of them
ſeem eſpecially to call for Popery, as the only ſcammony ſtrong
enough to purge them out: Such are the frequent and avowed
Sinonaical Contracts betwixt ſome Patrons and their unworthy
Clerks. Such alſo are the moſt unchriſtian practices of many of
our Planters abroad, not only in the inhumane cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
they exerciſe upon the poor Negroes,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Godwin's</hi> Negro's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</note>
and other Heathen their Slaves, but eſpecially in their
diſcouraging and oppoſing all endeavours for the
Converſion of thoſe poor Infidels to Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>For have not the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Prieſts travelled to the vaſt Plain
of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and Mountains of <hi>Africa,</hi> to propagate their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition?
Yea, have not the Jeſuits, and other <hi>Romiſh</hi> Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
gone to the furtheſt <hi>Indies</hi> to ſpread that ſort of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which they profeſs? and probably they taught for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of it, the Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,
though they built Hay, Straw and Stubble on that Foundation.
And their Converts in <hi>Japan</hi> and other where, ſuffering for the
owning one God and one Mediator 'twixt God and Man (Chriſt
Jeſus) are juſtly numbred in the Catalogue of Chriſtian Martyrs.
Shall not theſe <hi>Romaniſts</hi> therefore riſe up in Judgment againſt us
and other Proteſtants, who oppoſe the Converſion of our own
Slaves? Nay, may not God juſtly ſay to them concerning us as he
did once to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Ezek. 29. 20. <hi>That he gave him the
Land of</hi> Aegypt <hi>as his hire for his labour wherewith he ſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi>
Tyre. So may God ſay, He will give unto the Popiſh Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
thoſe Proteſtant Churches, (who are negligent in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95460:4"/>
the Faith) as their hire for that ſervice they have ſerved
againſt Heatheniſme in the new found world.</p>
               <p>And did not thoſe excellent Perſons who preached before the
Lords and Commons on the Faſt-day <hi>Dec.</hi> 22. 1681. proclaime
it in the Name of the Lord, <hi>That the vine bringing forth ſowre

               <p>So that if we eſtimate the Preſent Quarrel by the Practice of

               <p>I do readily grant it, but then they are thoſe who

They acting therefore according to the Benevolent Principles of

forced by their Prieſts, or willing to be bitterly cruel to their

               <p>The Method I will obſerve in my Diſcourſe ſhall be this:</p>

               <p>III. What promiſes God hath made both of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

            <sp>

               <p>Sir, I am glad we are come to this ſweet Theme,

I. Who ſuffers, for refuſing to ſtrengthen the hands of Wicked
Men in their Wickedneſs, by his Conſent or Example.</p>
            <p>II. Who ſuffers, for Promoting the Churches Peace.</p>

if we Suffer on this account, becauſe we will by our profeſſed
obedience to God's Law, give teſtimony to his Sovereignty,
and to the Equity and Excellency of that Rule he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to his Rational Creatures, we may juſtly be ſtiled
God's Martyrs. And in particular, if we Suffer, for <hi>Fearing
God and the King, and not medling with thoſe who are given to
change,</hi> but that in Conſcience towards God we retain our
Loyalty to our Sovereign, it is a Suffering for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pariſh.</speaker>
               <p>But will the Suffering in the Cauſe of ſtrict Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities,
in title Chriſtians to Martyrdom?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; For Morality or Conformity to the Moral Law
in our Duty to God and Men (for God's ſake) is ſo great a
part of the obedience of Faith given to the Rule or the New
Creature, that he who Suffers, rather than he will offend
againſt the Moral Law, In Conſcience that God who made
him, and Chriſt who Redeem'd him, requires that he ſhould
live by that Rule, in order to God's Glory, his own and
others good, is God's and Chriſt's Martyr. And be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of it, Good Men ſhall not want occaſion of Suffering
on that account, eſpecially in ſuch days and places, wherein
almoſt every thing is countenanced, but Piety and Virtue.</p>
               <p>Next, If you Suffer for promoting the Peace of the Church,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95460:6"/>
and oppoſing Schiſms and Diviſions amongſt Brethren, you
Suffer for the Name of Chriſt: and you cannot want occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Suffering if than be your deſign, ſo long as the Zeal
for or againſt our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Littleiſmes, flames out at the top
of every Chimney.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pariſh.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed it is eaſily obſervable, that thoſe good and
moderate Men, who have endeavoured to remove the Fewel
of our preſent Contentions, are as violently aſſaulted by the
fierce Men (the Bigotts on both ſides) as if they were the
declared Enemies of both the Contending Parties: however
I reſolve, through the Grace of God, to follow your
Example and Doctrine herein, both to pray and ſtrive for
the Peace of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by all lawful means. For I believe,
if I ſhould dye at the Stake for the Profeſſion of the moſt
precious Truths of the Goſpel, and yet be a divider of
Chriſt's Church, I ſhould be condemned to be a Firebrand
in Hell by the Prince of Peace.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>But when I preſs you to contend for the Peace of the
Church, I mean not only the Peace of the particular Society
of Chriſtians amongſt whom your Reſidence and Cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
calls you to communicate in Publick Worſhip; But alſo
to promote the Catholick Unity of the Catholick Church,
by vertue of which it is, <hi>That every Baptized Chriſtian, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, and bringing ſufficient Evidence or Credentials of
his Chriſtianity, may, as a Member of that one Body, under Chriſt
the Head, Challenge the Priviledge of Communion in all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of Chriſt with any Society of Chriſtianst or partionlar
Church) where ever he happens to live, or occaſionally to come,</hi>
For if any Society of Chriſtians ſhall impale themſelves by
mutual Compacts, or by ſetting up other new and unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Terms of Communion with them, ſo as to exclude from
their Communion other Chriſtians cohabiting with them, or
coming to them, they are therein Schiſmatical; eſpecially if
thoſe Terms be ſuch as the Neighbor or Stranger-Chriſtian
cannot comply to without wrong to his own Conſcience.</p>
               <p>I do indeed judge, that if the Terms of Communion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
though new and narrower then Chriſt hath required
to make us Members of his Catholick Church, be ſuch as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95460:7"/>
I can comply to wihout Sin, I ought not to diſturb the Peace
of the particular Church where I am, by a ſtiff oppoſing of
them, eſpecially if I have ſufficiently proteſted my Right and
Priviledge as a Member of the Catholick Church, to have
Communion allowed me without ſuch Impoſals: For my
Chriſtian Liberty gives me a Latitude <hi>to become all things</hi>
(not ſinful) <hi>to all men:</hi> And though a particular Church
may be Schiſmatical in impoſing ſuch new and narrow Terms
of Communion with her, as Chriſt never impoſed, to make us
Members of his Catholick Church, yet if I ſeparate cauſleſly,
(that is; where I can Communicate without Sin) I am Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
alſo; ſo that at the ſame time a Church may be Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
in impoſing uneceſſary Terms of Communion, and
a particular Chriſtian may be Schiſmatical in refuſing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
to thoſe Terms, if he can comply to them without
Sin.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Sir, I thank you; for by this Information you have
contributed not only to make eaſie to me my Compliance to
juſt Eccleſiaſtical Laws, (which I did ſomething ſcruple, on
conceit that my yielding betray'd my Chriſtian Liberty) but
alſo to enlarge my ſpecial Brotherly Love to all Chriſtians
as Members of the ſame Body with me under Chriſt our Head:
and you have given my Conſcience a latitude, and my Heart
a readineſs to join in worſhip with any Chriſtian, where
ever I come, and may be admitted; and to receive readily,
as much as in me lies, any Chriſtian to Communion with
me, and with that Society of Chriſtians amongſt whom I Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
and Communicate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>Next, if you ſuffer for not complying to ſinful Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
ſuch as is forbidden by God, as unworthy to be offered
up to his Glorious Majeſty, you ſuffer for Righteouſneſs
ſake, and the Commands of God, with the examples of the
Saints in all Ages will juſtifie you herein. Nay further, if
you ſuffer for exerciſing the true Worſhip of God, either
ſingly, (as <hi>Daniel)</hi> or ſocially with other Devout Perſons
fearing God (as the Primitive Chriſtians) did daily and
weekly,<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 10.</note> not forſaking the aſſembling themſelves together,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. You ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake: For God is
God, and is to be worſhiped, whether man will allow it or
no.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95460:7"/>
I ſpeak not this, as if I thought it unlawful for the Civil
Governor, when any of his Subjects ſhall Aſſemble in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Number, to require ſecurity of them, that they will
not under pretence of Divine Worſhip (like the <hi>Galileans,</hi>
whoſe blood <hi>Pilate</hi> mingled with their Sacrifice) complot
the Diſturbance of the Publick Peace.</p>
               <p>Next, if you ſuffer for holding faſt, and contending for
the Faith and Truth once, and at once, <hi>delivered to the Saints,</hi>
you ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake.</p>
               <p>And this hath been, and will be the moſt general cauſe of
Suffering to the Saints of God: For they are Children of
the Light, and of the Truth; and by Publiſhing and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Truth, they not only turn others <hi>from darkneſs
to light,</hi> but alſo <hi>from the power of Satan unto God;</hi> which
makes him and his Inſtruments rage againſt it.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, He ſuffers for Righteouſneſs, who ſuffers
from Athieſts, for owning the belief of a God; that is, for
profeſſing to believe, That there is a Glorious and Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible
Being eternally exiſting, unmade and diſtinct
from all things that are made unmeaſurable in his Infinite
Preſence, Infinitely, Powerful, Wiſe, Good, and All-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
who made, preſerves, and Governs all things, and is to
be Feared, Loved, Truſted in, and to be Submited to, Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Worſhiped by all Men and Angels, and to be deſired
and choſen by them as their Portion and Happineſs.</p>
               <p>Next, He Suffers on the ſame good account, who Suffers
from <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Polytheiſts,</hi> for profeſſing to believe there
is One onely God; and thus ſome amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> yea,
and amongſt the <hi>Heathen</hi> (as <hi>Socrates)</hi> and thouſands of
the Primitive Chriſtians Suffered, and are Martyres of God;
yet they were by the <hi>Polytheiſts</hi> reputed <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> becauſe
they denied their falſe Gods.</p>
               <p>Next, He Suffers for Righteouſneſs Sake, who Suffers
from <hi>Materialiſts</hi> or <hi>Hobbiſts,</hi> for profeſſing that God is a
Glorious Spritual Being, free and unconſtrained by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or fatal neceſſity, who is every where intire, and not
divided into parts, <hi>Working all Things according to his own
Will.</hi> And indeed <hi>Hobbiſm</hi> (or <hi>Hylexiſm)</hi> is but a blanched
and diſguiſed <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and is the Pander to all ſenſual
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95460:8"/>
Luſts, and the Canker of Loyalty, and incourager of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
               <p>Next, He is God's and Chriſt's Martyr, who Suffers for
the <hi>Arrian</hi> or <hi>Socinian,</hi> for profeſſing to believe, according
to the Revelation of God concerning himſelf, that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Godhead, through its Infinite Perfection, ſubſiſts in
Three, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghoſt;</hi> owning that Unity,
and undividing Communion of Eſſence, do each of them
imply Perfection, and are a way of Subſiſtence proper to the
Godhead, and as incommunicable and unparallel'd in the
Creatures, as his Eternity of duration, or the immenſity of
his ſpiritual Preſence are.</p>
               <p>And Thouſands of Chriſtians thus Suffered of Old under
the <hi>Arrians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, He is a Martyr of Jeſus, who Suffers from <hi>Jew,
Mahometan, Heathen,</hi> or any other Inſidel, for profeſſing to
believe, <hi>That Jeſus conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and born of the
Virgin</hi> Mary at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> in the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> the

<hi>That in him all Nations ſhould be Bleſſed, and he ſhould
be a Covenant to all People, and bear our Sins, and have the
Chaſtiſements of our Peace laid on him;</hi> that is, that he ſhould,
as a Mediator betwixt God and Man, Seal a new Covenant
for us in his Blood, wherein God promiſeth pardon to the
Penitent Believer, and grace to the humble Suppliant, and
peace to the Contrito, and glory to the perſevering in Faith
and Holineſs, and that his Death is the onely Propitiation
for our Sins, and that he accordingly dyed for our Sins, and
confirmed thereby the Covenant, and <hi>roſe again the third day,
and aſcended into Heaven, and ſitteth on the right hand of God,</hi>
being exalted even in his Humane Nature above the higheſt

be ſaved, but the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Chriſtian may meet with Sufferings alſo from other
Sects, but the main Sect and Hereſie againſt which I perceive
you deſire to be fortified, is that of the Papiſts, from whom
ten thouſand times ten thouſand of the Saints of God have
ſuffered, for owning the Faith <hi>once delivered to the Saints;</hi>
and that Whore ſitting on the Scarlet Beaſt, hath made her
ſelf drunk with the Blood of the Martyrs of <hi>Jeſus;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 6.</note> though

            <sp>

               <p>It is indeed my chief deſire to be fortified in ſuffering

               <p>You ſuffer therefore as a Martyr of Jeſus, if you ſuffer
becauſe you own that God ſince the writing of the Scriptures
hath appointed them to thoſe who have them as an intire
rule of Faith in all things, which God hath by Revelation
made known concerning the way in which he will carry on

the firſt Chriſtians was built upon Oral Tradiſion and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetical
Inſtitution.<note place="margin">The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was our Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday to the <hi>Jews,</hi> on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſending Quails and Manna.</note>

            <sp>

               <p>You ſay right, the Patriarchs Doctrine of Faith,
about the Creation of the World, about the Fall of Man,
about the promiſed Seed, and about Sacrifices Tythes, the
Patriarchal Sabbath, and Marriage, was at firſt delivered by
Oral Tradition, and derived by Catechiſing from Father to
Son: But after that the Nations had corrupted the true
Doctrine, and Adulterated the Tradition, it pleaſed God
to inſpire <hi>Moſes</hi> to write all that Tradition Doctrine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all Mankind, and alſo what was peculiar to <hi>Abreham</hi>'s
Poſterity, ſo that no part of the Traditional Doctrine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95460:9"/>
to Salvation was left unwritten: And the Prophet
afterwards having more particular Revelations about the
time, place, and other circumſtances of the Conception,
Birth, Preaching, Miracles, Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the promiſed Seed penned them likewiſe: So that the
great Tradition that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was to derive down
from Generation to Generation, was the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi>
and the other divinely inſpired Penmen as the intire Rule of
their Faith in the Meſſiah to come. So alſo what was neceſſary
to be believed of what our Lord Jeſus Chriſt (come in the
Fleſh) Taught and ordained, did and ſuffered, is intively col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, and no
Doctrine of Chriſt neceſſary to be believed, nor Inſtitution
of Chriſt neceſſary to be obeyed, is left out of the ſaid Holy
Writings to be derived down by Oral Tradition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is an intollerable injury done to Chriſtians; to deny
them the liberty of Reading the Scriptures in their own
Tongue.</p>
               <p>And an abominable Cheat is put upon the Chriſtian world,
in pretending that Part of the Rule of Faith, is left to be
derived down by the Churches Tradition; yea ſo, that what
Doctrine was not defined by the Church (that is, the Pope or
Council or both) to be <hi>de ſide,</hi> and part of the Tradition to
day, may yet be ſo to morrow, and ſo be made then neceſſary
to Salvation, which was not neceſſary before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pariſh.</speaker>
               <p>I apprehend now the good warrant we have to ſtick
to the Scriptures as the only and intire Rule of Faith, and I
hope, by the grace of God, I ſhall not forſake that ſure Word:
But (Sir) ſtill if we yield (what the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> claim) that
there is appointed by God an Infallible Judge of the ſenſe of
the Scriptures, to whoſe definitions all are bound to conſent,
our Rule would be no Rule to us, without the concurrent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch an Authentick Interpreter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>But it can never be proved, that Chriſt hath appointed
ſuch an Authentick Interpreter of Scripture, and infallible
Judg of Controverſies: And beſides, the ridiculous pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Scripture by Popes, to bolſter up this and their other
pretenſions is ſufficient evidence to any man that will uſe his
eyes and his reaſon, that the Pope is no ſuch Judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95460:9"/>
And indeed if Gods Spirit cannot ſpeak plain in his Word
but he muſt need an Interpreter, how can the Pope or Church
ſpeak ſo, but they muſt alſo need an Interpreter, and that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
muſt need another Interpreter, and ſo on <hi>in Inſinitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore we believe the infinitely Gracious God hath ſo
made known his mind about Mans Salvation, in his word,
that no man who prays to God, earneſtly and humbly for
the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, and uſeth ſerious attention and
pondering of the Scripture, comparing Scripture with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and applies himſelf to the help of learned and pious
Men and Miniſters, when he needs the ſame, can dangerouſly
err in neceſſary points of Faith, and yet learned Men and
Miniſters convince him of the ſence of Scripture who ſeeks
their aſſiſtance not in the ſtrength of their Authority and
Infallibility, but in ſtrength of that Light in which they are
inabled. by God to repreſent the Truth. But I muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
upon this Head, I refer you, if you need farther ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
to what the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Stillingſleet,</hi>

And that you may be ſatisfied that ſo you ought to do, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that the <hi>Pope</hi> claims no leſs than theſe Prerogatives fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That he, as Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſour and <hi>Chriſts</hi> Vicar,
is the Head of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church on Earth, and the firſt
Subject of all Eccleſiaſtical power: So that whatſoever Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Order or Juriſdiction any Biſhop, Presbyter, Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour;
or other Official doth exerciſe, is derived (ſay the
<hi>Romaniſts)</hi> from the <hi>Pope.</hi> That he can diſpence with Vows

Vertue to be Vice, or contrarily, none are to queſtion
it, nor doth any Appeal lye from him. Nor can any Prince
or State, or Church, conſtitute any Order, or reform any
abuſe in matters Eccleſiaſtical, but by delegation from the
<hi>Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95460:10"/>
That he as Chriſts Vicar (who is King of Kings) may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Kings for Hereſy, or for favouring Hereticks, or for
any Male-Adminiſtration or other pretended unfitneſs of the
Perſon to Govern. That he can abſolve Subjects from their
Oaths of Allegiance, and give to whom he will the Empires
and Kingdoms of the Earth, and the Glory of them, as the
Divel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. ſaid he could do. For thus <hi>Popes</hi> have

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pariſh.</speaker>
               <p>If this be his claim, then every one is warranted
to oppoſe it unto death; it being ſuch an abominable uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of an Authority that Chriſt never gave, and a moſt
unſufferable inchroachment on both the Civil and Religious
Rights, both of Princes and private men, both Chriſtians
and Heathen; And he is a Traytor to Chriſt, and a betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

there is nothing in Popery of more dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to be yeilded, and yet nothing more groundleſly
challenged; nor that can more prejudice unconverted Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Princes againſt Chriſtianity than this Doctrine, <hi>That
they who before were Supreme, muſt be Subordinate to the</hi> Pope
<hi>when they turn Chriſtians.</hi> For firſt, It can never be proved
that Chriſt gave any ſuch power to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or if he had,
it cannot be proved that St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s perſonal priviledges are
derivative to his Succeſſours; nor yet that the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Roma</hi>
is his Succeſſour, rather than the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi>
no, nor yet can it be proved that the preſent <hi>Pope</hi>
is the rightful Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> by uninterrupted Succeſs,
when from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as they claim, there having been ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Heretical, wicked, Schiſmatical, and Simonaical Perſons

               <p>This and more I remember you told me was ſaid againſt it

               <p>The Scripture tells us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 2. They are made
drunk with the Wine of the fornications of the great Whore,
and intoxicated with the pompouſneſs of her ſuperſtitious
Worſhip, and the looſneſs of the Doctrines that indulge
both their Luſts, Ambition, and Cruelties. But beſides, the
Popiſh Princes make uſe of the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority, ſometimes
for quelling their Rebellious Popiſh Subjects, ſometimes to
palliate their inceſtuous Marriages, ſometimes for fleecing of
their Clergy whom they have ſuffered firſt to ſleece their
People; ſometimes for confiſcating the Eſtates of whole Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
(as of the Knights Templers) and ſeizing the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of <hi>Monaſteries</hi> and <hi>Abbeys;</hi> wherein the <hi>Pope</hi> always is
a ſharer, and ſometimes to countenance by his Bulls, their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
and Uſurping others Kingdoms. But I will proceed,
there are abundance of other Popiſh errours, for oppoſal of
which a Chriſtian may warrantably ſuffer; ſuch is that Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Doctrine, that there is no Salvation but to thoſe that
are of the Romiſh Communion; ſuch alſo is their praying
to Saints and Angels, and worſhipping Images; ſuch alſo
is their Doctrine of Merit, Purgatory, Pardons, and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies:
But no one Doctrine is fuller of errours and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
than their Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation; for denial
of which many thouſand precious Servants of God here in
<hi>England,</hi> and other where, have ſuffered death: And how can
any aſſent to the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, as the
Doctrine of the Goſpel, who underſtand the meaning of it?
Which is, that the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine in the
Sacrament, is turned into the very ſubſtance of the Body
and Blood of our Bleſſed Saviour, which then the Prieſt
offers up to God, as a propitiation for the ſins of the
Quick and Dead.</p>
               <p>Which abſurd Doctrine, Firſt, is contrary to our Sences
of both Seeing, Feeling, Smelling and Taſting, (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
takes away the credit of all Gods true Miracles) for
ſtill we ſee and feel, and taſte, and ſmell Bread and Wine;
nay, If my Sences may be deceived, What ſecurity have I
that I read in the Scriptures theſe words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi>
next, it contradicts our Reaſon, that our Saviours Body
ſhould be in ſo many hundred places at once, as there are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95460:11"/>
Maſſes Celebrated at the ſame time in all parts of the world;
Nay, and as many Bodies of Chriſt in the ſame Church,
Chancel, or Parlor, as there are Minute and ſmall ſeparated
Pieces and Particles of the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine; for
ſo the litter <hi>Romaniſts</hi> teach, that every piece broken off is
an entire Body of Chriſt: Though the firſt Inventers of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubstantiation</hi>
in the <hi>9th Century,</hi> and ſo onward, for almoſt
three hundred Years, taught, that the whole Loaf Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
was turned into one Body of Chriſt, part of which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Body was broken off, when part of the appearances of the
Conſecrated Elements was broken off from the reſt, as the
Learned Doctor <hi>Burnet</hi> well obſerves in his Faſt Sermon,
<hi>Decemb. 22. 1680. page</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>And it is a Doctrine contrary to Scripture alſo, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
Chriſt's Body to be in Heaven, and is alſo oppoſite
to the very deſign of Chriſt's Inſtitution of that Sacrament,
as the Scriptures give us an account of it.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt's declared intention of that inſtitution, was to
bring his Death to our remembrance thereby, and to ſhew
the Lords Death till he came; and by that remembrance of
it, to ſtir up in us the ſame Affections and Reſolutions, and
the Exerciſe of the ſame Graces which would have been ſit
for a pious believing Penitent to have taken up and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
If he had ſtood by Chriſts Croſs when he ſuffered, and
ſeen the wounds made in his moſt precious body, to redeem
us from the curſe due to our ſins; namely, Sorrow and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
for ſin, Faith in Gods Mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
love and thankfulneſs to him that redeemed us with
his Death, with ſolemn renewal of our Baptiſmal vow to live
to him and his Glory, who bought us with the price of his
Sons Blood; and by receiving of that Symbol of the Unity
of Chriſts myſtical Body, (for we being many are one Bread
and one Body) we proteſt our Unity and Love to and with
all the members of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now, How contrary the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi>
and its <hi>appendages</hi> are, to this inſtitution of Chriſt, and the
deſign of it, will eaſily appear to any that conſiders it.
Beſides, what reaſon have we to think that God would put
it into the power of an ignorant or wicked Prieſt to work
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95460:11"/>
with four words<note n="*" place="margin">Hoc eſt corpus meum.</note>, ſpeaking ſuch a Miracle as the like is
not Recorded in Scripture; Namely, to turn a multitude of
little Wafers into ſo many Bodies of Chriſt, and at the

ever did. Nay, obſerve there never was a Miracle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in Scripture to be wrought to bring a matter of
Fact to remembrance, (as the deſign of the Sacrament is

obſerve yet further; what an horrid thing the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of our Saviour himſelf; namely, that he at his laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
did Crucify and Break his own Body; nay, break it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
twelve ſeveral Bodies, (ſuppoſing the Communicants were
ſo many) and that many hours before, his Crucifiers did nail

Countrey to meet in the Streets their Breaden Idol, I ſhould
by the Grace of God, not fall down and Worſhip it, though

Indeed I think I ought, if I have the warning of their <hi>Sacred

their Holy Hoſt, (as they call it) not out of fear, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I will not Provoke the Idolaters to make a Bloody Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

to ſin, though we muſt couragiouſly ſuffer, rather
than comply to their ſin and Idolatry.</p>
               <p>There is one other Popiſh Principle that we ought to bear
teſtimony againſt, even unto ſufferings, and it is this, That
the Church hath a power to impoſe upon mens Conſciences
what ſhe pleaſeth, and her Children are bound to obey her;
not from the Evidence of the expediency, or neceſſity of the
thing commanded, but from the Authority forſooth of the
Church commanding, which is a Uſurping upon the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of God himſelf, to whom alone it belongs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
indiſputable obedience. I may indeed, for peace ſake,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95460:12"/>
or for fear of wrath comply to the commands, which to me
<hi>bona ſide,</hi> ſeem neither neceſſary nor expedient; provided
they do not appear ſinful. But for the Church to command
obedience (blind obedience) meerly <hi>pro imperio,</hi> is to ſeat it
ſelf in the place of God.</p>
               <p>And indeed, this is the maſter vein of Popery, running
through not only the main Body of Papiſts; but alſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
religious Order and Society amongſt them; To whom
it is as ſacred to obey what their Church or Superiour
commands without diſputing, as to obey God and Chriſt
in what he commands. This therefore is another piece of
their Idolatry, ſetting up their Church or Superiours in the
place of God.</p>

the Whore of <hi>Babylon;</hi> one of theſe, or all theſe are the

the real preſence ignorantly, and ſlanderouſly imputing to

               <p>Indeed (Sir) I longed to come to them my ſelf,
as knowing they are ſpeculation, yeilding ten times more

we could not treat on that without reflexion on others
wickedneſs or errour; which is no pleaſing proſpect to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

all beſet with the fragrant Graces of Gods Spirit, and the
Fruit-bearing Trees of his rich and precious promiſes; I
ſhall proceed therefore,</p>
               <p>1. He is very ignorant of the nature of God, who thinks
God ſtands in need of a vile and profligate wretch (living
yet in the practiſe of known ſins) to aſſert the cauſe of his
holy truth, for his praiſe is in the Congregation of his holy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95460:12"/>
ones, and dear in his ſight is the death only of his Saints.
But he putteth away the wicked of the Earth like droſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 149. 1.</note> Therefore none are fitted to be Martyrs but ſincere
Mourners for their former ſins. When thunders and Storms
are without,<note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 15.</note> and ſwelling Winds are in the Bowels of the
Earth, there muſt needs be a terrible Earth-quake; So he,

of truth raging and menacing without him, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
accuſing him within; that he is not only an high tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor,
but a careleſs neglecter of ſeeking his peace with
God, can never confidently dye in the beſt Cauſe. When
the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were coming upon <hi>Saul, 1 Sam.</hi> 13. the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

to obey, never ſeriouſly ſearching thy heart and ways, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſincerely mourning for thy ſins, never applying thy ſelf
by earneſt prayer to the mercy of God in Chriſt. I do not
deny, that a man who is under great fears and doubts, having
for ſome conſiderable time been earneſtly ſeeking Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in Chriſt, prizing his loving kindneſs more than life,
may make a couragious Martyr; for ſuch an ones thoughts

impenitent, hath no <hi>Boots</hi> or <hi>Greaves</hi> on, but his naked Feet
are ſubject to be wounded with the Gall-traps of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
when Conſcience tells him, that according to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the Goſpel, he is in no capacity for peace or for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and his Enemies without (ſuppoſe Heathen) tell him
he ſhall periſh here and hereafter as an Enemy to the gods,
or Popiſh perſecutors curſe him ſolemnly with Bell, Book,
and Candle, to the Fire of Hell, as well as to the Flames
here, and forbid the people to pray for them, (as they did
in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> days prohibit all to aſſiſt the Martyrs ſo
much as by a prayer for them) how can ſuch a one dye coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly?
But ſtill I muſt take heed of diſcouraging any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
though late penitent; for I do not queſtion, but as our
Saviour received the penitent Thief upon the Croſs, ſo ſome
have entred profane wretches into Priſon, who yet have had
ſuch conviction of the preciouſneſs of the truth they were
urged to renounce, that they durſt not deny it, and have
come out to Execution ſincere penitents; nay, it may be,
rejoycing through hope, and have died happily; yea, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
in the Lord: But ſerious repentance, and ſorrow
founded in ſerious ſearch of our ways and heart, ſooner or
later, is a neceſſary qualification for a Martyr of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, So alſo is mortification neceſſary, that is, that
the Martyr hath endeavoured faithfully to ſubdue every luſt
in himſelf, and to cleanſe himſelf from all defilements of
Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear and love of
God; for God will not receive a polluted Sacrifice, though
offered with the Fire of his own Altar; nor can ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the aſſiſtances of Gods Spirit, who have grieved that
good Spirit, by wilful allowance of themſelves in known ſins,
not denying their luſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95460:13"/>
One living luſt is like a potent oppoſite party in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
that will weaken the hands of the Defenders, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of being under the power of one ruling Sin, will cut
the Sinews of our courage, and God will ſay to ſuch, as <hi>Pſal.</hi>
50. <hi>Why takeſt thou my Law into thy Mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt
to be reformed?</hi> Why offereſt thou to fight my battels againſt
the adverſaries of my truth, ſeeing thou fighteſt againſt my
fear, obeying the adverſaries of my honour, thy luſts?</p>
               <p>This is the other Boot or Greave of the preparation of the
Goſpel of Peace, which according to St. <hi>John Bapiſts</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is prepared for by reformation of our hearts and lives.
<hi>Luke</hi> 3. 5. <hi rend="margQuotes">Let every valley be ſilled, and every mountain be
brought low, and the crooked be made ſtraight, &amp; the rough
ways be made ſmooth;</hi> let the low groveling, worldling, and
filthy ſenſual fill up the Valley, ſetting his affections on things
above, and every Proud and Ambitious perſon bring his
thoughts low, minding Gods glory not his own, and every
crooked cunning deceiver get a ſtrait Spirit in ſimplicity and
godly ſincerity, and every angry and revengful perſon make
the rough ways ſmooth by endeavoring to obtain a Spirit
of meeltneſs and kindneſs; and then both feet are ſhod with
the preparation of the Goſpel of peace, and God will both
receive and aſſiſt ſuch in the conflict for his truth and glory:
And as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. They can confidently preſent their bodles
a living holy Sacrifice acceptable to God, which is their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
(rational) ſervice; whereas an unmortified perſon
in whom brutiſh luſts do yet raign, if he dyed in a good cauſe,
yet offered up a brutiſh unreaſonable Sacrifice, no way accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
unto God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Chriſtian muſt take the ſheild of Faith,
that is confidence in Gods promiſes of aſſiſtance and ſupports
in the day of his Tryal, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 16. He muſt be aſſured that
Gods goodneſs and faithfulneſs will never ſuffer him to fail
who flyes for refuge to his grace and mercy.<note place="margin">Pſal. 41. 12.</note> Thus ſaith
<hi>David,</hi> By this I know that thou favoreſt my righteous cauſe,
<hi rend="margQuotes">ſeeing mine enemy doth not Triumph over me, and as for
me thou preſerveſt me in mine integrity.</hi> Thus ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor. 1 8, 9. Chriſt will confirm you unto the end, and keep you
blameleſs to the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or in the day of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95460:14"/>
Chriſt, that is emphatically the day of ſuffering for Chriſt,
and will confirm you unto the end. The Chriſtian <hi>Matron</hi>
falling in Travel of Child-birth in the Priſon, cryed out in
her ſtrong pains, and was thus aſſaulted by the <hi>Jaylor:</hi> If,
ſaith he, you cannot bear thoſe pains without ſuch outcrys,
how will you be able to bear the torments provided for you?
She anſwered, Theſe pains I ſuffer as the burden lay'd upon
our Sex for the ſin of our firſt Mother; but in that conflict I
ſhall have the aſſiſtance of his grace, which is able to preſerve
me through faith againſt every evil work, and his grace ſhall
be ſufficient for me. Thus the Victory by which we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the world is our faith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Who ever will be a couragious Martyr muſt
have full aſſurance of the goodneſs of his Cauſe, that it is the
truth and way of God and Chriſt, (for which he ſuffers) and
worthy of all his ſuffering for it. This is that girdle of Truth,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 14. As a girdle or belt not only ſtrengthens the loins,
but by compacting and compreſſing the Muſcles of the back,
gives an advantage and tightneſs to the cords or ſinews of
even the hands and feet alſo; ſo the aſſurance that it is the
cauſe of God for which we ſtand, will make us confident that
we ſhall not be confounded: whereas but to doubt of our
cauſe, looſeneth all our powers of ſpirit and courage. Thus
the Apoſtle prays for his <hi>Coloſſians:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2. 2, 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Col. 2. 2, 3, 4. That their
hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto
all riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding, to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of the myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of
Chriſt; in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great cauſe maintained by the Apoſtolical Chriſtians
againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> was the Myſtery of God, and of the Father,
and of Chriſt; that is, that the infinite goodneſs and wiſdom
of God of old had carried on the Salvation of the Ancient
Fathers of the world, in the ſame way of Repentance and
Faith in his mercy, through the mediation of the promiſed
Seed, that ours is now carried on ſince Chriſts coming in the
Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Now had any doubted whether this way of Salvation
Preached by the Apoſtles, and received by the Churches, was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95460:14"/>
the truth of God, or queſtioned whether it was all of a piece
with the old method of bringing Sinners to glory, how could
they have ſuffered confidently in the cauſe? For ſtaggering
betwixt two opinions, whether the <hi>Moſaical Law,</hi> or Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
towards God and Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
was the way to juſtification, they would have been unſtable
in all their ways. But being aſſured that there was but one
name and way of life, Jeſus Chriſt the ſame to day, yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and for ever; they had a full aſſurance of underſtanding,
which is the <hi>Girdle of Truth,</hi> neceſſary to gird up the loins of
the Martyrs mind.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay a Chriſtian muſt be able to anſwer all the
ſubtle Fallacies and Sophiſms of the Adverſaries of the Truth,
but he muſt be aſſured that notwithſtanding all their Cavils,
it is the truth of God for which he appears: And that he
is aſſured of, becauſe he finds it works effectually in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
it, purifying his heart by the faith of it, incouraging
his hope and increaſing his love to God and Chriſt and all
good Men (yea to all Men) for Chriſts ſake; and what
works ſo, cannot, he is aſſured, be other than the Truth of
God.</p>
               <p>A mean-bred man who ſhould hear a Sceptick diſpute
whether the ſnow was white, arguing that the water from
whence it comes is black, and therefore the effect muſt be as
is the cauſe, yet would not however be brought to disbelieve
his eyes: but would continue confident the ſnow was white,
as his ſight repreſented it, for he found the effect of that
whiteneſs in diſperſing his viſual Rayes and Spirits. Such an
aſſurance muſt every ſuffering Chriſtian have of the Truth
for which he ſuffers, and that it is the true grace of God
wherein he ſtands, and for which he ſtands, and therefore
an ignorant unſtudied Chriſtian can hardly make a Martyr.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Whoever will be a Martyr muſt have his heart
ingaged in a ſincere deſign to promote Gods glory both by
doing and ſuffering. This is that Breaſt-plate of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Sincerity, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 14. which gives courage to a
ſuffering Saint: For if there be any Hypocritical deſign of
ſeeking Reputation to our ſelves, or bringing credit to an
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95460:15"/>
eſpouſed Faction or Party, it flats our courage: but the ſingle
eye makes the body full of light and heat alſo.</p>
               <p>On this account it was that the Primitive Chriſtians in
times of Perſecution received the Euchariſt ſo frequently,
(in St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, in the Decian Perfecution, they took it
daily) thereby renewing their Baptiſmal vow to live and die
to Gods glory, if called to it; As when ſome great Battel
was expected, the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals uſed to renew the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
Militare,</hi> the Souldiers. Oath, <hi>That they would not
diſobey,</hi> nor forſake their General, their Imperator: So that
who ever hath not frequently and ſeriouſly Conſecrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to God, to live and die to him, will hardly make a
Martyr; that being an ingagement he never devoted himſelf
unto.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, A Martyr muſt have right apprehenſions of the
Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Juſtice, and mercy of God, in ſuffering
the rod of the wicked to light upon the Lot of the Righteous,
there being ſome Chaff to be winnowed away; ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
even amongſt the Profeſſors of the Truth, that
ſtand in need of reforming. And therefore judgment begins
at the Houſe of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 17. He that would be a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
ſufferer, muſt be throughly perſwaded that God doth
all things wiſely and graciouſly, that therefore there is ſome
ſcandalous ſin or ſome diviſions which is to be pruged
out.</p>
               <p>Thus when the Sheep are apt to run into low and miry
places, or to ſtraggle at a diſtance from one another, or to
puſh and ſmite one another, the Shepherd ſends in the Dog,
and rectifies all preſently. So when Chriſtians ſtray into
ways of ſenſuality, or cauſeleſly ſeparate from one another,
or perſecute and vex one another for little differences, it is
both Juſtice and Mercy in God to let in a common Enemy
upon them, to teach them to live better and love one another;
and when this purifying is accompliſhed by Gods refining fire,
the Martyr is confident that God will give their cauſe (the
Righteous cauſe of Truth) to have dominion in the morning:
He therefore who queſtions either the wiſdom or Juſtice or
goodneſs of God in permitting perſecution, or that can
think that God remits of his care of the Church, ſo as to let
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95460:15"/>
the gates of Hell prevail againſt it, will not be a couragious
Martyr. Thus the excellent Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> ſaid in Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s days, It is but a ſtorm it may wet our Coats through,
but it will waſh them alſo and will ſoon be over.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth's Reformation of the Doctrine and
Worſhip of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is juſt matter of praiſe
and Thankſ giving to God even to this day: But ſtill the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Church Diſcipline, under the management of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan
Biſhops with their Aſſiſtant Colledges of Presbyters, in
the preſence of the Chriſtian People (the Brethren) to remove
ſcandals out of the Church, was not reſtored, as our Church
complains in the preface to the Commination. So that God
did not miſtake the ſtate <hi>of his Church,</hi> in ſending Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s
perſecutions to refine the Spirit of the Engliſh Proteſtants.
And that the ſame may ſtand yet in need of further winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Gods fan will hardly be denied by any pious and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Perſon; though ſtill I hope God will not let us fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of the Men of his indignation, but ſtir up the
Spirit of our Governours to take effectual courſe for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of our <hi>Lives and Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, A Martyr muſt be one enabled to prefer the
glory of God, and the cauſe of his Truth before all Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Friends and Relations.</p>
               <p>Many a Man can more eaſily die to himſelf, than to his dear
Wife, and Children, and Friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Saviour therefore proteſts,</hi> Matth. 10. 37. He that
loveth Father and Mother more then me, is not worthy of me:
<hi>Nay he aſſerts,</hi> Luke 14. 26. that if he do not hate Father and
Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he cannot be his Diſciple. <hi>Not that Religion
makes us unnatural but as the Sun puts out the ſhining of the
Stars by its overpowering light, ſo the fervent love of God in
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Chriſtian prevails ſo intirely over natural affections, that
the ſame ſeem in compariſon to be quite extinguiſhed. Thus
that reſolute Chriſtian of old expreſſed himſelf:</hi> If my Father
<hi>(ſaid he)</hi> who begot me,<note place="margin">Per calca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam irem Patrem, per calca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem.</note> and my Mother who bare me, lay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſrate
on the threſhold of the Priſon, to beſeeeh me to deny
Chriſt, rather than leave them in their old Age, to an unkind
and churliſh World; I would tread on the Loins that begot
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Womb that bare me, and go out unto Chriſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95460:16"/>
bearing his reproach, Heb. 13. 13. The Devil and wicked
Men know that natural affection is a tender part, and they
will pinch us there, and if our hearts be not fortified with the
Breaſt-plate of Faith and Love, they will prevail againſt us.
But when we can truſt God with our Friends, and love God
above them, then we are fitted to be Chriſts Souldiers.</p>
               <p>An Heroick example of this we have in the Mother, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Brothers ſuffering under <hi>Antiochus, 2 Mac:</hi> 7. 29. What a
couragious expreſſion is that of the Mother to her youngeſt Son,
<hi>Fear not the Tormentors, but being worthy of thy Brethren, take thy
death, that I may receive thee again in mercy with thy Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, A Martyr muſt be one who hath not himſelf been
a Perſecutor of any of the ſervants of God; or if he have
ſo been, he muſt be a ſerious Penitent, and profeſs his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for it before the Church and the World. Now a M<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
may be a Perſecutor of the Saints out of ignorance, and
miſtaken zeal, thinking therein to do God good ſervice,
reckoning the Religion of the Perſecuted to be Hereſy; and
thus did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and this I Charitably believe do ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and zealous <hi>Papiſts.</hi> But then obſerve ſuch Perſecutor
are very regular in other regards, and can profeſs as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
did, <hi>Acts 23. 1. I have lived in all good Conſcience before God
until this day.</hi> And ſuch Perſecutors have found mercy, and
been converted, and owned their Repentance for that furio<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
zeal, ſo contrary to the Spirit of Chriſt, who came to ſave
not to deſtroy Mens lives; yea ſome of them have been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by God, to be called to ſuffer for the Truth which
once they perſecuted.</p>
               <p>But all Perſecutors are not acted by that principle, ſome
directly out of a ſpirit of prophaneſs have perſecuted goo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

for God (for he is not in all their thoughts, nor in the
mouths, further than their Oaths and Curſes come to) but
zeal for the Law of the Land, or the Conſtitutions of the
Church forſooth; when really they regard no Law of th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95460:16"/>
Others there are who, perſecute goodmen, out of a worldly,
and covetous humour, that they may gain by Informations,
Plunder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I dare not limit the Eſſicacy of the grace of God,
but I have not to my rememberance, either heard or read of
any ſuch Perſecutors of a prophane, or Worldly Temper, who
have been converted, and honoured with the Crown of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome.</p>
               <p>But as I ſaid before, if ever you have perſecuted good
Men, though out of a miſtaken zeal for God, be ſure you
repent and own your Repentance, or expect not an aſſiſtance
in your own day of Tryal. The ſtory is remarkable about
the Controverſy, in King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixths days, about

who would not receive Information. But when <hi>Ridly</hi> and

               <p>O, what a beauteous luſtre and lovelineſs hath this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
humility and fervent Brotherly love, above all the
ſharpneſs of wit and cloſeneſs of arguing, that any can ſhew
in theſe Petit Controverſies! If therefore you have harmed
your Brother, who holds the Foundation with your ſelf, for
ſuch mean ſuperſtructures, kiſs the wounds you have made,
own your Repentance to your injured Brother and to the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95460:17"/>
Church of God, as ever you expect ſupport in the day of
your ſufferings.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Therefore it is neceſſary that the Martyr be
rooted, and grounded in love and charity, which implies
love to God and to his Church, and to the Martyrs very
Enemies.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that I do not make love and charity, any part of
the Spiritual Armor, for it is indeed the very life and ſpirit
of the new Man: So that as the beſt Armor in the World
put upon a Coward, would not inable him to attempt a
Combat, or overcome therein, ſo if it was poſſible that a man
ſhould be aſſured of the Truth and Goodneſs of his cauſe,
and thereby had his loins girt with Truth, and was expert
and nimble at the weilding the Sword of the Spirit, (the
word of God) yet if he had not love and charity to fill all
the Nerves of the inward man, and to give Spiritual ſtrength
and vigor, he could never make a Martyr. Therefore, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi>
13. it is made ſo neceſſary, that giving our body to be burned
without it, is reckoned nothing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Therefore the Martyr muſt love God with all his
Soul, for this love only is ſtronger than Death, and neither
Perſecution nor diſtreſs nor Sword can overcome it. This
I have ſpoken of before, and unqueſtionably if Gods Spirit
(who alone knows Mens hearts) ſhould write the Univerſal
Hiſtory of all the Martyrs, from the Righteous <hi>Abel</hi> to this
preſent, there would not one be mentioned as ſuch, but
would have this Teſtimony, that the Love of God and
concernment for his glory, was the ruling affection in his
Soul.</p>
               <p>The ſecond branch of Charity, is love to Gods Church,
or an affectionate concernment for the eſtabliſhment of our
Brethren in the Faith. Thus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 14. St. <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced
that his bonds and impriſonment at <hi>Rome</hi> gave confidence to
the Saints there, ſo that they were much more bold to ſpeak
the word without fear. On the ſame account he ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24.
<hi>I rejoyce in my ſufferings for the Brethren, and fill up that which
is behind, of the afflictions of Chriſt in my fleſh, for his bodies
ſake which is the Church;</hi> the <hi>[Huſteramata] that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,</hi>
ſignifies the empty ſpaces of a Seal, which the wax
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95460:17"/>
filling up receiveth the impreſſion; ſo that the Praiſe of filling
up, what is behind of the afflictions of Chriſt, is far from
ſignifying any merits of the ſufferings of the Martyrs added
to the merits of Chriſts ſufferings for his Church; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
no more then <hi>Paul</hi>'s being conformed to the ſufferings
of Chriſt, as a Copy is conformed to the Original, or the
impreſs of the Wax to the carving of the Seal. A Martyr
therefore goes forth as <hi>David</hi> againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> to ſtrengthen
the hands of the Armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Armies of the living
God; And though a Chriſtian be Murdered ſecretly in a
Priſon, or a Dungeon (as undoubtedly many are in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
of the <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Monks,</hi> and other-where)
yet they deſigned the ſtrengthening of others, (If God had
permitted the Example of their Courage, and Faith, and
Patience to have been ſhewed openly) their death is Precious,
and their purpoſe acceptable in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>The third branch of the Martyrs Charity, extends to all
men, even their Perſecutors, whoſe Converſion they pray for,
and that their blood may be the ſeed of Gods Truth; and
therefore he is not a Diſciple and Martyr of Chriſt, who hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Converſion of his Adverſaries by his Rayling, and
Reviling, and rendring evil for evil: ſo that to ſuffer in the
beſt cauſe in the World, and not to be Baptized into the
Spirit of meekneſs and kindneſs, ſo as to pray for Enemies,
and bleſs them that curſe us, and ſtrive to overcome their
evil with good, is not to ſuffer as a Diſciple and Martyr of
Chriſt; who reviled not again, and was dumb as a Sheep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Shearers, ſave when he prayed for his Crucifiers,
<hi>[Father forgive them]</hi> and ſo alſo did Saint <hi>Steven;</hi> ſaying,
<hi>Lord lay not this Sin to their Charge:</hi> By this patience and
meekneſs of the Saints, Chriſtianity prevailed to the ejection
of Heathen Idolatry out of the Roman Empire, and Popiſh
Superſtitions and Errors out of <hi>England</hi> and other reformed
Churches.</p>
               <p>10. The next qualification of a Martyr is, he muſt be one
very converſant in the Scriptures, nimble at weilding <hi>the
Sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, Epheſ.</hi> 6. 17. For
thence is he to fetch his directions, even from the Patterns and
Precepts there, and his ſupports from the Promiſes there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95460:18"/>
and thence muſt he be furniſhed with Arguments to
put to ſilence his Adverſaries; Our Saviour himſelf by this,
foiled the Tempter thrice: ſo that a ſtranger to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
(to the reading and meditating of them) is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for a Martyr, both becauſe he knows not whence to fetch
directions or ſupports for himſelf, nor how to confute and
ſilence gainſayers; But he that is mighty in the Scriptures
(as 'tis reported of <hi>Apollos, Acts</hi> 18. verſe 24. 28.) will both
mightily confute and confound his Adverſaries, and will
through Patience and Comfort of the Scriptures be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
in hope <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4.</p>
               <p>11. Next, The Martyr muſt put on the Helmet of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 17. or, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Phraſeth it, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. for
an Helmet the hope of Salvation; that is, he muſt be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the Goſpel to a lively hope of an Inheritance incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
undefiled, that fadeth not away, reſerved in the
Heavens For us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. He that hath not his Treaſure
out of his Enemies reach, will be afraid to provoke him; and
beſides, no enjoyment on Earth can compenſate or equal the
ſufferings that the perſecuted Saints may be ſubjected to,
they may endure cruel Mockings, Scourgings, Impriſonments
in loathſome Dungeons, they may be ſawn aſunder, torn
Limb from Limb, Roaſted on Gridirons, Tympanized, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to take in ſtinking water till their Belly and Skin is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to burſt, and what other ways of Torment the Devil
and his wicked Inſtruments can invent, and nothing but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
can ſurmount ſuch Sufferings and Death, (painful Death)
by them; But Faith, which is the ſubſtance and ſubſiſtance of
things hoped for, the Evidence of things not ſeen, (giving
as full and firm aſſurance to the Soul of thoſe Rich and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Promiſes, as Light doth to the Eye of the Colour or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the things it ſeeth) can overcome all the Terrors and
Torments levelled againſt it; for what would not a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
ſuffer that hoped after a few hours of ſuffering, to come
to the viſion and enjoyment of the Glorious God, and our
Saviour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Communion of the
Church of the firſt born of God, the Spirits of juſt men made
perfect, and to an innumerable Company of Angels, and
thereby to be above all ſin and miſery, and fear of loſing or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95460:18"/>
loathing what they enjoy? Indeed the ſufferings of this life
are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that ſhall he
revealed.</p>
               <p>12. Laſtly, The Martyr muſt be abundant in Prayer, he
muſt have the Spirit of Prayer and Supplication poured out
upon him, <hi>Praying always with all Prayer and Supplication in
the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
for all Saints,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 18. For Prayer is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiane
Artillery-Yard, wherein he exerciſeth his Arms, and
puts all his Graces of godly ſorrow, reſolutions for holineſs,
devotedneſs to Gods Glory, love to God, and love to Men,
in practiſe, till he is active and nimble in the uſe of them.</p>

               <p>I ſhall do it to the beſt of my Ability, and in this
Method; Firſt, I ſhall ſhew what aſſiſtances a Chriſtian may
expect to enable him to give a reaſon of the Faith and Hope
that is in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall ſhew what ſweet Comforts the very Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that a Chriſtian doth then Exerciſe, will bring into his
Soul.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſhall ſhew what warrant a Chriſtian hath to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
more immediate Illapſes and Communications of the
comforts of Gods Spirit, and of joy in the Holy-Ghoſt, in
his ſufferings, then ever before.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I ſhall ſhew what rewards a ſuffering Saint may

               <p>The firſt expectation, namely of Aſſiſtances to give a reaſon
of his Faith and Hope, I think is ſufficiently warranted from
<hi>Matt. 10. 19. When they deliver you up, take no thought how or
what you ſhall ſpeak, for it ſhall be given you in that ſame hour
what you ſhall ſpeak, for it is not you that ſpeak, but the Spirit
of your Father that ſpeaketh in you;</hi> Firſt, It is plain this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
hath no relation at all to the publick adminiſtrations in
Worſhip, to warrant inconſiderate effuſions of words then,
where Men have not got an Oratorical habit of expreſſing
themſelves aptly, ſo as to ſtir up and lead the affections of
thoſe to whom they Adminiſter in Holy Worſhip; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
is got by ſtudying and reading the Scriptures, and frequent
exerciſe of our gifts in Holy Worſhip, in private or in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
with others; all which endeavours God uſually bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to thoſe that are ſincere for his Glory and the Service of
his Church; ſo that according to the foundation of natural
parts, on which they build, they may attain a competent gift,
who will ſet themſelves about it, as every publick Miniſter of
the Church certainly ought to do. But though as to this gift,
for adminiſtration of publick Worſhip, we warrantably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the bleſſing of God upon our Meditation, reading, and
ſtirring up the natural Abilities and Gifts that are in us, ſo
that we may attain to this habit of Sacred Oratory, yet it is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95460:19"/>
obſervable that there are differences of this habit in ſeveral
pious Perſons, according to the difference of their natural
quickneſs of Fancy and Invention, and volubility of tongue,
and complexional heat and fervor, wherein there may be at
ſome times ſomething like an Enthuſiaſtical Energy, but yet
under the manage and conduct of Chriſtian Prudence; and
withal, he that moſt reads the Scriptures, and meditates of
them, and exerciſeth himſelf in Religious Worſhip, Praying
to God for his Bleſſing upon himſelf; ſuch a one ſhall grow
more ready as to the languaging of what he is to ſpeak before
the people, than another who wants the advantage of thoſe
natural endowments before mentioned, or doth not uſe the
means of reading, meditation and exerciſe, with humble
dependance on God for his Bleſſing on them: and hence it
comes to paſs that the greateſt Schollars are not always the
beſt Preachers, nor the readieſt in Prayer, becauſe their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
partslye not ſo right for this ſacred Oratory: but many
times a natural coldneſs and baſhfulneſs and heſitancy of
tongue, and ungratefulneſs of voice and accent, and ſlowneſs
of fancy hinders them: And beſides too many great Schollars
neglect the ſtirring up of their gifts by exerciſe, and ſo their
Delphian Sword ruſts in the Scabbard.</p>
               <p>But I only ſpeak this by the by, to ſhew you that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to the Martyr for ſupply of abilities to juſtiſie his Faith
and Hope, doth not extend to warrant ſudden <hi>extempore</hi>
venturing on expreſſions in holy Worſhip, where men have
not got an habit of expreſſing themſelves decently and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively.</p>

               <p>The promiſe therefore of <hi>(Is ſhall be given you in
that hour)</hi> relates to the Saints aſſiſtances in a time of being
queſtioned about their Faith and Hope by their Perſecutors;
and a Chriſtian may then warrantably expect that he ſhall be
enabled to ſet forth the reaſonableneſs of his Belief, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs
of his Faith, the excellency of his Hope, and the
purity of the commands his Religion obligeth him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
ſo that his adverſaries ſhall not be able to reſiſt the
wiſdom by which he ſpeaketh: Of the promiſe thus made
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95460:20"/>
good we have Scripture examples in Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint
<hi>John Acts</hi> 4. 43. So that the Jewiſh Rulers marvelled at the
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the freedom of ſpeech which God had given to
thoſe unlearned Perſons. Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> is another example,
<hi>Acts</hi> 6. 10. whoſe adverſaries <hi>were not able to reſiſt the wiſdom
and ſpirit by which he ſpake:</hi> And a further evidence of his
enlargements in this gift we have in his diſcourſe before the
Rulers, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. And the Church-Martyrology gives abundance
of inſtances of this, not only in the learned Philoſophical
perſons of the firſt ages, the Perſecutions under <hi>Rome-Heathen,</hi>
ſuch as <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> &amp;c. but even in the common Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
and ſo afterwards under <hi>Rome-Papal,</hi> not only <hi>Cranmer,
Ridley, Philpot;</hi> but common perſons, yea, women, as Mrs.
<hi>Jane Askew, &amp;c.</hi> have been enabled to give ſuch clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of the truth of the Doctrine for which they ſuffered,
as hath put their learned Adverſaries to ſilence, and driven
them to uſe rage and threatnings where they wanted Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But obſerve, firſt, I will not hence warrant any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
Perſon to expect Ability to anſwer all the Sophiſms
and Fallacious ways of Arguing, which their adverſaries may
by the advantage of Art caſt before them, though they ſhall
be ſecured not to be ſhaken by ſuch windy Doctrine. Nay
further, In points diſputable amongſt good men, (who have
nothing of the Seed of the Serpent, of the perſecuting hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in them) and which may be held either way without
danger of Damnation, if the Diſputants do <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
ſpeak what they think to be the truth in love, ſuch Aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to judge and diſcourſe is not promiſed, becauſe the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the aſſent either way is without danger to the Soul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I will not from hence warrant unlearned, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
Perſons ſuffering for the truth, to ſpeak ſo cleerly, ſo
convindingly as the learned Chriſtians; becauſe, though both
ſpeak by the ſame Spirit, the Spirit of God uſeth to modifie
his own gifts according to the natural or acquired Abilities
of the Subject he imploys, as we ſee in the different ſtiles of
the different Pelimen of Holy Scriptures, which though all
were dictated by the energy of the ſame Spirit, yet did they
receive a Tincture from the Channel of the Prophets natural
Parts, or acquired, through which they paſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:95460:20"/>
But this in the name of Chriſt I dare promiſe, that a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Saint diſpoſed, as I have before deſcribed, ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
previous meditation and ſtudy be aſſiſted by Gods Spirit,
with an ability to juſtifie the Truth and Excellency of the

               <p>I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you next, what ſweet
comforts the Graces which a ſuffering Chriſtian exerciſeth in
his ſufferings doth then aſſord him.</p>
               <p>Every Grace carries a pleaſure and comfort in the exerciſe
of it, but ſome more than others, and ſome of them at ſome
time more than at other times. Now as it is in ſweet Herbs
and Trees, the very Leaves and Roots of them have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing
ſmell, but the Flowers and Fruits when they are in
their ripeneſs and perfection, have a far greater fragrancy,
ſo the time of ſuffering for Chriſt is the time of the Harveſt
and full ripeneſs of the Chriſtians Graces, and like the Sheep
in the <hi>Canticles</hi> coming up from the waſhing,<note place="margin">Cant. 4.2<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> every one of
them bear twins of comfort and conſolations. The Graces
I ſhall inſtance in, are. 1. Simplicity or plainneſs of Spirit,
2. Love to God. 3. Love to his Church. 4. Compaſſion to
Enemies. 5. Faith in Gods promiſes. 6. Heavenly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
               <p>The firſt is ſimplicity and plainneſs of Spirit, this is ſo
clean and ſavory a Grace, that it always yeilds comfort to
the Chriſtian in the exerciſe of it; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth,
<hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and godly ſincerity we have had our converſation in the
world;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12</note> when therefore a Chriſtian ſuffers in plainneſs and
fredom, without double dealing and diſſimulation, aiming at
Gods Glory, and not gratifying a vain glorious humour in
himſelf, or deſigning to credit a party &amp; faction, how well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
is he that God gives him without fear or a worldly mind,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95460:21"/>
to approve himſelf to God, and to be made manifeſt even
to the consciences of both Friends and Enemies:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 11.</note> This was
the frame our Lord and Saviour ſuffered in, there was no
guile found in his mouth, thus a Chriſtian, as <hi>Job</hi> 2. 1 5. Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
faſt his Integrity,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 22.</note> and will not let it go till he dye; this
is that Grace that gives Serenity and Clearneſs, even to the
Chriſtians countenance, as it is ſaid of Saint <hi>Stephen, that
theybeheld his Face as it had been the Face of an Angel,</hi> Acts 6.
15. This wiſdom from above, that is without Hypocriſie,
<hi>maketh his Face to ſhine, and the boldneſs of his Face ſhall be
changed;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8. 1.</note> And if there be ſuch a luſtre in the Circumference,
what exceeding comfort and glory muſt there be in the Centre
of his ſincere and upright heart, out of which that vertue
goeth that adorneth his countenance? Thus holy and plain
Mr. <hi>Latimer,</hi> who before was ſeemingly of a deſpicable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
when he was ſtript for burning in <hi>Q. M.</hi> days, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one of the comlieſt Perſons of his age that the company
had beheld.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Grace then exerciſed is love to God, this at
all times carries comfort in it, but eſpecially in a day of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for God and Jeſus Chriſt, for then it goeth forth like
the Sun in its ſtrength; ſo that we may ſuppoſe the three
Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. as they had the Furnace heated ſeven times
hotter than it uſed to be, to terrify them, ſo had they then
their love heated ſeven times more than at other times, to
ſtrenthen them; and as the Beams of the Sun will put out a
Fire, ſo the frevent love of God in them morally extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the painful burnings of the Furnace, and bound the Flames
to the Peace, even before Gods Power did the ſame mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly:
Thus the Apoſtles went away rejoycing, that they
were counted worthy to ſuffer for the name of Chriſt, their
love then burſt out into tranſports of joy and thankfulneſs that
God would vouchſafe to uſe them to bring Glory to his
Name. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If there be any conſolation in
love, Phil.</hi> 2. Intimating that there is no conſolation without
it; and by how much more excellent the perſon loved is
for whom we ſuffer, ſo much larger breaſts of conſolations
hath our love; ſo that if to ſuffer for the love of a deſired
Spouſe (as when <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerved an hard Service for <hi>Raehel)</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95460:21"/>
a joy and delight to the Party loving, or if to die for a
Friend, a good Man, or a good Prince, whom we love, be ſo
ſatisfactory to the ſufferer, (as men declare that it is) how
much more to ſuffer for God and Chriſt! It as far excelleth
all other ſufferings on the motives of the ſenſual Love, yea or
Friendſhip, or Loyalty, as the benevolent warmth of the
Sun beams in the Spring is more invigorating and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Plants, and living Creatures, than the chokey
heat of a Stove or Furnance; nay it is indeed a glory the
Saints have above the Angels, that they are called to ſuffer
for God, which the others impaſſibility denyes them to do.</p>
               <p>So that the love of God in ſuffering Saints gives that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
comfort and ſatisfaction that is at no other time felt,
becauſe there never was that full exerciſe of it before; it is
that breaking the box of Spicknard, that finelleth more ſweet
by its diffuſion.</p>
               <p>The third Grace is Love to the Church; which yields ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding;
ſatisfaction when it carries us to act for the good of
our Brethren, that we can willingly ſpend &amp; be ſpent for them;
but the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ower and top of it, is, to fill up in our bodies what
is behind of the ſufferings of Chriſt for his Churches ſake.</p>
               <p>When a ſuffering Chriſtian thinks thus, theſe ſufferings of
mine may be a ſtrengthning of the Faith of all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that hear of them, and ſee them, nay it may be an
eſtabliſhment to ſome Chriſtian an hundred years hence,
what a ſweet and comforting reflection muſt it needs be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
What delight may we imagine have ſome Gallant Heathens
taken to die devotedly for their Country, as did <hi>Coarus</hi> the
<hi>Athenian,</hi> and <hi>Deoius</hi> and <hi>Curtius</hi> the <hi>Romans?</hi> but how much
ſweeter is it to the Martyr, to think that by his ſufferings the
Church of Chriſt, the Houſhold of Faith, thoſe who ſhall
hereafter be fellow Citizens with the Angels, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
and ſtrengthened?</p>
               <p>The fourth Grace is love to Enemies and Perſecutors; at
any time to forgive an Enemy, is both more glorious and
more comfortable than to overcome him. <hi>David</hi> had more
honour when he diſmiſſed <hi>Saul</hi> alive, than when he brought
away the Head of <hi>Goliah</hi> in his hand, and undoubtedly he had
more inward comfort and ſatisfaction alſo; for the Victory
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95460:22"/>
of <hi>Goliah</hi> was juſtly attributed to the Providence of God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
the ſtone to the mark, but the diſmiſſing and Pardoning
his Enemy, was the Fruit of the Grace of God in his Heart<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

but to ſuffer with the deſigning the good of our Enemies (even
of their Converſion and Eternal welfare) is much more ſweet
and affecting.</p>
               <p>If St. <hi>Steven</hi> had (as in all likelihood he had) an hope that
his ſufferings might Convert ſome of his Perſecutors, what
joy did that thought bring into his holy Soul! if there be joy
in Heaven amongſt the Angels for the Converſion of a ſinner,
when yet they contribute nothing to it, what joys muſt be
to Martyrs, that die in hope and deſires for the Converſion
of Chriſts Enemies, and theirs? For a Martyr tyed to the
Stake to think with himſelf, Some of the ring of this gazing
Multitude that look on me, nay ſome of the Officers that is
humanely butcher me, may come to have their hearts melted
by my flames, and of Lions become Lambs, and followers of
the Lord Jeſus; what a ſweet and comfortable thought
muſt that be to the ſuffering Saint and Martyr of Jeſus?</p>
               <p>A fifth Grace that then yields its Fragrancy is our Faith it
the promiſes of ſufficient Grace and Support; this is our
Victory whereby we overcome the world,<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 4.</note> even our Faith; and
who is it that overcometh the world; but he that believer
that Jeſus is the Chriſt, of whoſe fulneſs we are to receive
Grace, and Grace for Grace? We have now the comfort of
Faith in the aſſurance from Gods Word that he will never
fail us nor forſake us; but in a time of ſuffering, Faith girls
up its Loins, and makes his boaſt in the name of the Lord,
crying, The Lord is our Refuge and Strength,<note place="margin">Pſal. 46. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 12. He expreſſeth his confidence in abundance of
words, <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength, my goodneſs, my fortreſs,
my high Tower, and deliverer, my ſhield, and he in whom I
truſt;</hi> Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1 12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and

of the Lord, and deſpiſeth all the power of the Adverſary.</p>
               <p>The next Grace yielding its ſweetneſs to a ſuffering Saint,
is his hope and heavenly mindedneſs; it muſt needs be a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
proſpect to go up to the top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> and view the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Land by Holy Meditation: to think, (as far as our
dark Glaſs will give us leave to ſee) what is the Peace and Joy,
and what is the Purity and Holineſs of the Glorified Saints;
but when we come to ſuffer for the Hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then our
Hope grows more lively, more ſtrong, and vigorous, and
fixed upon that Glory that ſhall be revealed. Thus St. <hi>Steven
Act.</hi> 7. (when his enemies, <hi>verſe</hi> 45. gnaſhed upon him with
their teeth) being full of the Holy Ghoſt, looked up ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into Heaven, and ſaw the Glory of God, and Jeſus ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Right Hand of God: thus our hope, by how
much the nearer it comes to injoyment, grows the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and makes the dying Chriſtian ſay as it were to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>Egredere anima mea, egredere, quid times?</hi> Go forth
my Soul, go forth, reach forward to lay hold on that
Crown of Righteouſneſs, which now thou art not far
from, think with thy ſelf what it is to have all Tears
wiped away, all Graces perfected, and to be filled with the
Love and Communion of God and Chriſt, at whoſe Right
Hand is fulneſs of Joy, and Pleaſures for evermore. Thus
theſe conſolatory Graces, of ſincere Love to God, to his
Church, and our Eenemies, with firm Faith and Heavenly
Hope, yielding their ſtrength in the hour of ſuffering, more
than ever before, do abundantly recompence the ſufferings of
the Martyrs. But beſides theſe Comforts, which the exerciſe
of theſe Graces then yields (giving their influence chiefly by
way of Reaſoning or Diſcourſe in our ſelves) the Martyr may
expect immediate Illapſes and Incomes of Comfort, God
ſealing then to his Soul the aſſurance of his unchangeable
Love in Chriſt: For it is ſuitable to the Fatherly Goodneſs
of God than to unvail his Love and Mercy, and lift up the
Light of his Countenance on his ſuffering Servant, that as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 4. As the ſufferings of Chriſt do abound
in them, ſo their Conſolations alſo do abound by Chriſt:</hi> This Joy
has it that toned the Song of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in the Dungeon,
and hath enabled many a Martyr to ſing in the Plaines: Thus
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95460:23"/>
the Conſolations of the Martyrs are looked upon by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
as being of a larger ſize than any other Saints enjoyed
on Earth, like the Portion of the Heir, or Firſt Born, which
is double to his Brethren, like <hi>Eliah</hi>'s double Meal that muſt
ſtrenghthen him for travelling over an howling Wilderneſs.<note place="margin">1 King. 19. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Such are the joys and extaſies of the ſuffering Saints, even
like the confines of Heaven it ſelf: as there is a greater and
pleaſanter light in the dawning of the Day, than the Moon and
Stars could give; thus it is to the dying Martyr, his ſoul is
juſt entring upon that Eternal day of Glory that ſhall never
decay: So that we may apply to their ſtate that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Iſaiah, The light of the Moon ſhall be as the light of the
Sun, and the light of the Sun ſhall be ſeven fold, as the light of
ſeven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his
people, and healeth the ſtroake of their wound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next,<note place="margin">Iſa. 30. 26.</note> God then Communicates to a ſuffering Chriſtian, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and Strength, far ſurmounting all the Courage and
Fortitude that ever was given to any other of the Sons of
men, for as a Chriſtian then wreſtles not with fleſh and blood
only, but alſo with Devils and damned Spirits, who poſſeſs
and enrage their Perſecutors, ſo may they warrantably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a ſupply of ſtrength, coming near to the impaſſibility of
the Angels, that what they feel ſhall not afflict them; thus
how compoſedly, and in a manner unconcernedly have the
Saints born their Torments, and ſo by Patience have Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed
over the Devil and his Inſtruments;<note place="margin">Tantum poena in membris tanta tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas in verbit tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us tarque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reretur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius loque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur.</note> and thus it hath
been to many Saints of old, I will inſtance but in one;
St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> reports of <hi>Vincentius</hi> the Martyr, that when he
was Tormented, he ſpake with that Meekneſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs,
that a Stander by would have thought it was one
man that ſuffered, and another that ſpake. The Tyrants
raged and roared, and ſtamped, and gnaſhed their Teeth for
indignation that they could not break the courage of the
Holy Martyr, they tear and rend his Body and Members with
a rage above that of Wild Beaſts, while the Martyr in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was ſtill compoſed, and himſelf in Patience poſſeſſing his
own ſoul: ſo that indeed the Tormenters were Tormented,
and the Tortured did Conquer and Triumph over Satan and
evil Angels in the Croſs of Chriſt, and made a ſhew of them
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95460:23"/>
openly: Oh what a glorious ſight is this! a ſpectaclo worthy
of the Theatre of Heaven and Earth! who would not clap
their hands, and lift up their ſhouts in applauding the Grace
of God Conquering in his Saints! Such ſtrength may an
humble Chriſtian warrantably promiſe himſelf to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to him from God, when he is called to ſuffer for him.</p>

               <p>Oh Sir! How have you filled me with an Holy
Emulation and deſire to be alſo partaker of the ſufferings of
Chriſt! But I will not interrupt you, I pray you proceed.</p>

               <p>The laſt thing I propounded for your ſupport,
was the conſideration of the Reward to come, the Glory that
ſhall be revealed.</p>
               <p>It is very true that ſometimes that promiſe of Chriſt,
<hi>Mark</hi> 10. 29, 30. is literally expreſſed, <hi>He that forſakes
houſes, or parents, or wife or brethren, or children for Chriſts
ſake and the Goſpels, receives an hundred fold;</hi> now in this
time Houſes, and Brethren, and Mothers, and Siſters, and
Children, and Lands, with Perſecutions, becauſe God makes
all the Saints near him, to ſerve him with their Perſons
and Eſtates, ſo that he hath an hundred Brethren, and
Siſters, and Nurſes, and Houſes for one that he forſook.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Davids</hi> Croſs led him to a Temporal Crown: and
the Faithful Chriſtians in <hi>Conſtantius Clorus</hi>'s Court, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
their Offices and Preferments, rather than they would
forſake their Religion, were received back to greater Favour
and Higher Places; the Emperor wiſely concluding that they
would be moſt faithful to their Emperor, who were moſt true
to their God and Saviour.</p>
               <p>But this is a ſmall part of that promiſe which Chriſt hath
made unto his Martyrs, for <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 10, 12. he not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
them Heaven, but a great reward in Heaven, even
greater than to other Saints, who did not paſs through that
Red Sea of blood to the Promiſed Land. Some Pious and
Learned men ſuppoſe that the Reſurrection of the Martyrs in
their bodies before other Saints, being the firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and their Raign with Chriſt a thouſand years, is
warrantably expected from <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4, 5, 6. This opinion
is far from the Peſtilent and Seditious perſuaſion of the
Fifth Monarchy men; but whether this ſhall be ſo or no,
