            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was the Wiſe Counſel of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Great Prelate, of the
Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at a late Viſit I
made him there, to diſcourage Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
and endeavour to abate Strife
among Chriſtians: For, ſaid he, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is a Quiet Place; there are no
Quarrels there, and Religion is a
Holy and Peaceable Thing, and
Excites to Piety and Charity, and
not to Genealogies, Strife and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</hi>
But the Biſhop of <hi>Cork</hi>
ſeems to be of another Mind, that
could not paſs by ſo Inoffenſive a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
as that Stiled <hi>Goſpel-Truths</hi>
(given him by me in a Private Way,
at a Friendly Viſit upon his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire)
<pb facs="tcp:34322:3"/>
without his <hi>Publick Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions;</hi>
and thoſe Expreſt not with
ſo much <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> as might
have been expected from him to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Neighbours.</p>
            <p>I am, I confeſs, very ſorry my
Chriſtian Viſits to the Biſhop have met
with no Better Returns than Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie:
But becauſe that's his, and
not my fault, it ſhall be my Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>I did indeed, Perceiving him Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
in our Writings, and his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
to be Moderation, caſually Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
him with one of thoſe Papers; but
as the Nature of it is Far from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
ſo my deſign in it was purely
to <hi>Improve</hi> his Temper, and not to
<hi>Excite</hi> his Contradiction. Nor was
it Writ for an <hi>Exact</hi> and Compleat Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of our Belief, but <hi>Occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
to prevent the Prejudices that the
<pb facs="tcp:34322:3"/>
Attempts of a Courſe and Scurrilous
Pen at <hi>Dublin,</hi> juſt before, might
provoke in ſome againſt us, as to the
Points touched upon in the <hi>Goſpel-Truths.</hi>
And though we have been ſo
Unhappy as to be therein Miſtaken by
the Biſhop, yet it's ſome Comfort to
Us that our Chriſtian Declaration hath
had quite another Reception with the
Generality of thoſe to whoſe Hands it
has come: And I heartily wiſh That
hath not been the moſt prevailing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to his Undertaking. However,
ſince he has been pleaſed to fault it both
with <hi>Shortneſs</hi> and <hi>Error,</hi> which
we thought Healing, at leaſt Inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
I eſteem my ſelf Anſwerable for it,
and ſhall, with God's Aſſiſtance, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it againſt the Force of his <hi>Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and I hope with <hi>Clearneſs</hi> and
<hi>Temper:</hi> For, though I may be
plain, as he may expect, I deſire to be
neither <hi>Rude</hi> nor <hi>Bitter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34322:4"/>
I ask, <hi>Reader,</hi> but the Common
Juſtice due to all Authors, eſpecially
in Controverted Points of Religion, to
wit, <hi>Attention</hi> and <hi>Impartiality;</hi>
and then judge whether our <hi>Pacifick</hi>
Paper deſerved ſo <hi>Sharp</hi> a Cenſure, and
the Manner of its being given him, ſo
<hi>Publick</hi> a Return: Though I hope the
Conſequence will be Good. To Almighty
God I leave the Succeſs, and am in all

            <p>IF thou hadſt rather we ſhould be in

I. It is our Belief; that <hi>GOD Is,</hi> and
that He is a <hi>Rewarder</hi> of all them that <hi>fear</hi>
Him, with Eternal Rewards of <hi>Happineſs;</hi>
and that thoſe that fear him not, <hi>ſhall be
turned into Hell.</hi> Heb. 11. 6. Rev. 22. 12.
Rom. 2. 5, 6, 7, 8. Pſal. 9. 17.</p>
            <p>II. That there are <hi>Three</hi> that bear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and
the Spirit, and theſe Three are really One.
1. <hi>John</hi> 5. 7.</p>
            <p>III. That the Word was made Fleſh, and
dwelt among <hi>Men,</hi> and was and is the <hi>only
Begotten</hi> of the Father, full of <hi>Grace</hi> and
<hi>Truth:</hi> His Beloved Son in whom he is <hi>well
pleaſed,</hi> and whom we are to hear <hi>in all
things; who taſted Death for every Man,</hi> and
Dyed for Sin, that <hi>we might Die to Sin,</hi> and

of Life here, and to Glory hereafter.
<hi>John 1. 14. Matth. 3. 17. Heb.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
            <p>IV. That as we are <hi>only Juſtified</hi> from
the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin by Chriſt the <hi>Propitiation,</hi>
and not by Works of Righteouſneſs that we
have done, ſo there is an abſolute Neceſſity
that we receive and obey, to <hi>unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Amendment of Life,</hi> the holy
Light and Spirit of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in order to

            <p>V. That Chriſt is die Great <hi>Light of the
World,</hi> that lighteth <hi>every Man</hi> that cometh
into the World, and is <hi>full</hi> of Grace and
Truth, and giveth to all Light for Light,
and Grace for Grace; and by his Light and
Grace he Inwardly Appears to Man, and
teaches ſuch as will be taught by him, <hi>That
Denying Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, they
ſhould live Soberly Righteouſly, and Godly, in

               </gap>14. Tit. 2. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>VI. That this Principle of Light and
Grace, which is GOD's Gift, through
Chriſt, to Man, is that which <hi>ſhews</hi> us our Sins,
<hi>Reproves</hi> us for them, and would <hi>Lead all
all out of them</hi> that obey it, to ſerve GOD,
in <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> all their Days. And
they that turn not at the Reproofs thereof,
and will not Repent, and Live, and Walk
according to it, <hi>ſhall die in their Sins, and
where Chriſt is gone, they ſhall never come,
who is Undefiled, and ſeparated from

to 24. John 8. 24.</p>
            <p>VII. This is that Principle by which
GOD prepares the Heart to worſhip him
aright; and all the Duties of Religion, as
<hi>Praying, Praiſing</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> ought to
be performed through the ſanctifying Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Aſſiſtance of It; other Worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

which we cannot, in Conſcience, joyn, nor
can we <hi>maintain</hi> or <hi>uphold</hi> It. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>VIII. Worſhip in this Goſpel-Day is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and Spiritual; For <hi>GOD is a Spirit,</hi> as
Chriſt teacheth and he will <hi>Now</hi> be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> being moſt ſuitable
to his Divine Nature: wherefore we wait in
our Aſſemblies to feel GOD's Spirit to open
and move upon our Hearts, before we dare
offer Sacrifice to the LORD, or Preach to
others the way of his Kingdom, That we
may Preach in <hi>Power</hi> as well as <hi>Words,</hi> and
as GOD Promiſed, and Chriſt Ordained,
<hi>Without Money, and without Price.</hi> John 4.

            <p>IX. This alſo leads us to deny all the

            </opener>
            <p>I Am ſuch a <hi>Reader</hi> as in your Paper you
deſire. I have <hi>read</hi> and <hi>ſoberly weighed
the account</hi> you give of <hi>thoſe things,
which you ſay are chiefly Received and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
amongst you.</hi> And I will exerciſe ſo
much Moderation and Charity as to lay a
great weight on that word [<hi>chiefly</hi>] hoping
theſe are not <hi>the Only Things,</hi> or <hi>All</hi> that
you Believe: I ſhould have been heartily
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34322:7"/>
glad to have found that you had been in
the Truth, as I am well aſſured I my ſelf
am; But as <hi>I profeſſed,</hi> when the Paper was
given Me, That if I took it, you muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
I ſhould <hi>bear my Teſtimony touching It or
againſt It;</hi> So I now muſt tell you, I think
my ſelf bound in Conſcience to perform
what I then profeſſed; and that upon more
Reaſons than I will now trouble the World
with. You muſt not be offended if I ſay,
You have ſuch a way of Writing and Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that it is very hard in many matters
of Religion to know what you mean. But,
as far as I underſtand you, I will <hi>candidly
acknowledge</hi> what Truths you have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
or tolerably expreſt; I will <hi>ſhew
you,</hi> with meekneſs, <hi>how far your Faith,</hi> if
this be your Faith, <hi>comes ſhort of being</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
or <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and I will <hi>ſincerely tell</hi>
you, what I apprehend to be the <hi>cauſe of
your Deluſion,</hi> and how <hi>dangerous a condition</hi>
I really fear, nay believe, you to be in.</p>
            <p>And firſt; The only Articles, in which
you have expreſt a ſufficient Chriſtian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
are your IV. which is touching Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
and your laſt touching Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and your Submiſſion thereto. I wiſh
you may always ſtick to this Belief and
Practice: And I heartily rejoyce to find
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34322:8"/>
you acknowledging the <hi>Neceſſity of Chriſt
as a Propitiation, in order to Remiſſion of
Sins, and Juſtifying You,</hi> as Sinners, <hi>from
Guilt.</hi> 'Tis the firſt time I have heard of it
amongſt you.</p>
            <p>As to all the reſt of your Articles, I mean
thoſe which I underſtand, I muſt tell you,
the declaration of your Faith comes ſo
ſhort, of what is required from People to
denominate them Chriſtians, that except,
under each Article you believe more than
you have declar'd, you cannot be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Chriſtians. For firſt; in thoſe Articles
of Faith, which you have thought fit to
mention, you have ſet down only ſome
little Ends, I had almoſt called them
Snaps, of the Article: And Secondly;
many more whole Articles, of the true
Chriſtian Faith, and which are of no leſs
import, you have intirely omitted, waved
or ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge in your I. Article,
<hi>there is a God,</hi> and you own his Providence
as to the other Life. But that <hi>He made
Heaven and Earth,</hi> that He is the <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and at preſent by his Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

as to this World at preſent, are not
here acknowledged by You. We hope you
believe both.</p>
            <p>Your II. Article is wholly true; for it is
expreſs Scripture, 1 <hi>John V.</hi> 7. But it is
onely what the Apoſtle there had occaſion
to ſay, and what was to his purpoſe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> far
from being the ſum of what the Holy
Scripture, teaches of them; and therefore
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not a ſufficient Confeſſion of Faith on
that head.</p>
            <p>In your III. Article you acknowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the <hi>Son of God to have been made Fleſh,</hi>
but neither <hi>Conceived by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> nor
<hi>Born of the Virgin Mary:</hi> So that it does
not appear, by this your Confeſſion, but
that He was at firſt an ordinary corrupt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Perſon: Nay you own Him not ſo
much as <hi>Jeſus</hi> or the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> (the great
<hi>Saviour,</hi> who delivereth from the wrath
which is to come; or the Great <hi>Prophet,
Prieſt, Lord</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of his Church:)
You acknowledged him indeed to have <hi>dyed
for Sin,</hi> but (not to mention the Articles
inferible from, and relating to, the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of his death) You have not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34322:9"/>
one word of <hi>His Reſurrection</hi> from the Dead
<hi>or of His Aſcenſion into Heaven:</hi> which i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
may be proved ſome of you have expreſly

thing of His <hi>Mediation, Interceſſion,</hi> or <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
now in Heaven for us.</hi> Nor further
have you ſaid a word of his <hi>coming again to
Judgment,</hi> or the <hi>End of the World.</hi> Thus
indeed You have here neither own'd the
<hi>Creation</hi> nor <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of the World; ſo
that it does not appear, by this Account of
your Faith, whether you do not judge it
Eternal, and ſo otherwiſe Infinite. Yet
again; Not a word of <hi>One Church,</hi> which it
may be feared you ſtrike out of your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
becauſe you are reſolved never more
to return into the Unity of the Church, but
to make and maintain a Schiſm or Party for
ever. Nor further have you a word of the
<hi>Reſurrection of the Body,</hi> which divers of
you have been known to deny, and others
of you only ſay. <hi>It may be ſo.</hi> And Laſtly,
Tho' you acknowledge Everlaſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for them that fear GOD, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the <hi>Everlaſting Puniſhment of Wicked
Men:</hi> You mention <hi>Hell</hi> indeed (in a very
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34322:9"/>
unnatural place, <hi>viz.</hi> in your firſt Article of

               </gap>he Being of GOD) but whether you mean

               </gap>cripture is meant; or a place of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

               </gap>one; <hi>or a State of total Deſtruction and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation,</hi>
as many now a days do, no one
knows.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole; As to the Sum of the
Chriſtian Faith, which you have been pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſet down, there is not any one Article
of our common Twelve, that you have
own'd intirely; and Eight at leaſt, if not
more of them, that you have here totally
ſuppreſſed or waved. And how influential
to a holy Life, thoſe which you have
waved are, and therefore how neceſſary to
Salvation, I muſt require and conjure you,
on your own Eternal Account, to conſider.
I will only mind you of two paſſages out of
the Scriptures of Truth: 1 <hi>Cor</hi> XV. 16, 17.
<hi>If the Dead riſe not</hi> (that is, if there be no
Reſurrection of the Fleſh) <hi>then is not Chriſt
Raiſed. And if Chriſt is not raiſed, your
Faith is vain, you are yet in your Sins,</hi>
Hence it appears All other points of Faith
are in vain, if this be not true. The other
is <hi>Rom.</hi> X. 9. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy
Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34322:10"/>
Heart that GOD hath raiſed Him from the
Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> This Article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is of ſuch force and influence on Mens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Hearts,
that if believed as it ſhould be,
ſuch belief will ſave Men. But both <hi>Chriſt's
Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Our own,</hi> are by You in this
Paper, left out of your Faith. I judge You
not, but judge Your ſelves, leſt you be
condemned of the LORD.</p>
            <p>Your V, VI, and VII. Articles treat of
what you call <hi>The Light of Chriſt within
Man:</hi> This You have never been able yet,
that I could find, to make out what You
mean by. For You will not allow it to be
either the Natural Rational Faculty, or
common innate Notions, or Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
or Conſcience Illuminated, by the
Preaching of the Goſpel and the Operation
of the Holy Ghoſt thereby: Till You can
make us underſtand your meaning, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
till You underſtand it Your Selves,
(that is, till you are leſs confuſed in this,
the very Fundamental Principle or Rule of
what you profeſs) You muſt not think of
<hi>Declaring</hi> (or Publiſhing) <hi>an Account of your
Faith:</hi> See you underſtand it firſt. There
are ſome Men who have a Faculty to ſpeak
things ſeemingly profound, but in the End
neither themſelves nor others can make any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34322:10"/>
diſtinct ſenſe of what they have ſaid. This
we uſually call <hi>Banter;</hi> And I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as far as I can ſee, your Diſcourſe of
his Light within, is perfectly ſuch. Take
notice We in our Preaching require People
to <hi>look within,</hi> as much as You do: We
ſtrictly charge all to walk according to the
<hi>Convictions,</hi> and <hi>Light they have received.</hi>
We daily <hi>appeal unto Conſcience;</hi> but then
we teach, that <hi>Conſcience (opened</hi> by the
<hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> under the Miniſtry of the
Word, <hi>Acts</hi> XVI. 14.) does and muſt <hi>take
in its Light from Holy Scripture. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of the Lord is pure inlightning the
Eyes,</hi> Pſ. XIX. 8. [viz. of the Mind, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> I.
18.] <hi>Thy Word is a Lamp to my Feet, and a Light
to my Path.</hi> Pſ. CXIX, 105. <hi>To the Law and
to the Teſtimony; If they</hi> [even Men in their
Conſciences] <hi>speak not according to this Word,
it is becauſe there is NO LIGHT in them.</hi> Iſai.
VIII. 20. Now theſe things are intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
This Rule is fixt and certain, nothing
of which can be ſaid of <hi>Your Light within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Your VIII Article You tell us, <hi>Worſhip
under the Goſpel is Inward and Spiritual.</hi> If
You mean hereby, that all Outward and
Bodily Worſhip ought to be accompanied
with an Inward and Spiritual Worſhip, it is
what we daily Preach and Practice, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34322:11"/>
even in private preſs. But if, as it would
ſeem, You mean all the Worſhip GOD
now requires, is from the Inward Man, or
from the Spirit, this is abominably falſe:
For Our Bodies are GOD's handy-work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Chriſt's Purchaſe, as well as Our Souls;
on which reaſon, GOD by His Apoſtle
commands, <hi>Glorifie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Number that is, <hi>both which) are GOD's.</hi>
Not to tell You, that You your ſelve
now a days perform ſomewhat of Bodily
Worſhip. And indeed, if there be not a
worſhip of the Body, as well as of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
there can be no Publick Worſhip. This
Article therefore muſt alſo be mended, to
make it Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>In your IX Article, You tell us of you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Scripture can never be proved even to

            </p>
            <p>In a word therefore, I again require you,
as you will anſwer all your Secret Arts and

you either <hi>Embrace and Profeſs the intire

OF a PAPER, Entituled,
GOSPEL-TRUTHS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Have given the <hi>Biſhop's Exceptions</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at Large, as he did our Paper, and
ſhall now Conſider their Validity.</p>
            <p>He is pleaſed to ſay at the beginning of
his firſt Paragraph, <hi>he is ſuch a Reader as in
our Paper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>we deſire:</hi> Words that gave me
great hopes, of not only fair, but friendly
dealing; and I heartily wiſh it had been
ſo: But ſince it ſeems to me the <hi>Reverſe</hi>
of his Promiſe, he muſt not take it ill from
me, if I ſtop a while, and ſhew him a little
to himſelf, and how much he is miſtaken
in his own Temper, as well as in our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
For tho' he begins with the
Names of <hi>Moderation, Charity</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi>
that's all: He quickly Loſes ſight of them,
and forgets them, with himſelf, almoſt all
the way. And unleſs my Taſte be Extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34322:15"/>
Depraved, there is little Reliſh of thoſe
Vertues in his Management, or a tolerable
Temper ſhewn towards us, reſpecting ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Belief, or Practice. We deſire
<hi>ſuch a Reader</hi> indeed as had <hi>rather</hi> we were
in the Right, than in the Wrong; One
that did not Prejudge our Caſe, and would
give us (and not our Enemies) the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
of our own Belief; While the Biſhop
but too plainly ſhews, he would not have
us in the Right, Even where he dares not
ſay (however freely he ſuggeſts it) that
we are in the Wrong. Which appears,</p>
            <p>Firſt, by his <hi>Unneceſſary</hi> Exceptions to
ſuch Truths, as we have Declared in our
Paper (and he cannot deny) as <hi>imperfectly</hi>
Expreſt, becauſe we have not ſaid all that
might be ſaid, to Branch them out, or Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate
them; tho' enough to be underſtood
by ſuch as are not Captious.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by <hi>Suppoſitions Incongruous,</hi> and
that can have no other Service than to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi>
us, and that in a very ill Manner.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by rendring us to <hi>Deny,</hi> what we
don't Expreſs in our Paper: Tho' indeed
we Believe it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in not taking due notice of
what is <hi>Implied,</hi> as well as Expreſt. Which
had been but Juſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:34322:15"/>
Fifthly, in making the <hi>worſt</hi> of what is not
concurrent with his Belief, and not the beſt
where we believe the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, by Groſly Miſrendering our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
to <hi>Strict Living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, by Condemning us upon <hi>Rumour.</hi>
All which, is <hi>more than leaning</hi> to that ſide,
that had <hi>rather</hi> we were in the Wrong, than
in the Right; and Conſequently not <hi>ſuch a
Reader</hi> as we deſired. That this is ſo, let it
but be obſerved, how he <hi>Unchriſtians</hi> us in
his third Paragraph; tho' Immediately in a
<hi>Contradiction,</hi> what he juſt before Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
in his ſecond. Nor will he allow us
to be ſo much as <hi>Deiſts</hi> in his fourth, or
at moſt but very Imperfect ones, becauſe,
we have not ſaid all of God, that may be
aſcribed to him. In his ſixth, he ſuppoſes us
Capable of believing that Chriſt Came of
<hi>Corrupt</hi> and <hi>Sinful Fleſh,</hi> becauſe we ſay no
more in that Place, of the <hi>Manner</hi> of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
than the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> doth, <hi>John</hi> 1.
14. Alſo, that we are <hi>Defective,</hi> at beſt,
<hi>Ambiguous,</hi> about Eternal Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.
He makes us, in his ſeventh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph,
to <hi>Deny</hi> the Reſurrection of the
Dead, at large, and <hi>without Diſtinction,</hi> tho'
we there Acknowledge a <hi>Future State,</hi>
which implies it; and have not ſaid one
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34322:16"/>
word againſt it; but upon all Occaſions,
in Print, or otherwiſe, have Expreſt our
Belief of that Branch of Chriſtian Doctrine,
<hi>according to Scripture.</hi> In his Tenth, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides
our Plain (though Proper) Language,
of <hi>Thou to a ſingle Perſon,</hi> though it is what
he himſelf gives to God in his Prayers. In
his Fourteenth, and Fifteenth, he is pleaſed
to ſlight and render our <hi>Stricter</hi> Living, a
<hi>Trick to promote a Party,</hi> and that our <hi>Garb,
Looks and Geſtures, are more to make our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Remarkable, than out of any Perſwaſion
of Duty, or Conſcience:</hi> As bad a Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as he could make. In his Sixteenth,
he tells us, <hi>the Light within us, that we ſay,
we have from Chriſt,</hi> is rather <hi>one of the
Highths or Depths of Satan Transformed, and
that we are Abandoned to his Deluſions.</hi> So
that We and moſt of our Principles too, are
ſtark Naught with the Biſhop. In his
Eighteenth, and laſt Paragraph, he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts,
<hi>We take away two Thirds of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith, beſides many Points of the other
Third; and equal our Preſumptuous Conceits,
to the Divine Oracles, and Revelations, and
uſe, and diſ-uſe at pleaſure, what part of God's
Inſtituted Worſhip, we think fit; Even the
very</hi> Badges <hi>of Chriſtianity. I will not,</hi> ſays
the Biſhop, <hi>interpoſe</hi> (yet ſuggeſts it) <hi>your
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34322:16"/>
making Gain your Godlineſs; but if the Afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Men, are in a way to Perdition, what can
you Conclude of your ſelves? In the Name of
God Repent and Return:</hi> Thus the Biſhop,
upon a whole People, without any other
Provocation, than has been Expreſt.</p>
            <p>I hope, after this, He will not Expect,
(I am ſure he ought not) that any Body
ſhould think him <hi>ſuch a Reader,</hi> as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
for our Goſpel-Truths, and which he
promiſed us to be; or that he has treated us
with the <hi>Moderation, Charity,</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi>
he made us hope for; ſince none of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
have uſed us much worſe, in ſo
little a Compaſs. I heartily wiſh him a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſight of himſelf, as well as of us, that
he may be leſs miſtaken in both another
time; for I have a Reſpect for him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
not to be upon theſe Terms with him,
any Longer, than he thinks fit to make it
neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The reſt of his firſt Paragraph is only a
Strain of Fair and <hi>Paſtoral</hi> Promiſes, <hi>forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>

and meant, under that word <hi>Man?</hi>
Beſides, could the Biſhop think that while
we owned God's greater Providence, his leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
could be disbelieved by us? He that
has the alone Power of <hi>Rewarding</hi> Men, in
the other World, according to their Works
in this, muſt certainly be the <hi>Sovereign of
Both;</hi> and his Providence, in Juſtice, is to
be ſo underſtood. And as it is moſt certain
that we believe of God, all that the Holy
Scriptures declare of him, and whatſoever
is proper to that Great and Glorious Being
ſo, had we not thought it unneceſſary to be
more particular, from the Common Notion
all Men have of the Deity, the Biſhop could
have had no room left for the Exerciſe of
his Charity.</p>
            <p>In his fifth Paragraph he Blames us of
being Defective in our Confeſſion of the
<hi>Holy Trinity:</hi> Tho' we give it in the very
Terms of the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 15. 7. If
this is not a ſufficient Text to prove the
<hi>Trinity,</hi> that <hi>Antiquity</hi> Urges, and alſo <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi>
Writers of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to
prove it, I know not where to find one, in
the Scripture.</p>
            <p>It is Generally believed the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>
gave this Declaration to the <hi>firſt Chriſtians,</hi>
to <hi>prevent</hi> their being deluded by <hi>Cerinthius.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:34322:20"/>
How come the Biſhop then to render it but
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by paſſage,</hi> and otherwiſe intended by the
Apoſtle, than for an <hi>Article of Faith</hi> about the
Trinity? Is there a plainer, or a fuller any
where in the Writings of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Three and yet <hi>One,</hi> is the Doctrine
of the <hi>Trinity:</hi> And no other Apoſtle has
gone ſo far, or been ſo Expreſs: Inſomuch
that the Text has been doubted, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<hi>Apocryphal</hi> by ſuch as do not believe
the Common Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> and
<hi>Foiſted</hi> in to ſerve the turn of <hi>Trinitarians:</hi>
So plain it has been thought to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
even by the <hi>Anti-Trinitarians.</hi> How
then is the Text defective with the Biſhop?
But he ſays the Apoſtle writ it <hi>upon occaſion:</hi>
Doubtleſs he did ſo. But what other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
I pray, than that of the <hi>Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi>
He adds, <hi>and it was to the Apoſtles pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi>
touching <hi>the Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi>
But what purpoſe could the Apoſtle have,
but that of Declaring the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and yet
<hi>Unity?</hi> What other Uſe does be make of it?
The Biſhop muſt be very hard put to it,
certainly, to ſhift off, and leſſen our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
in this Point, and Rather then fail,
render the Text it ſelf ſhort; which, with
ſubmiſſion, I think is <hi>a bold Attempt in one</hi>
of his Station, if he Believes the Thirty Nine
Articles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:34322:21"/>
The next and ſixth Paragraph, relating to
our third <hi>Goſpel-Truth,</hi> is large, and conſiſts
of divers Branches, and therefore I ſhall
Conſider them diſtinctly and apart. <hi>In the
third Article, You acknowledge indeed the Son
of God to have been made Fleſh, but neither
Conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, nor Born of the
Virgin</hi> Mary: <hi>So that it does not appear, by
this your Confeſſion, but that he was at firſt an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Ordinary, Corrupt and Sinful Perſon.</hi> I think
it is hardly to be ſuppoſed that we could
intend ſo Groſs a thing, or that it is infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
from the Manner of Expreſſing of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
in Reference to <hi>Chriſt's Manifeſtation
in the Fleſh.</hi> Where Enough is ſaid, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the Reſt, all is Meant, though all
be not Expreſt: We call him <hi>the Beloved
Son of God,</hi> the <hi>only Begotten of the Father:</hi>
Pray what is that ſhort of being <hi>Conceived
by the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> To be ſure, it is very
far from a <hi>Corrupt</hi> and <hi>Sinful Perſon,</hi> a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
as remote from what we ſaid, as
from what the Biſhop promiſed, viz. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
He that Confeſſes the Word <hi>was made
Fleſh,</hi> Confeſſes Him made Fleſh <hi>by God,</hi> and
therefore made Holy Fleſh: For God never
made any <hi>Corrupt</hi> or <hi>Sinful</hi> Fleſh. If the
place is read, as ſome do, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word
<hi>took Fleſh,</hi> the Fleſh muſt be Holy, for he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34322:21"/>
would not take, or dwell in <hi>Sinful</hi> Fleſh.</p>
            <p>And had the Biſhop well remembred
what he <hi>Acknowledged,</hi> upon our Believing
Chriſt to be a Propitiation for Sin, not many
lines before, he could never have Suggeſted
ſo unreaſonable, as well as uncharitable a
conceit, ſince <hi>Sinful Fleſh,</hi> or a <hi>Corrupt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
could never be any part of a Sacrifice for
Sin:</hi> So that in Commending that part of
our Belief, he has ſufficiently ſecured us
againſt this part of his Inſinuation. But the
Biſhop proceeds to Aggravate our Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in Expreſſion to a Severe Imputation,
<hi>viz.</hi> that we <hi>own him not ſo much as Jeſus
or the Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This muſt be a great overſight of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
not to ſay worſe, when the very
Fourth Head about <hi>Juſtification by Chriſt,</hi> of
which he declares himſelf ſo well ſatisfied,
<hi>Thrice</hi> confeſſes him to be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> viz. in the
<hi>Firſt, Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth Lines.</hi> Again, we
call him <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Firſt Line</hi> of the Fifth
Goſpel Truth; likewiſe in the <hi>Firſt</hi> and
<hi>Fourth Lines</hi> of the Sixth we call him <hi>Chriſt:</hi>
We do the ſame in the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Fifth Lines</hi> of the Eighth, and in the <hi>Firſt Line</hi> of our
Tenth Goſpel-Truth: How the Biſhop
came to miſs in ſo Palpable a Point of Fact,
in the Compaſs of one half ſide of a Sheet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34322:22"/>
of Paper, I cannot Imagine, and am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to Cenſure. Nor would I willingly
think the Biſhop ſo Trifling, as Well as
Diſingenious, as to Excuſe himſelf herein,
becauſe we do not call the Word that took
Fleſh by the Name of Chriſt in <hi>that place,</hi>
ſince the Biſhop Repeats it from us, out of
our aforeſaid Fourth Head, about <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Chriſt,</hi> where we call him by the
Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as may be ſeen in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and foregoing Paragraph of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions.
Beſides, we have not Confeſſed
his Name leſs than <hi>Nine times</hi> in that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
But if the Biſhop could yet inſiſt upon
the word <hi>Chriſt</hi> not being in our Third
Head, I ſay the Thing is there, though the
Word be not. For what is Chriſt but the
<hi>Word made Fleſh,</hi> and who is the Word
made Fleſh but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Again,
who is the Beloved Son of God but <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and who elſe but Chriſt is the <hi>Beloved Son
of God,</hi> and <hi>Only Begotten of the Father, full
of Grace and full of Truth:</hi> For theſe High
and Diſtinguiſhing Characters are to be found
in <hi>That</hi> very Head of Doctrine, where the
Biſhop will not have us to acknowledge him
to be <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So that unleſs a <hi>Corrupt</hi> and
<hi>Sinful</hi> Perſon can be full of <hi>Grace</hi> and
<hi>Truth,</hi> I wonder how the Biſhop came to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34322:22"/>
ſuppoſe a thing in our Name, ſo very Groſs.
But he proceeds in the ſame Paragraph.
<hi>You acknowledge indeed he died for Sin, but you
have not one Word of his Reſurrection from the
Dead, or of his Aſcention into Heaven, which
it may he proved ſome of you have expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
ſaying, he is not aſcended into Heaven,
he is in us:</hi> With more to this Effect. I
ſhould be ſorry to tax the Biſhop here of
<hi>Abſurdity</hi> and <hi>Uncharitableneſs;</hi> but who
can help it? For if Chriſt be not Riſen,
He is <hi>ſtill</hi> in his <hi>Grave;</hi> He is no more.
How then do we aſſert him to be a <hi>Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi>
and the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
See <hi>Goſpel Truth</hi> 3, 4, 5, and 6. Can
that which is Dead <hi>Sanctifie</hi> and <hi>Juſtifie</hi>
Believers? Can the Dead give us <hi>Grace</hi>
and the <hi>Holy Spirit?</hi> Or have we not
ſaid ſo of Chriſt, that he is the <hi>Giver</hi>
thereof? And if we have ſaid ſo, muſt
not the Biſhop be Extreamly beſide the
buſineſs? His Uncharitablineſs is as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
I will not ſay his Untruth; but I
muſt pray him to Reflect a little better up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what he has writ; for unleſs he would
make us to mean the <hi>Grave,</hi> when we ſay
that Wicked Men ſhall never come where
Chriſt is gone, <hi>Goſpel Truth</hi> 6, he muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that we acknowledge Chriſt to be in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34322:23"/>
               <hi>Heaven,</hi> and Conſequently <hi>Aſcended.</hi> What
ſhall I ſay to his Story of ſome of our
<hi>Friends,</hi> whom he makes to affirm that
Chriſt is not aſcended into Heaven, he is in
us? Can it touch us, or ſhould he have ſaid
it, and not have proved it? Is that fair and
candid? Is it Charitable, Suppoſing it
were true, which does not appear? Or is
it Juſt to Inſinuate it upon the People as
<hi>Dubious?</hi> But let it be never ſo true, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Conclude the People, if not the <hi>Act</hi> of
the People, The Church of <hi>England</hi> has
Doctors of very different Sentements;
would the Biſhop think it fair the Common
Belief of the Church ſhould thereby be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded?
It is true, and a great and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Truth, <hi>that Chriſt is in us,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. Gal. 2. 16. Col.</hi> 1. 26. 27.
but not <hi>Confined</hi> to Man: He is not ſo
there, as that he is <hi>no where elſe,</hi> and leaſt
of all that he is not in <hi>Heaven.</hi> For the
Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 10. that He <hi>Aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
far above all Heavens, that he might fill all
things;</hi> then he is <hi>in Man</hi> certainly. So
that our aſſerting that Doctrine of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling</hi>
of Chriſt <hi>in Man,</hi> does not make
void his being <hi>elsewhere</hi> becauſe he is <hi>every
where:</hi> Tho' in Heaven moſt Gloriouſly,
without doubt, being there <hi>Glorified with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34322:23"/>
the Glory that he had with the Father before
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he World began.</hi> And they that Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Chriſt cannot deny his being at
God's <hi>Right Hand,</hi> which ſignifies, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Scripture, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2, 9, 10, 11. the
Higheſt Exaltation: Nor yet to be their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi>
for that is inſeparable from his being
their Propitiation. So that tho we did not
<hi>dwell</hi> upon Points, but were Conciſe in our
Expreſſions, yet whatever is <hi>Implied</hi> or is <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable</hi>
from any Aſſertion, <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as well
as Charity always grants; and ſo wound
the Biſhop have done, had they been Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt
in his Mind when his Pen ran ſo
faſt againſt us. I muſt own it was not writ
for <hi>Criticks,</hi> but for ſuch Readers as the
Biſhop ſays he was, or ſhould have been,
to wit, who Exerciſe <hi>Moderation,</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
more of which, I hope he thinks as
well as I, will do him no harm.</p>
            <p>But it diſturbs the Biſhops that we have
ſaid nothing of <hi>Chriſt's coming to Judgment,</hi>
nor of the <hi>end of the World,</hi> whether it be
<hi>Diſſolvable</hi> or <hi>Eternal.</hi> For the firſt, it is
implied in our making all Men <hi>Accountable
to God,</hi> for their Deeds done in the World.
For the Other, it was not under our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
being not objected to us. But
they that ſay as much of Chriſtian Doctrine
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34322:24"/>
as we have done in thoſe <hi>Eleven Heads</hi> of
our Paper, did never yet, that I have heard,
believe the <hi>Eternity</hi> of this World, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.
10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet again ſays the Biſhop,</hi> Not a word of one
Church, which it may be feard you ſtrike out of
your Belief, becauſe you are reſolved never more
to return into the Unity of the Church, but to
make and maintain a Schiſm or Party for ever.</p>
            <p>Theſe are very harſh Conſtructions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that they beg the Queſtion, and in my
Opinion would have paſt better from a
Perſon whoſe Office was leſs concerned in
<hi>Charity</hi> than That of a Biſhop: But why,
pray, muſt <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> Rule our
Diſſent? What's to be got by it? <hi>Profit</hi> and
<hi>Preferment</hi> go the Biſhops way, I will not
ſay he goes Theirs. But why not <hi>Conſcience,</hi>
tho' it were miſtaken, ſince we have been
all along of the <hi>Looſing</hi> ſide? which is not
uſually eſpouſed by the Men of <hi>Intereſt;</hi>
nor are Men ordinarily Obſtinate againſt
their <hi>Intereſt.</hi> Let us at leaſt be Honeſt
Men and allowed to mean well though we
were miſtaken. But what Church, of the
many Churches in <hi>Europe</hi> is the Biſhops
One Church, to which he would have us
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34322:24"/>
return? He has not told us. Methinks

the One Church, as he phraſes it; by
which I understand him to Intend the true
One, may be of two minds, it will be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
for him to recommend his own above
the reſt, becauſe that is not only broken in
<hi>Sentiments,</hi> but <hi>Practice</hi> too, and which
the Biſhop knows is no longer a <hi>Secret.</hi> I
might mention the Differences warmly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged

I cannot be ſo well ſatisfied of his exact

beſide the buſineſs, when I ſay it would
very well have become the Biſhop to have
told us what it is he would have us believe,
when he found ſo much fault with what
that Paper ſays we do believe. It would be
too long, and perhaps he might think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of Eight, that he thought fit to mention

you are yet in your Sins.</hi> Hence it appears
(ſays the Biſhop) all other Points of Faith
are <hi>in vain, if this be not true.</hi> And ſo ſay
I, as well as the Biſhop, and ſhall always
ſay as he ſays, while he ſays no more than
the Text ſays: For who can think that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
himſelf to think, that we ſhould not
believe an <hi>Immortality,</hi> who have expoſed
our ſelves, and ſuffered ſo much that we
may obtain <hi>an happy One.</hi> But the Queſtion
is not whether Dead Riſe, <hi>but with What Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:</hi>
For if the Dead riſe not, then may
we ſay with the Apoſtle, Verſe 19. in the
ſame Chapter, <hi>We are of all Men moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
So that the Reſurrection of the Dead
is out of all Diſpute with us: But with
<hi>What Body,</hi> will I believe, be One, <hi>till the
Dead Riſe.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:34322:28"/>
Here it is we are <hi>Cautious,</hi> and tread <hi>Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
Remembring what the Apoſtle ſays to
the <hi>Curious</hi> and <hi>Inquiſitive</hi> upon this Head,
Ver. 35, 36, 37, 38. <hi>But ſome Man will ſay,
How are the Dead Raiſed up, And with what
Bodies do they come? Thou Fool, thou ſoweſt
not that Body which ſhall be but bare Grain.
—But God giveth it a Body</hi> as it had Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him, <hi>and to every Seed his own Body.</hi>
Here is the Ground of our Caution, which
the Biſhop is pleaſed to call <hi>Suppreſſing,</hi> and
others <hi>denying</hi> of the Reſurrection. We
have indeed been <hi>Negative</hi> to the Groſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Conceits of People concerning the Riſing
of this <hi>Carnal Body,</hi> we carry about us
which better agrees with the <hi>Alcoran of
Mahomet,</hi> than the Goſpel of Chriſt. But
that there is a <hi>Reſurrection of the Juſt and
Unjuſt to Rewards and Puniſhments,</hi> we have
<hi>ever believed.</hi> And indeed we cannot but
wonder that any ſhould be <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> with
us for being <hi>Pleaſed with that which God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pleaſed to give us.</hi> Bodies we ſhall have,
<hi>but not the ſame</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, and ſo Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves

us,</hi> whoever it diſpleaſeth: For we had <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

            <p>The other Scripture urged by the Biſhop,

<hi>Rom. 10. 9. If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy
Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and believe in thine
Heart, that God hath raiſed him from the
Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> He adds, <hi>Thoſe who
believe this as they ſhould do, ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
But that we have <hi>left out both Chriſt's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,

in the Heart, that he can ſo believe. But
that we have left out <hi>Chriſt's Reſurrection</hi>

for Sin, and the <hi>Light, Life</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi>
of his People, and in giving us his <hi>Grace</hi>

            <p>I am now come to the Biſhop's <hi>Eighth</hi>

As for the Biſhop's <hi>Innate Notions,</hi> and
<hi>Natural Conſcience,</hi> if by them he means
Impreſſions, or Principles wich are born
And <hi>come with us</hi> into the World, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Law of God in the Heart of Man;</hi> I muſt tell
him, firſt, that this is not the Language of
the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony</hi> he referrs us to in the
ſame Paragraph: And next, that as the
<hi>Work</hi> is not the <hi>Workman,</hi> ſo They are not
properly the <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt, but the bleſſed
<hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> of the Light of Chriſt, the
Word-God in Man, which ſhines in the
Heart, and gives him the Knowledge of
God, and of his Duty to Him. So that
the Innate Notions, or <hi>Inward Knowledge</hi> we
have of God, is from <hi>This true Light that
lighteth every Man, coming into the World,</hi>
but is not <hi>that Light it ſelf.</hi> Juſt ſo the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's
Natural Conſcience, muſt only mean
a <hi>Capacity</hi> that Man has <hi>by Nature;</hi> that is,
in his <hi>Creation,</hi> of making <hi>Judgment</hi> of
himſelf, his Duty, and Actions, according
to the Judgment of God manifeſted to him
by the <hi>Light of Chriſt within.</hi> Not that
ſuch a Capacity is <hi>That Light;</hi> but that It
<hi>ſees</hi> or <hi>underſtands</hi> by the Inſhining of the
Divine Light, the things that belong to
Man's Duty and Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:34322:32"/>
Nor is it <hi>Conſcience,</hi> Illuminated, <hi>by the
preaching of the Goſpel, and the Operation of
the Holy Ghoſt thereon,</hi> which is the laſt of
the Biſhop's Conſtructions; but <hi>That very
Principle of Life &amp; Light,</hi> which Illuminates
the Conſcience, and was the very <hi>Spring</hi>
and <hi>Force</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Miniſtry, and of
the <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> of their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and which Opened their Hearts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Goſpel when preach'd unto them.
In ſhort, this Excellent Principle is in Man,
but not <hi>of Man,</hi> but of God. The Nature
of it is to <hi>Diſcover</hi> Sin, <hi>Reprove</hi> for It, and
<hi>Lead</hi> out of It, all ſuch as <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obey</hi>
the Convictions thereof. It is a Principle
of <hi>Divine</hi> Life that <hi>Quickens</hi> the <hi>Obedient</hi>
Heart to <hi>Newneſs</hi> of Life: It <hi>Raiſes,</hi> the
Mind <hi>above</hi> the World to God, and <hi>ſearches
out</hi> and <hi>reveals the Deep things of God</hi> to the
humble and waiting Soul. And be it known

teachetb, comparing Spiritual things with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.
But the Natural Man receiveth not
the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
fooliſhneſs unto him: Neither can he know
them, becauſe they are Spiritually diſcerned.</hi>
Now, according to the Biſhops treatment of
us, the Apoſtle ought not to have writ of
Faith and Salvation, unleſs he could have
made all that read his Writings <hi>underſtand</hi>
his Meaning. And it muſt be a <hi>perfect Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
to talk of ſpeaking Wiſdom in a <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and not in the Terms that Man's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
teacheth.</p>
            <p>But the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was of another
Mind, when he ſaid, <hi>I thank thee, O Father,
Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe thou haſt</hi>
hid <hi>theſe things</hi> (the Truths of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
<hi>from the Wiſe and Prudent, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
them unto Babes; Even ſo Father, for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34322:34"/>
ſo it ſeem'd Good in thy ſight.</hi> It is hence
beyond all Diſpute that God <hi>hideth</hi> the
Myſteries of His Kingdom from the Wiſdom
of <hi>Man,</hi> when <hi>Simplicity and Sincerity</hi> fail
not to <hi>Reach</hi> and <hi>Underſtand</hi> them. Here it
was that poor <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was abſolutely <hi>at
a loſs</hi> for Chriſt's meaning, when Chriſt
ſaid, <hi>Unleſs a Man be born again, he can in
no wiſe enter the Kingdom of God,</hi> John 3. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
as he asked Chriſt, upon his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the <hi>New Birth, How can theſe things
be?</hi> At which Chriſt ſeems to admire, in
a ſort of Reproof upon <hi>Nicodemus, Art thou
a Maſter of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi>
As much as to ſay, Art thou, a Man of
thy Station in the Church of God, Ignorant
of the Way to Heaven? Whoever reads
that notable Interview between Chriſt and
<hi>Nicodemus,</hi> will find that Chriſt reſolves the
Matter into <hi>Two Births,</hi> That which is Born
of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and That which is Born of the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> and theſe are Contrary: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no wonder if they <hi>differ</hi> in their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of the Holy Scriptures, being a
Declaration of the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> as

of God that were Enlightned and
Born of the Holy Ghoſt. Nor is this all;
for <hi>they that are Born of the Fleſh, Perſecute
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34322:34"/>
them that are Born after the Spirit:</hi> So
that when they can <hi>no longer</hi> commit Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
upon their Perſons and Eſtates, they
will Perſecute them with their <hi>Tongues</hi> and
<hi>Pens:</hi> They <hi>are Hereticks, Blaſphemers, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate</hi>
and <hi>Ignorant,</hi> yet <hi>Preſumptuous;
Enemies</hi> to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Diſobedient to</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,

<hi>Enthuſiaſts, Unintelligible, Men of Cant and

whether his Knowledge of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>whom rightly to know
is Life Eternal,</hi> John 17, be by the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
of the Son of God in his own Soul,
ſince Chriſt himſelf Teacheth and Affirmeth,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34322:35"/>
that <hi>no Man knows the Father but the Son,
and He to whom, the Son Reveals Him:</hi> I

of this Paragraph; he turns us to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

for Expreſſing Ours in the <hi>Terms of It;</hi>

            <p>His <hi>Ninth Paragraph</hi> refers to our <hi>Eighth</hi>

Remark to the Biſhop, Firſt, That we did
not give him the leaſt Occaſion to ſuſpect we
deny'd Bodily Worſhip, as appears by the
<hi>Goſpel-Truth</hi> now in queſtion: For 'tis plain
there, by theſe words, <hi>Worſhip in this Day
is Inward and Spiritual,</hi> That we only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd
between <hi>Goſpel</hi> Worſhip, and the
<hi>Ceremonial,</hi> and <hi>Pompous</hi> Worſhip of the <hi>Law;</hi>
and that by <hi>Spiritual</hi> Woſhip, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<hi>Praying, Praiſing,</hi> and <hi>Preaching</hi> by
the <hi>Preparation</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
of God; which the Biſhop does not, and,
I hope, dares not. Deny: Yet Unkindly,
and I think <hi>Unjuſtly</hi> brings in His, <hi>as it
would ſeem,</hi> to make us by an Uncharitable
<hi>Innuendo</hi> look to his Reader, as if we denied
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34322:36"/>
               <hi>Bodily Worſhip.</hi> And yet, to avoid ſo hard
a Chapter, as Maintaining this Aſperſion
would prove to the Biſhop, he is forced to
confeſs that <hi>now a-days we perform ſome-what
of Bodily</hi> Worſhip; as if we did not perform
<hi>any</hi> formerly, and but a little now: Which
ſhews not that Candor, that his Character
ows us, and but too plainly tells every Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Reader, how muck more mind he
has that we ſhould be in the <hi>Wrong</hi> than in
the Right. I muſt Confeſs we have <hi>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Whatever It be, 'tis ſuch as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
God by his Holy Spirit hath led us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
And tho' it be not ſo Entertaining to
thoſe who are Govern'd more by their <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

it will be allowed us to be <hi>Grave, Solemn</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The other Remark I make upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's
Exceptions is this, That the Spiritual
Worſhip he there allows of, ſeems to be but
the Worſhip of <hi>Man's Spirit,</hi> and not of the
Spirit of God, working upon the Spirit of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34322:36"/>

               </gap>aying, <hi>Mat. 5. And if ye Salute Your Brethren

Acts of <hi>Love, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> they were
to <hi>Exceed</hi> the Practice of that time: They
were to take more notice of, and to look <hi>more
kindly</hi> and <hi>friendly</hi> upon All Men. But in

Enemies as well as Friends,</hi> alſo forbids
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34322:41"/>
his Diſciples to <hi>Salute any Man,</hi> or <hi>call any

            <p>In the mean time, if my Reader pleaſe

to the Biſhops next Paragraph, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
his Exceptions to our Tenth <hi>Goſpel-Truth</hi>
about <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> and the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſt he has to take notice of, the Eleventh,
about <hi>Government,,</hi> being by him already
granted in the beginning of his Paper.</p>
            <p>He begins thus, <hi>In your Xth Article you
believe a Spiritual Baptiſm and a Spiritual
Supper and Communion, but acknowledge, you
diſuſe the outward Signs, by us commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Sacraments: Now did not Chriſt command
Water-Baptiſm?</hi> Go ye and Baptize all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>The Baptiſm here commanded
was Water-Baptiſm:</hi> His reaſons are firſt,
<hi>that Baptizing with the Spirit was God's work,
not the Apoſtles.</hi> 2dly, <hi>Primitive Practice,
Acts</hi> 10. 47, 48. in <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Caſe; <hi>Who
can forbid Water?</hi> But this is alſo <hi>gratis dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi>
For the firſt Reaſon is no Reaſon,
ſince it is <hi>not true:</hi> And the ſecond ſeems
to me <hi>Defective</hi> and <hi>Short.</hi> I am very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the <hi>Diſadvantage</hi> I am under, and
that I touch a <hi>tender</hi> Place, and what I ſay
upon this Head, as alſo anon upon the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
will be againſt <hi>Wind and Tide</hi> with the
Generality. But as I hope I ſhall expreſs
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34322:42"/>
my ſelf <hi>Reverently</hi> as well as Plainly upon
this Occaſion, ſo I beſeech my <hi>Reader,</hi> for
his Own ſake as well as Ours, not to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge</hi>
us; as I am ſure he will not if he be
a <hi>Searcher</hi> after Truth, and that I chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
ſuppoſe of him.</p>
            <p>I ſay then The Biſhop's firſt Reaſon is
not true; for God by the Apoſtles did Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
Believers with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> It fell-upon
them, through the Powerful Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word: Thus, <hi>Acts 10. 44. While
Peter yet ſpoke theſe words, the Holy Ghoſt
fell on all them which heard the Word.</hi> By
which it is evident that <hi>Peter,</hi> in that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
was the Miniſter of the <hi>Spiritual Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi>
to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Company.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Peter</hi> gives this account to thoſe of
the <hi>Circumciſion</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 11. 15.
<hi>And as I began to ſpeak, the Holy Spirit fell
on</hi> them <hi>as on</hi> us <hi>at the beginning: Then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
I the Word of the Lord, how that
he ſaid</hi> John <hi>indeed Baptized with Water, but
ye ſhall be Baptized with the Holy Spirit.</hi> So
that <hi>Peter</hi> evidently declares the Gift of
the Spirit by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel,
to be the Baptiſm of Chriſt, or the Baptiſm
of the Holy Spirit and Fire, which Chriſt
promiſed at his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> into Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:34322:42"/>
But the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> puts this Matter
beyond all Doubt, in his Excellent Account
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e gives of his <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to
King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> Acts 26. where my <hi>Reader</hi>
will find theſe words dropping from the
Mouth of the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> to <hi>Saul; Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thee from the people, and from the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iles,
to whom now I ſend thee, to <hi>open their
Eyes</hi> / and to turn them from <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to
<hi>Light</hi> / and from the <hi>Power</hi> of Satan unto
<hi>GOD</hi> / that they may receive Forgiveneſs of
Sins, and an Inheritance among them which are
Sanctified through Faith that is in Me,</hi> Verſe
17, 18. Now if this could be done <hi>without</hi>
the Holy Ghoſt, let my Reader judge. 'Twas
with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi>'s Hearers
were <hi>Prick'd to the Heart,</hi> and fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
more of It: And it was by the <hi>ſame</hi>
Holy Ghoſt that <hi>Paul</hi>'s Hearers had the <hi>Eyes
of their Minds opened,</hi> to ſee the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of
God's Kingdom, and by which they were
<hi>Converted from Darkneſs to Light,</hi> that they
might receive the Forgiveneſs of their Sins,
and Inheritance among them which are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.
So that the very End and Benefit
of the Apoſtolical Miniſtry was <hi>Converting,</hi>
that is, <hi>Baptizing them into Chriſtianity;</hi> in
the Nature, Power and Life of It, by the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:34322:43"/>
Now for the Biſhop's Second Reaſon,
viz. <hi>Practice:</hi> I ſay it is granted that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptiſm
having got place among them
by <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry, the Fore-runner, it held
after Chriſt's Coming; but that was <hi>Ex
Gratia,</hi> and of <hi>Condeſcention,</hi> not of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion?
for that properly ceaſes when his
Miniſtration begins, of which <hi>John</hi>'s was
but the <hi>Fore-runner.</hi> For <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
were till</hi> John, <hi>and</hi> John <hi>till Chriſt.</hi>
And this, <hi>John</hi> the Water-Baptiſt tells us,
<hi>Mat. 3. 11. I indeed Baptize you with</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>unto Repentance, but he that cometh after
me is mightier than I, He ſhall Baptize you
with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire,</hi> ſee Mark
1. 8. Luke 3. 16. Here's a different Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
and Baptizer, the <hi>Servant</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
the <hi>Water</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> One
<hi>Tranſcient,</hi> the Other <hi>Permanent:</hi> One the
<hi>End</hi> of the Jewiſh, and the Other the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>
of the Goſpel Diſpenſation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſays our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the leaſt in
the Kingdom of Heaven is Greater than</hi> John,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 11. Why is not <hi>John</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
No doubt of it at all, and a Glorious
Saint too: But the <hi>Leaſt</hi> in Chriſt's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,
viz. <hi>The Kingdom of God in the
Soul,</hi> the <hi>Work</hi> of Chriſt, the Baptizer with
the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> is <hi>Greater</hi> than <hi>John,</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:34322:43"/>
as to the <hi>Nature</hi> of his Adminiſtration. See
<hi>John 3. 30, 31. He muſt Increaſe, but I muſt
Decreaſe.</hi> What! <hi>John</hi> decreaſe, or his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration?
His Miniſtration certainly, which
he calls <hi>Earthly</hi> in Compariſon of Chriſt's.
So that the Baptiſt in his <hi>Watery</hi> Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did but <hi>Fore-run</hi> Chriſt, in reference to
the Kingdom that he was to ſet up in Men.
He pointed to Chriſt, and ſhewed what
Chriſt was to do, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Waſh, Fan,</hi> and
<hi>Throughly Purge his Floor;</hi> that is, His <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
and Sanctifie them <hi>throughout, by his
Spiritual Baptiſm,</hi> according to the Apoſtle,
<hi>in Body, Soul and Spirit,</hi> 1. Theſſ 5. 23. So
that in ſhort, <hi>Practice</hi> Properly can be no
<hi>Inſtitution,</hi> where the thing Practic'd has <hi>no
Commiſſion,</hi> which I ſuppoſe the Biſhop will
not think fit to deny: But, ſays he, <hi>It has
a Commiſſion,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. which is, under
favour, bur his <hi>ſay ſo;</hi> and that I think it
is no more, I do with all Humility and
Submiſſion ſay, Firſt, I cannot tell how to
reconcile it to Good Senſe, or Common U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
in Sacred or Civil Matters, that any
thing ſhould be in force by a Commiſſion
that is not ſo much as <hi>once named</hi> in the
Commiſſion. I ſay, to me it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<hi>Congruous</hi> any more than <hi>Cogent,</hi> or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging.
And this is the Cauſe in hand: For
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34322:44"/>
there is not a word of <hi>Water</hi> in the Text al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for Water; nor yet in the Context.
And unleſs there were <hi>no other</hi> Baptiſm than
that of <hi>Water,</hi> as there are ſeveral, it muſt
at leaſt be allowed to be a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> what
Baptiſm Chriſt meant in that Commiſſion,
when he ſayd. <hi>Go ye therefore and Teach all
Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the
Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be returned upon me; nor
does the Text ſay it is the Baptiſm of the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſo the Biſhop is upon
equal Terms with me. Grant it, that the
word <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is not litterally joined to
<hi>Baptizing,</hi> any more than the word <hi>Water</hi> in
that part: But if I am able to ſhew that the
thing is there, and that the Baptiſm of the
Holy Ghoſt was the <hi>Subject</hi> of Chriſt's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
when he gave that Commiſſion at
his Farewell, I preſume it will be granted
me, that Chriſt intended a <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and not
a <hi>Water</hi> Baptiſm; and that is what I ſhall
do, I hope with much Clearneſs. Firſt, the
Fact, and then my Arguments. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
the Evangeliſt, large in his Hiſtory upon
other Points, ſeems ſhort and abrupt in the
Context of this Commiſſion, as the Reader
may obſerve. And as it is uſual for one
Evangeliſt to explain another, which was the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34322:44"/>
great Wiſdom, as well as Goodneſs of God,
that thoſe Chriſtian Memorials might come
with leſs Suſpition to the World of any
Humane Contrivance; So <hi>Luke</hi> ſupplies the
ſhortneſs of the other Evangeliſt in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
to this Commiſſion. Luke 24. 45 to 50.
particularly the 47, 48, 49. verſes. And

Preached in his Name, among all Nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y
of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>until ye be endued with power
from on High.</hi> Where, as it is plain that this
Evangeliſt in his Account of Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
to wit, <hi>the Work Chriſt gave his
Diſciples to do,</hi> Names no <hi>Baptizing</hi> at all,
tho' that which it <hi>Implies,</hi> in my Senſe of
the Word, is there, viz. <hi>the Promiſe of the
Father,</hi> which is the Power from on High
They <hi>were to tarry at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for.</hi> So is there
not <hi>one Word</hi> of Water here mentioned, to
induce us to think that Chriſt intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to give it <hi>any Place</hi> in his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
In ſhort, it appears that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
were to be <hi>Qualified</hi> before they
were to go forth as His <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and that
this Qualification is the <hi>Promiſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
that he would quickly ſend them.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34322:45"/>
Now I muſt deſire my Reader to turn to the
<hi>Acts</hi> of this Evangeliſt, Chap. 1. 4, 5. where
he further opens the Manner and matter of
Chriſt's Diſcourſe, and <hi>Farewell</hi> to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
And (Chriſt) <hi>being Aſſembled with
them, commanded them, that they ſhould not
depart from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>but</hi> Wait <hi>for the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<hi>of the Father, which,</hi> ſaith He, <hi>ye have
learnt of me: For</hi> John <hi>truly Baptized with</hi>
Water, <hi>but ye ſhall be Baptized with the Holy
Ghoſt not many days hence.</hi> It can be, me-thinks,
no longer a doubt what Baptiſm it
is that Chriſt's words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. refers to,
ſince we ſee not only that Chriſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes
betwen <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm and His
own, and between <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi>
but alſo He aſſigns Water Baptiſm to <hi>John,</hi>
as <hi>his Baptiſm,</hi> and not Chriſt's, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
declares the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to be his own
Baptiſm, and none of <hi>John</hi>'s, and which
yet is no more than what <hi>John</hi> had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>So that Comparing both Texts together,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. with <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4, 5. we may ſee,
if we pleaſe, that the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> in the one,
is to be explained by the <hi>Qualifications</hi> in
the other, which was omitted by the firſt
Evangeliſt. There They are bid to <hi>Go,</hi> here
They are bid to <hi>Stay:</hi> That is to ſay, Stay,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34322:45"/>
before you Go, and receive your <hi>Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
before you go to <hi>Qualify,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<hi>of the Father;</hi> that is, the <hi>Baptiſm of
the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which is followed <hi>by the
Power from</hi> On High, verſe 8. And indeed,
had we not this expreſs force on our ſide
from the Text it ſelf, the Word <hi>Therefore</hi>
in the Commiſſion, (referring plainly to the
foregoing Verſe, as the Reaſon of what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows)
juſtifies our ſenſe. For whereas the
Biſhop has objected againſt our Aſſertion,
<hi>that it muſt not be a Spiritual Baptiſm, becauſe
that was the work of God, and not of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:</hi>
It is plain that our Lord takes off the
force of his exception, ſince the Reaſon why
he bid them <hi>Go,</hi> &amp;c. is <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>all
Power in Heaven and in Earth is given unto
me.</hi> Verſe 18. As much as if he had ſaid,
<hi>Go, do all that I have ſaid unto you, and be
not <hi>Doubting</hi> or <hi>Fearful</hi> / about the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of It,</hi> for <hi>All Power <hi>in Heaven and
Earth is given unto me</hi>
               </hi> that bids you Go,
<hi>and Lo I am with you alway, even unto the end
of the World,</hi> Which need not have been
ſaid, as an Encouragement to them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Water <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> ſince that was
practiſed by them, as well as by <hi>John</hi>'s
Diſciples long before.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all; for the very Text, duely
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34322:46"/>
conſidered, will not have It to be Water,
ſince that could Baptize none <hi>Into</hi> the Name
of the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſo the
Biſhop knows the Greek Text runs, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
for they that are Baptized <hi>Into</hi> the Name
of the <hi>Father,</hi> and of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> muſt be baptized with the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Since it is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their <hi>Likeneſs,</hi> and bear their <hi>Image,</hi>
which is <hi>Holineſs.</hi> And had not the Apoſtles
underſtood their Commiſſion as I render it,
when they had Baptized with Water, they
would certainly have uſed the Terms that
bore the Force of their Commiſſion, <hi>viz. In
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> of which there is not one
Inſtance in all the Scripture.</p>
            <p>But that which further ſhews that <hi>Water</hi>
cannot be underſtood, to be meant in the
Apoſtolical Commiſſion, is, that one of the
Greateſt of the Apoſtles, He that came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
(and was added to, by) none of them,
denys It, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. to be <hi>any Part of his
Commiſſion;</hi> for, ſays he, <hi>Chriſt ſent me not
to Baptize but to preach the Goſpel:</hi> And
thanks God for that reaſon, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Verſes, that he had Baptized ſo few:
Which to be ſure he ought not to have
done; but on the Contrary to have been
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34322:46"/>
ſorry he had Baptized <hi>no more,</hi> had <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi>
been <hi>Part</hi> of the Apoſtolical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. Again this Eminent
Apoſtle, the <hi>Great Grand Father</hi> [not to ſay
<hi>God-Father</hi>] of Gentile Chriſtians, delivered
to them <hi>for Doctrine,</hi> Eph. 4. 5. that there
was but <hi>One Lord, One Faith, and One Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi>
And if ſo, <hi>That</hi> muſt be the Baptiſm
<hi>of Fire and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which is Chriſt's
Baptiſm, and <hi>Proper</hi> to the Goſpel Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
Now could any other make a
Man a <hi>True Chriſtian,</hi> or a <hi>Child of God</hi>
then; nor can any be ſo now without It.
That Baptiſm therefore, without which a
Man cannot be a <hi>True Jew,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or
of the <hi>Circumciſion made without hands, that
Worſhip God in the Spirit, and hath no Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the Fleſh,</hi> muſt needs be the <hi>One
Baptiſm;</hi> but ſuch is the Baptiſm of the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt:</hi> Therefore the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Baptiſm is
the Apoſtles <hi>One Baptiſm,</hi> Rom. 2. 28, 29.
Phil. 3. 3. Again; the One Baptiſm muſt be
Chriſt's Baptiſm, but Chriſt is the Baptiſm of
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> therefore <hi>That,</hi> and not <hi>Water</hi>
Baptiſm, muſt be the One Baptiſm that's
in force, according to the Apoſtle. As
<hi>John</hi> was the <hi>Fore-runner</hi> of Chriſt, ſo was
<hi>Water,</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> But that which
Fore-runs, in Nature <hi>Ceaſes,</hi> and that which
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34322:47"/>
ſucceeds, of courſe <hi>Remains:</hi> Therefore
the Baptiſm of the Spirit, is the <hi>One Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
and <hi>Permanent Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet further; If it be Goſpel, <hi>That he is
not a Jew that is one Outward, nor that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
that is Outward in the Fleſh; but
that he is a Jew that is one</hi> Inward, <hi>and that
is Circumciſion that is of the Heart, in the</hi>
Spirit, <hi>and not in the</hi> Letter; <hi>whoſe Praiſe is
not of Men but of God,</hi> as Rom. 2. 28, 29.
Then unanſwerably, <hi>He is not a Chriſtian
that is one Outward, nor is that Baptiſm that
is of</hi> the Fleſh: But he is a Chriſtian <hi>that
is one Inwardly, and that is Baptiſm that is
<hi>of the Heart</hi>
               </hi> / in the Spirit; <hi>whoſe Praiſe is
not of Men but of God.</hi> For indeed in all
Ages Men cry him down, as a <hi>Slighter</hi> of
God's Ordinances; but his Praiſe however
is <hi>of God,</hi> let Men ſay what they will; and
this is the Inward Chriſtians Comfort, in all
Undervaluings and Reflexions he meets
with from Outſide Chriſtians. For it's not
to be thought that the Apoſtle meant or
deſigned to undervalue one Obſervation, as
that of Circumciſion, becauſe it is Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and ſet up another Outward Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<hi>inſtead</hi> of it, viz. <hi>Water-Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>If in Chriſt Jeſus, neither Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
availeth any thing, nor Uncircumciſion, but
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34322:47"/>
a <hi>New Creature</hi>
               </hi> / as ſaith the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15. Then by the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>neither being baptized with Water avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
any thing,</hi> not being <hi>unbaptized with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
but a <hi>New Creature.</hi> I will repeat the
Apoſtles Diſcourſe at large upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
in the ſame Chapter, becauſe it is very
Inſtructing, and ſeems Diſciſſive in this
Caſe; <hi>As many,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as deſire to make
a fair ſhew in the <hi>fleſh</hi> / they conſtrain you to be
Circumciſed; only leaſt they ſhould ſuffer Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
for the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> It ſeems they
were Outſide People, that laid ſtreſs upon
Outſide things; or ſomething elſe inſtead of
the Croſs of Chriſt; for they Temporized
in this matter, to ſhun the Shame and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
that then attended the Chriſtians
Croſs: Which ſtood partly in laying down
of outward Obſervations; and which they
that <hi>deſire to make a fair ſhew in the Fleſh</hi>
ſtand moſt for. But the Apoſtle goes on;
<hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>neither they themſelves who are
Circumciſed keep the Law, but deſire to have
you Circumciſed, that they may Glory in your
Fleſh.</hi> They were not exact in the other
parts of the Law, it ſeems, as ſtrict as they
ſeemed to be for this Sacramental Practice,
which is the Caſe of too many now: Yet
they preſt it, that they might glory and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34322:48"/>
value themſelves upon gaining others to be
conformable to them, whether to excuſe
their Compliance with Cuſtom, that they
might avoid Perſecution, or out of love to
Ceremonial Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> ſays that clear-ſighted and plain-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Apoſtle, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory,
ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the World is Crucified unto me, and I unto
the World.</hi> If he rejoyced in nothing but in
the <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt, then in no <hi>other</hi> Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Rite, Service or Ordinance, any more
than in Circumciſion.</p>
            <p>But he proceeds: <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi>
but a <hi>New Creature.</hi> That is to
ſay, for according to Chriſt Jeſus, or in the
Religion of Chriſt Jesus, neither Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nor Uncircumciſion availeth, <hi>but a New
Creature, a regenerate Soul; One born again
by the Spirit of God:</hi> For the Apoſtle in
theſe excellent Words, not only ſtrikes at
Circumciſion, but all Outward and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Obſervations: Neither This, nor
That <hi>Outward thing availeth in the Chriſtian
Religion,</hi> or according to <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> but
a <hi>New Creature:</hi> He does not ſay, <hi>but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>As for the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>'s Queſtion, <hi>Acts
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34322:49"/>
10. 47, 48. Can any Man forbid Water, that
Theſe ſhould not be Baptized, which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Holy Ghoſt as well as We?</hi> It Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
with ſubmiſſion, no more than this;
That <hi>Peter</hi> well knowing the Narrowneſs of
his Country Mens Spirits, was Cautious leſt
his Latitude ſhould Diſtaſte them: For the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> being <hi>Unholineſs</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
even <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, without a Viſion from
God, too narrow Spirited for the Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Devotion of that excellent Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,
<hi>Cornelius;</hi> It behoved him to ask if
any body had any thing to ſay, Why they
might not be baptiſed as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi>
being Proſelites to the Chriſtian Profeſſion.
In all which he ſeems more concerned to
ſave his <hi>Own</hi> Credit, than to recommend or
eſtabliſh that of Water Baptiſm: As if he
had ſaid, Why ſhould this Cuſtom be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> more than to the <hi>Jews?</hi>
But this will not warrant the Practice in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
becauſe Practice is <hi>no Inſtitution,</hi> and
that their appears no Command to make It
one. So that asking who can forbid what
was not commanded, ſtrengthens his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
inſtead of weakening it; ſince what
was done of <hi>Condeſcention,</hi> could not have
been forbid upon Authority. There needed
not ſo much Care or Strickneſs in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34322:49"/>
And indeed, the Apoſtles themſelves
ſeem not to have been ſo clear about the
aboliſhing of the Jewiſh Obſervations, as
appears by the want <hi>Peter</hi> had of a Viſion,
his own apprehenſion of the ſtraightneſs of
his <hi>Brethren,</hi> and their calling him to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for what he had done, as may be ſeen
in the ſame Chapter.</p>
            <p>But I confeſs I cannot ſee why the Biſhop
ſhould aſſume the Power of Unchriſtianing
Us, for not practiſing of that which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
practices ſo <hi>unſcripturally,</hi> and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Sentiments of a conſiderable
part of Chriſtendom; having not one Text
of Scripture to prove that <hi>Sprinkling</hi> of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Face, was the Water Baptiſm, or
that <hi>Children</hi> were the <hi>Subjects</hi> of Water-Baptiſm,
in the firſt times. And yet this is
all the Baptiſm the Biſhop practices, who
ſeems ſo ſevere upon us. I think our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
of Water Baptiſm from a Belief and
Senſe of the coming of the Inviſible Grace,
ſignified by that Viſible Sign, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
ſuch a ſlight to Water Baptiſm, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
to <hi>alter</hi> the Manner and Subſtance
of its firſt Inſtitution: For then it was in
the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> now in a <hi>Baſon;</hi> it was
then unto <hi>Repentance,</hi> now to <hi>Children Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable</hi>
of Repentance. But that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34322:50"/>
miſled the Doctors of the <hi>Declining</hi>
Church firſt into this Practice, being at the
diſtance of ſome Hundreds of Years from
the Apoſtolical Times, might be the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that Water Baptiſm came in the place of
Circumciſion, and that being to Children,
ſo might Water Baptiſm too. But they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
(among other things, which even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time were crept into the Church,
without Precept or Evangelical Example)
that Repentance was not made a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Circumciſion, at it was to Water-Baptiſm.
I would beſeech the Biſhop to
tread ſoftly in this Matter; for if Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
ſhould indeed prove a <hi>Badge</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
he would be at a loſs for one that
would paſs currant in Scripture. Thus
much for this Point.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid upon this Head of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Baptiſm</hi> may ſerve alſo for what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which the
<hi>Biſhop</hi> Reproves us for Omitting to Practice:
Urging <hi>Luke 22. 19. This do in Remembrance
of me.</hi> And the Apoſtles words, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
24. 25. It is true indeed Chriſt ſaid, when
he eat it with his Diſciples. <hi>That they ſhould
do it in remembrance of him till he came.</hi> And
this ſeems much more of the Nature of a
Commiſſion than that cited by the Biſhop

any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I
will come into him, and will ſup with him and
he with me,</hi> which was ſaid near Fourty
Years after his Aſcention. Now ſince this
is acknowledged to be an <hi>Outward</hi> Sign of
an <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Inviſible</hi> Grace, what can <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
Bread and Wine more properly Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and Reſemble, than <hi>Inward Bread and
Wine?</hi> And an Outward than an <hi>Inward
Supper?</hi> And if ſo, the words may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be read thus, <hi>Eat this Supper of Outward
Bread and Wine, till I come into and ſup with
you, and be your Supper, that am the Bread
and Wine from Heaven which Nouriſhes the Soul
unto Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> The Kingdom of God being Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and in the Soul, <hi>ſuch</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi>
of that Kingdom. Now Chriſt tells
the Phariſees, <hi>Luke 17. 20. The Kingdom
of God is within.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi>
Rom. 14. 17. ſaith, <hi>The Kingdom of God is
<hi>not Meat</hi>
               </hi> and <hi>Drink / <hi>but</hi> Righteouſneſs / 
<hi>and</hi> Peace <hi>and</hi> Joy <hi>in the Holy Ghoſt:</hi>
               </hi> But
the outward Supper is <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> and
therefore not of the Kingdom of God which
is not <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi>/ but <hi>Righteouſneſs / 
Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And this
was made Uſe of by Chriſt in the State of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34322:51"/>
               <hi>Humiliation,</hi> before his Death, and the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth of the Holy Ghoſt, to faſten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Diſciples that were <hi>weak,</hi> and <hi>of little
Faith,</hi> the Remembrance of him till they
ſhould know him with them and in them by
his Spiritual Appearance (as he was the
<hi>Lord from Heaven, the Quickning Spirit</hi>) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Promiſe. For if the Scripture
be conſulted, we ſhall not only find that
Chriſt <hi>Reproves</hi> the Apoſtles for their Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity
in him, but after all the <hi>Example, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi>
and <hi>Miracles</hi> they ſaw by him, and that
he had ſo very lately left them with ſuch
Aſſurances of his Coming to them again;
yet when <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c. brought them the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.
10, 11. <hi>Their words ſeemed to the Diſciples
as Idle Tales,</hi> and they <hi>believed them not.</hi>
Which ſufficiently ſhews the low State they
were in, or that at leaſt they needed a <hi>Sign</hi>
or Token, as that of the <hi>Supper</hi> to Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate
Him. But this Reaſon, which is yet
true, does not Credit its Continuation; for
when the Spirit was come, or Chriſt in his
Spiritual Appearance, their Eyes were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and they ſaw then it was the <hi>Spirit that
Quickens, the Fleſh profiteth nothing.</hi> John 6. 63.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly,</hi> Moſt certainly Chriſt meant no leſs,
when he Preach'd himſelf <hi>the Bread that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34322:52"/>
came down from Heaven,</hi> John 6. 31 to 52,
and that they that would have Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<hi>muſt eat his Fleſh and drink his Blood:</hi>
That is, they muſt feed upon <hi>Spiritual Food:</hi>
Not the Outward but <hi>Inward Supper;</hi> the
thing ſignified and <hi>Subſtance it ſelf.</hi> For
Chriſt oppoſes Himſelf, who is the Bread of
God, to the Bread their Fathers eat in the
Wilderneſs who were Dead, which was of
an <hi>Elementary</hi> Nature; therefore it can never
be that ſuch Bread as periſheth ſhould be
the Bread of the <hi>Evangelical Supper,</hi> when
Chriſt by Companion undervalues it to the
Bread he had to give them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly,</hi> Our bleſſed Lord, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 18.
taught, <hi>That it was not that which went into
the Man that defileth the Man, becauſe it went
but into his Body, and not into his Heart;</hi> and
if ſo, the Argument is undeniable, that it is
not that wich goeth into the Man, that is,
into his Body, and not into his Heart, that
<hi>Sanctifieth</hi> the Man: But Material Bread
and Wine goeth only into the Body, and not
into the Heart; therefore they cannot San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie.
The Import of Chriſt's words is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this, <hi>Meats and Drinks</hi> neither Defile nor
Sanctifie; they <hi>neither Benefit nor Harm any
one upon a Spiritual Account:</hi> Conſequently
<hi>Elementary</hi> Bread and Wine cannot be the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34322:52"/>
               <hi>Evangelical</hi> Supper, but a Figure of It,
which is ended in Chriſt the Bread of God,
that cometh down from Heaven, <hi>John</hi> 6. 31,
32, 48, 49, 50. That a Man may eat of and
not dye: The Subſtance of all Shadows;
for ſaith the Apoſtle, the Body is of Chriſt;
and where that is, our Lord tells us, <hi>Luke</hi>
13. 37. the <hi>Engles are gathered together:</hi>
Where the Apoſtles; Wiſe Men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
15. ſeek for the true Supper, which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
their Souls unto Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7thly,</hi> But the Biſhop will have this <hi>Supper</hi>
four times repeated in the Scripture of the
New Teſtament, beſides that of the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul,</hi> which muſt be his miſtake—ſince there
is no Command to practice it beyond that
very Time, but in <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 19. If there it
ſelf. For tho' his Eating of the Paſſover is
there related, as alſo in <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> It
was but once <hi>done;</hi> and the Command, this
<hi>do in Remembrance of me,</hi> is only <hi>Once Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated</hi>
among the Evangeliſts, as well as it
is but <hi>Once Commanded.</hi> And would we
be ſtrict with the Biſhop, we need not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him that Command to reach further
than the preſent Time in which it was
Given; for <hi>This Do,</hi> or <hi>Take Eat,</hi> are Equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the <hi>preſent Tence, for thereby you ſhew
forth my Death.</hi> And the following words,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34322:53"/>
viz. <hi>I will Drink no more of <hi>This</hi> Fruit of
the Vine, until that Day when I Drink it <hi>New</hi>
with you in my Father's Kingdom,</hi> Mat. 26.
29. further explains it. Thus Mark has it,
14. 25. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, I will Drink
no more of the Fruit of the Vine until that Day
that I Drink it <hi>New</hi> in the Kingdom of God.</hi>
Luke 22. 18. gives it thus, <hi>I ſay unto you, I
will not Drink of the Fruit of the Vine till the
Kingdom of God <hi>ſhall come.</hi>
               </hi> Now it is plain
that Chriſt refers them to the Spiritual Supper,
which we Prefer and Practice, and which is
the Supper <hi>Signified</hi> by That of outward Bread
and Wine, that was to ſerve <hi>till the Kingdom of
God came,</hi> and then he would Communicate
with them in a way <hi>Suitable</hi> to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
which Kingdom, as before ſaid, is
not <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> but <hi>Righteouſneſs, Peace</hi>
and <hi>Joy</hi> in the Holy Ghoſt. And as the
ſame Apoſtle has it, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 20. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is not in Word but in Power;</hi> of
which Power, and its coming from on High
upon the Apoſtles, Read <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>For when they asked Chriſt, <hi>Lord wilt
thou at this time Reſtore the Kingdom again to
Iſrael,</hi> and that he told them, 'twas not for
them to know <hi>the Times or the Seaſons which
the Father had put in his own Power.</hi> He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
adds, <hi>But ye ſhall receive Power after the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34322:53"/>
Holy Ghoſt is come upon you,</hi> and ye ſhall be
<hi>Witneſſes unto me, both in</hi> Jeruſalem and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,
and in Samaria, <hi>and in the uttermoſt
Parts of the Earth.</hi> This Power was the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> of God, <hi>for it ſtands in Power,</hi> ſays
the Apoſtle; but it ſeems he thought fit to
wave their Queſtion, as to a direct Anſwer,
and left it a Secret to be revealed unto
them, when the Holy ghoſt ſhould Come,
and the Power from on High ſhould fall
upon them: And thus he takes his leave of
them, and is Immediately received by a
Cloud out of their Sight.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude with this Paragraph, I
would obſerve, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that it was the <hi>Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi>
and Cuſtom of the Jews, which properly
ſpeaking, we conceive hath no juſt plea to
continue as a <hi>Goſpel Ordinance</hi> or Inſtitution;
ſince it was a Type of Him to come, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ended, as to <hi>Inſtitution</hi> by his coming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> the
Beloved Diſciple, that lay in the Boſom of
Chriſt, does not ſo much as mention It, or
<hi>Water Baptiſm,</hi> as left by Chriſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
by his Followers, Concerning the
Spirit's Baptiſm, tho' he uſes not the word
Baptiſm, yet he is very full, <hi>John</hi> 14, 16,
17. Chapters, where he tells them, that he
would ſend them the <hi>Comforter the Spirit of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34322:54"/>
Truth, to lead them into all Truth, and that
he would dwell with them for ever.</hi> I ſay It
ſeems very Improbable if not Incredible,
that what the Biſhop ſtiles the <hi>Badges</hi> of
Chriſtianity in his 17th Paragraph, ſhould
be <hi>wholly forgotten</hi> by ſo great an Apoſtle of
<hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> And as the Beloved Diſciple ſays
nothing of theſe <hi>viſible Signs,</hi> which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
calls the <hi>Badges</hi> of Chriſtianity, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they made an <hi>Article</hi> of any of the
<hi>Ancient Creeds</hi> Extant, which certainly does
not make for their Credit or Authority:
Since had they then been of that Importance
they are now by ſome eſteemed, we cannot
think they would have been forgot by the
Compilers of thoſe Creeds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats
the <hi>Tradition</hi> he received of the Lord's
Supper, that night he was betrayed, does
not Injoyn it; but as often as the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
did it, he tells them they ſhould do it
in remembrance of Chriſt: Which is far
from commanding it, as it would be for
the Biſhop, if he ſhould ſay to his Friend,
as often as he comes to <hi>Cork</hi> he ſhould
come and Eat with him, obliges that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to <hi>come often</hi> to <hi>Cork.</hi> So that tho' the
Apoſtle bids them, that as often as they did
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34322:54"/>
it, they ſhould do it in <hi>Remembrance</hi> of
Chriſt, yet he does not thereby bid them do
it <hi>often,</hi> if at ail.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> And whereas the Biſhop would make
it a freſh Revelation to the Apoſtle, when he
ſays for <hi>I have received of the Lord, that which
alſo I delivered unto you,</hi> I muſt diſſent from
him. I cannot apprehend that means any
more than this, <hi>that what account he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of Chriſt's Eating the Supper with his
Diſciples, the Night he was Betrayed, the ſame
alſo he had Delivered unto them:</hi> For what
need could there be of an <hi>Immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
for ſo late a <hi>Fact,</hi> ſo well Witneſſed by
the Diſciples? But if my Reader will peruſe
that Part of the Chapter which relates to
the Supper, he will find the Streſs lies upon
<hi>Remembring</hi> of the Lord, which is indeed
our Daily, Indiſpenſible Duty, and he that
lives without it, may be ſaid to live without
God in the World; of which thoſe <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
at that time ſeemed to Inſenſible, and
as ſuch are ſeverely reproved by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
being <hi>Irreverent, Greedy</hi> and <hi>Drunken,</hi>
hardly fit for the Sign, and <hi>leſſ</hi> able to diſcern
the <hi>Thing Signified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> Nor does the Apoſtle ſeem to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
this practice, but rather <hi>reprehend</hi> their
<hi>Abuſe</hi> of it; and if my Reader will look back
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34322:55"/>
to the foregoing Chapter, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to die 18 Verſe, he may find a more
<hi>Spiritual</hi> Supper, and <hi>Myſtical</hi> Bread and
Cup hinted at by the Apoſtle, as well as
<hi>Mat. 26. 29. Rev.</hi> 3. 20. by our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt himſelf: Which is indeed very copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
expreſt by <hi>Luke</hi> in the Parable of the
<hi>Supper,</hi> chap. 14. from the 16. to die. 24.
Verſe, where One that was at Meat with
Chriſt, ſpeaking of the <hi>Bleſſedneſs of eating
of Bread in the Kingdom of God,</hi> Chriſt takes
occaſion to ſhew forth the <hi>Goſpel Supper</hi> by
a Parable, viz. <hi>A Certain Man made a Great
Supper, and bid many, but they refuſed, upon
divers pretences, and came not; He ſent out a
ſecond and third time to invite an inferiour
ſort of Gueſts,</hi> and they came to the Supper;
that is, they received the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is
the <hi>Power of God to Salvation,</hi> and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as Well as means of It: Which Chriſt
in the 27th verſe further expreſſes, thus
(<hi>viz.) and whoſoever doth not bear my Croſs
and follow me cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> Now
the Croſs of Chriſt, the ſame Apoſtle alſo
ſays, is the Power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. all
which referrs to an <hi>Inward</hi> and Spiritual
Work, and Supper, and that they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Chriſt in Spirit, <hi>Sup with him in Spirit,</hi>
being the partakers of his Spiritual Supper,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34322:55"/>
which Chriſt promiſes and <hi>prepares</hi> for all
thoſe that open <hi>at his knocks</hi> the Door of
their Hearts unto him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly.</hi> But beſides what I have ſaid, both
from Scripture and the Nature of the thing,
in Proof of Chriſt's <hi>Spiritual Supper</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe
of our <hi>diſuſe</hi> of the <hi>viſible Sign,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

to another Ordinance: For our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt did as ſolemnly Command his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<hi>to waſh one anothers Feet,</hi> as to eat the
Supper. The Paſſage is large and edifying,
and I muſt recommend it to my Reader to
peruſe in his Bible, <hi>John</hi> 13. But that part
of it which more ſtrictly concerns this point,
between the Biſhop and me, I ſhall repeat
here, verſe 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>So after he had
waſhed their Feet, and taken his Garments
and was ſet down again; He ſaid unto them,
Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me</hi>
Maſter and Lord; <hi>and ye ſay well; for ſo I
am, If I then, your Lord and Maſter, have
waſhed your Feet,</hi> ye alſo ought to waſh one
anothers Feet: <hi>For I have given you an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
that</hi> ye ſhould do as I have done to
you. Thus Chriſt Commanded his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
not only by his Authority but Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Now does the Biſhop and his Friends
follow Chriſt's example and obey this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept?
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34322:56"/>
He and they know they do not.
What muſt I Infer from thence, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
is no Chriſtian? I ſuppoſe he would
take it very ill from me. Tho' he has treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me and my Friends after that ſort. But I
will ſhew him a better example, and ſuppoſe
he thinks, that if Chriſtian Miniſters and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
walk <hi>Humbly</hi> towards God and one
with another, they fulfil this Commandment,
tho' they diſuſe the Sign, by which the Lord
Jeſus expreſt and recommended <hi>Humility</hi> to
his Followers: Now that which excuſes the
Biſhop in reference to this Ordinance of
<hi>Waſhing of Feet,</hi> will alſo excuſe our diſuſe
of the Supper, <hi>viz. Our eating of the Spiritual
Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> of the Kingdom; the Thing
Signified by the Outward Supper. But it
is an Error incident to ſrail Man, to prefer
the Practice of thoſe things that have a
Shew of Religion, and have <hi>leaſt</hi> of Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
and of the Nature of the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt</hi>
in their Performance. Juſt thus it is eaſier
to receive the Supper than to be <hi>Humble,</hi> if
not eaſier than to waſh Feet: For one is but
a Memorial of Chriſt, but the other perhaps
is a Reproach of preſent Practice, and to be
ſure a Command to <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Self-denial,</hi>
the hardeſt Leſſon in Religion. And
who knows but for the Reaſon it has been
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34322:56"/>
               <hi>dropt</hi> ſo long; ſince it muſt be very uneaſie
for People to continue a Cuſtom, to which
their Daily Practice is ſo viſible a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:
Though I hear the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>mocks the Text Once a Year.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>8ly.</hi> But in Relation to the Supper, we far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſay, the Practice is varied: Then they <hi>Sat,</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow one ſort <hi>Stands,</hi> another <hi>Walks,</hi> a third
<hi>Kneels,</hi> a fourth <hi>Lies down</hi> upon the Ground,
as in the Eaſt Countries. The <hi>Romans</hi> have
one Opinion, the <hi>Greeks</hi> another, and the
<hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> Divide, to great Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs,
in their Sentiments about It.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>9ly.</hi> Again, in thoſe Days they were <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
ſuch as followed Chriſt, now <hi>all</hi> are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
that profeſs Chriſtianity, tho' they
do not follow him or forſake any thing for
his Name ſake, or keep any of his Holy
Precepts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5, 6, 7 Chapters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>10ly.</hi> Nor is this all we have to ſay to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
our <hi>Diſuſe</hi> of this Practice; It is <hi>too
much Look'd at, and Relied upon</hi> by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
And indeed is become a kind of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>Extream Unction;</hi> for if the Generality
of them can but have it adminiſtred juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they Die, they are too apt to preſume
upon it for an acceptance in the other World.
And indeed it is very frequent, if not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
for many Men to excuſe their Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34322:57"/>
by <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and where Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
or Shadowy Services are continued,
People reſt upon their obſervance of them,
and <hi>Indulge</hi> themſelves in the Neglect of
the Doctrine of the <hi>Croſs</hi> of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt. I need not look far, nor yet the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
for a proof of what I ſay; we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miſs, which way ſoever we throw out
Eyes, the more is the pity: And as this is
no ſmall Abuſe of Primitive Practice, ſo no
ſmall Argument for our diſuſe of it. For
when the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> was <hi>over-valued</hi> by
the Jews, God, that had commanded It, for
their benefit, ſtirred up <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>11ly.</hi> Beſides, theſe things are become
matter of <hi>Gain,</hi> and made a <hi>Sacerdotal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,</hi>
not to ſay <hi>Merchandize;</hi> which has
alſo helpt to <hi>Scandalize</hi> People to Tender
Conſciences, who think it a <hi>Prophanation</hi> of
Religion to ſuffer any part of it to be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed</hi>
to the People that ought to be <hi>Free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>12ly.</hi> But paſſing that by at preſent, and
ſuppoſing <hi>Water Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi>
were not Antiquated, but ſtill in Force, Who
is there Qualified to Adminiſter them? Who
has received a <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> or the <hi>Mind</hi> of
the Holy Ghoſt, and Power from on High
to perform theſe things? For if thoſe that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34322:57"/>
hold they are in Force, have <hi>no</hi> Divine
Force or Authority to qualifie them to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter

inſtead of an <hi>Edifying Reality.</hi> Which

               </gap>eads me to what I promiſed long ſince,
That I would at the Cloſe of this Diſcourſe

<hi>Difference</hi> and <hi>Diſſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay then, that where we are ſuppoſed to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iffer moſt, we differ <hi>leaſt;</hi> and where we
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re believed to differ leaſt, we <hi>moſt of all</hi>
differ: Which I explain thus. It's generally
thought, that we do not hold the Common
Doctrines of Chriſtianity, but have Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<hi>New</hi> and <hi>Erroneous</hi> Ones in lieu there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
Whereas we plainly and entirely Believe
the <hi>Truths contained in the Creed</hi> that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> which is very
Comprehenſive as well as Ancient. But that
which hath affected our Minds moſt, and
engaged us in this Separation, was the great
<hi>Carnality</hi> and <hi>Emptineſs</hi> both of Miniſters
and People, under their Profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
They <hi>having hardly the Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi>
but generally ſpeaking, <hi>denying the
Power thereof; from whom,</hi> the Scripture
warns Believers <hi>to turn away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next Miniſters being made ſuch, and
preaching, and the People worſhipping
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34322:58"/>
               <hi>without the Spirit,</hi> confining the Operations
of it, to the <hi>Firſt</hi> or <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Times, as if
theſe did not want them, <hi>as much,</hi> or that
Chriſt would be <hi>leſs</hi> Propitious, where his
Gifts were not leſs needful. I ſay, an <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
and <hi>Lifeleſs</hi> Miniſtry and Worſhip, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the great Wordlineſs of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
have occaſioned our Separation; and
the Perſecution that has commonly followed
it, hath abundantly confirmed our Judgment
In that Matter. Hence it was we Retired
our ſelves to wait upon God together, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Gift of his Holy Spirit, and
as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted the <hi>Athenians</hi>
Acts 17. <hi>We felt after him</hi> (with our Souls)
<hi>if by any means we might find him, and hear
what God the Lord would ſay unto us; who
ſpeaks Peace unto his People and his Saints, but
let them never turn to folly any more.</hi> We
could not, I ſay, tell how to think that ſuch
as God had never ſent, but run <hi>of themſelves,</hi>
and were made Miniſters by <hi>Humane Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
and <hi>Authority,</hi> not knowing the Work of
the Spirit to their <hi>own Regeneration,</hi> could
poſſibly Profit or Edifie the People <hi>unto</hi> their
<hi>Regeneration:</hi> And yet that is the very <hi>Work</hi>
and <hi>End</hi> of the true Goſpel Miniſtry, for no
Man can guide another in the way he never trod.</p>

of God will be come in us, and his will done
in our Earth as it is in Heaven: Which
God Grant, I moſt Humbly beſeech him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:34322:61"/>
For the Concluſion of the Biſhop's Paper,
it is either <hi>Repitition,</hi> or <hi>Reflection;</hi> the one
needs no Anſwer, and the other wants a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
However, I will not have it ſaid
that I either wave or ſuppreſs It, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without any Reflection I will conſider
his: Which ſhould have no weight with my
Reader but againſt him.</p>
            <p>He ſays in his 12 Paragraph, He <hi>pities
us,</hi> thinking many of us <hi>Harmleſs</hi> and <hi>Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning,
but under the Power of ſtrong Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>
And in his 13 Paragraph he gives us
his ſence of the cauſe thereof, viz. <hi>that we
make the Light within, a Rule of Faith and
Practice, Co-ordinate, if not Superiour and
Antecedent to the Holy Scripture.</hi> To prove
which to be our Sentiment, he cites theſe
words out of our <hi>Goſpel-Truths,</hi> where
ſpeaking of the Holy Spirit, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
we ſay, <hi>they are the Double and
Agreeing Record of true Religion.</hi> Now if
the Light and Spirit agree with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
there is no fear of contradicting the
Scripture, and ſo we can have nothing to
anſwer for on account of that Expreſſion, for
what agrees with the Scripture, <hi>eſtabliſhes</hi>
it, inſtead of Slighting or Superceeding the
Authority of it.</p>
            <p>And though we uſed no ſuch words as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34322:61"/>
               <hi>Co-ordinate,</hi> much leſs <hi>Superiour and Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
which is the Biſhop's Gloſs to render
our moſt True and In-offenſive Expreſſion
ſuſpected, and make way to faſten his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>Strong Deluſions</hi> upon us; I will be
very frank with him in this matter, that we
Believe the Scripture to be the Declaration
of the Mind of the Holy Ghoſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not Superiour to the Holy Ghoſt, but
<hi>Credited, Confirmed, and Expounded</hi> by the
Holy Ghoſt; ſo that without the Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of It, the Scripture cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by them that read It. The Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and Critical Senſe of the Words and
Alluſions therein may be underſtood, but
the <hi>Inſide</hi> and Spiritual Signification of them,
is a Riddle to thoſe that are not Spiritually
inſtructed therein, tho' they were never ſuch
Grammarians or Linguiſts.</p>
            <p>Again Chriſt ſays, <hi>He that loves the Light
brings his Deeds to the Light, to ſee if they
are wrought in God,</hi> John 3. 21. which was
before the New Teſtament Scripture was in
being; and this makes It both <hi>Rule</hi> and
<hi>Judge</hi> of the Life and Deeds of Men. What
ſays the Biſhop to this? Alſo <hi>John</hi> 14, 15,
16 Chapters, Chriſt promiſes the <hi>Spirit to
lead them,</hi> his People, <hi>into all Truth,</hi> and
this was not the Scripture, but ſomething at
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34322:62"/>
leaſt <hi>Co-ordinate, if not Superiour and Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to the Scripture,</hi> which is more than
we ſaid before. Alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells
the Romans, Ch. 8. that <hi>as many as are led
by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God;</hi>
Then the Spirit is to Lead Believers, or
they cannot be the Children of God. And
that which Leads, Rules, and that which
Rules is a <hi>Rule</hi> to them that follow it. And
the ſame Apoſtle referr'd the <hi>Galathians,</hi>
Chap. 6. 15, 16. to the Rule of the <hi>New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
to walk by, and that muſt be the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which begets the <hi>New Creature,</hi> viz.
<hi>Chriſt formed in them,</hi> of whom he tells them,
Chap. 14. 19. <hi>He travelled in Birth again.</hi>
And the Beloved Diſciple expreſly ſays to
the Chriſtians in his Firſt Epiſtle, Chap. 2.
20. that they had an <hi>Unction from the Holy
One, and they knew all things</hi> / that is, all
things they had to Believe, Know and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
And Verſe 27. he adds, <hi>But the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
which ye have received abideth in you,
and ye need not that any Man teach you, but as
the ſame Anointing teacheth you of</hi> All things,
<hi>and is Truth.</hi> If the Biſhop will break
through all theſe Scriptures to undervalue
the Light and Spirit of Chriſt (for no other
Light or Spirit do we Aſſert, Recommend
People to, or Contend for) that he might
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34322:62"/>
render us Guilty of <hi>Strong Deluſions,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help it, but muſt be truly ſorry for him.
But I beſeech him to have a care that he
does not, like the Jews of old, Undervalue,
and indeed <hi>Blaſpheme</hi> againſt the Holy Light
and Spirit of God, and by miſcalling the
Fruits and Effects of its Power, <hi>Strong Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Transformations of Satan:</hi> For God
will not hold ſuch Guiltleſs in his Great and
Terrible Day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>And after all, the Beſt and Firſt Reformers
and Martyrs, as well as Fathers, Concur in
our Aſſertion and Teſtimony. As <hi>Zuinglius,
Luther, Melanchton, Calvin, Beza, Bucer,
Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Eraſmus</hi> too. Alſo our
own Excellent Martyrs, <hi>viz. Lambert, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
Philpot, Bradford, Hooper, Woodman,</hi>
&amp;c. that the <hi>Double and Agreeing Teſtimony</hi> of
the <hi>Spirit of God within, and the Scripture of
Truth without, is the Rule and Judge of Faith,
Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice;</hi> yea that the Spirit is
given to Believers to be the <hi>Rule and Judge</hi>
by which they are to underſtand the true
Senſe and Meaning of the Scriptures.
Now let the Reader judge who gives the
Trueſt Honour to the Scripture, the Biſhop,
or the People called Quakers? They ſay
the Scriptures have a Double Record, that
is, the Evidence of the Spirit of Truth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34322:63"/>
in the Hearts of Believers, as well as their
Own: Or the Biſhop, who by his way of
Treating us and our Principle, will allow us
no other Evidence of their Truth, but Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
For to ſay the Evidence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, with that of the Scripture, make
a <hi>Double and agreeing Teſtimony</hi> is with him
to undervalue the Scripture, and the Ground,
in his Apprehenſion, of our Strong Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It muſt be my turn now to pity the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
and truly I do it with all my Heart,
to ſee him <hi>ſtrain</hi> ſo Sound, as well as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive</hi>
an Expreſſion, as that which he
makes the Reaſon of our Deluſion, that he
might have an occaſion to leſſen our Credit
with the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Proteſtants. Can it Dishonour the
Scripture to deny the Evidence of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
and Author of the Scripture, to back
the Authority of the Scripture? Or doth
not he rather leſſen the Authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that will not allow us another Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Truth of Scripture than its
own, for fear of <hi>Co-ordinacy,</hi> which was not
ſo much as once intended to be inſinuated
by us, nor do the words import any ſuch
thing; yet it had been no ſtrong, nor any
<hi>Deluſion at all</hi> to give the Holy Ghoſt the
Preference. But I ſhall keep to the Terms
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34322:63"/>
of the Paper, whatever the Biſhop is pleaſed
to do; knowing that whoever Concludes
an Argument in terms not in the Queſtion,
nor plainly deduceable from the Premiſes,
is not a <hi>fair Dealer</hi> in Controverſie: In
which the Biſhop, if he pleaſes, may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
enough think himſelf more than
once concerned.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God we have known the Power
and Efficiency of this Holy Light and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Chriſt in our ſelves, and being in
good meaſures Witneſſes thereof, we do not
only ſpeak by Report, but by Experience.
We had the Scriptures in the Days of our
Ignorance and Worldly-mindedneſs, but
diſregarding the Reproofs and Inſtruction of
the Light of Jeſus in our Hearts, we never
could come to know the Power of thoſe
Truths the Scripture declares of. But when
it pleaſed God, in the Riches of his Love,
to cauſe his bleſſed Light, that had ſhined
in Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
it not, <hi>to ſhine out of Darkneſs,</hi> and
<hi>gives us the Knowledge of himſelf in the Face</hi>
(or through the Manifeſtation) of his Son
Jeſus Chriſt, we ſaw and bewailed our ſelves,
and by an unfeigned Sorrow and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
returned as Penitent Prodigals to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our Fathers Houſe; and in this Turn,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34322:64"/>
we were brought to die daily to that Love
and Satisfaction we once had in the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Pleaſures, Honours, Friendſhips and
Diverſions of the World, which now became
<hi>Burdenſome,</hi> more than ever they were pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to us.</p>
            <p>Hence it was, and from no Siniſter Ends,
or Self-righteous Conceits, that we became
an altered and a diſtinguiſhed People, in our
Behaviour, Garb and Converſation: More
<hi>Retired, Watchful, Silent</hi> and <hi>Plain,</hi> than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
equally avoiding <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice.</hi>
I ſay, it was the Work of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
upon our Hearts, who by his Light gave
us to ſee the juſt difference of things, and to
diſtinguiſh between that which pleaſed Him,
and that which pleaſed Him not. And
this Holy Pattern he gave us in the Light
of his beloved Son, which we deſign to
follow, as did the Holy Ancients; and is
a full Anſwer to the Biſhop's Unfriendly
Queries upon our diſtinguiſhing Behaviour,
in his 14th and 15th Paragraph, as if it
were not out of Fear towards God, or upon
a Conſcientious Bottom, but to ſerve a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Turn? For he asks us <hi>Is it not your</hi> main
Aim, End and Study, by pretended <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
to make your ſelves a Party Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi>
Again, <hi>Are not to this Purpoſe your dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34322:64"/>
Garb, Speech, Looks and Geſtures, and
to make your ſelves remarkable, rather than out
of a Senſe of Duty, or Conſcience of Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
Which, as it is the worſt Conſtruction
that the moſt Irreligious and Prophane
could make upon our Behaviour, ſo I beſeech
God to forgive the Biſhop, and make him
ſenſible how little ſuch Treatment of ſtrict &amp;
ſober Living advances the Common Cauſe of
Religion, and how much it indulges thoſe
that know no Reins or Check to their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
in his own Church. But to go no
farther than the Biſhop and his <hi>Clergy,</hi> pray
who diſtinguiſh themſelves more by their
Garb from other People then they? Tho' I
cannot ſay as much of their Behaviour. So
indeed did the <hi>Chemerims</hi> or black Coats
of old, and Thoſe that wore long Robes
in our Saviours time, but as I take it, they
went not without his Cenſure, while I
think the Biſhop will find none in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
againſt our Plainneſs. But the Biſhops
Pontifical Robes, do in my Opinion look
much more like <hi>Singularity</hi> and a <hi>Sight</hi>
than ours; for our Garb is like other
Mens, only freed of their Superfluity.
In ſhort I wiſh him a better Underſtanding
of the true Grounds of our ſtricter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and Where and Who they are that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34322:65"/>
make a <hi>Trade</hi> of Religion; that if he has
any Shot left againſt <hi>Mercinary</hi> Religioniſts,
he may not miſs the Mark next time, but
may make it his <hi>main Aim, End</hi> and <hi>Study,</hi>
to Expoſe Hirelings and Hypocrites in
their Proper Colours: And ſome are of
Opinion he need not go far to find too many
of them.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange the Biſhop ſhould be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
of the Advantage he gives me by
his <hi>Queries,</hi> and what a wide Door he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to a ſevere Retaliation; but my deſire
to be Modeſt, and to be Silent upon ſuch
Advantages, is, I think, to be abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, I muſt take Notice of one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
for it may too ſeriouſly affect us
not to be obſerved to him. When he asks,
<hi>If it be not our main End and Study, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Mortifications, to make our ſelves a
Party Conſiderable?</hi> He adds, <hi>and ſuch to
which, <hi>for Reaſons of State</hi> / Peculiar Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
muſt be indulged.</hi> If this were not
more than Mockery, I ſhould wave my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
but calling the meaning of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in Queſtion about the <hi>Liberty of
Conſcience</hi> we enjoy, He muſt forgive me if
I beſtow a few Remarks upon that Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
It ſeems then our Liberty flows not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34322:65"/>
from the Inclination of the Government to
Liberty, leſs from Compaſſion, and leaſt of
all from Juſtice and a Chriſtian Principle.
Which Motives carry with them a Proſpect
of the Continuance of Liberty, if not for
Liberties ſake. But the Biſhop believes no
ſuch thing, and if he would not have us of
his mind, he did weakly to tell us ſo.
Well then, we are all of us to take his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement,
that our Liberty hangs but by
ſlender Threads, and a <hi>Reaſon of State,</hi> and
not of Nature, Right or Chriſtianity; which
certainly is not to beſpeak this <hi>Conſiderable
Party</hi> to the advantage of the Government:
And for which I think the Biſhop a very
moderate States-man, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as little beholding to his <hi>Politicks</hi> as
we are to his <hi>Charity.</hi> However, we will
have a better Opinion of our Superiors Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
to Liberty, and conclude that their
Inclination equals their Diſcretion, and that
their Judgment as well as Prudence is of
that ſide. Let the Biſhop ſay what he
pleaſes. And tho' he deſerves it not at my
Hands, I could almoſt perſwade my ſelf to
think that he does not begrudge us, and
means not ſo looſly as he writes. But be
it as it will, <hi>That God that has upheld us by
hit free Spirit to this Day, through many and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34322:66"/>
great Afflictions, we firmly believe will ſuffer
nothing to attend us, that ſhall not in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
work for his Glory and our Good, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſtedfaſt to the End, in the bleſſed way of
Righteouſneſs, wherein he has ſo often and
ſignally Owned and Preſerved us; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Violence of Open Enemies, and the
Treacherous and Reſtleſs Endeavours of Falſe
Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His 16th Paragraph multiplies Reflection,
as before obſerved, and Repeats what I have
already largely anſwered; particularly that
we own the Chriſtian Faith, which he
makes us to <hi>Wave, Suppreſs,</hi> or at leaſt not
to Confeſs; and have expreſs'd it even in
the Paper, he has faulted ſo much of Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and that more fully, in all Points,
than in the Creed commonly called the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenaſian;</hi>
except that about the <hi>Trinity,</hi>
which ſeems to me leſs plain by that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
way taken to explain It.</p>
            <p>He alſo ſays, <hi>We Reject all Outward, Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Parts of Worſhip,</hi> which we deny: For
we own and uſe <hi>Prayer, Preaching</hi> and <hi>Praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Spirit,</hi> without which they cannot
be Owned or Joined with; for they cannot
be ſo performed to Edification by a true
Chriſtian Worſhipper; ſince God, <hi>who is a
Spirit, will be Worſhipped in Spirit, and in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34322:66"/>
Truth,</hi> which Chriſt's Spirit muſt enable us
to perform. And ſuch Worſhippers Only
God the Father ſeeks to Worſhip him: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
he regards not other Worſhippers.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Eſpecially,</hi> the Biſhop ſays, <hi>we reject
Baptiſm and the Supper.</hi> We ſay we do not
<hi>Reject</hi> but <hi>Diſuſe</hi> the Signs, becauſe we felt
the <hi>Inviſible Graces</hi> in <hi>our Souls</hi> they were
<hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of; and therefore not in
<hi>Diſreſpect</hi> to the Signs, but in <hi>Reverence</hi> to
the Divine Subſtance they ſhew forth, we
diſcontinue their uſe among us. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
place in the <hi>Infancy</hi> and <hi>Twi-light</hi> of
the Church; in her more weak and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
time, directing, as I may ſay, that
<hi>Inter-regnum</hi> between the Law and Goſpel,
before the Diſpenſation of the Holy Ghoſt
had <hi>Fully</hi> obtained Place and Preheminence
in the Church. But of this I have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
very particular.</p>
            <p>He grows <hi>warm</hi> in his 17th Paragraph and
<hi>Epiſcopal;</hi> for he ſays, <hi>In a word, I again</hi>
Require <hi>you, as you will anſwer all your</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Arts and Pretenſions <hi>at Chriſt's Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>
that you either Embrace and Profeſs
the Entire Chriſtian Truth, <hi>in the Points
wherein I have ſhewn you to be Defective;
and that you receive the Chriſtian</hi> Seals or
Badges, Baptiſm <hi>and the</hi> Lord's Supper; <hi>or
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34322:67"/>
elſe that you</hi> Deſiſt <hi>to lay claim to the Name of Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But firſt I muſt return the Biſhop <hi>his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Arts and Pretenſions,</hi> In all which he is
Greviouſly Miſtaken. For either I do not
underſtand his meaning, or I abhor it.
Next, be it known to him, we <hi>Wave not,</hi>
we <hi>Suppreſs not,</hi> but heartily Embrace and
Profeſs before the whole World, all Points
of Chriſtian Doctrine, according to the
mind of the Holy Ghoſt, as I have amply
ſignified before upon this ſubject. And
where the Biſhop takes leave of the Text,
he muſt excuſe me if I leave him to keep
company with it. We did not Entitle our
Paper <hi>All Goſpel-Truths;</hi> but <hi>Goſpel-Truths,</hi>
which extended ſo far as we were Tax'd
with Error about thoſe Truths: And yet he
muſt have but a little Charity that will not
allow a Believer and Follower of thoſe
Truths to be a Chriſtian. Nor indeed has
the Biſhop given us the Articles of Faith he
ſays we <hi>Wave</hi> or <hi>Suppreſs,</hi> or told us his
own, or that <hi>One Churches</hi> Faith he would
have us receive, as I have Complained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
But that the Biſhop <hi>ſhould forbid us
ſo much as to lay claim to the Name of</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<hi>unleſs we will Practice what he calls
the</hi> Seals or Badges <hi>of Chriſtianity</hi> (which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34322:67"/>
divers Churches in Chriſtendom think he
miſuſes) is very Uncharitable and Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.
But beſides what I have ſaid at large
in our Excuſe and Defence in that Matter,
he produces not one Scripture that calls
them either <hi>Seals</hi> or <hi>Badges.</hi> But yet there
are other things that are ſo repreſented by
our bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles, which
he takes no notice of. As <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24.
where, <hi>they that will he reputed Chriſt's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
muſt take up his Croſs and follow him.</hi>
Chriſt's <hi>Croſs</hi> is a Chriſtians <hi>Badge</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi>
of Diſcipleſhip. Again, <hi>John</hi> 13. 35. He
ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>By this ſhall all Men
know that ye are my Diſciples if ye love one
another.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34, 35, 36.
The Diſtinguiſhing Character of the laſt
Day is not Water Baptiſm and the Outward
Supper, but <hi>Love, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion;
Bowels</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> not being <hi>Aſhamed</hi> or
<hi>Afraid</hi> of Owning and Helping the Lord's
Servants in their Afflictions, viz. <hi>I was an
Hungry and ye gave Me Meat: I was Thirſty
and ye gave Me Drink: I was a Stranger and
ye took Me in: Naked and ye Cloathed Me:
I was Sick and ye viſited Me: I was in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and ye came unto Me.</hi> This is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<hi>Badge</hi> that will be Recognized by our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt at the laſt day: We
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34322:68"/>
have his own Word for It. In all which,
He is ſo far from mentioning either of the
other Badges that <hi>Luke</hi> 13. He brings in
the <hi>Unhappy,</hi> that are on his left hand, uſing
this Argument to engage him to receive
them into bleſſedneſs, viz. <hi>We have</hi> Eaten
<hi>and</hi> Drank <hi>in thy Preſence, and thou haſt
taught in our Streets.</hi> A plain Inſtance they
had the uſe of ſuch Ordinances as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
reputes <hi>Badges</hi> of Chriſtianity; but it
is as plain that ſuch Pleas would not do:
For behold the Lord Jeſus ſays unto them
in the Parable, <hi>I know you not, depart from
me ye workers of Iniquity!</hi> I recommend the
peruſal of the following Verſes to my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which confirm my ſenſe of the Text:
For He ſpoke to an outſide People that
counted themſelves the People of God, and
were obſervers of <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks,</hi> and
<hi>Divers Waſhings:</hi> And that which was
Doctrine and Caution then, is Doctrine and
Caution now; for Truth holds the ſame to
the End.</p>
            <p>I might add, Holineſs for a <hi>Characteriſtick,
without which no Man ſhall ever ſee the Lord:</hi>
And that <hi>neither Circumciſion availeth any
thing nor Uncircumciſion, but a</hi> New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. Alſo the Fruits of the Spirit,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 5. among which there is not one
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34322:68"/>
word about <hi>Water- Baptiſm</hi> or the <hi>Outward
Supper,</hi> with many more Paſſages that are
Cloſe and Cogent.</p>
            <p>His 18th and laſt Paragraph tells us, <hi>He
will not judge us,</hi> and yet his whole Paper
is but one Continued Judgment of us. But,
<hi>from God,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>and as his Miniſter he
bids us Judge our ſelves.</hi> Firſt, We thank
God we are before-hand with the Biſhop,
having Judged our ſelves, and that by the
Judgment of God upon us, and ſo have
right to Judge others according to that
Judgment. Secondly, We have no proof
that the Biſhop ſpeaks from God to us:
Nor can I tell how he ſhould, that does
not acknowledge the Inſpeaking Word of
God in the Soul. Thirdly, For his being
God's Miniſter, he has not ſhewn us his
Commiſſion yet, and I fear it will not be
from Heaven when ever he does. But if
my Reader will take the pains of peruſing
this very Paragraph, he will not only ſee a
Judging Spirit, but that the Biſhop holds
out abuſing of us to the laſt, rendring us as
bad as bad can be, <hi>viz.</hi> That we <hi>Subvert the

your making</hi> Gain <hi>your</hi> Godlineſs. But as I
have already taken ample notice of this
Charge, ſo I ſhall ſay no more of his Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<hi>Slant</hi> at our Sincerity than this,
That I cannot pretend to tell the Biſhop
what Tribe of Men in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> it is that
have long made Gain their Godlineſs, and
the Pretence of it their Worldly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
ſince he has been ſo much more
Senſibly inſtructed in this Affair than my
ſelf: But one thing I am ſure of, that if
<hi>Gain</hi> and not <hi>Godlineſs</hi> was our Motive to
be the People we are, we mightily Miſtook
our way <hi>when we left the Biſhops:</hi> For <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
Spoiles, Priſons, Baniſhments,</hi> yea,
and <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf have attended us ſince God
was pleaſed to manifeſt his Truth to us:
And if under all thoſe Calamitys that have
followed us ſince we were a People, for the
ſake of our Unfaſhionable Profeſſion, the
Biſhop or any elſe is ſo Unnatural, as to
envy us the Bleſſing of God upon our
honeſt Induſtry, and to render that which
is an Effect of God's Goodneſs, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and End of our Religion, God forgive
them. I could Enlarge upon this Topick,
but time would fail, and the Diſcourſe
ſwell beyond Bounds, as indeed it hath
already beyond my Expectation: for which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34322:69"/>
I ſhould Excuſe my ſelf to my Reader, but
that it was not Simply from the Regard I
had to the Biſhop's Sheet, ſince that could
not have deſerved this Notice from me, but
might have been anſwered as Conciſely as
that was written, had I only conſidered his
Undertaking and Treatment, and not my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Satisfaction, in the better Knowledge of
our ſo much Miſrepreſented Perſwaſion:
Eſpecially in a Nation, where of late I had
occaſion ſo Generally to Travel, and the
Biſhop's Paper hath been I ſuppoſe as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
Diſperſt. I owe it therefore to My
Profeſſion, to My Self, and to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to Vindicate the One, and to Expreſs
my Chriſtian Regard and Acknowledgment
to the Other; having received a more than
common Civility from the Inhabitants in
General: To whom I wiſh, as to my own
Soul, the Saving Knowledge of the Truth,
as it is in Jeſus: That Chriſtians <hi>Indeed</hi>
and <hi>at Heart</hi> They may be, to the Glory
of God their Creator, and the Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatiou
