         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>O Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the pure love of God, and freſh Breath of his living
Spirit, is it now on my heart to write unto you, in
fear, in tenderneſs, in meltings and true ſence of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and the Lord God ſo guide my heart and words,
as that they may reach the witneſs in the hearts of all that
ſhall read, and may be felt by that to be purely of God,
and not at all of the birth, will, or wiſdom of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>I remember, I remember, O Friends, and it is in my
heart to put you in remembrance of the cloudy, diſmal
and dark day, wherein the Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> our
Souls, and what condition we were in, when he cauſed
the Light of Life to ſhine upon our Tabernacles, and to
ſpring up in us. O the deſolation, the deſolation that
our Souls were in, in that day! O the wandrings up and
down, the ſeekings, huntings, mournings, bitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
and deep diſtreſſes for want of our God, and for
want of the guidance of his good Spirit! Who can utter
now what was then felt of the thickneſs of darkneſs, of
the miſery, the loſs, the dreadful captivity that poor Souls
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93157:2"/>
were entangled and wraped up in? O how acceptable
was the Viſitation of God then! how deep was the ſence
of his tender Mercy in viſiting! how glad was the Soul
then of the living Path revealed! how unfainedly did it
cleave unto the Lord, and embrace the meaſure of his
Life revealed inwardly to the mind! how did it fear! how
did it wait! how did it watch againſt the Enemy, and cry
to the Father for his help! how beautiful were the Feet,
and how pleaſant the viſitations of them, who brought
the tydings of this Life and Peace! What love, what uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
what embracing one another in this life, was then wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
in the hearts of one another! and where this lives
and grows to this day, O how precious is that Veſſel!
but where the Life in any is departed from, where ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing (of another nature) hath entered and been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by any, there it is not ſo; but there the love is
grown cold, the mind changed, the goodneſs of the Lord
forgotten, and the poor Soul again entangled in that
which formerly it felt ſome releaſe and deliverance from.</p>
            <p>Now, that the Enemy would endeavour to entangle
the minds of the Redeemed, and to draw them back from
the Lord, and his pure meaſure of Life in the heart,
towards Perdition again, that is not to be queſtioned, it
being his Nature and Property ſo to do; and that he
would uſe, not only his ſtrength, but alſo all his ſubtilty &amp;
deceiveableneſs to affect this (his aim being at the Church
and Redeemed of God, more then at the World) appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as an Angel of Light, in motions like Light, in wayes
like Life, this is not to be doubted neither; for how elſe
could he gain upon that, whoſe eye is towards, and whoſe
aim is after the Lord? But this is the great thing for my
heart, and the hearts of Friends, to be exerciſed in, to wait
on the Lord, in his true Light, clearly to diſcern how far
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93157:2"/>
we have been aſſaulted by this Enemy; and how far the
Lord hath preſerved us from his aſſaults, or ſuffered him
to prevail upon us; for he hath prevailed in former Ages,
under the ministration of the Law in the Prophets dayes,
and under the miniſtration of the Goſpel in the Apoſtles
dayes; yea, and I muſt needs ſay, he hath alſo prevailed
in our dayes, on all that have not watched in the pure
Fear, and been preſerved by the pure Power of the Lord.
Now doth it not concern every one to look up to the
Lord, to guide his heart in ſearching, that he may truly
underſtand his ſtate? that, if he can witneſs the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Power, he may ſing praiſe to the Power;
but if he hath been betrayed and come to a loſs, he may
ſeek after the Power of Life again, and wait for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and reſtoring by it. For with the Lord God is
Mercy and Bowels, and he ſeeketh after and ſaveth the
Loſt, not once onely, but again and again; onely here is
the great danger of Souls, when they are ignorant of
their Captivity, and judge in themſelves, and are guided
by that, which ſhould be judged down and deſtroyed in
them; When Darkneſs is the light and leader in the
Mind, O whither doth that Soul travel! how doth it
judge, think, act! how ſure doth the Enemy hold it in
his Bonds and Chains! how eaſily doth he prejudice it
againſt that, which is of God and for its good; and incline
it to think favourably of that, which only appeareth to be
of God, but is not, and is to its hurt.</p>
            <p>Now Friends, there were three things on my heart
this morning, which ſprang up in true ſence and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of God's Spirit, as ſubtil engines, which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
hath endeavoured to make uſe of to hurt our Souls;
which any that have been entangled in, have received
hurt by, and thoſe that have eſcaped, have cauſe to bleſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93157:3"/>
the Name of the Preſerver of <hi>ISRAEL.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is this, By getting in Perſons prejudices againſt
thoſe whom the Lord hath choſen, and pleaſeth to make
uſe of in Miniſtring to his People. Precious is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
that is in the Spirit, for the building up in Life, as
well as for begetting. How doth the Enemy ſtrive to
prejudice the World againſt them, that there may be no
begetting to God from amongſt them? And how doth he
alſo endeavour to raiſe prejudices among the Begotten,
that he may interrupt, and (if poſſibly) ſtop their build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up?</p>
            <p>The ſecond is this, To draw men from eying and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
to the preſent diſpenſation, by an earneſt looking
after and waiting for another, or further. The ſecurity and
bleſſing of the Soul lies in the preſent diſpenſation, in
bowing to God there, in being diligent under the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
of his Spirit therein. Now that which draws the
mind another way, from the preſent exerciſe, from belief
in the preſent gift, under a ſpecious pretence of waiting
for ſomewhat more glorious to appear, betrayes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
in thus turning the mind out of the Path which
God holds forth and guides into, towards expectation of
a Path as yet to be revealed.</p>
            <p>The third is this, Under a pretence of ſticking to the
enlightning &amp; guidance of ones own meaſure, to ſet up a
ſenſe and judgement in the mind, both concerning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
practices, and things, which is not truly of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
but ſecretly inſtilled into and raiſed up in the mind,
contrary to the pure meaſure of Life. All theſe have I
not onely ſeen in Spirit, but been forely aſſaulted with;
and that they have not prevailed upon me, even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
is the tender mercy and kindneſs of the Lord
unto me; and in that tenderneſs and love, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93157:3"/>
of others do I write theſe things: And indeed, I
have ſomewhat in my heart to ſay ſingly and nakedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
each of theſe, which the Lord guide and bleſs
to the conditions of thoſe who ſtand in need thereof.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Concerning thoſe prejudices which the Enemy
is apt to lay before the minds of Friends concerning thoſe
whom the Lord hath choſen to miniſter to them in the
Power of his Truth, I ſhall ſay this: Look over the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
diſpenſations of God; There were falſe Prophets
under the Law, and falſe Apoſtles and Miniſters in the
time of that diſpenſation of the Goſpel, who did ſtrive
and labour hard to diſturb, undermine and overturn the
Building and Work of God in the Spirits of his People
then; but did God ſuffer the True Prophets under the
Law, or his True Apoſtles to fall and loſe their Miniſtry?
And is not this preſent diſpenſation pure and living, and
able to preſerve both the Inſtructers and Inſtructed in the
Lord? It is natural to the Enemy to ſuggeſt ſuch a thing;
but let all that fear the Lord and love his Truth, take heed
how they entertain ſuch a ſuggeſtion. Beſides, he that
hath felt the pure Power in his heart, and waited to be
carried through the work of it, and hath been carried
through and brought into the dominion, and ſet as a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
in the Temple of the Lord; it is not eaſie (if poſſible)
for him to fall, the Lord having undertaken for him, that
he ſhall <hi>go no more forth,</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 12. But let me ſay
this to thee, O Soul, who ever haſt entertained this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
Thou, through prejudices and ſuggeſtions judgeſt
them fallen; but do not they, in the true Eternal Light
of the Spirit of Life, ſee thee fallen? Nay, if thou couldſt
but retire to the pure meaſure that at firſt quickened
thee, mighteſt not thou feel thy own fall?</p>
            <p>To the ſecond, Of drawing out the mind to look after
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93157:4"/>
another or further diſpenſation, I have this to ſay: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what this diſpenſation is; Is it not of the Seed it
ſelf? Is it not of the Light, Life and Power of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
manifeſted in the Seed, and in the Soul through the
Seed? Is not the ſence quick, and the love pure, where
this is felt? What wouldſt thou have, poor Soul? O that
thou felteſt the virtue and power of this, ſurely thou
wouldſt then find, that thou mighteſt ſit down here in the
Peace, Purity, Power, Dominion and Perfection of Life;
for it is all in the Seed, and to be revealed to thee, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
thine, as thou art gathered into the Seed, and the
Seed opened in thee. Beſides, are there not many that
have witneſſed, and that can witneſs from God, that this
is the diſpenſation which is to go through the whole earth?
and ſhall it be laid aſide in the beginning of its work? <hi>If
there had been a Law given, which could have given Life,</hi>
(ſaid the Apoſtle) <hi>Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the
Law.</hi> God doth not change. When he hath brought forth
that which will do the thing, why ſhould he change it?
Now of the ability of this, there are many witneſſes;
Yea it hath brought forth Life and Righteouſneſs in thoſe
that have been ſubject to it, and was once owned as the
deſire of our Souls, and became a covering to our eyes
that we could look no further; our hearts in the ſenſe and
life of Truth, being ſatisfied that this was the very thing
we had long mourned after, and waited for. O that
which begets another ſenſe in any of us, (under what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
or appearance ſoever) let it be the abomination of
our Souls, that we hearken not, nor give the leaſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to it, leſt by it we be betrayed of our portion
in the bleſſed Treaſure and Inheritance.</p>
            <p>To the third I ſay; It is a ſtanding Truth, the Standard
we were invited to, and to which we are to keep for ever,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93157:4"/>
even the meaſure of Life in our own Veſſels: This will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
us in our ſubjection to whatever it reveals; and its ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
will ſtand, whatſoever any man elſe ſhall ſay to
the contrary. But this is at unity in it ſelf, and never op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
the motion or appearance of Life in another. Now
this is certain, the Enemy will appear as neer life and its
motion, as he can; and if I receive his appearance, I am
not ſubject to the meaſure of life in me, but to him under
his deceitful appearance. Therefore if that, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
like Life in thee, contradict a practice or appearance
of Life in others, (who were in the Truth before thee,
and are in the growth thereof far beyond thee) oughteſt
thou not to be ſober in Spirit, and to wait in fear, leſt thou
ſhouldeſt be deceived, leſt thou ſhouldeſt exalt Self and
the Enemy in thee, and not the Truth; yea leſt thy heart
ſhould grow hard, and thy neck ſtiff againſt thoſe who
are over thee in the Lord, and ſo thou loſe the benefit of
their watching over thee and counſel to thee, and of Gods
preſervation? For out of the Truth, in the deceitful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
there is no preſervation, nor true Light, nor
juſtification of Life, but ſelf conceit fleſhly confidence,
and the juſtification of a mans own ſpirit; and his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
then gets up, and exalts it ſelf, as if it were the right
thing. The Lord gave the meaſure of Life to thee, and
the Lord alſo hath given Fathers, Guides, Inſtructers,
Watchmen, in his <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Theſe have a ſervice from the
Lord towards thee, who knoweth that thy Soul hath need
of that ſervice; now if the Enemy can prejudice thee
againſt, and withdraw thee from the uſe of what thou
needeſt, art thou not in danger of falling and miſcarriage?
Doſt not thou ſet up the meaſure of Life in thee (if not
another thing) beyond its place, ſtate and growth? And
can any thing grow and thrive out of the Order and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93157:5"/>
of God? Nay, nay, the very meaſure of life it ſelf
will this way come to wither and die in thee, and another
thing live in its place, and the Sword of the Lord will be
drawn againſt thee, and thou wilt be cut off from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and alſo from him who is the quickner and preſerver
of the Body. Therefore my Friends, as the Enemy
watcheth to deceive and deſtroy, ſo the Lord keep our
Souls in the true Watch and looking up to him, who (to
thoſe that fear him) diſcovereth the deceit, and preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from the ſnare.</p>
            <p>And this is witneſſed concerning the meaſure of Life
in the heart, and the way of its acting and operation, that
it alwayes acts in its place, even in due ſubjection to the
Father of Spirits, and to his Life in others according to
its growth: for there is no rent nor diviſion in the living
Body, no ſetting up one meaſure of Life againſt another
meaſure, or one motion of Life againſt another motion,
or one practice againſt another, but all there is in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in the love, in the tenderneſs, in the ſence, in the peace,
in the dominion, in the ſubjection; and that which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
or diſſenteth from the Life, interrupting the Union
and Uniformity in the Life, is not of the Life; which
when it is every-where caſt out, Life to Life will anſwer
every-where; which day my Soul breatheth and waiteth
for, even the day wherein Life alone ſhall live and reign
in every Veſſel, and all the devices and ſnares of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
not be able to enter upon, or catch any of God's little
ſimple-hearted ones; but ſtill by the power of Life riſing
in clearneſs againſt them, be thrown back upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
to his torment and diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>And O dear Lambs, conſider how eaſie it is for you to
miſtake, err, &amp; wander from the Truth; and do not refuſe
the care, watchfulneſs and tender counſel of thoſe who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93157:5"/>
were inſtrumental to beget you to, and are yet over you in the
Lord. Alas, how eaſie is it for the Enemy to deceive your ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
and get between you and your Life; and then ye are liable
to miſs-ſee and miſs-act in all ye do, and to follow the Enemy,
as if he were your right guide; and to fight againſt, and reſiſt him
who is your true Leader, as if he were your Enemy. The Life
in you is to be your Guide and Leader, as it groweth up and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
ability, ſtrength and dominion from the Lord; but the
Heir is to be under Tutors and Governour, till the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the Father. And the Seed is meek, humble, tender, lowly,
ſenſible of its own ſtate and weakneſs, and ſubject to the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
dominion and pure authority of Life in others where the
Lord hath ſo exalted it. That which is otherwiſe in you (which
is high, exalted, conceited of it ſelf, and not ſubject to every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Life in others, according to its ſtate) is another thing,
which is not of the true kind, but onely under a guize appears to
you as the true; and as it gets entrance, corrupts your hearts from
the true, &amp; deſtils its poyſon into your Spirits, which ye believing,
entertaining and feeding upon, as if it were the true, grow up in
his poyſonful nature (loſing the pure nature and fellowſhip of
the Body) and are travelling whither ye are not aware, being gone
from that which at firſt gathered, into that which through ſubtilty
hath deceived, appearing to you as if it was ſtill the ſame, and
that ye ſtill keep to it, but others are departed; whereas the thing
is clean contrary in the ſight of the Lord, and in the ſight of thoſe
who keep to the Annointing, and ſee with his eye. Therefore,
O dear Lambs and Babes, what need have we to wait, in tender
ſence, for the Lord's preſervation of us in that Nature, Spirit
and Life, whereof we were begotten, and wherein we were taught,
that there we may ſtill learn and keep to the true teaching, in the
innocency and ſimplicity of love, and not hearken to the wiſdom
and reaſonings of another ſpirit, who lieth at watch to catch the
mind with his wiles, and draw from the true thing. Mark how
we learned at firſt; Was it not in a Nature, by a ſecret inſtinct
and inclination of our minds towards the Life, and the Path,
Wayes and Practiſes thereof, whereinto the Body (which before
had been gathered) was led and walked before us? The ſame
Life, when it maketh us part of the flock, bringeth us into the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93157:6"/>
ſame footſteps; and there we walk with them, in the unity of
the ſame Life, and ſence of the ſame Leader; but if the Enemy
can at any time draw us from this ſence, and from the belief and
practices or practice, which we received in this ſence, (even out
of the limits of this nature and its naturalneſs) how eaſie is it for
him to perſwade us to queſtion right things in our minds and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
as if they were wrong, (darkening our eye, and
cauſing us to overlook and forget the leading and motion, which
we had in the true ſence and nature, from the Annoiting it ſelf)
and ſo confidently to think and conclude, that we took up ſuch or
ſuch a practice by imitation, and have held it up in form? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Lord (who forgetteth not what and how he hath wrought
in us) knoweth that we took it up in the ſence and leading of his
Truth, and are now tempted from that in the reaſoning ſubtilty,
which we formerly practiſed in the true innocent ſimplicity. And
thus getting into us a belief and entertainment of his ſnare, he
draws us from that which at firſt led us, and from the practices we
were at firſt led into, to hearken to him and follow him, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth
us in a way we were not inſtructed in before while the
Lord inſtructed us; and ſo deſtroyeth his Nature, and the Work
of his Spirit in us, dividing us both from the Head and living
Body; and ſo our ſtanding, growth, ſence and judgement
is altered, and we are neither to the Lord what we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
nor is he to us what he was before; for he hates that
Spirit in all its appearances, and cannot have unity with
the Souls that are entangled by it. Therefore, dear Friends,
as we prize our gathering to and abiding with the Lord, and the
enjoyment of his Love, Peace, Joy and Preſence at preſent, and
the Crown and Inheritance of Life with him for ever; ſo let us
fear, ſo let us watch, ſo let us cry unto him, to be preſerved by
him, which gathered us, in that into which he gathered, and not
by any means betrayed (through ſubtilty of the Enemy) into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, where the life of the Body (and union with the Body)
cannot poſſibly be witneſſed, nor the true juſtification of the Lord,
but only an appearing juſtification of a man's own ſpirit, which
muſt afterwards come under condemnation. Ye, who are in the
living and true ſence, will feel my love, tenderneſs and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
in what I write; and ye who are not, the Lord God of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93157:6"/>
Bowels pitty, and recover out of the ſnare and wrong judgement,
that ye may feel it; and feeling that which is true, may be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it, drinking of its virtue and preservation, and live;
which is the earneſt deſire of my Soul to the Lord, who am</p>

            <p>DEar Friends, Brethren, Lambs and Plants of the
moſt High, it is in my heart to add one thing, which I
have been deeply exerciſed about, and have received help
from the Lord in, wherein I am truly willing (in faithfulneſs
and tenderneſs) to be helpful to any of you that ſtand in need
thereof, as the Lord ſhall give me ability and opportunity;
It is this, Among other things, wherewith the Enemy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth
to reproach thoſe whom the Lord hath ſent forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, he maketh uſe of this, as if they wanted Bowels
and Tenderneſs. Now Friends, I beſeech you conſider it,
that the Enemy may not thus enter you; Did not the Lord
conſider of his work, and whom he ſent forth in this his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and labour of Love? Doth he not know the need of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
and tenderneſs in them, and would be not eſpecially furniſh
them therewith? Yea, have they not bowels from, and in the
Lord? and doth not the eye that is open ſee, and acknowledge
their bowels, and bleſs the Lord for them? I have lately been
often warmed in the true ſence of it, and have felt, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I have not bleſſed his Name in vain; but the thing is ſo in
the ſence of Truth, and ſo acknowledged before the Lord, in
that which erreth not: Onely as true judgement and ſeverity
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93157:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath its proper place in the Lord as well as his Mercy; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

made uſe of by him towards his people, as all by experience
know, ſo muſt it be in them alſo who bear his Image, who muſt
know, in his Wiſdom and Authority, whom to ſmite with his
Rod and ſharp Reproofs, and when, and whom to cheriſh in
the tenderneſs and meltings of Love. And this is alſo love
and tenderneſs (and hath ſweet and precious vertue and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
in it, both for the recovery and reſtoring of thoſe whoſe
condition calls for the ſharp ſtroke, and for the preſervation
of the reſt) though it doth not ſo appear to that, which by no
means can endure the judgement, but would have the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and mercy which belongs not to it; for the mercy is to the
broken, to the humble, to the meek, to the afflicted and bo<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

ones under the ſence of judgement; not to the ſtiff and
ſtubborn againſt the righteous judgements and teſtimonies of
the Lord. And my Friends conſider, Could the Lord carry
on his glorious Work, in the hearts of his Children, without
his judgements? Or can they, who are ſent by him, poſſibly
carry on his work among his people, without making uſe of

and unſeaſonably, which (if it be let alone) will draw away the
ſap from that which ſhould be fed and nouriſhed with it. Dear
Friends, the Lord give you a true ſence, that in his Light, Life,
Wiſdom and Preſence ye may juſtifie what is of him, diſcerning
between things that differ, and not call any thing that is evil
(as the tenderneſs which is out of him is) good, nor any thing
that is good (as the judgment and ſeverity which is of him is)
evil, but may rightly diſtinguiſh between the nature of things,
knowing every thing that is of God, and owning it in its place.</p>
