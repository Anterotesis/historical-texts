            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE TO The Dutchess, On Her Return from SCOTLAND.</head>
            <byline>Written by Mr. <hi>DRYDEN.</hi>
            </byline>
            <l>WHEN Factious Rage to cruel Exile, drove</l>
            <l>The Queen of Beauty, and the Court of Love;</l>
            <l>The Muses Droop'd, with their forsaken Arts,</l>
            <l>And the sad <hi>Cupids</hi> broke their useless Darts.</l>
            <l>Our fruitfull Plains to Wilds and Desarts turn'd,</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Edens</hi> Face when banish'd Man it mourn'd:</l>
            <l>Love was no more when Loyalty was gone,</l>
            <l>The great Supporter of his Awfull Throne.</l>
            <l>Love cou'd no longer after Beauty stay,</l>
            <l>But wander'd Northward to the verge of day,</l>
            <l>As if the Sun and He had lost their way.</l>
            <l>But now th' Illustrious Nymph return'd again,</l>
            <l>Brings every Grace triumphant in her Train:</l>
            <l>The wondring <hi>Nereids,</hi> though they rais'd no storm,</l>
            <l>Foreslow'd her passage to behold her form:</l>
            <l>Some cry'd a <hi>Venus,</hi> some a <hi>Thetis</hi> past:</l>
            <l>But this was not so fair, nor that so chast.</l>
            <l>Far from her sight flew Faction, Strife and Pride:</l>
            <l>And Envy did but look on her, and dy'd.</l>
            <l>What e'er we suffer'd from our sullen Fate,</l>
            <l>Her sight is purchas'd at an easy rate:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:48930:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>Three gloomy Years against this day were set:</l>
            <l>But this one mighty Sum has clear'd the Debt.</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Dream, but with a better doom;</l>
            <l>The Famine past, the Plenty still to come.</l>
            <l>For Her the weeping Heav'ns become serene,</l>
            <l>For Her the Ground is clad in cheerfull green:</l>
            <l>For Her the Nightingales are taught to sing,</l>
            <l>And Nature has for her delay'd the Spring.</l>
            <l>The Muse resumes her long-forgotten Lays,</l>
            <l>And Love, restor'd, his Ancient Realm surveys;</l>
            <l>Recalls our Beauties, and revives our Plays.</l>
            <l>His Wast Dominions peoples once again,</l>
            <l>And from Her presence dates his Second Reign.</l>
            <l>But awfull Charms on her fair Forehead sit,</l>
            <l>Dispensing what she never will admit.</l>
            <l>Pleasing, yet cold, like <hi>Cynthia</hi>'s silver Beam,</l>
            <l>The Peoples Wonder, and the Poets Theam.</l>
            <l>Distemper'd Zeal, Sedition, canker'd Hate,</l>
            <l>No more shall vex the Church, and tear the State;</l>
            <l>No more shall Faction civil Discords move,</l>
            <l>Or onely discords of too tender love:</l>
            <l>Discord like that of Musicks various parts,</l>
            <l>Discord that makes the harmony of Hearts,</l>
            <l>Discord that onely this dispute shall bring,</l>
            <l>Who best shall love the Duke, and serve the King.</l>
