            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD, and Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN Obedience to Your Order I have printed, and here humbly preſent to You, the Sermon I lately Preached before You; and therewith I make my Acknowledgments of the Reſpects You have ſhewed me in the kind Entertainment of my Endeavours to ſerve You.</p>
            <p>I made choice of the great Doctrine of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the Subject of my Diſcourſe, as well with
<pb facs="tcp:48899:4"/>
a peculiar regard to the diſtracted condition of the Times we live in; as upon the general account of its perpetual uſefulneſs to all the great purpoſes of Religion: and I am now confirmed in my Choice by the teſtimony of your judgments and approbation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> Though I live not much in the Air of this buſie World, yet a man muſt be quite out of it that is not ſenſible, not only of different Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and Diſputes amongst us, but of the moſt violent paſſions and animoſities, inſomuch that no Terms of Reproach are thought virulent enough to bestow upon one another, but we muſt rake the Sinks of other Countries for odious Nicknames to diſtinguiſh Parties, and to perpetuate our Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels.</p>
            <p>Nor is this the worſt of our Caſe neither, for now at length (as it uſes to happen in declining Age) our Choler ſeems to be turned into Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and our Anger into Jealouſie. We grow ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of our beſt Friends, of our Governours, of our Clergy, of one another. By which means not only Religion is ſcandalized, but the very Sinews of Society are relaxed, and the ſtrength of the Nation is diſſolved.</p>
            <p>And what Remedies can be ſufficient to recover us from this Condition? It is true we have a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb facs="tcp:48899:4"/>
Prince, but who can preſerve a Kingdom divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt it ſelf? We have good Laws, but what can they ſignifie when they have loſt their venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? We have a great many Good Men, but who will take upon him to make peace, when he that parts the Fray is likely to receive the moſt Blows, and he that pretends to be a common Friend (to the angry Parties) ſhall be treated as tbe common Enemy? In a word, we ſeem to be very near that condition which the Hiſtorian bewails in his own Country, <hi>Nec Morbos, nec Remedia pati poſſumus;</hi> We can neither ſubſiſt without a Cure, nor yet will admit of the Remedies.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>My Lord,</hi> my Text affords us hope e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this condition. It brings into view a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Majeſty, able to awe men into a compoſure: It gives us aſſurance that we are under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who can cool our Heats, allay our Paſſions, prevent our Fears, and cure our Melancholy. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Providence can turn the hearts of men, change the Scene of things, and make a Tempest become a Calm. And that in his own good time he will do this for us, we have encouragement to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the former experience we have had of his Goodneſs, and upon the intereſt of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that Vine which his own right hand hath plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48899:5"/>
Now that it may pleaſe him to effect this in our days, and to make Your Lordſhip, and the reſt of the Worthy Magiſtrates of this City (in their ſeveral Places) inſtrumental in ſo happy a Work, is the hearty Prayer of</p>

            <head>A SERMON PREACHED Before the Right Honourable THE Lord MAYOR and ALDERMEN Of the CITY of LONDON.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM XCVii. Verſe 1.</bibl>
               <q>The Lord reigneth, let the Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice; let the multitude of the Iſles be glad thereof.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHether this Pſalm was penned by <hi>Moſes</hi> upon occaſion of the Victory obtained over <hi>Sihon</hi> King of <hi>Heſhbon,</hi> as the firſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ſucceſs in the conqueſt of the promiſed Land? (as the Jewiſh writers think)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48899:6"/>
Or, Whether it was compoſed by <hi>David</hi> upon the recovery of his Throne and Kingdom, when the conſpiracy of <hi>Abſolom</hi> was defeated? (as the Greek Interpreters ſeem to intimate) Or laſtly, Whether the ſame <hi>David</hi> indited it, upon the huge inlargement of his Dominions, by the addition of all thoſe bordering Countries, his Conqueſt whereof we have recorded 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. (as ſeems moſt probable.)</p>
            <p>It is however certain in the general, that the Pſalm is an Hymn of Praiſe to the Divine Majeſty, and a devout acknowledgment of his power and providence in the management of the affairs of the World. And like as at the inauguration of ſome virtuous and brave Prince, or eſpecially upon ſome glorious ſpecimen or inſtance of his Wiſdom and Proweſs in the conduct of Affairs, it is uſual for the people to make mighty ſhouts and acclamations: So here is <hi>the ſhout of a King</hi> in my Text, and all the World is ſummoned to celebrate the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this great Monarch <hi>Jehovah. The Lord reigneth, let the Earth rejoice; let the multitude of the Iſles be glad thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>the Earth,</hi> I underſtand the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> and bordering Countries, the Territory of the Church. By <hi>the multitude of the Iſles,</hi> I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48899:6"/>
conceive is meant all the remoter parts of the World; for by that name the Jews in their language were wont to call all but the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent on which they inhabited, as may appear <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 5. where ſpeaking of the poſterity of <hi>Japheth,</hi> the Text ſaith, <hi>by theſe were the Iſles of the Gentiles divided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the words afford us theſe two obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Divine Majeſty is not a mere neceſſary Agent or paſſive Being, or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Spectator of the Affairs of the World, but manages and governs, as well as obſerves the courſe of things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Divine Providence and Government of the World, is matter of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and ſatisfaction, of triumph and rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to all mankind. And that although the Church of God have a principal intereſt in it, and advantage by it; yet no part of the World is neglected by God, or deſtitute of a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>And theſe two ſhall be the ſubject of my preſent diſcourſe. I am well aware that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them contain any new Doctrine to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain and gratifie curioſity; but I am withal very certain, that they repreſent to us matter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48899:7"/>
of the greateſt uſefulneſs and importance that can be for any times, but moſt peculiarly ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable at this time. The Doctrine of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence (and eſpecially ſuch an one as the Text ſpeaks of) being the only conſideration able to allay our Paſſions, to abate our Fears, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move our Jealouſies, to cure our Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and conſequently to promote Peace and Settlement both in Church and State. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not doubt either of your patience or attention whilſt I give account of theſe three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I will ſhew what is meant by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>the Lord reigneth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I will demonſtrate the truth of the aſſertion, That God Almighty exerciſeth a reigning Providence in the World.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I will bring this down to practice, by diſcovering the great influence this truth hath upon all the intereſts of mankind.</p>
            <p>And by that time I perſwade my ſelf you will be ready to make the application in my Text, and give example to the reſt of the World, to rejoice that <hi>the Lord is King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I begin with the firſt, what is meant by this expreſſion, <hi>the Lord reigneth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot imagine that any one that hears me
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48899:7"/>
ſhould phanſie this expreſſion to give counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to a <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi> (as they call it) as if ſuch an intereſt in the Government of the World was hereby aſſerted to the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as ſhould repeal or diſannul the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Temporal Princes and Potentates; or that they muſt become Uſurpers becauſe God is King. For beſides that (as I ſhall ſhew anon) they are only Gods Vicegerents and Inſtruments of his Government; and ſo being ſubordinate cannot be repugnant to him: (Beſides this I ſay) it is evident that <hi>David,</hi> who (I ſuppoſe) indited this Pſalm, reigned at this time as a Temporal Prince, and neither thought his Royalty impeached by the Divine Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor an invaſion of the Divine Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>And as little can I ſuſpect that any ſhould be ſo unreaſonable, as to think that the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a Divine Providence ſhould ſuperſede and diſcharge the uſe and efficacy of ſecond cauſes, for it is a reigning Providence we ſpeak of; now to reign is to command in chief, not to tranſact all things immediately, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to and govern, rather than to diſpatch buſineſs by himſelf.</p>
            <p>That which therefore we are to underſtand
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48899:8"/>
by Gods being King, is no more but that <hi>Omne regnumeſt ſub graviori regno;</hi> that the Lord God is Lord Paramount, who though he not only ſuffers but inables other cauſes to act under him, yet keeps the reins of Government in his own hand; and conſequently can and doth whenſoever he pleaſes, interpoſe, ſuſpend or controll them, and over-rule all things to his own will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>That things are neither carried by the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a blind fortune, or chance as the Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans dreamed;</p>
            <p>Nor born away with the ſwinge of fatal neceſſity, as the Stoicks imagined:</p>
            <p>Nor yet left either to the will of man, or the natural efficacy of ſecond cauſes, but that God ſometimes interpoſes, and always guides and governs them.</p>
            <p>This is that which was darkly and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, but elegantly expreſt by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in his firſt Chapter, where the courſe of ſecond cauſes is compared to the <hi>Wheels of a Chariot,</hi> which run on in a Road with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cariere; but then v. 18. there are ſaid to <hi>be eyes in thoſe Wheels,</hi> intimating that God takes notice how all things go; and not only ſo, but v. 20. there is ſaid to be <hi>a Spirit</hi> that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48899:8"/>
guides and governs all their Motions.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord is King and reigns in the World; and ſo much for that point, I paſs to the ſecond:</p>
            <p n="2">2. Which is to make plain and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proof of this aſſertion, that ſo we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a juſt foundation for that joy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph which the Text calls for upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; and for this I offer theſe four follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I argue from the very nature and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a God after this manner: Every man that frames in his mind any worthy notion of the Deity, conceives him to be a Wiſe, Powerful, Juſt and Good Being; and whoſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives of him any otherwiſe, or leaves out any of theſe Attributes, debaſes him below the common notion that men have of him, and renders him no fit object of love, or fear, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and adoration, (as I ſhall ſhew more anon.)</p>
            <p>Now he that denies ſuch a Providence as we have explained, denies to the Deity all thoſe perfections at once; and in ſo doing forfeits and forgoes the moſt natural and general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of a God; ſo that either there is in effect no God, or there is a Providence. For if he cannot take notice how things go in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48899:9"/>
World, we cannot eſteem him Wiſe.</p>
            <p>If he ſees how things go, but cannot help or hinder them, we cannot allow him to be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful; and if he ſees, and can help, but will not, men will have no apprehenſions of him as either Juſt or Good.</p>
            <p>But becauſe we certainly conclude him to have all thoſe perfections, when we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be a God, therefore he doth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the World. And thus in ſhort we have all the branches of Divine Providence, at once, demonſtrated from his Nature and Being.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> My ſecond Argument ſhall be from the Spirit of Prophecy, or from all thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of things to come, which have been verified in real effects in any age of the World.</p>
            <p>He that denies that any thing hath been foretold, and come to paſs according to the Prediction, muſt deny the Faith and Hiſtory of all the World; and he that grants ſuch things, cannot avoid the acknowledgment of a Providence.</p>
            <p>For it is evident, that he who certainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells what is to come, muſt ſee through all the ſeries of cauſes that tend to the production of ſuch an effect, and eſpecially if he define the very preciſe time and other circumſtances an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48899:9"/>
to the accompliſhment of the Event, his knowledge muſt be very accurate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate to the whole intriegue of cauſes. But above all, if he declare before-hand, not only what ſhall come to paſs according to the courſe of natural and neceſſary cauſes, but even ſuch things as are caſual and contingent, and ſuch as are ſubject to the liberty and indifferency of the will of man and free agents: Then (whether men be able or no to diſcover the ſecret man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and means of this fore-knowledge it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not) it muſt be acknowledged, that he not only is privy to the Cabal, and ſees the conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and workings of theſe cauſes; but that he alſo governs the reſult and iſfues of them, which is that we here mean by a reigning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as we before explained it.</p>
            <p>Now all this matter of fact is evidently true in innumerable inſtances; amongſt all which, I will only take notice of the Prediction of the deliverance of the Jews, firſt from their Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Bondage, and then from the Babyloniſh Captivity.</p>
            <p>In the former of theſe, the Event was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told above 400 Years before it came to paſs, and the accompliſhment was exact to a very day, as you find it obſerved, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 41, 42.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48899:10"/>
the words are theſe, <hi>And it came to paſs at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the ſelf ſame day it came to paſs, that all the hoſt of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt: it is a night to be much obſerved to the Lord; this is that night of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the other paſſage of Providence, <hi>viz.</hi> the Babyloniſh Captivity, it was foretold above Seventy Years before it came to paſs, and in a time of the greateſt unlikelihood of any ſuch Calamity to befal them, namely, in the time of their greateſt Proſperity; and the period of their Captivity was preciſely determined to the juſt time of Seventy Years continuance, and then they were to be delivered and reſtored to their own Land again: and all theſe ſtrange things were punctually and preciſely fulfilled, as appears by comparing together 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 22. and <hi>Ezra</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 1.</p>
            <p>In both which paſſages there are ſo many admirable circumſtances, ſo great were the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles in the way of their accompliſhment, and alſo ſo much of the will of man concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the whole caſe, that of neceſſity there muſt be a governing Power as well as a foreſight in the bringing it about; in which two things lies the notion of a Providence. This is the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48899:10"/>
Argument of <hi>Tertullian, Preſcientiae</hi> (or <hi>Providentiae) Deus tot habet teſtes, quot fecit Prophetas;</hi> i. e. Look how many Prophets or Prophecies ever were in the World, and ſo many infallible evidences of a Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> My third Argument is from Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or the ſeveral inſtances of Divine Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, either in raiſing and improving, or in depreſſing, ſuſpending and altering the natural and ordinary courſe of ſecond cauſes: For moſt aſſuredly, if ever the courſe of things hath been interrupted and brought into order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, there is plain evidence of a ſuperiour Power and Management; foraſmuch as it is not imaginable, that natural cauſes ſhould go out of courſe of themſelves, without their own decay and failure, and impoſſible that being once out of order (upon ſuch decays and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſions) that ever they ſhould recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into their former order again; therefore if ever ſuch a caſe hath happened, it muſt be the over-ruling hand of Providence.</p>
            <p>Now, that there have ſuch extraordinary things happened in the World, as this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuppoſes, the moſt Epicurean and Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Wits do not altogether deny, but endeavour to find out ſome wiſe ſalvo or other for them,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48899:11"/>
upon natural Principles, in which enterpriſe they are much forſaken of all true Reaſon and Philoſophy, as they are deſtitute of Devotion; for to reſolve that into natural cauſes, which is either above them, or contrary to them, is the greateſt inſtance of humor and folly that can be aſſigned.</p>
            <p>They will obſerve, perhaps, that in the Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or in ſome of the miracles done in the Wilderneſs, there was ſome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of natural cauſes; but beſides that, thoſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were apparently incompetent to the effects: there was alſo ſuch a ſtrange and ſudden bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe cauſes together, as could not but beſpeak an Almighty Power and Government.</p>
            <p>But then let them try their skill to tell us, what natural cauſes made the Sun ſtand ſtill in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time, or made that unnatural Eclipſe at our Saviours Paſſion, when the two Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries were in Oppoſition. Or let them tell us, how men utterly unlearned (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and other Primitive Diſciples were) ſhould be able to ſpeak all kind of Languages on the ſudden? how incurable Diſeaſes ſhould be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? nay, men be raiſed from the Dead by a word ſpeaking: in all theſe, and a thouſand inſtances more, there is undeniably the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48899:11"/>
of the Divine Majeſty, and ſo God governs the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and laſtly, I argue for a Providence from the Conſpiracy and Cooperation of all things that happen in the World, to a certain and uniform end, which cannot be without the direction and management of Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Things that are and happen in the World (as we ſee plainly) have different natures, and various tendencies, nay ſometimes run flatly croſs to each other; but now if all thoſe lines meet in the ſame point and center, if all appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent contrariety conſpire to the ſame end, then there muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a God in the World. For if things were either carried by blind and uncertain chance, it would be very ſtrange, if they ſhould not often claſh and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere; or if they be acted by their reſpective neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary cauſes, yet thoſe cauſes being often contrary to each other, no one end can be jointly purſued and carried on between them; therefore when we ſee (all this contrariety notwithſtanding) all things ſo attempered and adjuſted, that they at laſt cooperate to one great purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of God, and the good of men; then it is apparent that they are ſubordinate to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48899:12"/>
one great, and wiſe, and univerſal cauſe, which preſides over the World.</p>
            <p>There are an infinite number of noble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this kind in all Hiſtory and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſuch as the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which God turned into a Bleſſing to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to all his Fathers Family, to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to all <hi>Egypt.</hi> Such was the drowning of <hi>Jonas</hi> in the bottom of the Sea, and his miraculous eſcape thence, which was made an effectual means to convince the Ninevites, that God ſent him with that awakening Meſſage. Thus the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of the Church, which in the firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, looked like the moſt effectual way to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Chriſtian Religion, proved in the iſſue, the moſt ſucceſsful method of propagating of it.</p>
            <p>So the afflicted condition of good men in this World (upon a ſuperficial view) looks as if virtue was under ſome malignant Planet, or that if any God minded it at all, it was only to diſcountenance and diſhearten it; yet it proves nothing elſe in the concluſion, but a deſign to exerciſe, to try and confirm it, eſpecially God ſo ordering the matter, that ordinarily the lives of ſuch men are intermixed, and as it were checquered with Proſperity and Adverſity; the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48899:12"/>
latter paring off their luxuriancy, and not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to grow light and vain, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer preſerving them from melancholy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency; the one affording them ballaſt, and the other ſails, that by the help of both together, they may ſteer an even courſe through the World towards Heaven.</p>
            <p>This is the Argument of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>All things work together for good, to them that love God,</hi> &amp;c. and that ſhall be my laſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for this great Point; it were eaſie to add a great many more, but I think theſe fully ſufficient.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I come now to the third and laſt thing I propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew the eminent and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal advantages that mankind hath by being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a Providence, that ſo they may be ſenſible what cauſe they have to rejoice that <hi>the Lord reigneth:</hi> And this I repreſent in the ſix following particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The belief of ſuch a Providence as we have proved, is the prime Pillar, and the very Baſis and Foundation of all Religion; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this or that Religion in particular, but of Religion it ſelf, and in the general notion of it. Foraſmuch as the belief of a God, is by no means ſufficient to ſupport that great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48899:13"/>
without this alſo of a Providence. For let a man not only acknowledge the Being and Exiſtence of a Deity, but alſo let him look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as never ſo great and admirable in his nature; yet if he conceive of him as inactive, ſuch an one as either cannot or will not trouble himſelf to take notice of mens carriage towards himſelf: in a word, if he neither reward nor puniſh, the great obligation to Religion is wanting; for the mere reverence of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent nature will be utterly ineffectual, either to keep a man ſteady and conſtant in the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a ſtrict and devout life, or eſpecially to reſtrain him from ſuch ſins, as both his temper is greatly prone to, and to which he hath the ſtrong allurements of Pleaſure and Profit; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a man is ſenſible all along that he is (upon this ſuppoſition) as ſafe in deſpiſing and affronting, as in fearing and worſhipping the Divine Majeſty.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Epicureans, for all their acknowledgment of a God, were reputed Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical by the wiſer Sects of Philoſophers, and that not unworthily; becauſe (as I ſaid before) they making him to enjoy his eaſe, and to be unconcerned in the affairs of the World, ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Providence, and with it overthrew all the reaſon of Religion and Piety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48899:13"/>
Nay further, ſuppoſe a Man ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not only a God but ſome kind of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence alſo, yet unleſs it be ſuch a Kingly Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as we have before ſtated, it will ſignifie little or nothing to the purpoſe of Religion. For ſo we ſee the Stoicks acknowledged both: But foraſmuch as they apprehended the Deity to be bound under the Iron Bonds of fatal and invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible neceſſity, ſo that though he was aware how it went with men, and might perhaps pity them in their diſtreſſes, yet could not help them; they hereby cut the main Sinews of Vertue and Devotion.</p>
            <p>But now upon ſuppoſition that God is not only a great and everlaſting Being, but a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, wiſe and free Majeſty, and that there is ſuch a Kingly Providence as we aſſert; then it is apparent that Vertue and Vice have vaſt differences, and Piety and Religion are the greateſt concerns of Mankind. And therefore it is very obſervable, that this is the great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Old Teſtament, the main Doctrine of thoſe times, and of all thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the World into the belief of ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in, and ſuperintendence over the World. But I proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48899:14"/>
Secondly, Not only the Internal Reaſon and Obligation to Religion is founded upon Providence, but alſo the External Profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion in ſpecial, and the whole Society of a Church ſubſiſts by the ſupport and protection of it.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour hath told us he would <hi>build his Church upon a Rock, and the Gates of Hell ſhould not prevail againſt it:</hi> But it is certain, that it is not the inherent ſtrength of the Conſtitution of this Political Body his Church, which can maintain it in all times, and againſt all aſſaults; but the ſtrong hand of Almighty Power that preſerves it: otherwiſe it is not imaginable but it had been ſhattered to pieces long e're this day. For either the violence and cruelty of Perſecution had diſſipated it, or the contagion of evil Examples would have debauch'd it; or prophane Wit and Drollery would have laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it out of countenance, or its own follies and Diviſions would have crumbled it to nothing.</p>
            <p>But Providence hath taken care, that neither the ſtrength of its Enemies, nor its own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, neither their wit nor its fooliſhneſs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their combined malice and union, nor its own animoſities and diſtractions, have had their (otherwiſe probable and) natural effects upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48899:14"/>
And that this admirable event is not to be attributed to Chance, or any other cauſes, but is the mere effect of Divine Providence, will be evident by this further Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſo long as any Church hath kept cloſe to God, and approved it ſelf to him and to the Laws of its Inſtitution, ſo long it hath always been ſafe and flouriſhing, (at leaſt if we except only the very infancy of the Chriſtian Church and Religion, at which time it pleaſed the Divine Wiſdom to work a greater Miracle of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than all the reſt, in expoſing his Church in ſo much weakneſs to ſuch ſtrength of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and yet preſerving it (as the Burning Buſh) and thereby giving a more illuſtrious evidence to all the World of his Providence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, than conſtant proſperity could have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded.)</p>
            <p>But contrariwiſe, whenſoever this Church or any Branch or Member of it, hath by wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs and ſelf-confidence, by pride and ſchiſm, by hypocriſie or prophaneneſs, forfeited this Divine protection; if Divine patience and moderate chaſtiſements have not in due time reclaimed it, it hath by a ſevere act of the ſame Providence been moſt remarkably delivered up to confuſion and barbariſm: God hath pulled
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48899:15"/>
down his Fence, and the wild Beaſt of the Field ſpoils it, and the Boar out of the Woods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours it.</p>
            <p>But leſt any man who hath obſerved the horrible degeneracy, the hypocriſie and corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet withal takes notice of the great pomp, ſplendor and proſperity which that Society en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, ſhould make this an Objection againſt that which I am diſcourſing, I freely anſwer, That I think it hath pleaſed God to make that ſingular inſtance on purpoſe, and by an act of the ſame Providence by which he puniſhes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degenerate Churches, he hath kept up that debauched Church (juſt as he did thoſe wicked and idolatrous Princes the Kings of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c.) to be a plague and a ſcourge whereby to chaſtiſe and reclaim other and better, but declining Churches.</p>
            <p>In all other caſes my Obſervation is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly verified; not only in the Church of the Jews, but in all thoſe once famous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> Which whilſt they were humble and holy, true to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and worthy of Divine protection, ſo long they were happy and glorious: But when they had provoked God to deſert them,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48899:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from that time it was neither their wit nor wealth nor learning, neither their numbers nor their reputation, neither their former zeal nor their Apoſtolical foundation, could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from ruine and barbariſm. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Divine Providence is the ſecurity and protection not only of the Church but of the State alſo. Of Kings and Princes, of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Governours, and of Government it ſelf: for it is not the <hi>Satellites</hi> of Princes, their Lifeguards that ſecure them, their Sword and Scepter that defends them, not their purple and all the Enſigns of Majeſty; but an all-ſeeing of Providence over them, and an inviſible Guard of Providence that protects them.</p>
            <p>It was well obſerved by Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> that in ſome reſpects the condition of Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heads and Soveraign Princes was more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and uncomfortable than of meaner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and in this reſpect amongſt the reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have a great deal to fear, and little or nothing more to hope for in this World. They cannot go much higher, and they may fall a great deal lower. Other men if they have ſomething to fear, yet they have a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſphere of hope to cheer and encourage them.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48899:16"/>
Princes have but little ſcope for their deſires or ambitions, but on the other ſide, by reaſon of their long Train, ill Fortune hath great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages againſt them. And indeed in theſe reſpects their condition were very melancholy, but that there is a Providence which watches over them, and prevents their fears, and their dangers.</p>
            <p>They are God's Vicegerents, and He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and upholds them in their Offices under Himſelf; He ſtrikes an awe and reverence of Magiſtrates into the hearts of Subjects, that an enraged multitude ſhall tremble at the ſight of one man, and He in other reſpects like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaving that he hath the Stamp and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Divine Authority upon him.</p>
            <p>He that calms the raging of the Sea, and ſaith to <hi>the proud waves, Hitherto ſhall ye go, and no further;</hi> it is He alſo that ſtills the rage and madneſs of the people. Therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99. 1. <hi>The Lord reigneth, be the people never ſo impatient; He ſitteth between the Cherubims, be the Earth never ſo unquiet: i. e.</hi> The Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty hath that influence upon the ſpirits of men, that it is not all the brutal rage and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor all the combined force of evil men, ſhall be able to diſſolve Government, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48899:16"/>
that Order He hath conſtituted.</p>
            <p>Let us take one great and famous inſtance of this, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made a General Defection from <hi>David</hi> their King, and, as one man, were all for ſetting <hi>Abſolom</hi> upon his Throne: The number of the Conſpirators was as the Sand upon the Sea-ſhore, that in the expreſſion of <hi>Huſhai</hi> they were able to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>David</hi> and his Handful of men with him, <hi>as the Dew falls upon the Ground;</hi> and if he ſhould betake himſelf to any City or Strong-hold, <hi>all Iſrael ſhall bring Ropes, and draw that City into the River; ſo that there ſhall not be one ſmall Stone left.</hi> What becomes of <hi>David</hi> in this caſe? Who ſhall withſtand this Torrent? Only Divine Providence, this divides the Waters, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves that great black Cloud, and makes it fall in a gentle Dew (otherwiſe than <hi>Huſhai</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and the reſult is, That <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the ſame men ſtrive who ſhall be the firſt and forwardeſt in ſetting <hi>David</hi> upon his Throne again.</p>
            <p>Therefore whatever Prince or Magiſtrate ſhall ſlight a Providence, they ſlight the beſt Fort of their Empire and Juriſdiction, they diſmiſs their Guards, and lay themſelves open to all the follies and rage and inſolencies of the people.</p>
            <p>

Fourthly, Divine Providence is alſo the peoples caution and ſecurity againſt the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, paſſions and extravagances of Princes and Magiſtrates, ſo that they ſhall not need to reſort to Arms or any ſeditious and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means in their own defence. We uſe to appeal to an higher Court when we are oppreſt in an inferior Judicatory, and this is our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per refuge, when our Rights and Properties are invaded, to look up to God the ſupreme Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of the World, that he will reſtrain the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances of his Miniſters.</p>
            <p>God is King of Kings, not only becauſe he is above all other Princes, but becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains and controlls them, he makes and rules them, he inveſts and deveſts them. <hi>Cujus juſſu homines naſcuntur, ejus juſſu Reges conſtituuntur, aptique illis qui ab ipſis in illis temporibus regnantur,</hi> ſaid the great <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Saint <hi>Irenaeus. He that made men makes Kings, and he fits and qualifies them for the times wherein, and the people over whom they reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it is He that can (amongſt other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his tranſcendent Sovereignty) turn their hearts alſo. So <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf a great and a wiſe King hath told us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1. <hi>The heart of the King is in the hand of the Lord, and he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48899:17"/>
               <hi>it as the Rivers of Water;</hi> that is, as an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman or Gardiner, can by Drains and Trenches derive the Water from one place to another, to his uſe and purpoſe; ſo doth God Almighty diſpoſe and incline the hearts of Princes, be they never ſo ſtrong and deep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> was a mighty Prince, and had a heart as averſe to the People of the Jews, and to their Religion alſo, as any of his Predeceſſors, that carried them into, or kept them in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. What was the matter then? what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of State was there that he ſhould let them go, and loſe ſo much People, and ſo much Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute? nothing, but the Text tells us, <hi>God ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the heart of Cyrus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was ſo ſtiff-necked and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as that he defied any ſuch Providence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him as we are ſpeaking of; but God turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his heart firſt to that of a Beaſt, and put him out to Graſs till he had learned, that <hi>the most high ruleth in the Kingdoms of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore no deceitful or illuſory method of ſecurity, to appeal to, and truſt in Providence, in the greateſt caſes poſſible. It is true the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Religion, Liberty and Property are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concerns; but certainly they are not too great a ſtake to truſt in the hands of God, who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48899:18"/>
we ſee, both can ſecure them, and is obliged by the honour and intereſt of his own ſupereminent Government to be tender of them, againſt all the Arbitrary Invaſions of thoſe under him.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſome man will ſuſpect, that it will look like Cowardiſe, if not Treachery (in confidence of a Providence) to neglect other means of ſecurity; and that it will be like him in the Fable, that lay in the Ditch, and uſed no endeavour to get out, but only cried to God to help him: To which I anſwer, that if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God have afforded us other means that are lawful and warranted by the ſtanding Law and Rule of his Word, we tempt God if we neglect them, when thoſe great Intereſts are indangered; but unleſs the means we uſe be as certainly and manifeſtly lawful and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, as the cauſe we pretend to, ſhall be juſt and honourable, we ſhall but provoke Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence inſtead of ſubſerving it. We forego our greateſt ſecurity by not being contented with it; for by ſuperſeding Providence we ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate it, and by ſhifting for our ſelves we fight againſt God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Providence is our ſecurity againſt private Fears as well as publick, againſt ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and dangers of all kinds, whether by ill
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48899:18"/>
accidents and encounters from Brute Beaſts, or more Brutiſh men.</p>
            <p>Man is a very feeble creature, and impotent for his own defence in a thouſand caſes that happen every day; it were therefore a moſt melancholy condition of life, if we were not under the ſhelter of a Providence, if we had no Patron, if there were not a Superiour Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, an higher nature continually ſolicitous about us for our protection: And therefore the well known Gentleman of <hi>Malmſbury</hi> might well be timorous and afraid that every man ſhould have deſigns to kill him, or that every accident might take away his life, for the man did not well believe in a God above, nor had any confidence in a Providence.</p>
            <p>And indeed ſuch a caſe is ſo ſad and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that it ſeems to be a very ſilly thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live if it were true: A man had better dye once than live in perpetual fears of dying; and nothing but childiſh cowardize could tempt a man to wiſh to live one day, if he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident there was no ſuch thing as a Providence.</p>
            <p>But if I believe there is a God that over-looks me where-ever I am, that is tender of me, that can and will preſerve me as long as he ſees good, in ſpight of all evil deſigns or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48899:19"/>
this erects a mans mind and fortifies his ſpirits; this ſuffers him neither to fear nor to wiſh for death, but enables him both to live pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and to dye bravely.</p>
            <p>And conſequently of this, the truſt in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is the great incouragement of all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enterpriſes and performances; and theſe, whether they be publick or private, if a man deſign a ſecret good thing, what can be the inducement to it? where can be the wiſdom of giving himſelf the trouble about it, when he can expect no reward in this World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the performance is kept ſecret from the notice of men; and if there be no Providence, it is certain there can be no reward in another World, and ſo his labour is wholly loſt.</p>
            <p>But if it be a publick action he deſigns, he ſhall be ſure to meet with thoſe will envy and malign him, a ſecond ſort will ſuſpect him, and a third will traduce and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame him; and amongſt the reſt there will not want thoſe that will find it to be their intereſt to oppoſe and hinder him: ſo that in ſhort, without a ſpecial hand of Providence, no man ſhall have either the heart to undertake, or the power and ſucceſs to effect any noble acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but grant this great point, and men are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48899:19"/>
born above envy, oppoſition, and even above themſelves.</p>
            <p>I cannot upon this occaſion forbear to take notice of a noble and memorable paſſage of the Roman Orator, in one of his Orations to the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> his words begin thus, <hi>Quàm volumus licet, patres conſcripti, nos amemus; tamen nec numero Hiſpanos, nec viribus Gallos, nec calliditate Poenos, nec doctrina Graecos,</hi> &amp;c. the ſenſe of the whole is to this effect, as if he had ſaid, Fathers of the Senate, let us entertain as good an opinion of our ſelves as we will or can; yet it muſt be acknowledged, that we neither equal the Spaniards in numbers, nor the Gauls in ſtrength and ſtature, nor the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians in craft and ſubtilty, nor the Greeks in learnimg and knowledge; and yet it is as certain, we have overcome and triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all theſe Nations: Now inquiring into the reaſon of this ſucceſs, I can attribute it to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, nor give any more probable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it than this; namely, that we live under a better and a quicker ſenſe of a God and a Providence than any of them do, and this, and this alone gives us all the advantage.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, But Sixthly and laſtly, and to ſpeak ſummarily, Providence is of unſpeakable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48899:20"/>
and influence upon the ſpirits of men, both in proſperity and adverſity. It may ſeem indeed, that whileſt a man is in proſperity, he is in no need of a Providence; and it is too commonly true, that men do not uſe to think much of God whileſt all goes well with them. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs this practice however general, is very fooliſh and unreaſonable; for beſides the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of worldly Proſperity, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more ordinary than for mens fortunes to be ſoon at a ſtand, for all their broad ſails and moſt earneſt endeavours, if once the wind of Providence deſert them: Beſides this (I ſay) it deſerves the moſt ſerious conſideration, that all worldly Proſperity is very little worth (even whileſt it laſts) if there be no Providence. For what great joy or contentment can the greateſt affluence afford a man, if all come by mere chance, or the courſe of the Stars, or by fate or any ſuch undiſcriminating cauſes. But on the other ſide, if a man can look upon his comforts, as the gifts and favours of a wiſe and a good God, then and then only they are comfortable indeed.</p>
            <p>And then for a ſtate of adverſity, that is ſad indeed if there be no Providence; think what it is to be in a ſtorm at Sea, where the Winds
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48899:20"/>
roar, the Sea rages, the Ship cracks, no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor-hold, no Shores to land upon, no comfort in Pilot or Governours of the Veſſel, nothing but a proſpect of death every way; if a man cannot look up to Heaven, and have hope in God, what a caſe is he in? Or ſuppoſe a man be cloſe Priſoner, and denied the comfort of his friends, together with other refreſhments of life, or confined to a ſick-bed, or be buried alive with obloquy and reproach; in a word, that a man be friendleſs and helpleſs; now if it can be ſaid to ſuch a man, there is no help for him in God neither, here is the very quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of miſery, a caſe ſad beyond expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But contrariwiſe, if a man in all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal circumſtances aforeſaid, ſhall yet firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Providence that orders all things well and wiſely, that can if he pleaſe bring a man out of all thoſe difficulties, that certainly will make all theſe work for his good, and at laſt judge righteous judgment, and make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends in another World; then is any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the mean time very tolerable whatſoever it be.</p>
            <p>And thus I have, I hope, performed the three things I promiſed from my Text; and what remains now, but that we make Application of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48899:21"/>
all to our ſelves, and that in theſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. By ſetling this great Doctrine in our minds. And,</item>
               <item>2. By improving it in our hearts to all the comfortable conſequences aforeſaid.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us ſettle this truth in our minds, that God Almighty exerciſes a Kingly Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in and over all the World; and let it (if it be poſſible) be a principle with us firm as a firſt notion, and indiſputable as the verdict of our Senſes: my meaning is, let nothing make us ſtagger or be able to ſhake our belief of that which is of ſo vaſt conſequence to us. Foraſmuch as without this Perſuaſion, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Religion is nonſence, but we are the moſt abject and pitiable Creatures in the World.</p>
            <p>Brutes and other inferiour Creatures have indeed no apprehenſion of a Providence, and yet enjoy themſelves in proportion to their natures; but then this is to be conſidered, they foreſee nothing, they ſuſpect nothing, and ſo do not torment themſelves before the time. But man ſuſpects dangers where they may not come, and foreſees them when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is a ſagacious and jealous Creature, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48899:21"/>
ſo anticipates calamities, and accumulates them. Now if there be no Providence, his condition is worſe than that of inferiour Beings, he is doubly miſerable, and that without remedy.</p>
            <p>Shall then a trifling Epicurean objection, nay, ſhall a Sceptical ſurmiſe, or a flaſh of Wit and Drollery, baffle us out of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the honour of our natures conſiſts, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all our comfort depends?</p>
            <p>Laugh at and ſcorn them that laugh at a Providence, poor pitiful wretches that worſhip blind fortune, or a manacled and fettered De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, bound hand and foot by fatal neceſſity: Our God is a wiſe and good and free Agent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, limited by nothing, but his own Wiſdom. He ſees all things without difficulty or deception, manages all things without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue or wearineſs, governs all things with juſt order, judges without partiality, pities in all adverſity, can relieve in all neceſſity, and with unſpeakable glory rewards thoſe that faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve him.</p>
            <p>And purſuant of this belief let us in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place raiſe our affections to the higheſt pitch of triumph, let us make a ſhout as in the Text, <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice, let the multitude of the Iſles be glad thereof:</hi> Or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48899:22"/>
as you have it in the 10. Verſe of the Pſalm immediately foregoing, <hi>Tell it out amongſt the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that the Lord reigneth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let all foreign Nations, and all foreign Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, all that have good will, and all that have ill will to our Religion, or to our Country, know that <hi>the Lord is King,</hi> and that we truſt not to the number of our Forces, or the Wiſdom of our Counſels, our Seas, or our Rocks, our Courage or Conduct, but to our King, to that Divine Providence which watches over us:</p>
            <p>Let our Prince and our Magiſtrates take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage againſt the rage or the follies, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or combinations of evil men, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that they are the inſtruments of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, the Lieutenants of Gods Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and he that ſet them in office under himſelf, will ſtand by them, and bear them out in diſcharge of their truſt and duty.</p>
            <p>Let the People be quiet, not liſten to noiſe and rumours, but be ſure to baniſh all diſloyal thoughts of reſorting to irregular means for the aſſerting their pretenſions. Is not God in the World? hath any one wreſted the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of his hand? why then ſhould we not truſt in him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48899:22"/>
When <hi>Philip Melancthon,</hi> otherwiſe a very wiſe and peaceable and mild-ſpirited perſon, began to be out of humour with the then ſtate of the World, <hi>Luther</hi> addreſſes to him in theſe words, <hi>Exorandus eſt Philippus ut deſinat eſſe rector Mundi; q. d.</hi> Good Brother <hi>Philip</hi> let God alone to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the World.</p>
            <p>Let the Oppreſſed, the Widow, the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Friendleſs take comfort, for he that ſitteth in the Throne will judge righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and firſt or laſt avenge the cauſe of his meaneſt Subject.</p>
            <p>Nay, let the man that is tempted and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by the Devil, hold his ground, and fear nothing, for God is above the Devil.</p>
            <p>To conclude, let us all lay aſide our fears and our jealouſies, our ſighs and complaints, our melancholy and deſpondency, <hi>Is there not a balm in Gilead, is there no Phyſician there,</hi> Jer. 8. 22. Have we not a Wiſe and a Powerful, a Glorious and a good Prince, why then ſhould we murmur? why accuſe his Reign? why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach his Government?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Novum ſeditionis genus otium &amp; ſilentium,</hi> ſaid the Hiſtorian; A ſullen uncomfortableneſs and diſlike of our condition, our diſcontent with the ſtate of affairs, is a kind of Sedition againſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48899:23"/>
Heaven, our murmuring is no better than a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling of Gods Government.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (to ſay no more) let us ſtick cloſe to this God, this mighty Potentate; let us hope, truſt, and rejoice in him, and he ſhall bleſs our King, our Church, our Magiſtrates, and all our Concerns.</p>
            <p>Now to this Univerſal Monarch of the World, this King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, be all Glory and Praiſe, Worſhip and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion World without End.</p>
