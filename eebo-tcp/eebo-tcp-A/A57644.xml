            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>EBEIA hath not bin the leaſt conſiderable. His ſevere and moſt indefatigable labours in moſt parts of <hi>Learning,</hi> are conſummated in this piece of Religion, wherein like an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Anatomiſt, he hath left no vein un-cut up. To fall into exceſſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of him, were to commit a moral abſurdity, by praiſing one whom the general Trumpet of Fame hath blaz'd abroad for ſo great an advancer of Virtue and Learning; But to trouble <hi>you</hi> with them, were yet to be ſo much the more importunate, whoſe converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him was ſo great, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I may ſay of him, I ſhall not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with ſo much as your ſelf know. Nor did the influence of your Patronage raiſe and animate onely him, but there are ſo many other monuments of your great encouragements to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it will be thought modeſty in me not to mention all. But your exceſſive Benefactorſhip to the Library of S. <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge at <hi>Cambridge</hi> (whereof I have ſometimes had the honour to be an unworthy member) I cannot paſſe over, as a thing, which will ſtand upon the file of memory, as long as learning ſhall find profeſſors or Children. And that which
<pb facs="tcp:53313:3"/>
increaſes the glory of your muniſicence, is, that that Library may boaſt that it is furniſhed with the works of its owne ſonnes, which, being the greateſt act of retribution and gratitude that may be, muſt be accordingly acknowledged by all that ſhall come after. But that which hath the moſt engaged and ſatisfied the <hi>Engliſh</hi> world, is, that your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours have diſplayed themſelves in their cleareſt light, in that <hi>one thing that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Religion,</hi> not only by being a conſtant aſſertor of her purity here in <hi>England,</hi> but in that, after more then <hi>Ulyſſean</hi> Travels throughout moſt parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> you have returned to your former enjoyments of that chaſt <hi>Penelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,</hi> when others either out of weakneſſe or ſurpriſe, are enſnared and beſotted with the Tenets of other Countries, whereby they are both ingrateful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to their own, by preferring the prudence and policy of another before hers. Religion certainly, if well impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is the <hi>Talent,</hi> that felicifies the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover, if not, coademnes him. It is that univerſal <hi>Patrimony,</hi> which entitles us to be the ſonnes of God, and by which we are adopted into the aſſured hope of eternall hapineſſe. It is the <hi>Loadctone</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53313:4"/>
wherewith when our ſouls are once touched, they are directed to the right pole of the eternally beatificall viſion; and without which, wee muſt infallibly expect to ſplit againſt the rocks and ſhelves of perdition. It is the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heavens indulgence to Mankind, that which doth familiarize us, and makes good our Intereſt in the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cauſe of all things. It is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of nature, ſince that whatſoever wee know of the divinity by her comes onely by the aſſiſtance and mediation of our ſences, but the other furniſhes us with a more evident aſſurance, (and that, in things, which can bee neither <hi>ſeen, heard</hi> nor <hi>conceived),</hi> by the more particular providence of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby hee is pleaſed to <hi>how down the heavens,</hi> and deſcend unto a familiar converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with our very ſpirits.</p>
            <p>But that which ought further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear all men to Religion, is, that ſhe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly next to God may pretend <hi>Ubiquity,</hi> as being a thing written in ſuch indelible characters in the hearts of all men, that even the moſt barbarous nations, and the greateſt ſtrangers to civility and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy have acknowledged ſome divine worſhip, though their pravity or want
<pb facs="tcp:53313:4"/>
of inſtruction, may have blinded them from the <hi>true,</hi> but yet that eclipſe of the true God hath not been total, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as they have ſtill retained a ſenſe and veneration of Religion, ſo that to the beſt of their imaginations, they have created ſomething like God to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. To make this yet more evident, we are to note, that moſt people, though they had not ſo clear apprehenſions of the immortality of the ſoul, as we have; yet were they not only perſwaded of the impoſſibility of its annihilation, but have alſo acknowledged rewards and puniſhments to be expected after this life.</p>
            <p>To aſcend yet a little higher; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity and preheminence of Religion is demonſtrated, in that it exerciſeth that Empire and Soveraignty over the mind of man, that no blandiſhments of the fleſh, no temptations, no torments have been able to diſpoſſeſſe it. It hath tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd in the midſt of its perſecutions; and by her ſufferings hath conquered her perſecutors. Her pleaſing Raviſhments can ſtifle for a time all ſence of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, elude flames, and racks, and ſo arm the delicacie and tenderneſs of virgin puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to overcome the hardieſt Tyrants.
<pb facs="tcp:53313:5"/>
It is ſhe that raiſes our ſoules to a holy boldneſſe and intimacy in our addreſſes to heaven, being indeed rapt into the heavens of divine contemplation, by her extaſies and illuminations. It was her inſpiring communication, that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated your pious ſoul, when you deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the divine perfections of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable THEOPHILA. Theſe things can ſhe do and greater, when there is but one grain of true <hi>Faith;</hi> but when ſhe is defiled and adulterated with humane ceremonies and inventions, ſhe is deformed, and looſes all her grace and beauty. And among theſe hath ſhe met with two moſt importunate pretenders, <hi>Atheiſme</hi> and <hi>Superſtition;</hi> the one ſtrips her ſtark naked, the other meritriciouſly proſtitutes her in the diſguiſes of humane Inventions. And that ſhe hath been thus evill entreated, in all places and times, this book gives but too great teſtimony, whether you look on the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or this ſmall appendix, treating for the moſt, of what happened in High and Low <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> I would not draw any excuſe for our own gyrations of Religion here, from their madneſſe; but rather condemn them as things that would have out-vy'd the extravagance of the former. But to
<pb facs="tcp:53313:5"/>
draw any argument againſt Religion from either were impious; for if we did, we muſt in conſequence, deny all, both particular and univerſal <hi>providence</hi> of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; we muſt deny the Scriptures, the heavenly Legacy of eternal ſalvation; wee muſt deny <hi>Heaven, Hell, Eternity,</hi> nay take away the <hi>Cement</hi> of all humane ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and expect to ſee the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> of the <hi>univerſe</hi> hurried into <hi>darkneſs</hi> and <hi>confuſion,</hi> ſince it ought not to out-laſt man, for whom it was created. Nay; but let us rather profeſſe humanity, and make this uſe of the failings and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of others in matters of Religion; To humble our ſelves to a relyance on that immenſe Being, who hath thought fit to plant Religion in the heart of man, to direct him in his voyage to eternall happineſſe, wherein that every man might take the right way, is the earneſt prayer of</p>

They are <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> and falſe teachers, as being a contagion, than which hell it ſelf hath not vomited up a more dangerous ſince the beginning of the world. For I do not think it can bee eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, what other miſchief could have redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not onely the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> but almost all <hi>Germany,</hi> into ſo great calamity and devastati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When I more narrowly look into the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of theſe men, I confeſs I am puzzel'd to finde a name for the Monſter, but what its aims are, I may haply gueſs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I call it a <hi>Monſter,</hi> and I may add the moſt monſtrous that ever was, as having in it the Ingredients of all formerly condemned Sects. Which when I conſider, me thinks all the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

So that I can make no other judgment of <hi>THOMAS MUNTZER,</hi> that Authour and raiſer of a moſt pernicious Sect, then that he hath re-erected the Standards of all former hereſies. But that it may not be ſaid, as in the Proverb, that <hi>Affrick</hi> alwayes furniſhes us with Novelties, he alſo with his deſperate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, hath ſacrilegiouſly attempted to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſome altogether new and unheard-of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, whereof who ſhall ſay that which is <hi>MADE</hi> is <hi>GOOD,</hi> muſt be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant.

Out of theſe, teach to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and diſcard Magiſtrates, who are the living ectypes of God, while in the mean time they themſelves aſpire to Soveraignty, and would be accounted Potentates, when they are indeed the wickedſt among men; Diſſemblers, Cheats, Hypocrites, Novators, or Advancers of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, and the ſubtle generation of the old Viper <hi>Novatu.</hi> Which ſaid <hi>Novatus,</hi> if I diſplay in the colours wherein the holy Father and Martyr <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſets him forth, diſcreet men ſhall be my Judges, whether I have not hit the mark, and the ſame deſcription moſt ſitly ſuits the greateſt part of the Proſelytes of

               <hi>Muntzer.</hi> As concerning <hi>Novatus</hi> (ſayes that Ornament of his <hi>Carthage,</hi> lib. 11.

You therefore, Orthodox Doctors, reduce thoſe erroneous and miſerably ſeduced men, which yet are ſo, into the way of Truth, Deliver them, I beſeech you out of this phrenſy, and omit no opportunities which may help to recover them out of this imaginary diſeaſe to which they are ſo accuſtomed.

IN the year of our Lord God, M. D.

From <hi>Marpyrgum</hi> were there ſome diſpatched, who arriving at <hi>Munſter,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the principall heads of Chriſtian Religion into <hi>thirty nine Articles,</hi> which they propoſed to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, being ready, (as they pretended) to make good and prove the ſaid heads, by places of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which was effected.

Upon this weighty buſineſſe, the Magiſtrates and Citizens ſate in long and prudent conſultations. At length there was a certain agreement, upon theſe terms, <hi>viz.</hi> That all injuries committed in thoſe Tumults ſhould be pardoned, and that the Goſpel ſhould be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached in ſix Pariſh Churches, and that the Church of <hi>our Lord</hi> only ſhould be abſolutely reſerved to them. Theſe conditions were readily ſubſcribed to by both ſides, and thereupon all things laid aſleep in peace. But this peace was not long undiſturbed by the <hi>Devill,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The devill an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of peace.</note> (that irreconcileable enemy of peace and virtue) and therefore by doing at <hi>Munſter</hi> what hee had done at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, that is, by raiſing up out of the jaws of Hell, the ſeditious and peſtiferous <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> thoſe importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate diſturbers and <hi>turn-pikes</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> his deſign was not onely to diſcourage the good and godly, but withall, ſhamefully to deſtroy the Goſpel it ſelf.

Theſe emiſſary meſſengers of Chriſt, or rather of Satan, boyled over with their various opinions, held mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of no account, and dreamed diverſe other things.

But indeed they may be fitly ſaid to be like Aſſes that rub one another; or to the Blinde leading about the Blinde. It is a great affliction, it is a pennance to repeat the miſeries and the wofull conſequences of Famine and want. There were a <note place="margin">Famine, it's character, and miſeries.</note> many who being impatient of ſo long hunger, revolted to the enemy, not ſo much out of hope of compaſſion, as to accelerate their own deaths; not a few creeping upon all four, endeavored to get away; for being weak and ſtrengthleſſe, they could hardly faſten their feet on the ground; ſome falling down were content to give up the ghoſt in the place where they lay. There you might ſee a ſad ſpectacle of foreheads and cheeks pale as aſhes, temples fallen, eies ſunk into hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſharp noſes, ears ſhrivel'd, lips black and blew, throats ſlender as thoſe of Spiders; to bee ſhort, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocratical</hi> faces, living carcaſes, and excellent ſhadows of men.

To this wee may add, that the moſt wickedly obſtinate citizens were not yet convinced, that by crafty infinuations and ſpecious ſuggeſtions they were brought into the nooſe, whom therefore he ſtil entertained with conſiderations of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, and the deliverance they were yet conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expect from God, but as for thoſe who admitted any thoughts of running away, and endeavoured to avoyd their miſeries, he peremptorily ſends for, and like a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Robber taking away all that their induſtry had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with, <hi>depart,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and be gone to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and bid ſarewel to this place.</hi> The King, though he <note place="margin">He forgets community.</note> had gotten at his houſe ſufficient proviſion for two months, yet was he willing to imbrace all occaſions wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might keep up the heart of the City which now continually barked for ſuſtenance.

By this pretence hee flyes to the enemy, and betrays the City to the Biſhop, for a certain ſumme of money with his life included. The Eve of <hi>Saint John</hi> was appointed for the execution of this deſign, about ten of the clock, at which time hee had obliged himſelf by oath to cauſe the gate called the Croſſe-gate to be opened. This Commiſſary for proviſions returning at length to the City, aſſured the King upon his ſaith and reputation, that the ſaid recruits of proviſion and forces, ſhould be ready within the time appointed. The day aſſigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, hee acquaints the Guards that the promiſed forces, were to come in in the night (which would bee ſtarr-light enough) that ſo they might receive them as friends. The gates are hereupon ſet open, and the enemies being admitted into the City as into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Troy,</hi> upon the Watch-word given, ſoon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd the Guards and others that were neer.

The King and his Courtiers being gotten into a body, drove back the enemie to the Gates, which the citizens had by that time ſhut again: whereupon the reſt of them that were without: were forced to ſet Engines to force open the Gates, which being once broken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, they flouriſhed and ſet up their Colours. The citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſtiffely reſiſted the firſt aſſault, and made a ſtrong bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Market place, where the fight became very hot and bloody.

The Anabaptiſts upon the taking of their King being quite caſt down and diſcouraged, went and hid themſelves in Larders, Kitchins, and other lurking holes. The City was moſt <note place="margin">The City of <hi>Munſter</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully plundered.</note> unmercifully plundered; and to make a full ſearch of it, there were ten days allotted.

Whereof having ſufficiently informed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he pretended that he had been driven out of his Countrey for the Goſpels ſake, and that he <note place="margin">At <hi>Baſill</hi> he pretends to have been ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his Countrey for the Goſpels ſake.</note> had been hitherto toſt both on the land and ſea of the miſeries of this world; and therefore he humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, that now at length he might be received into ſome place of Reſt. Some being by the repreſentation of his misfortunes and his teares, melted into compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards him, he preſum'd to intreat the Magiſtrate, that in tenderneſſe to Chriſt and his holy Goſpel, he might be made capable of the priviledges of the City, which if it were granted, he bid them be confident of Gods moſt particular protection towards their City, and that for the preſervation of it, he engaged for him and his, that they ſhould be ready to lay down their lives. The Magiſtrates being moved with theſe juſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53313:33"/>
remonſtrances and deſires received the viper as a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, <note place="margin">With his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretences he gains the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the City for him and his.</note> gave him the right hand of welcome and fellowſhip, and made him and his free of the City. What ſhould the Magiſtrate do? Behold, he hath to do with a man of a grave countenance, free in his behaviour, having a very long beard and that yellowiſh, sky-coloured and ſparkling eyes, milde and affable in the midſt of his gravity, neat in his apparel; Finally one that ſeemed to <note place="margin">His Character.</note> have in him all the ingredients of honeſty, modeſty and truth; to be ſhort, one, if you examine his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, carriage, diſcourſe, and the cauſe he is embarqu'd in, all things without him are within the limits of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity and modeſty; if you look within him, he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but deceit, fraud, and diſſimulation; in a word, an ingenuous Anabaptiſt. Having already felt the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Senate and divers of the Citizens, comming with his whole family to <hi>Baſill,</hi> he and his are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a certain Citizen. Having neſted a while in <hi>Baſill,</hi> he purchaſed certain houſes in the City, as alſo a Farm in the Countrey and ſome other things thereto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertenant, married his children, and by his good offices procured to himſelf many friends. For, as long as he remained at <hi>Baſill,</hi> he ſo much ſtudied Religion, was ſo great an Alms-giver, and gave himſelf ſo much to other exerciſes of devotion, that ſuſpicion it ſelf had not what to ſay againſt him. By theſe cunning inſinuations (this is beyond a young fox, and ſmells more of the <hi>Lybian</hi> wilde beaſt) many being ſurpriſed, came eaſily over to his party, ſo that he arrived to that eſteem and reputation in matters of Religion, he pleaſed himſelf. This perſwaſion thus craftily gotten, was heightened by his great wealth (and his riches in jewels, whereof he <note place="margin">His riches</note> brought ſome with him, ſome were daily brought from other places in the Low-countries) &amp; was yet further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, by his ſumptuous and rich plate and houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuffe, which though they were gorgeous and majeſtical, yet were they not made to look beyond ſobriety, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and mediocrity. Theſe people ſojourning thus in common houſes, deſiring as yet to ſuppreſſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious infection of their ſect, very religiouſly enacted <note place="margin">He, with his Sect, enact three things.</note> three things: Firſt, that no man ſhould profane or ſpeak idly of the name of <hi>David George.</hi> Secondly,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53313:33"/>
that no man ſhould raſhly or unadviſedly divulge any thing concerning his country, or manner of life; whence it was that ſome thought him to be a perſon of ſome quality; ſome, that he was ſome very rich Factor or Merchant, whence it came that he was ſo exceſſively rich; others had other imaginary opinions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of him, for as much as they themſelves being ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, lived in a Country where they could not be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of any thing: Thirdly, he was very cautious that none of the <hi>Baſileans</hi> ſhould be careleſly admitted into his acquaintance, ſociety or correſpondence, imitating therein the policie of the <hi>Ferrets</hi> and <hi>Weeſels,</hi> which (as is reported) never aſſault any bird of ſupremacy, in the places where they frequent. And thus did he by letters, writings and emiſſaries, plant and water the venemous ſeed of his ſect through the lower Provinces, yet kept the waies by which he wrought unſuſpected and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. For, although he had lived two years among them, there was not ſo much as one man infected; or had privately caught the itch of his Religion. What tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Myſteries are theſe! This man, though he feared neither deceit nor treachery from ſtrangers, yet the fire kindled out of the deceitful embers of his own houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.

But this was but a report, and was not true. Thoſe that were in cuſtody abhorring that doctrine, as unheard of, and ſuch as deſerved to be anathematized, and deſiring to renew their acquaintance with diſcretion and their ſences, are delivered out of thoſe habitations of Iron which they had kept poſſeſſion of for two months, upon theſe conditions, That none ſhould make any purchaſes <note place="margin">Conditions whereupon the impriſoned are ſet at liberty.</note> either within or near the City, without the knowledge and conſent of the Magiſtrate: That they ſhall not entertain any coming out of the lower Provinces,

That the printed books and writings that were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into the <hi>Dutch</hi> language, ſhall be brought into the Palace. That there ſhould be nothing publiſhed that were diſconſonant to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine. That children ſhould be educated according to incorrupt manners.

For <hi>Menno</hi> held, that Chriſt was ſomething more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and more divine then the ſeed of a woman, but (our) <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood upon it, that he was leſſe worthy then that of God, ſo that he rowſed up the <hi>Arrian</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, <note place="margin">He revived the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie.</note> which had lain ſo long aſleep, as having been but too famous in the year three hundred twenty five.

               <hi>ſuffering and impaſſible, is made paſſible, and he that was immortal, is made mortal; for he was cruciſied, and died for our advantage.</hi> To be brief, he held, that Chriſt was not to be accounted any thing but the hand, the finger, or the voice of God. But although the opinion or Religion of this (third, but moſt unfaithful) <hi>Paſtor Adam</hi> wander out of the limits of divinity, and that it ſeem to be an ancient hereſie, containing nothing in it but what is childiſh, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, and meer foppery, &amp; hath been confuted &amp; brought to nothing by the moſt religious preachers of the word <note place="margin">His opinion hath been ſufficiently reſuted.</note> of God, notwithſtanding the barking of the viperous progeny of <hi>Arrius</hi> and <hi>Servetus;</hi> yet he hath this in particular, that he would have us look narrowly to his explication of the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which he ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, where he fooliſhly and vainly endeavours to prove that the <hi>prohibition there,</hi> is the word made fleſh. This monſter did not onely beget this ſect, but nurſed it; here are baites, allurements, and all the poiſonable charmes imaginable that may cunningly ſeduce the beſt and moſt innocent of men.
