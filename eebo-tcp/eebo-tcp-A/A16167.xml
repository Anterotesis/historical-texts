         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and prouoke mee to commit this my ſimple tranſlation

of Noble perſonages, but theſe <hi>Regios Canes</hi> (for ſo the
Philoſopher termeth them, I commit eyther to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath béene a very auncient opinion of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
(worthy Readers) that there is giuen
vnto man of nature, a deſire to vnderſtand, for they
ſuppoſed, that oure ſoules in taking imperfection,
through the vniting with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſubſtance, by the meane
of vnderſtanding, ſhould approch the neerer to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
their winges alreadie loſt, and to returne vnto
their priſtinate perfection: but foraſmuch as diuers
of them, were inclined to ſundrie wayes of vnderſtanding, ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the occaſion vnto the ſtarres, other vnto the predomination in
our bodyes, more of one humor then of an other. Ariſtotle diſtinctly
notwithſtanding, ſeemeth to attribute euery thing in this, vnto our
election, which through the pretext of ſome felicitie, or profite, doth
diſpoſe vs to practiſe rather one thing then an other. But verilye
which of them ſoeuer is true, the inclination of my natiuitie, I haue
alwayes knowne to haue beene giuen to the vnderſtanding of diuers
things, and eſpecially of thoſe, which apperteyne vnto the cure of
mens bodies. And to put it in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I diſpoſed my ſelfe to trauaile
diuers Countries, and to be conuerſaunt with diuers ſortes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
not omitting with all induſtrie thorowly to ſearch out the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the ſecretes of many nations, and with them likewiſe to
make experience, by putting them into practiſe, by reaſon whereof in
ſhort ſpace, through the recouery of helth, which the people did feele,
I became ſo famous, that I obſcured the names of the moſt expert
Phiſitions that were, through which occaſion I haue beene reſorted
vnto as it were with infinite kinds of Nations, with exceeding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
vnto my great credit. And although for all things, I rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thankes vnto the diuine bountie, yet my iuuenile minde was not
voyde of euerie ſparkle of ambition and glorie. I wrote them in the
yeares paſſed, certaine tryfling things, part whereof were of my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes
(although weake) belonging vnto phiſick, part vnto the bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
of women, and part vnto other practiſes, to manifeſt vnto
the worlde that I had knowledge in miſticall thinges, whereby I
conceyued to obtaine greater glorie, then much to helpe, hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
reſerued in the priuieſt partes of my heart as a moſt precious
treaſure, the profound ſecrets of the Art of healing, and the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the ſame, for the which I haue bene alwayes had in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall
veneration. Neyther was their any (although a moſt deare
friend) that might get of me any ſmall intelligence of my ſecretes, ſo
much I deſired not to haue any part of my glorie or reputation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed.
And bicauſe euerye mans operations, are directed vnto
<pb facs="tcp:589:4"/>
ſome laudable ende, or that we accompt worthie of commendation,
I being incited long ſince, and of my deare friendes requeſted, that
I woulde for a vniuerſall benefite vnto all the worlde, reduce into
lyght, theſe my ſecretes, to the ende they might profite the abſent,
and thoſe which are farre diſtant from the Region where I inhabit.
I refuſed to accept anye one part of their perſwaſions, accounting
him vnwiſe, which to benefit other, would depriue himſelfe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and dignitie, ſo much was I blinded in worldly glorie. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nowe come to that age, in the which it is neceſſarie by the courſe
of nature, to yeelde my ſoule vnto God, being nowe impotent, and
thinking it the duetie of one man to doe good vnto another, and moſt
of all in matters of phiſick, which are communicated vnto vs of God
for a vniuerſall commoditie: I haue eſteemed it not my part or dutye
to preferre my peculier profite, before that of all the worlde, for in ſo
doing I muſt haue ſuppoſed and beleeued to haue committed a great
error, if I had not yeelded my ſelfe culpaple, and repented mee, to
haue hidden from the whole worlde, ſuch a benefite vnto this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
And therefore calling vnto memorie the perſwaſions once made
vnto me, of the noble and worthie knight maiſter Francuccio Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio,
touching this matter, and alſo examming mine owne conſcience,
I coulde no longer abſteyne from wryting and publiſhing them to
adorne therewith the worlde, bicauſe otherwiſe dying, I ſhoulde
worthily haue beene accompted not inferiour vnto an homicide: as
alſo to eſchue the crymes of auaritious perſons, who hauing hidden
their treaſures in the grounde, and Death ſurpriſing them, remayne
buried togither with their ſubſtaunce, and depart out of the world, in
the diſpleaſure both of God and man. Therefore if my firſt conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and purpoſe to write, was of ambition and vaine glorie, as is
the propertie of yong minds, little regarding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they are bound
vnto: This other ſhall not diſſent from the duetie of a chriſtian, &amp; one
full of compaſſion towards mankind: that is to publiſh &amp; diſpoyle my

to accompliſh the ſaid decree, hauing gathered al my experienced me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
I haue thought good to ioyne them togither, with thoſe
whych were printed in time paſſed, which although they were not
of ſuch importaunce, neuertheleſſe they are things both of ſkill, and
credit, whereof hauing gotten a volume, and read it ſundrie times,
I haue found them ſo altered and corrupted, that with difficultie I
might be perſwaded to beleeue that they were mine, they were ſo
wholy altered, except only in name. And hauing in part corrected the
volume of the ſuperfluous, and thinges of little account added vnto
it, being well pervſed, I haue ioyned therewith this my laſt labor

to come: Firſt, bicauſe in theſe my trauayles (as I haue alreadie
ſayde, I haue ſpoyled my ſelfe of all that euer I experienced: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in that I am ſo olde, as within ſhort ſpace, you maye ſuppoſe to
vnderſtande rather of my departure out of lyfe, then to receyue of me
any other thing, if their be not written ſomewhat vnder my name, of
ſome malicious perſon to deceaue you withall, and to encreaſe the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
without any profite. I will not omit to aduertiſe the Readers,
that they deceaue not themſelues through my examples, working
theſe medicines wythout the counſell &amp; wholeſome aduertiſements
of ſome expert Phiſition, for I neuer wrote them to that ende, ſince
from my tender age, contynually I haue applied the ſtudie of good
letters, in ſuch ſort that the ſecretes of ſciences are not hidden vnto
me, neyther is there any Cannon of Phiſick that I haue not verie
well vnderſtood: and therefore haue knowne with the age, with the
ſeaſons, and with conuenient time to applie and vſe them: Beſides
the knowledge to aduertiſe one if neede were to be let bloud, and an
other to be purged, and hauing proceeded in this manner, there was
neuer any Pacient of mine, that hath not obtayned his due remedie.
You therfore (vnto thoſe I ſpeake which vnderſtand not the cannons
of Phiſicke) when occaſion happeneth to vſe my ſecretes, take the
counſell of ſome expert Phiſition, to the ende you may attayne the
benefite. Bicauſe in not knowing to compound, applye, and miniſter
them as you ought to doe, you may ſlaunder the Phiſition that hath
healed many. Accuſtome therefore to take counſell of ſuch Phiſitions
as are honeſt, and that practiſe the Art without fraude: for there are
ſeene of that profeſſion many, which being giuen to prattle, and tell fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to deceaue the people, doe vitupcrate the experiences, with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they are wicked, and ſuch lyke. Not conſidering that ſicke
perſons are not cured with trifles, as affirmeth the worthy Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Celſus, but with experimented medicines, not newly found out
(if well they vnderſtoode the Art.) And aſſure your ſelues, that by
practiſing theſe ſecrets which I ſet openly foorth (as is conuenient)
and preparing them with diligence, and with choſen ſimples, alwaies
they will worke according to your intent, for in this booke there
is nothing mencioned, which hath not beene many times
practiſed, and founde true, through the grace of
Almightie God, vnto whome be giuen
all praiſe, and glorie, worlde
without ende.</p>
