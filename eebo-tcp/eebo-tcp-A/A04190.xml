            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus much of the coherence of theſe words with the former, the true meaning of this aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, and of the Prophets drift and ſcope in this place: which is to aſſure <hi>Ephraim</hi> or <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he ſhould ſhare with <hi>Iudah</hi> in the glory of their <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> as after he did in his conception and educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <p n="3">3 The ſecond argument, wherewith theſe Iewiſh ſeducers had bewitched theſe fooliſh <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> (as we may gather from our Apoſtles praeoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation in this preſent Chapter) was much what the ſame with that maine charme, wherewith the Romane Sorcerers ſo mightily prevaile with the ignorant of our times.</p>
            <p>Theſe, or the like quaeries, you may imagine, were often propounded to theſe late converts, by the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Whoſe ſucceſſours would <hi>Paul,</hi> would <hi>Apolloes,</hi> would others, which abandon Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, or the Ceremoniall Law, be reputed? Doe they not cal themſelues the children of Prophets? Would they not bee accounted the ſonnes of Gods choſen people? And what religion (I pray) did the Prophets, or their godly forefathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe? Did they not all ſubſcribe to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies giuen by <hi>Moſes</hi>? Did they not liue and die in theſe practiſes, which wee perſwade you to?

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7899:23"/>
and heires of the everlaſting promiſes?</p>
            <p n="4">4 To bring this controverſie, betweene our Apoſtle and theſe ſeducers, to a more ſhort and diſtinct iſſue. Firſt, they agree, that only ſuch, as liued vnder the Law, were the true Church and people of God. Secondly, that onely the true Church and people of God, were the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heires of the everlaſting promiſes. But from theſe grants or ſuppoſitions, our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle thus inferres.</p>
            <p>As every other heire, ſo the Church of God was to haue a time of non-age, before ſhee could come to her full age, or bee enſtated in the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance bequeathed; that during this non-age, the ſtate or condition of Gods Church and people, as of all other heires in their childhood, did nothing differ from the condition of ſervants. Whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it will follow, that as the authoritie of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, of Gardians, and Feoffees in truſt (though, for the times being, moſt abſolute) is vtterly to expire and determine, at the time, by the Teſtator or Doner appointed for the heire to enter vpon his inheritance: ſo the Law of ordinances, which God himſelfe had given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> though, during the time of the Churches non age, moſt abſolute and ſoveraigne, was to be repealed and cancelled, at the fulneſſe of time (i) at the time appointed by God for the full age of the Church. Where it wil be no digreſſion by the way to obſerue, that the period of other heires non age, was not alwaies
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7899:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
preciſely determined by humane Laws; but might be longer or ſhorter according to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Doner. Laſtly, as ſecular heires, by not entring vpon their inheritance at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, doe much preiudice their title, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue (as wee ſay) to bee beg'd for fooles; ſo the Church and people of God, by not abandoning the yoke of the Law, at the time appointed by God for their full age, did thereby make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vncapable of the bleſſing beſtowed on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Goſpell.</p>
            <p n="5">5 This is the point moſt preſſed by our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in this and the Chapter following.<note place="margin">Chap. 5. v. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Stand faſt therefore in the libertie wherewith Christ hath made you free, and be not intangled againe by the yoke of bondage: behold, I Paul ſay vnto you, that if yee be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, Christ ſhall profit you nothing: for I teſtifie againe to every man, that is circumciſed, that hee is a debter to doe the whole Law: Chriſt is become of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnto you, whoſoeuer of you are iuſtified by the Law: yee are fallen from grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that which determined the Churches non age, and did <hi>ipſo facto</hi> extinguiſh the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne authoritie of the Law, was the ſending forth of the ſonne of God, who was heire of all things. <hi>But when the fulneſse of time was come, God ſent forth his ſonne, made of a woman, made vnder the Law, to redeeme them that were vnder the Law, that we might receaue the adoption of ſonnes.</hi> Or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dialect of our engliſh Law, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance

            <p>The queſtion is not what he could haue done by his Almightie power, but what in his wiſdome was moſt fit and convenient for our redemption. Now, this wee ſay, that by the eternall rules of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, which God obſerues in all his waies, it was not onely convenient but neceſſarie (though not for our inſtruction, yet for our redemption &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification) that his ſonne ſhould be not only man, but man <hi>made of a woman</hi>: and our Apoſtle in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, ſaith a great deale more, then if hee had ſaid, borne of a woman.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Every man, except the firſt man <hi>Adam,</hi> is borne of a woman, but no man beſides the ſonne of God, by whom man and all things were made,

was made of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The myſteries contained in this manner of ſpeech, cannot bee duely valued or vnfolded, without ſome explication of that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar reference, which theſe words, in the Apoſtles intent and meaning, haue to the firſt creation of man and woman.</p>
            <p n="10">10 And here I muſt intreat you of the weaker ſexe, to obſerue with me, that our Apoſtle, aſwell to put you in mind of that duty which you owe to your huſbands, as alſo to ſtirre vp your thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards God, for your redemption; ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres you to the maner of your mother <hi>Eues</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and tranſgreſſion.

            <p>The former is <hi>1. Cor. 11. v. 7. &amp;c. For a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ought not to couer his head, for aſmuch as he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man; for the man is not of the woman, but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the man; neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man.</hi> Thus he deriues your ſubordination to your husbands, from the firſt originall of your ſexe: this methode &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of inſtruction hee learned from our Saviour, who reſolued the difficultie propoſed concerning divorce, from the Canon, or Inſtitution of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, enacted by God, with <hi>Adams</hi> conſent, and

               <hi>Neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man in the Lord: for as the woman is of the man, even ſo is the man alſo by the woman; but all things of God.</hi> The firſt woman then, was made of the firſt man; all men ſince haue come into the world by the woman: but the ſonne of God came not only by the woman, but was made of the woman; as the firſt woman was of the firſt man. This great myſtery was preciſely, fore told by the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> though not ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as many at the firſt ſight would obſerue it. <hi>The Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, a</hi> woman <hi>ſhall compaſſe a</hi> man,<note place="margin">Ierem. 31. v. 22.</note> 
               <hi>or the female ſhall incloſe the male, or man of ſtrength.</hi> It is called a new creation, with reference to the firſt creation, wherein the woman was incloſed in the man; as here quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the man is incloſed in the woman, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand of God, conceau'd and borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any concurrence of man; as the firſt woman was brought forth out of the ſubſtance of man, without the helpe or conſort of a woman.</p>
