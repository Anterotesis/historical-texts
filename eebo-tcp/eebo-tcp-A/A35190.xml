         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the World, and that all sorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Men, even from the <hi>Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> to the <hi>Cobler,</hi> are its Votaries. You will not then admire if I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to my self; nor do I think that <hi>I</hi> stood in need of a Preface to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of it: But <hi>Custom</hi> calling for one, a Book being without it (as our Modern Wits say) Like a House without a Porch, or a Play without a Prologue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tho <hi>I</hi> must confess <hi>I</hi> am no great admirer of Prefaces, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon 'em, <hi>I</hi> mean the Generality of 'em, (for there are some that are Concise, Pithy and Instructive) to be for the most part Impertinent, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, and little to the purpose; stuft with Flattery and Ostentation, and many times excessive long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, like too much Ceremony before a good Feast; which by its long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Man, palls his Appetite: Notwithstanding which, <hi>I</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give you some short account of tjis Book; which you will find to be a

choice Collection of the merriest Iests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as you may see in the Title Page, to which <hi>I</hi> refer you) extracted from the several Authors that have written on those Subjects: Wherein their Gold is separated from their Dross, their Vnpolite ones are Refin'd, their long and tedious ones Retrench'd, their old ones render'd Modern, and those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy an ingenious Mans Reading, wholy left out; The Composure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, having cost me no small Care and Pains, as you may judge; that not only the reading over, but Critical Examination of the several Books written (as aforesaid) on those Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, must needs amount to. But perhaps some carping <hi>Zoilus,</hi> or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere <hi>Cato,</hi> will either blame the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of those Iests, or utterly deny the usefulness of any. As to the first, I leave it to your Candor to judge of it, knowing that if you come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light your Self with Ingenious Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and not to Carp, you may find

some in this <hi>Collection</hi> that may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer your Expectation: But if there still remain any that ought to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pung'd, pass 'em by; and let the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Majority a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
