            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received yours, and do pay you the greateſt tribute of thanks, for your excellent Remarques upon the preſent ſtate of Affairs in <hi>Europe,</hi> and muſt have the ſame Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and do admire with you, that <hi>France,</hi> which (not many years ſince) was ſo weak and feeble, that it trembled at the very Name of the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> ſhould now be ſo potent, as to contraſt the mightieſt Powers of <hi>Europe. Lewis</hi> the II. paid to the King of <hi>England</hi> fifty thouſand Crowns, yearly, to be his Friend, and ſixteen thouſand Crowns to his Miniſters of State to keep him ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. having the Carkaſs of an inconſiderable Ship in the Stocks, received ſharp Meſſages from Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to deſiſt, which accordingly he did; and that Queen lent unto him, and disburſed for him, four millions of pounds ſterling, to ſupport his Wars, and had Towns of Caution for them.</p>
            <p>Within theſe few years <hi>France</hi> had not above twelve Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and twenty men of War, (as they called them) and was not able to put them to Sea, and keep them there, for want of money; the yearly Revenues of that Crown then not exceeding ten millions of Florens.</p>
            <p>But of late, the <hi>French</hi> King is tapred up to that magnitude of Power, ſo potent in the beſt Squadrons of Ships at Sea, ſo powerful in the moſt experienced Captains and Troops at Land, ſo rich in Treaſure, (the Revenues of the preſent King amounting unto ſixty millions of Florens yearly) that <hi>Europe</hi> begins to bow to his Power; and to declare unto all Chriſtian
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61244:3"/>
Princes what he intends, he hath taken to himſelf this Motto, <hi>Solus contra omnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Deſigns are ſo vaſt, that in ſome ſhort time all <hi>Europe</hi> will not be Elbow-room for his Ambition.</p>
            <p>How <hi>France</hi> hath of late arrived to this Power, and Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid of Grandeur, it's well becoming the wiſdom of the moſt conſiderate perſon to enquire.</p>
            <p>It's not from the richneſs of their Soyl, nor the amplitude of Territory, (<hi>Spain</hi> having much greater.) <hi>France</hi> hath no Mines of Gold or Silver as <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> nor other rich Mines as <hi>Germany</hi> and other places have, yet by their natural and artificial Commodities, peradventure their ſtock of money doth not fall much ſhort of the money of the reſt of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Images of great things are beſt ſeen contracted into ſmall Glaſſes: By their Wines (the natural Riches of <hi>France</hi>) they draw out of the Northern Regions of <hi>Europe,</hi> twenty five millions of Florens; for Salt, ten millions of Florens; for Brandy, five millions; for Wines, Brandy and Salt, they year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhauſt from thence forty millions of Florens.</p>
            <p>For their Silks, Stuffs, Toys and Fripperies, (which are the artificial Riches of that Kingdom) they ſpirit out of thoſe Parts yearly forty millions of Florens; and there is not import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>France</hi> of the Commodities of all the North, ſo much as doth amount unto fifteen millions of Florens: So that <hi>France</hi> doth yearly drain out of the Northern Regions of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſixty five millions of Florens; the prodigious ſum of money which he doth yearly drain out of the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> is beyond my Arithmetick to tell you.</p>
            <p>But the moſt Chriſtian King being Lord of the Commerce of that Kingdom, and being ſtudious to accumulate money, and careful to bring in more daily, and rarely ſuffers any to go out, and being provident to diſpoſe of all his Merchandiſe and Manufactures abroad, and not permitting any foreign Commodities to be imported into <hi>France,</hi> but ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with ſuch great Duties, that they return to no profit to the Merchants, <hi>France</hi> will in a ſhort time draw into them all the moneys of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61244:3"/>The moſt Chriſtian King having for his Royal Revenue ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty millions of Florens yearly, and <hi>France</hi> being enriched year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as aboveſaid, and by his ſupream Power, without any check or control, may impoſe what Taxes and Impoſitions upon his people he ſhall pleaſe, (and they willingly ſubmit thereunto) he hath laid ſuch an inexhauſtable <hi>

                  </gap>dus</hi> of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to carry on his Deſigns, (he being very active and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect) that he can rarely be diſappointed or fail in any.</p>
            <p>By this all ſubmit to his Power: This makes the <hi>Ephemeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> by which he knows how all the Orbs of many Princes Courts move; by it he can work all things Platonically to his own Idea; to its ſplendor and luſtre, the World, the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Common-wealth, and the love of liberty, do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proſtrate themſelves; and to deal plainly with you, it's the ſource of all the miſeries and infelicities of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is that <hi>France</hi> not long ſince ſo impotent, can now maintain ſuch ſtupendious Forces, and can ſupport their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when other Princes are enforced to beg for peace, and disband their Armies, becauſe their Treaſures are exhauſted: <hi>France</hi> only after many years War can engage in a new War, and upon all occaſions, by reaſon of its money, have inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to execute their Deſigns; and truly, Sir, money is the <hi>primum mobile</hi> which moves the Sphears, which are the hearts and hands of men, and it's the ſoveraign Cordial, which gives life to all noble Actions and Deſigns.</p>
            <p>The moſt Chriſtian King hath ſet up the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Trades, and hath engaged in them moſt of the rich Nobility and Gentry of that Kingdom, and hath armed them with ample Priviledges, Powers and Immunities, and hath erected ſeveral other trading Companies, and certainly he hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by laid a foundation of a greater Empire than ever was in <hi>Charlemain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By his Moneys and Priviledges he draweth moſt of the beſt Workmen and Artiſts, out of the other parts of <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and the Materials too; when they are there manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured, they make a <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and ſend them into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries from whence they came: But if any from thence be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61244:4"/>
into <hi>France,</hi> they are ſeized upon, being forbidden Goods, as they pretend, or elſe ſo incumbred with Duties by them, that <hi>Europe</hi> can have no profit or encouragement to trade with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe Arts, <hi>France</hi> with its Manufactures and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and thoſe which will be drawn from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> will ſurcharge all the Marts of <hi>Europe</hi>; and the moſt Chriſtian King having ſo great a Treaſure, may under-ſell his Merchandiſe and Goods, on deſign to break all other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Traders, and ſo in conſequence will have the Trade and Commerce of the Univerſe in their hands, and we muſt be content to take their Commodities and Merchandiſes at ſuch prices and rates, as they ſhall pleaſe to impoſe upon them.</p>
            <p>And all other Princes and States muſt become Higlers and petty Chapmen under them.</p>
            <p>Trade is the true and intrinſick Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it cannot ſubſiſt: From Trade there doth not only ariſe Riches to the Subjects, rendring a Nation conſiderable, but alſo increaſe of Revenue, and therein power and ſtrength to the Soveraign; and <hi>England</hi> having ſo potent a Neighbour, it's abſolutely neceſſary for its preſervation to advance it; for every Nation is more or leſs conſiderable, according to the proportion it hath of Trade, and it's more or leſs enriched by the ballance of its foreign Trade. If <hi>France</hi> vent more of our Commodities than we conſume of theirs in value, the overplus returns to us in Treaſure; but if <hi>France</hi> conſume leſs of ours than we of their Commodities, <hi>England</hi> will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed; for that Treaſure which is brought in by the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of our foreign Trade doth only enrich us.</p>
            <p>How the balance of Trade ſtands between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> it's worthy of your grave Conſideration.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King not long ſince having a deſign to prohibit all Trade with <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Merchants not well reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, petitioned his Majeſty to the contrary, and delivered a Certificate unto the moſt Chriſtian King, of all the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities by them exported, and of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures and Commodities by them imported into <hi>France,</hi> which was as followeth.</p>

            <p>In Saffron, Caſtle-Soap, Honey, Almonds, Olives, Capers, Prunes, and ſuch like, above one hundred and fifty thouſand pounds a year.</p>
            <p>Beſides five or ſix hundred Veſſels of Salt, laden at <hi>Marone, Rochel, Borage,</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Oloron,</hi> and Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> of a very great value.</p>
            <p>So that by this it doth appear, that the yearly value of ſuch Commodities as are tranſported from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> amount unto above ſix and twenty hundred thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>And the Commodities exported out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> conſiſting chiefly of woollen Cloaths, Serges, knit Stockings, Lead, Pewter, Allum, Coals, and other Commodities, which do not amount unto above ten hundred thouſand pounds a year.</p>
            <p>By which it appears, that our Trade with <hi>France,</hi> is at leaſt ſixteen hundred thouſand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> clear loſs to this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French.</hi> King hereupon laid aſide his Deſign: So that in few years (if ſome timely Expedient be not applied) all the money of this Nation will be drawn into <hi>France,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not above eight millions (if ſo much) of pounds in this Kingdom, which will be the impoveriſhing of <hi>England,</hi> but greatly to the enriching of <hi>France</hi>; and they melting down the Coyn of <hi>England,</hi> by their allay gain near one third.</p>
            <p>

            <p>As the middle Region of the Air is wont to frame its Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolts,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61244:5"/>
Hail, and dreadful Thunder, againſt the Earth, out of the Exhalations, it draws from the Earth it ſelf; ſo <hi>France,</hi> out of the Riches and Subſtance which it gathereth from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and the Kingdoms and Dominions thereof, doth raiſe formidable Armies, and potent Fleets againſt them.</p>
            <p>New Maxims muſt be framed, and Meaſures taken, for the retrenchment of the Power of <hi>France,</hi> or elſe I can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, without the help of an <hi>Augur,</hi> what will be the Fate of <hi>England.</hi> Enfeeble the Trade of <hi>France,</hi> and money will fail, and by conſequence its potency will become impotent; for Trade is the fountain from whence its Riches ſpring, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is the baſis of its greatneſs and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>The Parliament with great wiſdom and judgement, hath prohibited <hi>England</hi> all Trade or Commerce with <hi>France</hi>; and <hi>France</hi> cannot take it ill, when the moſt Chriſtian King had the ſame deſign upon <hi>England,</hi> but that he obſerved it would turn to loſs: It's no prudence to admit thoſe Manufactures and Commodities into <hi>England,</hi> wherewith we now abound, or may have better than from <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And no reaſon of Commerce requireth, that we ſhould be injurious to our ſelves, to be ſerviceable to the advantages of others; the Emperor by Edict doth exclude the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Wines, and many other things of the growth of that Kingdom, out of <hi>Austria,</hi> that they of <hi>Auſtria</hi> may conſume and diſpoſe of their own.</p>
            <p>And as for Wines, <hi>England</hi> may have them from <hi>Hungary, Austria, Tirol, Franconia, Rhene, Moſel, Portugal,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, at better rates and cheaper, than out of <hi>France</hi>; and the Princes of thoſe Countries will take off the Manufactures and native Commodities of <hi>England</hi> for them, and by that means we may ſettle Trade upon a ſolid Baſis with them.</p>
            <p>How far theſe generous Wines do exceed thoſe of <hi>France, Auguſtus</hi> the Emperor, if he were alive, would tell you, who when he poſſeſſed <hi>Italy, Spain, Creta, Greece, Egypt,</hi> and the richeſt parts of <hi>Africa, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> he would drink no other Wines; for theſe receive eſteem, dignity and value from their age and antiquity, and contribute much to health, (if moderately taken;) whereas the <hi>French</hi> Wines procure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61244:6"/>
but ſharp and tartarous humours, and as now adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>France,</hi> they are pernicious unto us: The Wines of <hi>France,</hi> if compared with the other, are inſipid, and of no value; all the Wines of <hi>France</hi> from their nativity, will ſcarce bear the age of one year, and ſome of them before the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the ſame year in which they grew, are corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; from whence it followeth, that they muſt be drunk cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted or new, in both caſes dangerous to our health.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brandy</hi> is a Liquor very fatal to us, and it had been well for <hi>England</hi> if we never had heard of it; yet if we do ſo much admire it, though we have no Grapes here, yet it may be drawn off from Corn, and there is no better than that which is ſo drawn in <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> and drunk by the <hi>Poles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Salt, if the making of it were encouraged, there might be made much better here in <hi>England</hi> than we have from <hi>France.</hi> That worthy and publick-ſpirited Perſon <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Alcorn</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> by his Salt-works near <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent preſident for the whole Nation: The Salt of <hi>France</hi> is groſs, foul, black, corroſive, and by no means to be compared with that of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you take two Veſſels of equal magnitude, and fill the one with <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the other with <hi>French</hi> Salt, and decoct them, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> decreaſeth leſs by one third part than the <hi>French</hi>; if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Salt be recocted, and a requiſite quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Sea-water added, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Salt doth increaſe one third more than the <hi>French</hi>; what great loſs by one, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the other, doth accrew, is worthy of due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Salt by reaſon of its purity and extraordinary efficacy, cures Fiſh or Fleſh better, goes further in uſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves longer than any unrefined Salt; the Fiſh or Fleſh ſaved with it, is much more wholeſom to the body, pleaſant and grateful to the taſte, which is the reaſon that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have better prices for their Fiſh than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and a greater Trade, becauſe they are cured with refined Salt. It will be of ſingular uſe in hot Climates, becauſe it pierceth ſo much quicker than Salt unrefined, and corned by the Sun, and will by conſequence preſerve either Fiſh or Fleſh better and longer;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61244:6"/>
whereas the unrefined Salt in hot Climates, by reaſon of its corroding quality, doth decay very ſuddenly either Fiſh or Fleſh, and in any Climate robs the Fleſh of its gravy and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, makes it dry and hard, and ſo prejudicial to the body. The great benefit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Salt in curing Fiſh, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Royal Fiſhery can give a very great account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: To give encouragement to the making of Salt here in <hi>England,</hi> (which they may do, not only to ſerve <hi>England</hi> with Salt, but in the <hi>Baltick, Weſt-Indies,</hi> and elſewhere) is to impoſe ſome great Duty upon foreign Salt, which will increaſe his Majeſties Revenue, if they ſhall continue to bring it into this Kingdom, and to impoſe half ſo much upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Salt, as ſhall be impoſed upon the foreign, which the makers of Salt are willing to pay, becauſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Salt (by reaſon of the great quantities of foreign Salt imported in ſome parts of this Kingdom) is ſold at ſix pence <hi>per</hi> Buſhel, whereas formerly it hath been ſold at four ſhillings <hi>per</hi> Buſhel.</p>
            <p>It will much increaſe home-Trade, by cauſing great ſums of money to circulate; it will give imployment to many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which now beg, ſteal, or otherwiſe live in a miſerable and poor condition.</p>
            <p>It will very much increaſe Navigation, by imploying great numbers of Veſſels to bring Coals to the Salt-works, and to carry Salt to Markets; whereas foreign Salt is imported by return of freight or foreign Veſſels.</p>
            <p>The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> did for ſome time by publick Edict, prohibit all Wines, Salt and Brandy, and the Manufactures of <hi>France,</hi> as foreign Commodities, and not for them needful.</p>
            <p>If the Emperor and other Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> by their prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Sanctions, had done the like, <hi>France</hi> would have loſt thoſe prodigious and vaſt ſums of money, which, to the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhing of many parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> it hath drawn into them; thereupon their Trade would have decayed, their Money failed, and by conſequence their Power would have aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Their Wines, Brandy, Salt, and other their Manufactures, would have layn upon their hands, their people, for want of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61244:7"/>
imployment, muſt have begged, and then if his moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Majeſty ſhould have continued Taxes upon them, it would have hazarded their obedience; and certainly nothing hath hitherto kept that people within the circle of their duty, but the great encouragement the moſt Chriſtian King hath given to Trade, for thereby they are imployed, and their thoughts taken off from breaking out into any Action or Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>All <hi>French</hi> wrought, figured, flowred, braſſed, ſtitched, ſtripe Silks and Drogets, Tamines and Eſtimens, Serges, and other Stuffs made of Wooll, together with Madam la Mode, being proſcribed <hi>England,</hi> all due encouragement muſt be given to the Weavers. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have arrived to a very great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in weaving of Silks, and other Stuffs made of Wooll; but by reaſon of the Importation of <hi>French</hi> Commodities, they have (for want of imployment) been burthenſom and chargeable to their reſpective Pariſhes; and many Strangers, which have come into <hi>England</hi> to work here, by reaſon they found ſo little imployment, they returned into their own Countries again: It will be prudence in us to encourage Strangers to work here, but not to give countenance to foreign Traders.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have paid yearly for the manufacturing of the <hi>French</hi> Weavers Silks, beſides Stuffs, which might have been better wrought by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> here, and which are generally paid for with money, not with other Commodities, the ſum of five hundred four thouſand one hundred and ten pounds: So that allowing to every perſon working Silk, fifteen pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> it would imploy 33000 perſons, which number were they well imployed here, would be conſiderably advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to this Kingdom; and it's evident, that <hi>England</hi> hath hitherto maintained the <hi>French</hi> King's Subjects at work, whilſt the Natives here have been ready to ſtarve for want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>It's great prudence in the Parliament, that they have abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely proſcribed all theſe <hi>French</hi> Commodities and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and not to impoſe ſome great Duty upon them, as ſome deſigned, becauſe much of the <hi>French</hi> Commodities (by ſmall Ships or Shallops) are privately conveyed hither, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61244:7"/>
out paying any Cuſtom: It's demonſtratively true, that not one piece in twenty is entred or paid for, to the deceit of his Majeſtn, and the impoveriſhing of his good Subjects here.</p>
            <p>The Woollen Drapery, which formerly was our glory, and brought much Riches to us, and imployed not fewer than 700000 perſons, muſt be encouraged: It's to be feared, that of late not one third part of the Wooll which is growing in this Nation, is conſumed in that Manufacture; but it's ſent over to our Neighbours, and they buying moſt of the Wooll growing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they have almoſt gotten the Manufacture from us, and we undone, the prices of Wooll being ſo low, (the Manufacture failing) that if people did not ſend it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Seas, they would not in many places be able to pay half their Rent, Wooll falling in value as much as Land.</p>
            <p>It was an obſervation of the Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> that if Wooll fell one ſhilling in the Stone, it's a million a year loſs to this Nation. If this obſervation be true, I pray Sir conſider, how many millions this Nation hath loſt, and how much we may ſuffer, e're we can recover our Manufacture and Trade again.</p>
            <p>Till the 5th. of <hi>Edward</hi> the III. moſt of the Wooll which was growing in <hi>England,</hi> was ſent over into <hi>Flanders, Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolt</hi> and <hi>Artoys,</hi> to be draped into Stuff, Cloth, and Stockings; <hi>Edward</hi> the III. looking upon it as a great loſs to this Nation, brought over 70 Families of <hi>Walloons</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and they did teach the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the Manufacture of the woollen Drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; an advantage ſo great to this Nation, that none of his Predeceſſors did ever effect any thing to compare with it, and what Riches it brought to us, we can tell you by the ſad loſs of it.</p>
            <p>The late Statute, which by the great Wiſdom of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was enacted for burying in Flannel, if it be rationally conſidered, and duely put in execution, and Informers encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, is great in conſequence, and will conſume much of our Wooll, and preſerve the linnen Cloth for making of Paper, which will ſave this Nation ſome hundred thouſand pounds a year.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61244:8"/>Thoſe Artiſts in <hi>Flanders</hi> which are ſo excellent in working Tapiſtry and other Hangings, are much deſired by the <hi>French</hi> King to come into <hi>France,</hi> and inhabit there; but he hath not prevailed with them; if they might receive countenance from <hi>England,</hi> I doubt not but many of them would come over, and inhabit here, which would be a great enriching of this Nation, and would imploy in that Manufacture, ſome great part of the ſtock of Wooll of this Nation.</p>
            <p>For want of Imployment, many of our Weavers go over into <hi>France,</hi> to whom that King gives great priviledges and countenance; their Friends here ſend them over Wooll, and the Manufacture in a little time will follow after.</p>
            <p>The linnen Drapery would be of great advantage to this Nation, if it received due encouragement; no Nation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth better Hemp and Flax than <hi>England,</hi> the ſowing of which would be a great improvement; and if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were enjoyned by Act of Parliament, under ſome penalty, (and a conſiderable part of that penalty given to the Informer) to ſowe yearly ſo many Acres of Hemp and Flax, in proportion to the Land they occupy, it would return to great profit. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have found out the beſt means, not heretofore practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for the dreſſing and preparing of Hemp and Flax; and there are many perſons living in <hi>Cambray, Vallentine,</hi> and other parts in <hi>France,</hi> which would come over and live here, if they might be encouraged; and then we might here in <hi>England</hi> make Hollands, Diapers, Damasks, and other fine Cloth, not only to furniſh this Nation, but other parts of the World; and would likewiſe draw to us the Manufactures of making the <hi>French</hi> Sail-Cloaths, and all kind of Tackling concerning Ships, in ſmall and big Cordage, Twine, Yarn, Thread, Nets, Cable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropes, which would enrich this Nation yearly at the leaſt 900000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be a great inſtance of Wiſdom, to ſet up the Royal Fiſhery here in <hi>England,</hi> and to countenance it with Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Immunities; certainly, Sir, it's ſo neceſſary, that without it his Majeſty will want Sea-men for his Royal Navy; for his Majeſty muſt ſo increaſe his Royal Power, that he be ſuperior to neighbour Princes and States, or elſe I can eaſily foretel what will be the Fate of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61244:8"/>This being eſtabliſhed, the making of Sail-Cloaths, Ropes, Tackle, Nets, Cables, and alſo Salt, which are the neceſſary attendants upon the Fiſhery, would be much encouraged.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, you muſt not expect that the Fiſhery is to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by any private perſons; it muſt be the publick Act of the State, the Laws, Powers, and management thereof, muſt be ſettled by Act of Parliament, a good <hi>Fundus</hi> and Bank of Money muſt be raiſed for its advance and encouragement, otherwiſe it will return to no account, and every ſmall loſs which ſhall fall upon it, will be the overthrow and diſſolution of the whole, as it hath been heretofore found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>The Company of the Royal Fiſhery being well eſtabliſhed, and taking their meaſures rightly, it will in a ſhort time ſo increaſe in Riches, that upon any exigency of State, it will be able to advance conſiderable ſums of money for the ſervice of the Publick; all perſons which have money will place it in this Company, if they might be ſure to have the product and effects of it, being the beſt means for Fathers to raiſe Portions for their Children, and all other perſons to improve their Eſtates, and enrich themſelves.</p>
            <p>It will be the only means to make the Subject rich, by the circulation of Money; for a Nation may be rich in Coin, and yet the people poor, when it's gotten into few hands; and that State is in no thriving condition, when at the end of the Game, moſt of the money is in the Box; and I muſt tell you, the Treaſures of Princes are then greateſt, not when their own Coffers are full only, but their Subjects rich.</p>
            <p>For the raiſing of a ſufficient <hi>Fundus</hi> to carry on the Fiſhery, if the Wiſdom of this Nation ſhall think fit to lay one ſhilling, or ſome ſuch ſum, upon every Chaldron of Coals, it would much advance it; and it's but reaſonable, that the advantage and benefit being general, that the charge ſhould be ſo too; and methinks (but I humbly ſubmit to more advanced judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) that if <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> each of them built a good ſquadron of ſtout men of War, and maintained them at their own charges, they would be able to juſtifie the Fiſhery againſt thoſe who durſt invade it, and fiſh without licence from his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61244:9"/>
Majeſty, or paying tribute, as formerly hath been uſed and practiſed; it would anſwer all their charges; and in caſe of a rupture with any Prince or State, thoſe ſquadrons would be a great acceſs of Power to his Majeſty, howſoever, thoſe Seas being well guarded, are the Lock and Key of Trade.</p>
            <p>Look upon all the maritine Counties in <hi>England,</hi> and that County which hath ten Ports or more in it, there are not above one or two, if ſo many, which have any Trade conſiderable, or have any Ships belonging to them, but the Havens and Ports are decayed, the People in thoſe Towns few, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately poor; whereas if the Fiſhery were eſtabliſhed, the Port Towns through the Nation would be the richeſt, and beſt ſtocked with people, which would be the ſtrength and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Nation againſt all Invaſions, and would be a great enrichment to the whole Countrey, becauſe they might ſell and put off their Commodities ſo near, and to beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Kings which formerly never fiſhed upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, but by ſpecial leave from the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and not otherwiſe, and that with a ſet and limited number of Boats, and that for their own Family, and likewiſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Laws and Orders of his own Fiſhermen; for breach whereof divers of their Subjects have forfeited their Veſſels, and their perſons have been ſeized and impriſoned in <hi>Dover</hi>-Caſtle. But of late the <hi>French</hi> are become ſo vexatious to us, that they have given a diſturbance to us, not only upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, but at <hi>New-found-Land</hi>; it's the intereſt of this Nation to give an interruption to their fiſhing there, and to prohibit them for the future; for the fiſhing there, is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary and Nurſery of their Sea-men, which may for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prove fatal to us.</p>
            <p>By the fiſhing of the <hi>French</hi> and of other Foreigners upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Sea, the Cuſtoms and Tolls which are undoubtedly due to his Majeſty, together with the increaſe of Trade, and conſequently of Cuſtoms thereby, are unjuſtly uſurped by them, whereby this Kingdom loſeth that which they gain, which is increaſe of Trade, of Ships, and Mariners, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Navigation is wonderfully ſtrengthned, their Mariners multiplied, and their Trade increaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61244:9"/>The Fiſhery being ſet up, Trade will flouriſh, the King's Revenue augmented, Lands and Rents improved, Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on increaſed, and it will imploy ſome hundred thouſands of men by Sea and Land, it will eaſe the Publick of great charges, in giving imployment to their poor: <hi>Henry</hi> the Great of <hi>France</hi> cauſed all vagrants and idle perſons to be ſent to ſerve in his Gallies, to oblige them <hi>per</hi> force to work; for idle perſons who take not care to imploy themſelves ſeriouſly in ſome thing, are unprofitable to themſelves, and pernicious to the Publick: Therefore that State muſt neceſſarily be rich and proſperous, which hath <hi>Argus</hi> eyes to foreſee advantages, and <hi>Briareus</hi> hands, and thoſe imployed.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, becauſe great Trades cannot be managed, or things effected, without multitude of people, it would be prudence to invite Foreigners into this Nation, and to live here under ſuch qualifications, as the Wiſdom of the Nation ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>A ſmall Countrey well peopled, will be able to effect things of more advantage and grandeur, than a great Dominion ill ſtocked.</p>
            <p>The ancient <hi>Romans</hi> finding nothing was more neceſſary for great and important. Enterprizes, than multitude of men, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their care and ſtudy to increaſe their numbers by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, Colonies, and ſuch like helps, making their conquered Armies free Denizens of their Common-wealth, by which means the number of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens became ſo great, that <hi>Rome</hi> could not be ruined, in <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s judgement, by any force but her own; and this did ſo much contribute to the agrandizing of her, that that City only could arm ſix hundred and forty thouſand men, when <hi>Sparta</hi> could never exceed twenty thouſand, for that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had inhibited the acceſs of Strangers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſeus</hi> to engreaten and enrich the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> invited as many as would come and dwell there, aſſuring them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſelf-ſame Liberties and Priviledges, which the very Citizens themſelves had.</p>
            <p>And we ſee the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which are not bigger than <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> one County in <hi>England,</hi> by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61244:10"/>
their denizations and fair uſage to Strangers, have ſo enriched and be-peopled that Countrey, that they have put to Sea more Ships, and driven a greater merchantile Trade to all parts of the World, than moſt of the Kings or Princes in <hi>Europe; England</hi> cometh ſo ſhort in number of people from <hi>Holland,</hi> that whereas they are calculated to have ſix perſons for one Acre of ground, <hi>England</hi> (I fear) hath hardly one for ten.</p>
            <p>Howſoever I cannot obſerve, that it doth any ways com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with the intereſt of State, to ſuffer ſuch multitudes of people to paſs out of his Majeſties Kingdoms into other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Dominions, or the Weſtern Plantations, thereby to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſh our ſelves of people; the ſad conſequences and effects whereof, are too viſible in the misfortunes of <hi>Spain.</hi>

            <p>For ſince thoſe Plantations by that King made in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and all along the Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> and thoſe great Garriſons maintained in <hi>Milan, Naples, Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> conſiſting for the moſt part of natural <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they have ſo exhauſted them of men, that <hi>John</hi> the firſt of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> who reigned before the ſeveral Plantations of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was able to raiſe 40000 men for the War of <hi>Africk,</hi> whereas <hi>Emanuel</hi> who lived after thoſe undertakings, had much ado to raiſe 20000 Foot and 3000 Horſe on the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; and <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> after that found as great difficulty to raiſe an Army of 12000 men.</p>
            <p>And whether this may not be our ſad fate, if not timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, it's well becoming your great Judgement to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>And I can eaſily believe, that 1000 years ſince this Nation had much a greater ſtock of people than now it hath; for the <hi>Rome</hi>-ſcot or <hi>Peter</hi>-pence, which was but one penny a Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, (granted by <hi>Offa</hi> and <hi>Ina, Saxon</hi> Kings to the Pope) did amount unto 50000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly; and the Hearth money, which is two ſhillings the Hearth, (and one Chimney may have many Hearths) doth not amount unto 300000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly; whereas if the number of Chimneys charged with the <hi>Rome</hi>-ſcot, had been two ſhillings a Chimney, it would have amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly: So that we may conclude, there
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61244:10"/>
were then more Buildings and Chimneys, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence more People.</p>
            <p>But where a Kingdom hath a great ſtock of People in it, it will be the teſt of Prudence in that State, not to ſuffer any City or Town in it too much to agrandize it ſelf, or to attain to that magnitude, thereby to impoveriſh the other parts of the Kingdom; for certainly the over-growth of any one great City, is of dangerous conſequence, not only in regard of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſuch multitudes of mouths being not eaſily to be fed, but in reſpect of the great danger of Inſurrections, if once thoſe multitudes, ſenſible of their own ſtrength, oppreſſed with want, or otherwiſe diſtempered with Famine, faction, or Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſhould gather to a head, and break out into Action.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> like a wiſe Prince, made it his work to hinder the growth of <hi>Rome,</hi> abrogating all Laws, by which the Allies and Confederates of that State were made free Denizens of that City, for that he conceived to be a way to draw the whole Empire into one City, and by the prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous increaſe of that to make poor the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Naples</hi> by reaſon of its ſituation had advanced it ſelf to an immenſe grandeur by Buildings, if the King by his Edict had not forbidden it, and this he did partly at the perſwaſion of his Nobles, who feared if ſuch a reſtraint was not had, their Vaſſals would forſake the Countrey to inhabit there, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally upon jealouſie, and point of State, the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all revolts and mutinies, which in moſt populous Cities are of greateſt danger; for as they are proneſt unto Factions and Seditions, ſo is the conſequence fatal both in it ſelf and the example.</p>
            <p>Certainly, Sir, too great a City in a Nation, is like a bad Spleen in the Body natural, which ſwells ſo big, as it makes all the other parts of the Body lean.</p>
            <p>And to deal plainly with you, a great City is the fitteſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to turn an old Monarchy into a new Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſome conſiderate perſons have conceived, that it would be more Prudence for a State to have three great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in it of equal power, that in caſe one ſhould rebel, the other two might ballance, and give Law to the third.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61244:11"/>And I pray, Sir, let me tell you, if you invite Strangers into this Nation, if you do not give them encouragement, I doubt whether they will come; for the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to enrich the City of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and other Cities in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and traffick of this Nation with them, freed us from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Impoſitions, which his own natural Subjects uſually paid.</p>
            <p>And indeed if the Cuſtoms even as to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſomewhat abated, it would much advance Trade.</p>
            <p>I do not ſpeak this to leſſen his Majeſties Revenue, (for I heartily wiſh it were more than it is) yet I think his Majeſty would be no loſer thereby; for a ſmall Cuſtom upon a great Trade, would anſwer a great Cuſtom upon a ſmall Trade; and it's more prudence to take little out of much, than much out of little: Where the Cuſtoms upon Merchants Goods are ſmall, it eaſily draweth all Nations to trade with them, but where great Impoſitions are laid, the Traffick of that place will ſoon decay.</p>
            <p>Two Ships laden at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> of equal Burden, <hi>viz.</hi> of 300 Tuns; the one goeth for <hi>England,</hi> the other for <hi>Holland</hi>; that which cometh into <hi>England,</hi> payeth for Cuſtom, Price-edge, Butler-edge, and other Charges thereon, by Book of Rates, 1200 <hi>l.</hi> and upwards, before ſhe be diſcharged; and the other going for <hi>Holland,</hi> is diſcharged for 60 <hi>l.</hi> ſterling, or thereabouts; and after the Duties paid, and Wine ſold, the buyer may tranſport them into any Countrey; but in <hi>England</hi> they cannot be tranſported, but the Merchant muſt be a great loſer by them; for the <hi>Hollander</hi> can ſtill under-ſell him, and be a gainer thereby.</p>
            <p>It would greatly advance the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> if by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> all perſons of Honour and Quality, (only ſuch perſons as attend his Majeſty, and the Courts of Juſtice, or ſuch as ſhould have his Majeſties ſpecial Licence excepted) to live upon their Eſtates in the Countrey, and not to reſide here conſtantly in Town; for thereby all their Rents are drawn up hither, where they are vainly ſpent, to ſay no worſe, to the impoveriſhing of the Countrey, decay of their Tenants, and ſubverſion of their Families: Here they change their old Seats
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61244:11"/>
and Caſtles, (the illuſtrious monuments of their Honour) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to new Coaches and Trains; ſome of them carry their Mills in their heads, and their Retinue their Woods and Lands on their backs.</p>
            <p>Sir, I pray conſult the Speech and Proclamation of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> of his Age, King <hi>James</hi>; he was very earneſt with the Nobility and Gentlemen to live in their Countrey-houſes, and not in <hi>London,</hi> and would often ſay, that Gentlemen in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> are like Ships in the Sea, which ſhew like nothing, but in Countrey-Villages, they are like Ships in the River, which look like great things: And by the Edict of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great of <hi>France,</hi> made 1598. after the Peace of <hi>Vermin,</hi> the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Gentry were commanded to go and live every man upon his own Eſtate, improve their Lands, and take care for the well-government and peace of their Countrey. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons living here in luxury, they are become ſo effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and degenerated from the true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gallantry, and ſo little known to their Tenants, (but by their oppreſſion, and exacting of their Rents) that if there ſhould be any diſturbance in their Countrey, they are of no more uſe, than a Sun-Dial in the Grave; nay, many of them are ſo unfit to ſerve their King and Countrey, that if there ſhould be any diſquiet, their preſence there would prove but as Oyl to the Fire, only to inflame it.</p>
            <p>Sir, There is one thing more, which would reſtore the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prudence of this Nation, and add much Honour to you, and that is, to eſtabliſh ſumptuary Laws amongſt us, as to Apparel, and ſuperfluous Expences, according to the ſeveral degrees and qualities of perſons, which would in a ſhort time recover this Nation; which is no other than a wiſe and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable parſimony, which the <hi>Romans</hi> and other well-governed States have uſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> inforced the <hi>Romans</hi> to yield an account of their Lives; a courſe full of health and wiſdom in a State, idleneſs being the root of all private vices, and publick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.</p>
            <p>I cannot but commend the laudable Practice of the Great Duke of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> who doth conſtantly preſcribe what Habit his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61244:12"/>
People ſhall wear, for matter and faſhion, ſuitable to their condition.</p>
            <p>That wiſe Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the III. in the ninth, and one and thirtieth year of his Reign, cauſed ſumptuary Laws to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, to prevent riot and exceſs, (the hectick Feaver of a State) both for Apparel and Diet, appointing every degree of Men, from the meaneſt Subject to the Prince, the Stuff and Habits they ſhould wear, prohibiting the adornments of Gold and Silver, Silks and rich Furs, to all, excepting emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perſons, whereby foreign Superfluities were ſhut out, and home Commodities only uſed. By this means theſe ſpreading Evils, which have ſince dif-faſhioned and effeminated the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, were prohibited.</p>
            <p>Yet with ſubmiſſion to your great Judgement, I think the vanity of the exceſs of Apparel may be permitted under theſe reſtrictions: Firſt, So as the expence doth not depend on ſuch Commodities, as have too much of the ſubſtance of Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or Silk, whereby the publick Treaſure is waſted. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That we impoveriſh not our ſelves to inrich Strangers, by preferring foreign Commodities, though worſe, before our own, which are better. Thirdly, That the exceſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence conſiſt chiefly in the Art, Manufacture, and Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Commodities made in our own Countrey, whereby Ingenuity would be encouraged, the People imployed, and our Treaſure kept at home, ſo as the Prince would be nothing damnified by the exceſs; for the ruine of one would raiſe as much another of his Subjects, and Money would be more moving, which would be a great ſatisfaction to the People; and peradventure the conceit of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> may have ſome truth in it, that the exceſs and luxury of the Nobility, makes much for the Princes advantage, and renders his State more ſecure, becauſe thoſe which are given to rioting and luxury, are never gatherers and hoarders up of vaſt ſums of money, which may prove the Inſtruments of Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Then, Sir, all the Vanities, Toys, and Fripperies, which <hi>Madam la Mode</hi> ſhall bring us, will be laid aſide.</p>
            <p>For want of ſuch a Law, our Servants here imitating their Maſters and Miſtreſſes, muſt go very gay, and to ſupport that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61244:12"/>
vanity, demand three times more Wages than formerly, though they perform ten times leſs ſervice, which is a great infelicity amongſt us, and will lay a foundation of our ruine, if not timely prevented.</p>
            <p>Certainly, Sir, <hi>England</hi> by reaſon of its ſcituation, many ſafe Ports and Harbours, the richneſs of the Countrey in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for Manufactures, if it were fully peopled, (and theſe induſtrious, and take their meaſures rightly) might exerciſe the greateſt Merchantile Trade, and grow the richeſt People, in the Univerſe; for where the People are many, and the Arts good, there the Traffick muſt be great, and the Countrey rich.</p>
            <p>It would be a great means to inrich this Nation by Trade, to increaſe the Exportation of our Commodities, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the conſumption of foreign Wares; for that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth that exceſſively ſpendeth the foreign Commodities dear, and uttereth the native fewer and cheaper, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich other Common-wealths, but beggar it ſelf; whereas if it vented fewer of the foreign, and more of the native, the reſidue muſt return in Treaſure; when foreign Materials are but Superfluities, foreign Manufactures muſt be prohibited, for that will either baniſh the Superfluity, or gain the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture.</p>
            <p>The conſumption of our own Commodities muſt be frugal, for it will advance much yearly to be exported unto Strangers; if in our Cloaths we will be rich, let it be done with our own Manufactures and Materials, ſo the exceſs of the rich will be the imployment of the poor.</p>
            <p>Trades in remote Parts or Countreys, as <hi>Turkey,</hi> the <hi>Indies,</hi> ought to be encouraged, becauſe of their great increaſe of Shipping and Mariners thereby, and becauſe they return to more profit than thoſe at hand.</p>
            <p>All Commodities manufactured here in <hi>England,</hi> are to be made without deceit, which will give a value to them; and they are ſo to be ordered, that they may be ſold as cheap as poſſibly we can; for it's found by experience, that we being able to ſell our Cloth in <hi>Turkey</hi> cheaper than the <hi>Venetians,</hi> we have thereby yearly increaſed the vent thereof, and the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61244:13"/>
have loſt as much of their utterance in thoſe Countreys, becauſe it's dearer.</p>
            <p>It's his Majeſties undoubted Intereſt to promote Trade, by removing all obſtructions, and giving it all encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It would be much for the advance of Trade, (but I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmit to the ſupream Authority) that all Manufactures made in <hi>England</hi> of foreign Materials, might be exported with a ſmall Cuſtom, as all manner of wrought Silks, becauſe it would imploy many poor People, and cauſe more Materials to be brought in, to the increaſe of his Majeſties Revenue, and of Trade, and the Manufacture would much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in <hi>England,</hi> and decreaſe in <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>Native Commodities would not be charged with over-great Cuſtoms, and foreign Wares brought into <hi>England</hi> to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported again, are to be favoured, otherwiſe this manner of Trading cannot proſper or ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>The manufacturing of any Commodity, doth redound more to the profit of the Common-wealth, than the Commodity it ſelf, therefore it ought to be favoured; and the <hi>Italians</hi> get more Money by manufacturing of the raw Silks of <hi>Sicily,</hi> than the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Subjects have by the Silk it ſelf; and there is five times more profit by the manufacturing of Wooll, than by the Wooll it ſelf; compare the Wooll of <hi>England</hi> with its Cloth.</p>
            <p>It would much advance Trade, to make the transferring of Bills of Debt valid in Law, becauſe it would be a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Traders, (eſpecially to young men, of ſmall ſtocks) to be able to ſupply themſelves with Money, by the ſale of their own Bills of Debt.</p>
            <p>To conſtitute a Court-Merchant after the example of <hi>France,</hi> and other Countreys, to prevent tedious and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Suits in Law, taking men off from their Trade and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would much promote Trade.</p>
            <p>Free Ports (if the Wiſdom of the Nation ſhall think fit) would be of great conſequence, as to improvement of Trade: Giving to Strangers as well as Natives, (upon payment of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61244:13"/>
ſmall Duties) liberty to keep Magazines, and Staples o<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, ready for tranſportation to other Countreys, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to encouragement of Markets abroad, they will much increaſe Trade, Navigation and Riches to <hi>England,</hi> as appears not only by <hi>Holland,</hi> which is a Common-wealth, but alſo by St. <hi>Mallows,</hi> under the Monarchy of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Legorn,</hi> under that of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>; the firſt for its bigneſs, and containing above thirty ſix Acres, being the richeſt City in <hi>France</hi>; the other, all the Cities in that Princes Dominions not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with it.</p>
            <p>Theſe being obſerved, <hi>France</hi> may be compared to a man graſping a handful of fine Sand, (in hopes to keep it) if he holds it too looſe, it runs from him; if hard, but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains; which agreeth with the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, <hi>Chy trappo abbraccia, poco ſtringe,</hi> He who graſpeth too much, retains too little.</p>
            <p>But you have been pleaſed to ſay, That I have no kindneſs for <hi>France</hi>: Sir, I do aſſure you, I have that Honour for the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> and Kindneſs for <hi>France,</hi> that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is but one King in it, I wiſh that there were twenty.</p>
            <p>The Conſequences whereof, and the Advantages which will thereby accrew to <hi>England,</hi> are as follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Power of <hi>France</hi> will be retrenched; for take away the Sinew of War, and you abate its Potency.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The value of Land will ariſe to thirty years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, whereas now it will give with much difficulty fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the Woollen Drapery ſo many perſons will be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we ſhall not only conſume the Wooll growing in <hi>England,</hi> but that of <hi>Ireland</hi> too, and ſo by conſequence we muſt drive the Trade of the World, as to that Manufacture, and have our own prices for them; and our Neighbours being not ſupplied with any Wooll from us, their Manufacture will fail; the greateſt part of thoſe perſons imployed by them, will for want of imployment, come over into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. All our Ports and Sea-Towns will be full of Ships and Men, and flouriſh by their Trade.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61244:14"/>5. The Royal Fiſhery, (which will bring us more Riches to this Nation, than the <hi>Indies</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard</hi>) will be fully imployed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We ſhall have ſuch numbers of Ships, that we may trade into all Parts, and our Fiſhery and woollen Drapery will fully fraught us out, and in return bring us the Riches of the World.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>London</hi> will be the <hi>Emporium,</hi> and great Mart of <hi>Europe,</hi> for all Commodities whatſoever.</p>
