            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherfore seing we make so plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the trueth out of Gods word, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can doubt of it, but such as will followe the bare name of Catholike, contrarie to the Catholike doctrine of the scriptures: against all such vaine motiues, wee may be bolde to oppose the trueth it selfe.

For will they nill they, the heretikes also and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes them selues, when they talke not with their own, but with strangers, they call the Catholike Church nothing but the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church. For they can not else bee vnderstanded, excepte they discerne her by that name, by which shee is called of the whole world.</hi> This therefore (quoth Bristow) is proued, <hi>they to be Catholikes that Catholikes are called</hi> When as Augustine saith, we must hold y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> church which both is catholike, &amp; is so called. Bristowe the Papist, is called by the name of a Cittie in England, theresore Bristowe the Papist is in deede a citie in England. This therefore is proued, that to bee Bristow that Bristow is called. But how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth he, that they be called Catholikes? The worlde forsooth beareth them witnesse.

Yes sir, not he only, but also <hi>Pope Humfrey in his Legend of sains Iewel, confesseth vs to be Catholikes, where he saith that Ponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus erred, when he wrot that onely lay men neither learned nor Catholikes, were moderators in the disputation at Westminster.</hi> Why Bristow, are you not ashamed to take the name of the lorde your god the Pope in vaine?

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the storie of Pontacus, when he saith, <hi>Catholikes were present,</hi> but in the next worde he expoundeth what catholikes, namely papistes. And som of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were also moderators, at the least wise one, namely D.

Augustines, Dominicanes &amp;c. did al take their names, eyther of that man, or that order, whiche they held to be the perfection of Religion, consisting not in keeping the commaundementes of God, as Bristowe like a wyse man affirmeth, whiche all Christian men ought to endeuour, but in keeping the traditions and constitutions of men, standing in garments, in meates, in gesture, in ceremonies, &amp; outward obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can not so lightly be acquitted of Heresie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Hieronymies owne rule, and last of all by the example of the name of Rechabites, who had their name of their family, and not of any Sect in perfection. The name of Papists (saith Bristow) is lately put vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs by heretiks, the like say we of the names of Lutheranes, &amp;c. put vpon vs by them. The saying of Augustine, <hi>De vtilitate credendi, Cap.</hi> 7. toucheth vs not, that Heretikes dare not denye their names by whiche they are called, for we vtterly denye all names by which we are called, in respect of our Religion, to be drawen from men, and aunswere onely to the name of Christians. And as for the name of Catholikes, which Bristow maketh all one with the name of Christians, being added to the name of Christians to distinguish true Christians from He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, which are counterfet Christians, we do embrace it: but if from this righte meaning of the name, it bee drawen to signifye a people, whiche by only glorying in that name, despise al true Christianitie grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the holy and diuine Scriptures, as Bristow seemeth to make it, then is it no better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a name of Heretikes, and so the name of Catholikes, boasted of by them that refuse to be members of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Catholike Church, turneth to their owne reproch, euen as the name of the Apostolikes was to them, whiche bragged of the name of the Apostles, but were indeed no true followers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles, no more than the Papistes be true Catholikes.</p>
               <p>In the eyght Demaund, he would know why we call them not Gregorians, or Leonians, of some one Pope, but Papists of the generall name of the Pope. I answer,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2880:12"/>
bicause they mainteine not one heresie only of one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but a general heresie and Apostasie from Christ, wherof the Pope is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head, whom no more foolishly then falsly Bristowe saith to haue bene alwayes since the Apostles time.

The like doth Augustine, wherefore let Bristow aduise him selfe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a good argument. Epiphanius and Augustine accounted prayer for the dead to be an errour, Ergo, it was an heresie in deede. For an other example of old heresies by vs recyted he bringeth in, <hi>That cruell heresie of theirs, against the necessitie of childrens baptisme, wherin they agree with the Pelagians, through which they suffer many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand poore soules to perish, which can not helpe them selues, while they promise them both life euerlasting, and the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen without baptisme, whereas the Pelagians promised life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting only.</hi> Who would thinke, that this slaunderous he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique had liued so long in England as hee did before he became fugitiue, which lyeth so impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly without all colour or shewe of trueth?

               <p>From Augustine he passeth to a tale reported in Bedes historie of a captiue, whose chaines were loosed at such time, as his brother which was a Monke and Priest sayd masse for him, by which reporte, Bede sayth, many were moued to pray, giue almes or offer the sacrifice of the holy oblation for the deliuerie of their frendes which were departed out of this world a sorie motiue without the autoritie of Gods word, which albeit it was credited of Bede, as diuerse other fables were, yet may we doubt of the truth of it, and although it were true that such a feate was wrought, yet it can not establish a doctrine contrarie to the holy Scriptures. And notwithstanding that Bede liuing in a corrupttime, holdeth many errors of Papistrie, yet I haue shewed against Stapletons sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, that he holdeth not all, not many of the chiefest.</p>
               <p>After this miracle of Bede, he beginneth the storie of our countrye woman, which hauinge plaied the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot in London, and running ouer into Flanders to seeke the knaue that got her with childe, was made lame with childbearing, so that one legge was shorter then an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by more then halfe a foote, sayth Bristow. But after often shrift, and other holy exercises of Poperie, in time of a masse, she was restored to health by the sacrament of miracle. I doubt not but the masters of Bridewell (neere which place she dwelled sometime) which haue done as great cures as that, coulde haue healed her of

her lamenes, without the sacrament of miracle. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsall of this doggetricke miracle, he interlaceth an other as monstruous a lye as this. That the pixe being stollen by a Iew, &amp; the cakes sticked in despight among the Iewes, did bleede aboundantly, that a druncken wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a Iew borne, and christned, being admonished by an Angell in a vision, restored that pixe with three hostes in it to her gostly father, from whom they were translated to S.

Yes sayth Bristow: for Augustine sayth in other places, we must tye our soules to God alone, whereof religion is so named, wherefore she tying her soule to the sactament, maketh the sacrament God him selfe. A substantiall reason I promise you, by which you may as wel prou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that she worshipped baptisme and made God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2880:17"/>
him selfe ofit, for there is no doubt, but vnto baptisme (which is also the sacrament of our pryce) she tyed her soule with the bande of faith, and so hath euery faithfull Protestant. For the sacraments by faith, are certaine pledges of our con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>unction with God through Christ. Into whose death we are ingraffed by baptisme, as we are fedde with his body and blood in the supper.</p>
               <p>The place of Augustine is corruptly cited by Bristow, who hath cut of both the head and the foote of it, which is this. <q>

                        </gap>r, omni superstitione ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reamus.</hi> Hauing respect to one God and tying our soules to him onely, whereof religion is thought to be called, let vs be voyde of all superstition. For Monica had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect onely to God, when she tyed her soule by faith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the seale of Gods promises.</q> And she was voyde of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, when she cleaued to none other ceremonye of coniunction with God, but onely to that, which was ordeyned of God him selfe for that purpose. But howe proueth Bristow, that prayer for the deade was vsed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or that Masse was sayd for the deade. Because that in the corrupt tyme of Augustine, prayer was vsed for the deade, and in the prayers vsed at the celebration of the communion, remembraunce was made of the dead. This is a strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge kind of reasoning: that was vsed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, therefore it was vsed alwayes. But how long it was vsed, and how it was taken vp, I haue shewed in myne aunswer to Allins booke of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>Now commeth S. Gregory to be of Bristowes religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I will not deny but in many errors and superstitions Gregory agreeth with the Papistes, but yet not in all, nor in some of the chiefest. The visions he rehearseth for prayer for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead, if they were not fayned dreames, they were illusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil, because they serue to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine that doctrine, which is contrary to the Scriptures, which teach that after death followeth iudgement im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, so that no prayers can preuaile. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. But prophecyes are for Bristowes religion. How so I praye
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2880:18"/>
you? The conuersion of Augustine and the death of Cassius were foretold in vision. If both those were grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be true visions, your religion were neuer the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, except the conuersion of the one, and the death of the other be your religion. But admitting the dreame of Monica to be a true vision, howe proue you that the Chapeline of Cassius did not fayne his vision after his maister was dead?</p>
               <p>But the dreame of Iudas Machabaeus who sawe the Prophet Ieremy pray for the people, is recorded in the Canonical Scripture it selfe (sayth Bristow) 2. <hi>Mach.</hi> 15. <hi>chap.</hi> which Scripture the Protestants reiect, because it maketh against them, as they would doe all the rest, but that they thinke they haue inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted shiftes good enough to blinde the worlde. What reuerence we beare to the holy Scriptures of God, he him selfe, our owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the whole world can testifie. And the reiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such bookes as were not written by the spirite of God, doth approue the same. Beside the authoritie of the auncient Churche, both of the Iewes and Gentills which neuer receiued the same bookes into the canon, we haue often made manifest demonstration, that they proceeded not from the spirite of God. Wherefore the Papistes making them of equall credit with the worde of God, incurre the curse of God, which is vnto all them that either adde or take away any thing from his holy word.</p>
               <p>But the Papistes are not destitute of visions in these daies, for Bristow knoweth a Protestant who hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that he saw in a dreame, the communion booke out of many handes cast into a fire, and yet the man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth a Protestant. Verely he doth as a good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an should doe, that not onely with no vaine dreames, but nether with visions of Angells from heauen he will be moued to condemne that doctrine which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth assuredly to be agreable to the holy Scriptures. But there was a Papist in London, which came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church against his conscience, and sawe a fowle blacke dogge

take the communion euer more, at the naughty mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters hands, as he offred it to the communicants, which stroke the Papist so at the hart, that he went home and dyed vpon it. This deuilish illusion, or mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cholike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of a deuilish dogged Papist, thinketh Bristow able to condemne the holy ministration of the Lordes supper, warranted by <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

Whatsoeuer of such things are done in the Catholike church, they are therefore to be approued because they are done in the Catholike church, but the church is not therby proued Catholike, because such things are done in it. Our lord Iesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, when he had risen from the dead, &amp; offred his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be seene with the eyes, &amp; touched with the hands of his disciples, yet least they should think they suffered any illusion, he iudged that they were rather to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with the testimonies of the lawe &amp; the prophets, &amp; the Psalmes, shewing that those thinges were fulfilled of him, which were so long before prophecied.

Non debuit. They should not reiect the saying of the booke of wisedom which in the church of Christ hath deserued so long a rew of yeares to be recited in the steppe of the readers of the church of Christ and with worship of diuine auctoritie to be heard of all Christians from the Bishops to the lowest sorte of lay men &amp;c.</hi> And againe. <hi>Et Etiam temporibus &amp;c.

               <p>Touching this defense, first I aske of Bristow, how he can proue that the booke of Machabees, hath had such continuaunce of credit?

nor any Pelagians as Bristow seemeth to meane, but such as defended the Catholike faith against Pelagius, reiected this saying of the booke of Wisedome, which booke also we refuse, although not for that saying and what one article of our doctrine doth that booke im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne? nay rather there is testimonies therein manifest aga<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

But what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and beliefe they attribute to the canonicall Scriptures, it is plaine by this, that they dare not abide the triall by them, but flie from them to traditions as Bristow doth euen in the next motiue, as though the Scriptures inspired of God were not sufficient both to teache all truth, and to confute all errors.</p>

               <p>Although we should graunt the Churches iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> to be alwaies infallible, yet would we neuer graunt the popish churches authoritye which falleth so manifestly from the word of God, &amp; thereby sheweth her self to be the malignant Church, &amp; Synagogue of Satan. That the Church of Christ hath alwaies ben from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning, &amp; shal continue vnto the end of the world, we all confesse and defende. Wherefore it is an impudent slaunder of Bristow, to saye that <hi>by Iewell the Church dyed within six hundreth yeares after Christ.</hi> And that the Donatistes and Luciferians are reuiued in Protestants. For we nether say, that the Church is perished out of all places, except Africa, as the Donatistes, nor that it is become a stewes with the Luciferians. But the Papistes are more like to the Donatistes, which say the Church is perished out of all partes of the world except Europe, and in steede of the Church they defende a stewes and sincke of all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, superstition &amp; vngodlines. Therefore Augustine and Hierom be not of Bristowes religion, for condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning those heretikes to whome Bristow and his Papistes are more like then the Protestants.</p>
               <p>Nether doe Protestants in their conscience thinke the Church of Christ to be against them, because Castalio an Anabaptist translateth <hi>Ecclesiae</hi> the Churche into <hi>reipublicae</hi> the common wealth, or because many vse the name of congregation, which is the true signification of this word <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> as no man will deny that is not past all shame. That the Churche is euerlasting and visible to them that haue suche eyes as the Churche is, that is spirituall, we neuer deny. But that it is visible to the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2880:24"/>
world alwayes, that shall neuer be proued. That no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is against the Catholikes we graunt, but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scriptures are against the Papists, it hath bene more then a thousand times proued. That the church geueth testimonie to Christ &amp; that the prophecies of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches euerlasting continuance are plaine &amp; euident, It is no question betwene vs. But that the synagoge of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Papists is the church of Christ, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such credit or reuerence is to be geuen, that I say, if Bristow woulde burst for anger, against the Protestantes, he shall neuer be able to proue.</p>

               <p>Of the churches practise &amp; custome I say, euen as of the churches iudgement, that how much soeuer it be to be esteemed, yet is not the Popish church the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church of Christ but an apostasie &amp; schisme from it. Neither is it sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for Bristow to say, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popish church practiseth many things that the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t church of Christ practised, therfore it is the true church of Christ, except he can proue, that the Popish churchteacheth &amp; practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth all &amp; nothing els but that which the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t church of Christ did teach &amp; practise. In stede whereof Bristow can allege nothing, but certeine spots &amp; wrinkles of the elder church, which the Popish church doth embrace, hauing almost nothing els like vnto it. But let vs see how substantially he proueth out of S. Paule &amp; S. Augustine, that the churches custome and practise is an infallible rule of truth. First S. Paule (saith he) 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. after many

Paul saith, if any man seme to be desirous of contention, we haue no such custome, nor the churches of God, whereby he meaneth plainly, that it is not the custome of the Apostles, nor of the church of God, to be contentious about such small matters of external beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2880:25"/>
are of a third kind, that is contrary to the word of God and the practise of the most auncient Primitiue church But Augustine (sayth Bristow) proueth that infants are borne in sinne against the Pelagians, which are reuiued in Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, by the customes &amp; practise of the church, which was to baptise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for remission of sinnes. <hi>And this practise he called the waight of truth, &amp; a most plaine bignes of truth.</hi> The slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, that Pelagia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are aliue in Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, by denying children to be borne in sinne, I wil no more esteme, then the barking of a dogge against the moone.

And who can blame Augustine, if after he haue mightely confuted the Pelagians out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, to shew the nouelty of their heresie, he alleaged the perpetuall practise of the church, which she alwaies had &amp; alwaies shall haue in praying for the conuersion of infidels, &amp; for the perseuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the faithful in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. This is all one (saith Bristow) <hi>as if we should reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these heretikes out of priuate mens beades &amp; out of the publike prayers which are in the portuse or Breuiary, or in the missall and such like bokes.</hi> The deuill it is, except Bristow can proue, that such beades and prayers, were euer vsed in the church. <q>For Augustine sayth <hi>de bono perseuer. ca.</hi> 22 <hi>Atque vtinam tardi corde, &amp; infirmi qui non possunt, velnon dum possunt Scriptur as vel earum expositiones intelligere, sic audrient vel non audirent in hac quaestione disputationes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stras, vt magis intuer entur orationes suas, quas semper ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit</hi>

Which seeing it can not be shewed for Poperie, the argument of the practise of the church serueth not for Popery. Bristowe proceedeth and passeth ouer the example of Christian women, which killed them selues, rather then they would haue their bodies abused, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by the churches iudgement were honored as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs To which I aunswere, the church considered their minde which was good, &amp; not the fact which was euell. At last he commeth to affirme that the Popish church neuer made any chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of religion. Which is a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse assertion, although he say that none of his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries is able to charge them with any alteration since Augustines time. For to omitte the whole scope of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, cleane peruerted, I will obserue only the practise of the church in Augustines time, about the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. In that time the lay people did receaue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kindes and one thousand yeres almost after, which of late the Papistes haue altered. In Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines time, the communion was geuen to infantes which the Papistes doe not obserue, therefore they can not bragge of perpetuall practise and deny all chaunge in religion made by them. But Bristow not content with this vayne bragge, will go farther and shewe that whatsoeuer they haue vsed sithe S. Augustines time, <hi>was obserued euen so in all that time that passed betwene S. Paule and S. Augustine.</hi> Is not this a master of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to promise that which all the worlde of learned
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2880:26"/>
men doth know to be impossible to be performed, and whereof the promiser himselfe, can bring no profe at all but his bare worde. For he beginneth with exorcisme and exsufflation, which as it was vsed in Augustines time vnnecessarily, so it appeareth by Cyprian, that was long before him, that it was vsed for the casting out of the deuill in them whose bodies he did sensibly possesse. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>ad Magnum.</hi> Of the sacrifice of the Masse, worshipping of the Sacrament, and oblation for the deade, as Bristow referreth the reader to his fift and seuenth motiues so doe I to mine aunsweres vnto the same. Concerning the vse of the altare, howe truly he sayth, I referre the reader to mine answere of D. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. The other fonde reason of the practise of the church, that children were taught to beleue the reall presence of Christ in the Sacrament, for which he citeth <hi>Aug. de Tim. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. which the poore man borowed out of Allens booke of Purgatory, is discussed &amp; answered in my confutation of the same treatise <hi>lib.</hi> 2 <hi>cap.</hi> 9. Then followeth going on pilgrimage, to holy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, worshipping of reliques, prayer vnto Sainctes, vsed (as he sayth) in Augustines time. For worshipping of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and praying to Sainctes, he citeth <hi>Aug de c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re pro mor.</hi> Who concludeth <hi>that to be buried at some memorie of the martyrs doth in this poynct only auayle the dead, that the affection of supplication commending him also to the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of the martyr may be encreased.</hi> That this was no perpetuall practise of the church to desire the interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sainctes, it is manifest by this, that Augustine him selfe dare affirme nothing certeinly, whether or how the Saincts may heare our prayers. Affirming that this question passeth the power of his vnderstanding <hi>cap.</hi> 16. But by the name of memory, Bristow will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande relique, because it is somtime so vsed, which is no strong argument. But admitte it were so, how can he proue, either that practise to haue bene continued from S. Paule to S. Augustine or the same opinion of reliques to haue ben in Augustines time, which is mainteined in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2880:26"/>
the Popish church? that there was superstitious peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Ierusalem &amp;c. vsed in S. Hieroms time, it is as true as that the same was reproued of him <hi>Ep. ad Paul.</hi> If God shewed any miracles at the deade bodyes of the Martyrs, to confirme that religion for which they suffred against the Gentiles it foloweth not that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of dead Saints are to be worshiped, kissed, saught vnto by pilgrimage &amp;c, but most absurd is it, that Bristow would haue Hierome by ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> entering into the Cryptos or vaultes of churches at Rome, to signifie that he went a Pilgrimage. Hierome was not so grose, to accounte walking about the Citie to be a Preregrination. But what is so leaden or blockishe, which these doltish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists will not auouch for the mainteinaunce of their trompery. Last of all he chargeth the Protestantes, with an impudent attempt, in making such an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall chaunge of the whole face of Religion, which none of the olde Heretikes did before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That we are like to none of the olde Heretikes, we like our selues neuer the worse, but as concerning the vniuersall chaunge, it was necessary in reformation where there was an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal Apostacie. For any alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we haue made, the Papistes dare not affirme for shame, that wee haue brought any thing into the Church which ought not to be vsed by the worde of God: neither are they able to proue that we haue omitted anything, which by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scripture is necessaryly required. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, you see that the practise of the church, except it be perpetuall, euen from the first beginning, is no Motiue by Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines iudgement, and that Bristowe though hee hath bragged much thereof, for some superstitions vsed of olde, yet he hath brought nothing, to proue that they haue beene from the beginning.</p>

the generall councell of Constantinople the sixt, for a Monothelite. Euen the popish councell of Constans, deposed three Popes. But now let vs see Bristowes wise examples. The Pelagians (which he saith, but sheweth not how) are aliue in Protestants, were condemned by the Apostolike Sea as witnesseth Augustine. <hi>Episto.</hi> 106. And this iudgement of the Catholike Church, the Emperour Honorius confirmed as testifieth Possidoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us and Augustine. What then? Ergo Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine and the Emperours were of our Religion. If the Pelagians had beene condemned by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Byshoppe of Rome, without conuiction out of the holy Scriptures, the Example had beene to some purpose. But when their heresie was bothe by Preaching, writing, disputing and Councell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be contrarie to the worde of God, then if the Byshoppe of Rome subscrybed to his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as one of the true Patriarches of the Church within the Romaine Empire, what doth this aduaunce the singularitie of his Sea? For examples of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes purging them selues, Firste he nameth Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome in his Epistle to Innocentius the sixt of Rome, but setteth downe none of his woordes, as in deede there is no such matter in that Epistle, onely he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth howe iniuriously hee was handled by the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Souldiers. His next example is: Theodoretus Byshoppe of Cyrus, who beeing vniustly deposed, appealed to Leo Byshoppe of Rome, which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of his case indifferently, consented to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution in the councell of Chalcedon. But that The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret would not haue accounted him selfe an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike or scismatike, although he had beene condemned by Leo, it is plaine by these words. <q>

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Theodoret was farre from acknowledging those popish principles. That the Pope can not erre, that his iudgement is all one with the iudgement of God. Although the mysterie of iniquitie in the Bishop of Romes prerogatiue, had by that tyme wrought very highe. The submission of Hierome to Pope Damasus, you shall finde aunswered in my confutation of Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders rocke <hi>cap.</hi> 15. where you shall see how the Church of Rome was called Catholike, while it was so in deede, and howe Antichristes side was against the Bishop of Rome, namely so longe as the Bishop of Rome was on Christes side. Whether Protestantes in England haue decayed and Papistes increased, as Bristow braggeth, for these 16. yeares, let wise men iudge. Although want of seuere discipline hath caused many to remaine obstinate, and some perhaps that were of no religion, to fall to Popery, yet for the number, it is altogether false, that Bristow so confidently affirmeth.</p>

to satisfie the Emperour Constantius, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to subscribe to the vniust depriuation of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius, he was caried into banishment, and one Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix a good Catholike also, yet by faction of the Arrians, was chosen Bishop of Rome in his place.

The same Pope Honorius is condemned in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond councell of Nice confirmed also by the Pope A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian.</q> Notwithstanding all this, I would Bristow were so hardy on his head, to graunt that Honorius was an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike. I might ioyne to these, three Popes condemned by the councell of Constance, confirmed by Pope Iohn 23. One of the three. also the condemnation of Pope Eugenius by the councell of Basil, confirmed by Pope Nicolas and Felix. But the other are sufficient excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against Bristowes false principle. Now whatsoeuer he prateth of auctority of councelles, is to no purpose. For we acknowledge how necessary synods are for the church of Christ, with the Apostles, whom the fond ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> boasteth to be of theyr religion, because they helde a councell. Not considering howe they determined the controuersie, only by auctority of the holy Scriptures, as it is manifest <hi>Act.</hi> 15. And what councell soeuer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that rule, we gladly embrace, and that is the cause, why the parliament ioyneth, the foure first gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councells with the Scriptures, in triall of heresie, not that those councels are of equall auctority with the worde of God, but in that they agree with the same, in condemning the heresies of Arrius, Macedonius, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius and Eutiches. That proude scoffe of Parliament religion, bewraieth the stomake of a Vauntparler, &amp; not the spirit of a diuine or good subiect. Popery was also confirmed by Parliament in Queene Maryes time, therefore it was Parliament Religion. But where as he would compare the laste rablement of Trent, in all pointes with those ancient holy Councels, he doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as much as if he would goe about to proue an Ape to be a man. But I may not omit that in shewing the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of the Popes confirmation of Councels, out of Annianus Marcellus, Lib. 15.

For example, we denye prayers for the deade, which some of the olde writers did allowe. But if Bristow woulde breake his heade in peeces with studye, he shall neuer be able to proue, that all the olde writers did mayntayne prayer for the deade, the like I saye of prayer vnto Sainctes, and of some prerogatiue of the Bishop of Rome ouer other Bishops, of some ceremonies &amp;c: which being the dregges of a great quantitie of good liquor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in the vessells of diuerse of the olde writers, and yet of the later sorte of them, the Papistes haue onely sucked out, letting all the good liquor to runne beside them.

Augustines motiue, euen none otherwise, then they are our reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, to staye vs in Christian truthe, which they write agreeable to the holye Scriptures, and therefore it is an impudent slaunder of Bristowe bothe where he saythe, that in our preachinge and writinge <hi>we thinke it not necessary to alledge the t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>As vayne a cauill it is, that the Protestantes are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of their fathers: When we acknowledge no fathers, vnto whose iudgement we will stande abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in all controuersies, but the Prophetes and the Apostles and God him selfe, by whose spirite they did write. As for Simon Magus, Eunomus, and suche olde heretikes we detest, more then the Papistes doe. But AErius, Vigilantius, and Iouinian were playnely of our opinion, and of them we are ashamed. And doe you Papistes beleeue nothinge common with AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Vigilantius, Iouinian? Doe you in no poynte holde that which Arius, Macedonius, Eutyches did holde? Doe you mayntayne no opinion which was taught by Mahomet him selfe? you will aunswer, that there neuer was heresie, but it h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2880:32"/>
wherin they were heretikes. Euen so we aunswere you of AErius, Vigilantius, Iouinian, we are not ashamed to beleue any truth which they helde, their errours we leaue vnto them selues. But I know you will replye, that among the errours of AErius, the denyall of prayers to profit the deade was one accompted by Epiphanius and Augustine. Then it is your parte to shewe, what argumentes out of the holy Scripture they bring to proue this opinion to be an errour. Otherwise their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie alone, is not sufficient to make it a truth. Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius is baighted only by Hierome, of other learned men in his time, he was counted a godly man, and a learned. As for Iouinian, we take not his parte, if in all respects he made mariage equall with virginitie, which in some respect the Apostle preferreth. But we must see of what religion and auctoritie, the fathers were. First sayth Bristow you may perceaue by Iewells challenge, that for Purgatorie, prayer for the dead and to Saincts, merite of good workes &amp;c. there is somthing conteined in the olde fathers which liued within 600. yeares after Christ, because he durst not make his challenge of these articles, but of the Masse, the Pope, the eucharistie &amp;c. But I pray you Bristow, are not these greater matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, then the other?</p>
               <p>If therefore you be not able to proue your greatest mysteries of antiquitie, out of any one father for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages, what great matter is it, if you haue them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable in a fewe articles of lesse moment? But Bristow with wayght of reason will beare vs downe, that all the fathers are on their side wholly, and against vs in all poynctes of our controuersie. And this is his reason: who are driuen to mayteyne the fathers cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and auctoritie, Papistes or Protestantes? Not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes verily, but Papistes, ergo the fathers be all for Papistes and against Protestantes. A mightie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of mayne force. Dioscorus and Eutyches in the councell of Chalcedon boasted of the auctoritie of the holie fathers, and stoode much in defense of their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2880:32"/>
creditte therefore the fathers were whollie on their side.</p>
               <p>But let vs heare L. Humfreys opinion out of his booke of B. Iewells life, of Iewells challenge, of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and of the Saincts in the calender. Nay rather let vs heare Bristow yelping like a little curre agaynst so great a lyon. First he snatcheth peeces of his sentences gnawne from the rest, and then squeleth out as though he had hearde some maruelous straunge soundes. D. Humfrey sayth, Iewell gaue the Papistes too large a scope, when not content to haue beaten them downe with the auctoritie of the holy Scriptures, he made his challenge vpon the testimonie of the fathers, and that so many hundreth yeares after Christ. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was iniurious to him selfe, that refusing that meane by which he might more easely &amp; more straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue maynteyned his cause, after a maner he spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him selfe and the church. This is his opinion of Maister Iewells challenge. Howe followeth his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the fathers and of the Sainctes in the calender. This thing (sayth D. Humfrey) he did not with his wil, but yet he did it not without a cause, that he might strike you through with the testimonie of your fathers, as it were with your owne sworde. For it had beene manlie for a Christian man to say. Thus sayth the Lorde. It had bene sufficient to haue layed agaynst you. Your doctrine is contrarie to the Scripture. For it is the question of men possessed with deuills to say: What haue we to doe with thee Iesus thou sonne of Dauid? But it is an interrogation of the Saynctes. What haue we to doe with our fathers with fleshe and bloode? You heare by these wordes, what a daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous opinion he holdeth of the fathers and of the Saynctes in the calender, namelie that the fathers are no farther to be followed, then they followed the holie Scriptures, and that the Sainctes either liuing or deade, whether they be in the calender or no, deny their fathers as fleshe and bloode if they be in any
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2880:33"/>
respect an hinderance for them to obey the will of their father in heauen.</p>
               <p>These are the perillous opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that Bristow brableth against falsifying his words by ommission &amp; dep<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>auing his meaning by false surmising.</p>
               <p>But Bristow hath yet an other reason to proue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be in all poinctes of their side. <hi>If in all poinctes</hi> (sayth he) <hi>they be not with the Protestants, then vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all poynctes they be with vs.</hi> And what is the reason of this monstruous conclusion? <hi>There was neuer but one true religion.</hi> As though none can be of true religion but such as erreth in nothing.

               <p>Al martyrs that euer suffred fot the testimony of true <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> religion, since Abel, were numbred of one true church, euen of the same that we are. But Bristow would binde vs to the Saincts in the calender, termed by L. Humfrey Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ct<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Notwithstanding so many of those cale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ddred &amp; canonized Sainctes as be Saincts in heauen and not firebrands in hell, were of that church which is builded vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ being the head corner stone. And therefore it is a foolish request, that we should name any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was of our faith. But it is a pleasant pastime, to heare howe Bristow proueth S. Stephen to be of his religion. It is manifest (sayth he) that he is of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2880:33"/>
of the rest of the martyrs, meaning Papistes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is proued, that he as well as they, had heard &amp; helped the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which prayed to them, which worshipped their reliques, &amp; went a pilgrimage to their churches, &amp; he specially reuealing by vision, the place where his reliques were hidden with the reliques of S. Gamaliel, &amp; S. Nicodemus: vnto one Lucian, a Priest of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erusalem, which wrote in Greeke the history of his inuention. To this inuention, I answere, that it is an inuention of the deuill, either by meanes of him that counterfaited the vision, or by sending a stronge illusion, &amp; so <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> say gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of all such miracles and visions, as are alleaged, to proue any doctrine contrarie to the holy Scriptures. As for the vanitie of this epistell of Lucian, it be wrayeth it selfe in that he maketh Gamaliel the Pharizee, so great a Sainct, who for any thing that we can read in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, was neuer a Christian. S. Paule in the 22. of the Actes, appealeth to the knowledge of the Iewes, that he was brought vp in Iudaisme, vnder Gamaliel, which if after he had bene conuerted to Christianity it shoulde haue bene greatly suspected that S. Paule had bene noselled vp by him, and not conuerted by a vision from heauen, as his intent was to shew.</p>
               <p>From this counterfait stuffe of Lucians epistell, he sendeth vs to the new founde sermons of Augustine, to whom he would get credit, by Augustines owne report, <hi>De ciuit.</hi> 22. <hi>ca.</hi> 8. but in vaine, for Augustine speaketh not of any such sermons, but only, when report of a miracle was brought vnto him, that he went vnto the church &amp; spake a few things of the matter. And touching all such miracles as he reporteth of Stephen, his conclusion is this, God was glorified by them, and the faith for which Stephen died, was magnified. But of worshipping of reliques, pilgrimage &amp;c. there is no mention, and yet that chapter of miracles, as Ludouicus Viues doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, is notably corrupted, as appeared to him, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient copies. <q>The conclusion was, <hi>Quid erat in cordibus exultantium nisi fides Christi, pro qua Stephani sanguis</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:2880:34"/>
                     <hi>fusus est?</hi> What was in the hartes of them that reioysed, but the faith of Christ, for which the blood of Stephen was shed?</q>
               </p>
               <p>The miracle which Bristow reporteth out of the 38. <hi>Serm. in diuus</hi> &amp; 96. <hi>in noua editione</hi> to proue the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of baptisme for infants &amp; the practise of the church for confirmation of children, &amp; praying to S. Stephen is an impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fiction, as appeareth manifestly by this, that he calleth a sucking babe <hi>Catechumenu,</hi> one that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in Christian religion, which could not possibly be, before he was of yeares of capacity. Secondly the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ofChristian parents, in Augustins time, were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised as sone as they were borne, &amp; taried not vntil they were <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> that is enstructed. Thirdly the woman in this fable, praying to S. Stephen, perswadeth him to know the purpose of her hart, which the word of God affirmeth to be known only to God. As impudent as the deuiser of that fable was, is Bristow, who citeth out of Augustine <hi>De <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nitat. eccles. cap.</hi> 16. a few words rent a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the rest, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning miracles, which the whole discourse, sheweth to be plainly against him, as you may read in this aunswere in the 8. motiue of visions. After this followeth a comparison of Foxes martyrs, with the Popish martyrs, <hi>Videlicet the good Earle of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, Storie, Feltons, Nortons, VVodhouse, Plomtree, and so many hundrethes of the Northerne men,</hi> all rebells and traytors, yet (saith he) approued by miracles vndoubted, but what miracles, he sheweth not. To these he addeth Fisher, More, the Charterhouse monkes &amp;c. whose cause being sufficiently discussed by M. Foxe, I referre to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of indifferent readers. But this I can not omit that the traiterous Papist, flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dereth our state, not only for publike execution of open rebelles and errant tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but also with priuie murthering, by poysoning, whipping, and famishing. From all suspition of which wicked practises, God be praised, the states that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the Go<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, so I nothing doubt, but that the same is vtterly false and vntrue, as a thousand more slaunders and lyes, Wherein the Papists, as Children of the Father of lyes haue so great delight. To conclude, seeing not the paine, but the cause maketh a martyr, whosoeuer haue suffred for treason and rebellion, may well be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Martirs of the Popisn Church, but the church of Christe condemneth such for enemies of Christes kingdome and inheritours of eternal destructi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, except they repent and obtaine mercie for their horrible wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes. And seeing patient suffring is by Bristows owne confession, a gift of God, vnto all true Martirs, such as were manifestly voide of patience, can be no true Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs, as were most of these rebels &amp; traitors, &amp; Story by name.

               <p>And to aunswere the xx. demaunde, we are content to bee tryed by that doctrine for which the auncient Martyrs Irenaeus, Cyprian, Laurens &amp;c. suffred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and Martyrdom, which was for no pointe of Popery but true christianitie, yet wil we not be tryed by all poyntes of doctrine which they did holde, for that it is certaine, some of them had their errors which the Papists them selues doe not holde, as Irenaeus is charged by Eusebius. <hi>l. b.</hi> 3. <hi>cap</hi> 39, to be a follower of the Chiliastes.

And Bristowe cannot altogether deny where he derideth the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Religion, and inconstancie of Protestants for chaunging the title of head into gouernour, and then expounding the gouernment by iniunction. Whereas in neither of bothe titles was any other meaning of the godly sorte in the time of King Henry, Kinge Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde or her Maiestie, then is contayned in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. In deede Stephen Gardiner (as Caluine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth) at Ratisbone, abused the title of supreme head, not more wickedly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> absurdly to defend all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie, which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was not abolished by king Henry. And against that grosse errour of Gardiner writeth Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and not against our vnderstanding of that tytle. But the Apologie prophecieth that shortely the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans and Zwinglians should bee accorded, which is fulfilled in the accorde of the Protestantes and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, who in the demaunde he sayth doe abhorre the tytle of supremacie, If I knewe whome he did meane by Puritanes, I might aunsweare him the better, but seeing hee maketh Protestantes and Puritanes mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a diuision, If hee recken the Puritanes for such as bee no Protestantes, let them aunsweare for them selues. If he calles them Puritanes which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to haue the Church thorowly reformed, there is no such dissention betweene them, but that they all agree in the Articles of Faith, maintayne brotherly concorde one with an other, notwithstanding in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of opinions concerning the matters and manner of reformation. But what an impudent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte is chaunge of Religion, hee will shewe vs out of Luther, which writing againste the Anabaptistes Anno 1528. affirmeth that much Christianitie, and true Christianitie is vnder the Popedome.

But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this succession is visible, &amp; limited to any one sea of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, it is false. For euen as he him selfe sayth <hi>it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that all Adams children to be come of Adam by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall pedegree of fathers and grandfathers and other proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors, euen vntill his time,</hi> and yet no one of Adams chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can deduce this pedegree by naming of all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors from Adam vnto his time so there is no doubt, but the Church hath had a perpetuall succession in the world, from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning thereof, vntil this day, although she can not name a particular succession of persons in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one place, for all ages that are past. But euen as by the Scriptures we are taught, that Adam is our naturall father, although we can not name all our au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cestors that haue bene betwene vs and him: right so by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we are taught, that the Church is our heauenly mother, although we can not frame such tables of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession as the Papistes require vs to shew, which they can not performe them selues. For although they can name a number of Bishops, whereof some haue taught at Rome, some haue sitten and slept in their chayer at Rome, and some at Auynion, some haue played the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill therein, an hundreth of the last being no more like to a score of the firste in doctrine and life, then God, whose children the first were, is like the deuill whose
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2880:40"/>
derlings the last were: yet what is this to shewe a succession of their Church. And howe doth this proue them to be the true Churche: can not the Churche of Constantinople and other Churches in Greece, doe the like vnto this daye? Yet doe the Papistes count all them for heretikes and scismatikes. Whatsoeuer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Optatus, Hierom, Augustine, Tertullian, or any other haue written of succession of Bishops in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike sees, they meane so large and so farre forth as they continue in succession of Apostolike doctrine. Otherwise woulde not Hierom haue embraced Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, because it was receyued by Liberius who sate in the Apostolike see of Rome, and coulde name his predecessors from Peter. Nor Optatus haue recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Eutychianisme, because it was defended by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oscorus, which satte in the Euangelisticall see of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria, and coulde name his predecessors from S.

Nether woulde Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine haue consented to Arrianisme, because it was mayntayned by Eulalius and Euzoius, Bishops of the Apostolike see of Antioche, althoughe they were able to shewe their succession by many Bishops, euen vnto S. Peter him selfe, who planted his chayer at Antioche, by all Papistes confession seuen yeares before he came to Rome. You see therefore howe farre the motiue of succession may drawe or driue any man to haue regard vnto it, euen as long, as there is succession of doctrine, as well as of place and person, and not longer, nor fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

This motiue in effect, is all one with the former, and in a maner so confessed by Bristow him selfe. But thus he tak<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th his principle of their singing in the Masse, &amp; our saying in the communion, of the creede, in which we confesse that we beleue one onely Catholike and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike Church. This one Catholike Church sayth Bristow <hi>is our Church that is Apostolike, because it agreeth with the faith of the Church of Rome, which is the sea of an Apostle, holding on to this day by succession, and to which was written an Epistle by an Apostle.</hi> I aunswer, it is not the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Romane Church, because that Church is departed from the vniuersal Church of Christ, planted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles through out the worlde, and holdeth not on in succession of the doctrine of the Apostle, which did write that epistle to the Romanes. But Bristowes wise reasoning, is to be noted. <hi>S. Peter was an Apostle.</hi> That is true. <hi>he was the first Bishop of Rome.</hi> It is a great doubt, whether he euer came at Rome, and it is out of doubt by the Scriptures, that he taried not there so longe as the histories affirme, and last it is false that he was a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of a particular Church, which was an Apostle ouer all the world, and specially ouer the circumcision. <hi>There is a citye in the worlde named Rome.</hi> And that citye by the Scripture is the seat of Antichrist and the whore of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. <hi>vers.</hi> 18. <hi>S. Paules epistle to the Romaines is extant.</hi> and euen that epistle will proue the Church of Rome at this day, to be not apostolicall but apostatical, as in many articles, so in the article of iustification. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 28. <hi>Are not those causes why a Church is called Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike,</hi> sayth Bristow? No verily but onely because it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and mayntayneth the Apostolike doctrine, which if it doe in all necessary articles, then is it Apostolike, &amp; hath succession and plantation of the Apostles, or els not, although it be gathered in such cities in which the Apostles haue preached, planted, and to whome they haue written. But Tertullian doth so define Apostolike Churches, sayth Bristow. I say it is vntrue, for Tertullian against newe heretikes, sendeth vs not to the emptye

chayres of the Apostles, which had written to such ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but vnto the the testimony of their doctrine, recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the Apostles, and continued vntill that time.</p>
               <p>So he sendeth them that are in Achaia, to Corinthe. such as are in Macedonia to Philippi, those that are in Asia to Ephesus, &amp; them which be neare Italy to Rome, from whence they of Africa had their authoritie, not by excellency of that Church aboue other Apostolike Churches, but by nearenes of place: Therfore he saith, <hi>Proxima est tibi Achaia? habes Corinthum.</hi>

                     <hi>Si non longè es à Macedonia, habes Philippos. Si potes in Asiam tendere, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes Ephesum, si autem Italiae adieceris, habes Romam, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de nobis quae<expan>

                  </q> But Bristow sayth that the auncient fathers <hi>when there were many Apostolike Churches standing, they did principally and singularly direct men alwayes to the Church of Rome.</hi> This you see to be false, by the place of Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian last ci<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed. But that they did more often direct men to the testimony of the Church of Rome, it was for that by meanes of the Imperiall citie, it was more notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and best knowne. Otherwise it is a very lye of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow, where he sayth, that when the fathers name the Apostolike church, they do meane the Romane church by excellency, as the Poet signifieth Vergil and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher Aristotle. A like lye it is, that no Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth in the world founded by any of the Apostles, but onely Rome. For many Churches remayne to this day, that were planted by the Apostle Paule, who from Hierusalem to Illyricum filled all the contryes with the doctrine of the Gospell: of which many vnto this day continue in profession of Christianitie, beside all the Churches of India &amp; AEthiopia, which were also plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apostles Thomas and other. The more bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly

is the blundering of this Bristow, who dreameth, that the councell of Constantinople the 1. which made this confession by the Apostolike Church, <hi>did not onely meane the Romane Church, but also none other but the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church.</hi>

And being called to a councel at Rome by the Princes letters, procured by Damasus Bishop of Rome, &amp; other Bishops of Italy &amp; the West, they refused to come, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing already by the Emperour of the East being gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Constantinople, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

other, yet it is falsely affirmed, that Poperie hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed all idolatry. That Popery hath destroyed idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: Bristow wil proue by three examples, the one of the reliques of Sainctes, and the honor of them, the other of the signe of the crosse and the honorthereof, and the last by the reall presence in the Sacrament, which he calleth his Lord and his God. But our Lord and God is in heauen according to the Psalm. 115. The destruction of idolatrie by Christ in deede was prophecied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope setting vp and mainteyning as grosse ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie almost as euer was any of the Paganes, sheweth him selfe to be a verie Antichrist. But to the purpose Hierom <hi>lib.</hi> 28. <hi>in Isa. cap.</hi> 65. sayth that the heretikes in Fraunce were possessed with the deuill which could not abide the might and whips of the holy ashes. If he spake this against Vigila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius, &amp; other godly men, which repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the immoderate honoring of reliques and other su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions, he spake of his owne iudgement, and not of the iudgement of the church. For he only of all writers of his time, counted Vigilantius an heretike as he did Ruffinus also, which yet is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for as good a Catholike as he. It is knowne how he taunteth and scoffeth at Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine. Wherefore his censure is not sufficient to make Vigilantius opinion heresie, nor them heretikes which were of his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But admit this iudgement of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom to be sounde, yet was not the honor and estimation of reliques which he defendeth, against Vigilantius the same, which is in Poperie, but much differing there fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>By this you may see that the honor they gaue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques was but a reuerent estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them, for Christs sake, whose seruaunts the Martyrs were, and a lesse ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor then they gaue to the Sunne and the Moone, as is manifest by his gradation, and consequently no religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worship. As the Papistes vse and mayntayne of the reliques, not of Saynctes, but oftentymes of deuills in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, of beasts and all manner of fayned bables. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any thing more monstrous in popery, then their shameles fayning of infinite reliques. That Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine writeth that deuils were tormented and expelled, at the memories or burialls of the martyrs, where som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times idolls were worshipped, it proueth that idols were destroyed by Poperie. For if God wrought miracles at such places, where the bodies of his Martyrs slept to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the faith, for which they died, doth this make any thing for Popery? But the same Augustine to the Maudaurenses that were Pagans, and other heathen men vseth the argument of the greater honor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence doone by Kings and Emperours at the tombes and memories of the Saintes and Martyrs, and of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought at the same places, to shew the power of Christe to the confusion of idolatrie. This wee graunt, but how doth Popery ouerthrowe Idolatrie? There reuerence although in so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e respects superstitious, was far from popish Idolatrie, of worshipping of Saints, Images, bones, &amp;c, as wee haue shewed euen now out of Hierom the most eger defender of those vses and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uses in his time: The miracles approued none other doctrine, then the ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tyrs died for, who died for none other doctrine, but such as is contayned in the holy Scriptures, in which Poperie hath no ground.

the churches and houses of prayer, &amp; to the graues of the martyrs not to worship them, as Papistes doe, but by such things to receaue blessing and to kepe them selues from being enta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled with the snares of the deuill, while they be put in mind of the vertue of the martyrs, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their godly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation. And albeit there were some superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that regard of martyrs troubles &amp; memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as in that age there was, yet doth it not follow, there was all Popery, nor such grosse idolatry as Papistes doe commit with their counterfait rehques. Finally the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wroght by God at the dead bodies of the Saincts, might wel be vsed by Augustin, Chrysostom, &amp; Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret against the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tills, asan argument to ouerthrow their idolatrie, euen as the example of the miracles wrought by God at the dead body of Elizeus against the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Israelits <hi>Reg.</hi> but it followeth not therof, that idols should be made of their lawes, by worshipping them as the Papists do. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bones of Elizeus were not for that miracle take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of his graue &amp; shined in gold, deuided into many churches worshiped, licked, and kissed, as the Popish guise is. The same aunswere I make concerning miracles wrought by God with the signe of the crosse, which was the motiue of Lactantius. I say they proue not that the signe of the crosse should be worshipped, no more then the miracles wrought by God, with the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, were any cause why the Israelits should wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the brasen serpent. <hi>Reg.</hi>

               <p>And as touching the blessed Sacrament, which Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow blasphemously calleth his Lord and God, although the reall presence and transsubstantiation were graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, forasmuch as the Papists the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues affirme the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to consist of accidents as the signe, but no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are God or in God: If any miracles were wrought by God at the celebration therof, as Augustine and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian seeme to auouch, yet neither is the reall presence proued by those miracles, nor they tryed to be Papists, for writing of such miracles, of which if any man will see more, let him resorte to mine aunswere vnto Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins

by auctority of the holy Scriptures, Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do gladly acknowledge, how necessary it is for the church to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide controuersies and do willingly submit them selues thereto.

to carry away all credit of learning to popish doctors &amp; Vniuersities, whose orders and readings he doth the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commend to be so excellent, that men w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> knew him of late, with periury to haue taken degrees in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, should not meruaile that he is so sudenly transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into so great a doctor of diuinitie, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by once hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the cause of Diuinitie, which he supposeth none of our doctors knoweth what it meaneth, such a goodly matter is <gap reason="foreign">

they be in all the lumpe of the popish solemnities, they would procure small credit to our Sauiour Christ: but rather the scorning and derision of Turkes, Iewes, and Pagans. As for the blind comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries of the Iewes, out of which he magineth we haue all our vnderstanding of the old testament, how litle we trust in prophecyes of Christ, may be seene in the written commentaries of Caluine, Musculus, &amp; such other. The names of a great number of the solemne feastes, (as Bristow sayth) doth argue in deede the Papists ether to haue inuented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to haue abused them, as Candelmas, Corpus Christi day &amp;c, but that the same were inuented by that aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> celebrated the natiuity, resurrection, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention of Christ &amp; cat is vtterly vntrue.

Howe vaine a brag it is, that the martyrs were of the Papistes religion, because they keepe holy their dayes, I leaue to be answered with childrens laughture.</p>
               <p>But it is a great offence I weene, that Protestants haue put downe most of the Saincts daies, &amp; namely S. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his day, &amp; all our Ladies daies, assumption &amp; all. If a man shoulde aske you wherefore you keepe not S. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams day, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering he was the father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nor S. Esayes &amp;c: what could you answer? As for the Ladies daies w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> he complaineth to be put downe by vs, namely the feasts of her conception, natiuitye, visitation &amp; assumption, the Church could be without some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more then 12 hundreth yeares. For Vrbanus the 6. insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the feast of the visitation of some called the new found Lady daye about the yeare of Christ 1380. as the very popishe seruice of that daye confesseth in the first lesso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The feast of the natiuity, is not much elder as both the lessons &amp; Durand do acknowledge, which affirmeth that one Fulbertus a Bishop Cardinal made part of the seruice. That the feast of the assumption can not be very auncient, it appeareth not onely by the barbarous hymnes in the popishe Churche that daye, but also by
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2880:51"/>
the lessons taken out of Bede, by whiche it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that the Church coulde be without that goodly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie, more th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n 700. yeares after Christ, as a great number of other festiuities which borrow their lessons out of Bede, doe shew sufficiently, that the popish ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is nether so auncient nor so vniuersall, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes most impudently doe affirme. As for the feast of the conception of the Virgine Marye, is not full one hundreth yeare olde, being decreed by Sixtus the 4. in great despight of the Dominike Fryers, which did both preach and wright against it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore there is no such <hi>intollerable fault assuredly</hi> committed, in omitting such festiuities, as Bristow cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out, nether we lacke proper dayes of our Ladye, as he sayth, whereby he bewrayeth the grosse Idolatrie of Papistes, which are not content to honor our Sauiour Christ in his Sainctes, but the Sainctes must haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per dayes dedicated to their honor alone, and vtterly seperated from the honor of Christ. For it satisfieth not Bristow, that we keepe holy the annunciation &amp; purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Mary, because the one of them sayth he, is the conception, the other the presentation of Christ. But Papistes keepe her natiuitie, visitation, conception, and assumption, which are the proper dayes of our Lady. I passe ouer that he affirmeth the assumption of her body as a certaine truth, which the very popish lessons songe on that festiuitie, leaue in doubt, and incline rather to the contrary opinion, that the was assumpted onely in soule. Likewise that he calleth her the Lady of Saincts and Angels, which title the holy Scriptures doe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not giue vnto her, but plainly denye. For there is but one Lord <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. both of men and of Angels, which doth not onely exclude all other Lordes of the masculine gender, but much more all Ladyes, and generally sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth all principalitie, power, Lordship, and euery name that is named, both in this world and in the world to come. <hi>Eph,</hi> 1. 2. The Virgine Mary is therefore no La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Sainctes and Angells, but a fellow seruaunt of God

with them. <hi>Luke</hi> 1 48. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. 9. What excellency soeuer she hath of Gods gift, more then any of them. That we keepe no solemnitie of S. Lawrens, it is not for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his holines, nor for any worship of Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist and the Apostles, that we solemnize their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But therein the Churche vseth her libertie as in things indifferent. Whereas Bristow <hi>doubteth not that if any of vs would once be present at the reuerent solemne doing of the popish Catholike seruice, especially at Christmas, Easter or such like time, but it would melt our st<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

For first many thousands of vs, haue bene present, and with greefe of hart haue seene and beheld the doing of those Idolatrous solemnities. Secondly he declareth, how he him selfe is caried away with piping, singing, sensing, and swinging in copes &amp;c, so that he can not discerne the true worship of God, which is in spirite and veritie, from the carnall and counterfeit solemnities of Idolatry and superstition. Last of all, how childishly doth he referre all Catholike solemnitie to the vaine pompe vsed onely in great and Cathedrall Churches, when a thowsand pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>shes beside in the poore contrey townes, haue all their trashe so beggerly and rudely set forth, that the Papistes them selues laughe them to scorne. The rest of this motiue is spent in disswading Papists from learning our seruice, or sermons, or reading of our bookes, by which it is plain, that he so much mistrusteth his cause, that he dare not once permit his disciples to inquire of it, or to heare any thing that may be sayd to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As for popishe priestes that say the newe (as he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it) seruice, I woulde they woulde followe his councell to saye it no more. That it is not lawfull for Christians to communicate with heretiks, or Idolaters, it is a playne case: But it shall neuer be proued that they be heretikes, which teach nothing but the doctrine of holy Scripture, or that they are Idolaters, which are ready to giue their liues rather then to worship Idolls. But the yeare of Iubely is a greate motiue for greate
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2880:52"/>
fooles to embrace popery, which Iubely Pope Boniface the 8. did first institute in the veare of our Lord 1300 by apish or rather deuelish imitation of the fathers of the old testament for filthy lukers sake, beside the horrible blashemye of full remission of sinnes graunted by the Pope in that yeare, which is denied to be giuen by the death of Christ. As for the Iubely, which Bristow spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of anno 1575. is of a later institution ordeyned to be kept euery 25. yeare, because it was to long for the Pope to tary vntill the hundreth and 50. yeare, as Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface appoynted.

In the tyme of Eusebius that errour of praying for the deade was in deede receyued in many places of the Churche, which beganne first amonge the Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists. The ceremonies of exuf<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

As for Fraunces and Dominike such late leaders of the locustes, we rather thinke they are returned into the bottomlesse pit from whence they came, then that they be Saincts in heauen. But if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the rest by ignorance, Bristow asketh why we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne not Augustine, which was not ignoraunt of our doctrine, because he condemned it for most wicked he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie in Aerius, Iouinian and Vigilantius, who although they be our fathers, he sayth we are ashamed to blesse their memorie.

As for Vigilantius I finde him not reckened ether by Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius or Augustine for an heretike, or for one that erred in doctrine, although Hierom did write so bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against him, who likewise did write against Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine and Ruffinus, yet are nether of both accompted for heretikes. And AErius as he helde some truth with vs against prayer for the deade, so helde he also much popishe superstition and errour, for like the order of

That our preachers in pulpits, praise God for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of colledges and schooles, of learning, by name, what maketh this for allowance of their religion.

The name I say of Priesthood &amp; Priest must be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, either accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Etymologie &amp; deriuation, or els according to the present vse thereof. And according to the deriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this word Priest, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the greeke word Presbyteros signifieth the same o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>der, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by God, like as the word Bishop c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mming of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopus, for which if any man vse the name of Elder &amp; superintendent, he varieth nothing in the worlde, from the signification of Presbyter and Episcopus, and much lesse setteth vp a new order as Bristow most vainly doth cauill. For in that sence, we abhorre not the name of Priest &amp; Bishop. But when according to the present vse, this word Priest is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for him which in greke is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and in Latine <hi>Sacerdos</hi> that is one appointed to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a special sacrifice for which our English tongue hath none other worde but Priest as Bristow doth well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse: In this sence we deny that we haue any speciall Priesthoode or Priestes among vs but the only Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode and high Priest our Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Christ, and the generall Priesthoode that is common to all the Saynctes of God. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 16. But in the former sence, we haue the same office of Bishoppe, Elder or Priest which being ordeyned by the holy Ghost, hath continewed in the church vntill this time. But this will Bristowe disproue, by two reasons. First that aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Bishoppes and Priestes were made by Bishoppès
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2880:57"/>
and Priestes, and not by Kinges and Queenes: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were made to offer sacrifice, and euen for the deade. Concerning the first it is true that the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Priestes were so ordeyned, but it is a most impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent slaunder, that we are made Bishoppes or Priests by Kinges or Queenes. For the worlde knoweth we are ordeyned by the Bishoppes and Elders of the church and not by the Prince. But that the auncient Bishoppes and Elders of the church since Christ, were ordeyned to offer sacrifice for the quicke and the dead, it is vtterly false. <q>For albeit the auncient writers vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly vsed the names of Priest and sacrifice, yet did they neuer meane to set vp a newe Priesthoode or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, to ouerthrowe the only true Priesthode and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christes death as in many places of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges most manifestly doth appeare, but only they did continew a memory of the sacrifice of Christes death in the celebration of the Lordes supper <hi>Chris. ad Heb. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Hom.</hi> 17. and a sacrifice of prayse and thankesgeuing <hi>August. De ciuit.

                        </gap>rt ipsa offera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> This (sayth Augustine speaking of the sacrifice of thankesgeuing) is the sacrifice of Christians, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many are one bodie in Christ, which thing also the church frequenteth in the Sacrament of the altar well knowne to the faithfull, where it is shewed vnto her, that in the same oblation which she offereth, she her selfe is offered. Likewise <hi>cap.</hi> 20. speaking of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christes death he sayth. <hi>Per hoc &amp; Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos est, ipse offerens, ipse &amp; oblatio. Cuius rei sacramentum quotidianum esse voluit ecclesiae sacrificium, cum ipsius cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris ipse sit caput, &amp; ipsius capitis ipsa sit corpus, tam ipsa per ipsum quam ipse per ipsam suetus offerri.</hi> By this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so he is a Priest, he him selfe offering and he him selfe being the oblation. Of which thing he would haue the dayly sacrifice of the church to be a Sacrament, seeing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2880:58"/>
that of her beinge his bodie he is the heade, and of him being her heade she is the bodie, as well she by him, as he by her, being accustomed to be offered.</q> So that the errour of praying for the deade which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled within three hundreth yeares after Christ, was at the first, without blasphemie of sacrificing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of Christ for the quicke and the deade. In this foure and twentie demaunde Bristowe as keth further whether in the auncient Church there were not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, Acolytes, Exorcistes, dore keepers &amp;c. I aunswere there were such offices, appoynted for ayde of diuerse partes of the ministerie, whereof the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes reteyne only the names, without any exercise of the offices. And the offices were suche for the most parte, as were proper for the tyme of persecution, and as they had no instruction of the worde of God but were ordeyned by the Church, so by the Church they are thought vnnecessarie. In the forty eight demaunde which is a parte of this motiue, he asketh whether their Church only hath not grace in her Sacramentes, merite in her workers, force in her worde, power in her teaching, her children the saddest sorte of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, men of best order in families, townes, and cities, &amp;c. I aunswere, the Popish Church hath no Sacraments but such as she falsely vsurpeth, namely the Sacrament of baptisme, which as Augustine sayth against the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natistes, may be geuen out of the true Church, but hath no vertue or grace but in the true Church. <q>As for merite of workes is blasphemous agaynste the mercie of God. <hi>Vnde mihi tantum meriti est</hi> (sayth Ambrose <hi>Ad virgin. exhort.) cui indulgentia pro coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naest.</hi> Whence shoulde I haue so great merite see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercie is my crowne.</q> And touching force of her worde and power of her teaching, if there were not greater terrour of her tyrannie and allurement in her worldly glorie she shoulde haue fewer partakers. For except the efficacie of errour which God hath sent for the punishment of the vnbeleeuing worlde, she hath
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2880:58"/>
no power of the worde of God, nor of his holy spirite, to conuert the hearts of men to Christe, but externall intisements like Mermaydes songes, to seduce men to their destruction. And as for her Children the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, although some bee more modest then the reste, as ther be euen among the Turkes and Heathen, none ate more light, vaine, disordered, proude, proude, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull, couetous, worldly, luxurious, malicious, and cruell, not onely at Rome, and abrode, where they bee in their ruffe, but euen heere in Englande, where they haue not all their will. I except a fewe, which bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceiued, not of malice but of ignoraunce, God in time may bring to the knowledge of the trueth, if they be not dissemblers and seeke by all meanes to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselues from it.</p>
               <p>Furthermore how e maliciously he slaundereth the Church of God let God himselfe reuenge, where hee sayth, we haue no preaching of Penaunce, no grace in sacramentes, nothing but sinne in good woorkes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be doone in Christe. No power to bringe vnder Deuils, no blessing, no comforte, yea that all followers bee they neuer so wicked and flagitious, haue they onely fayth and no doubte, they shall bee saued. And yet the forgetfull Lyer confesseth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, that wee affirme that true fayth cannot bee without true and perfect doctrine, nor without good woorkes.</p>
               <p>But what Fayth doe you preach or teach (sayth Bristowe) <hi>Not that Christian fayth which is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Articles of our Creede, but a speciall Fayth, or an vudoubted perswasion that hee is predestinate.</hi> How soeuer therefore it bee that Bristowe is disposed for to lye and rayle, they that either heare our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons or reade our Bookes of Iustification by Faith onely, doe knowe that wee teach none other Faith by which a manne may bee iustifyed, but euen that Faith, which is onely contayned in the Articles of our Creede. The very firste woorde whereof
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2880:59"/>
I beleue, teacheth not the implicite faith of the papists, but a speciall and singular faith and truste that euerye Christian man must haue in God the father and in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, which was conceiued, borne, deade, risen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, &amp;c. for vs, and in the holy Ghoste, by whome the vertue of Christes conception, natiuirie, suffring, death, resurrection, and assention, is communicated to vs, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members of the Catholike church, in which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue forgiuenes of sinnes, and thereby beeing made righteous, wee receiue the rewarde of righteousnesse, which is the resurrection vnto glory, and the life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, which was prepared for vs before the world was made, which faith no blasphemous heretikes can haue, that deny any of these Articles, what perswasion soeuer they haue, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> faith the Papists haue not, which neuer put their trustin God by Iesus Christe, but in their owne woorkes &amp;c, nor yet haue any certaintie of their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereas all they that truely put their trust in God, shall not be confounded. From which faith the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists are so farre, that they think it not conuenient that the people should know and rehearse the articles of the Creede in the mother toung, although nowe of late, they haue set foorth English cathechismes, as Apes of the true Church, not that their Disciples might haue more knowledge, seing they hold that ignorance is the mother of Deuotion, but that they see they cannot though for shame they would conceale this knowledge from them. And when they cannot hinder them of the knoweledge of the Articles of faith, howe I pray you doe they teach them to beleeue them? Euen with an historicall faith, which is none others then such as the deuill beleeueth, namely that there is one God, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christe was borne, crucyfied, ascended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the 17. Demaunde he asketh vs whether we reade not that the Christians of the Primitiue church, had an ordinary power and office to cast out diuels, which we acknowledge that we haue not, but the Papistes haue.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2880:59"/>
To this I aunswere, that in the Primitiue church were diuerse giftes of healing, casting out of Deuils &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of miracles, which were temporall, and are long since ceased to be ordinary, and therefore wee doe in deede confesse that we haue no such ordinary power. Neither doe we beleue that the papists haue any such, what iugling or counterfaiting of miracles soeuer is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, their forgery hath to often beene tryed to their shame.</p>
               <p>To conclude, our Church hath Christ and his spirit, and therefore all graces &amp; blessings whatsoeuer Christ hath promised to be perpetuall in the same, to the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his elect and the glory of his name.</p>

               <p>But Bristow replyeth that it was not the Popish church vnto whome Constantine and the rest of the Christian Emperours yeelded vp the imperiall Cittie of Rome, with all the countrie of Italie. What an impudent lye this is, may easely be knowen of all them, which haue read the historyes which testifie that the Emperors of Constantinople receiued possession in Rome and Italy vntill the time of Charles the great, which was made Emperour by the Pope. In the demaunde Bristowe asketh if the first Christian Emperonrs, Constantinus, Theodosius, were not in all pointes of the popishe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?

               <p>To this I aunswere, we will bee tryed by the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of Peter and his fellow Apostles, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament lawe for Religion and seruice of God, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nig the substance thereof vrgeth not Peter to chaunge his commission, nor to vse any other seruice then they them selues haue taught vs to vse. If Augustine were aliue and in Englande, hee was a man of such mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and loue of the trueth, that seeing the same plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuealed out of the holy Scriptures, hee woulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracte
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2880:62"/>
his errour of Prayer for the deade, as when hee lyued hee retracted and sette foorth manye thinges, wherein he founde that he hadde erred. As for the fine of an hundred Markes, he woulde not haue lefte nor beene depriued of his Byshoprike and imprysoned for saying of the popishe Masse, for hee neuer sayde any in his life, but was an vtter enemye to the chiefe poyntes thereof, allowing nothing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of but prayer for the deade at the celebration of the Lords supper.</p>
               <p>And for as our Sauiour Iesus Christ, the King of all Kinges and Lorde of all Lordes, and the onely ruler of Heauen and earth, doe you thinke that hee wyll not complaine that hee onely by Parliament lawe is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knoweledged to bee the heade of his vniuersall Church, and so continually present therewith by his holy spirit, that he neede no viear generall of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall manne, which canne occupye but one place, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were neuer so diligent and painfull to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his dutie in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>For his diuine and spirituall authoritie, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded vnder the name of forraine power, as Bristowe not more slaunderously then ridiculously affirmeth. Yet hee pleaseth him selfe so much in so greate folly and madnesse, that hee sayth, Christe coulde not clayme to be heade of his Church, excepte he should clayme to be the naturall Kinge of Englande, and to haue sayde vnto Pylate, My kingdome is of this world and thy maister Caesar doth me wronge. As though the King of Englande, by title of his royall power, clayming to be the chiefe Seruaunte or deputie of Christe, in gouerning his Churche according to his worde, did exclude the soueraignitie of Christe which he hath ouer his Church and elect, wheresoeuer they are vpon the face of the earth.</p>

               <p>The popish Church was not persecuted by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperous, but the Catholike church of Christ, <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> The popish Church is not of so great antiquitie, that shee had then any shewe in the worlde, although the misterie of iniquitie did then woorke and euen in the Apostles time. The Heathens, Turks and Iewes, doe no more hate the popish church; then they doe the church of God which is in England. The warres against the Turke be at this day maintained by the states of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, which are of our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aswel as by the Papists, That there is no publike ayde sent against the Turk out of England, it is not in any allowaunce of Turkish reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion but because the state seeth it not necessary neither was there any publike ayde sente an hundreth yeeres be ore the reuolte from Papistrie. And yet euen in the Queenes maiesties raigne, there hath gone ayde out of England against Soliman which died at the siege of Segesto, where diuers noble Gentlemen of Englande goinge on their owne charges as Bizia testifieth wan more true glory then they that 2. or 3. hundred yeeres before vpon a superstitious vowe were signed with the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2880:64"/>
crosse to fight against the Saracens, for the possession of the earthly Ierusalem. How often shall I aunswer, that the first christian Emperours were not conuerted from Idolatry to Christianitie by the popish Church, but the later Christian Emperours, by her haue bene peruerted from the true worship of God, vnto Idolatry. That the Emperours being conuerted from Idolatry, did pray at Peter the fishermans sepulchre (as Augustine sayth) it sheweth the vertue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospel of Christ that had made so great alteration in them, but nothing at all proueth the authoritie or any error of the popish Church, for Augustine sayth not that they prayed vnto Peter, but at the sepulcher of Peter, meaning in the Church that was builded vpon the place, that was supposed to be the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of Peter. The lawes that those Emperours made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Idolaters, may well serue against the Papistes, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> are as grosse in all kindes of Idolatry as the Gentills for the most part were. Finally it was not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popish Church, but the Church of Christ, that suppressed the heresies of the Arrians, Sabellians, Nestorians &amp;c. But Iouinian did let out of hell Priestes and Nunnes mariage, which gate not the Church of Protestantes, but our Church (sayth Bristow) hath stopped. The Church that striued against Iouinian, was nether for mariage of Priestes, of whom many thowsands were maryed in that tyme, yea and a thowsande yeares after, nor yet for mariage of such as had vowed virginitie, and could not contayne, when both Epiphanius the hatchet of heresies, and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erome that greatest aduersary of Iouinian, agree that they ought to marye. <hi>Epiph. cont.

               <p>Nether were Epiphanius, Philaster, and Augustine, which disalow the opinion of Aerius, concerning pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the dead, members of the popish church, for this one error which they held, seeing they hold the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall substance of religion against the Papists, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the word of God.

Sauing that in the demaundes, they are sundered, as though euery one of them without the other two, were a sufficient tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of truth, which nether Vincentius nor Optatus, nor Augustine, nor any that vsed this argument did euer meane. But that is truth, which being most auncient, hath at all tymes, of all true Christians, by general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent bene receyued. But this can not be proued of any one error of poperye. For if any of these three be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the argument is of no force to proue truth. All nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by generall consent embraced Idolatrie. yet was the true worship of God which was knowen onely in Iurye

the more auncient. The worship of Iupiter was more auncient, then the honor of Christ shewed in the flesh, and more vniuersally receyued, but not of the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of God. As for generall councells, which in the demaund of consent, he sayth to be all against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, he is not able to shewe one approued generall councel, that was held within six hundreth yeares after Christ, that decreed any thing contrary to that which we beleue in any poynt. But confessing that in many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges some there haue bene in some poyntes of our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet he sayth we can shewe no lyneall succession, but leape from Luther to Christ, without any recorde of our religion in all the meane tyme, hauing no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of such Church nether in leafe or lyne of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice booke: As one that loueth antiquities well, I would fayne see, what leaues the Papistes can shewe of their seruice bookes, to proue a lyneall desc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But Bristow wil proue, that we were neuer before this time. For as for AErius, he knoweth we are ashamed of him. But he will proue that nether Hus, nor Wicklefe were Protestants. Because they held some opinions, that we doe not. By the same reason he may proue, that the fathers of the councels of Constance and Basil were no Papists, because they tooke vpon them to depose Popes and decreed that the councell was aboue the Pope, which most Papistes at this day dare not affirme. AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas Syluius doth slaunder Wicklefe and Hus, that for euery mortall sinne a Magistrate should lose his office,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2880:65"/>
for their Apologies are extant to be seene to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>But Luther (sayth he) denyeth that he was an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, affirming that Hus was not of his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Although he had bene in all poyntes of his opinion, as he was in the chiefe, yet might Luther iustly deny the name of a man, which is proper to sectaries as Franciscanes, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicanes &amp;c, &amp; not to Christians. Yet Wicklefe (sayth he) is condemned by Melanthon. How I pray you? First that he found many errors in him, by which iudgement might be made of his spirite. If Wicklefe liuing in a time of so great blindnes and darkenes, coulde not see the truth in all matters, it was no maruell, and that he had errors, he sheweth that he was a man, euen as the best writers of the Church since the Apostles tyme, which might be deceyued: But as we condemne not Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, Hierom, Chrysostom, Cyprian, and other aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent writers, because we know rhey erred in some things, no more haue we iust cause to cond emne Wicklefe for some errors which it is not vnlike, but he did holde, yea but Melanthon chargeth Wicklefe (sayth he) to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignoraunt of the righteousnes of faith, which is the foundation of religion. I will rather thinke that Melanthon was ignoraunt of Wicklefes opinion, as one which had not seene but fewe of his workes. In which as perhaps he might vse the tearmes of merit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing, then commonly vsed in his tyme, yet that he had not the same meaning in them, but did well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and holde the righteousnes which is of fayth, I can playnely proue by his owne writings in diuerse pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As vpon the <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. he sayth: <q>
                     <hi>Sith Christ is God and man, satisfaction for the sinne that he made thus freely, is better then any other that man or Angell might make. The same man in nowmber that sinned in Adam our first fadir, the same man in nowmber made asseeth by the second Adam Christ. And sith he is more of vertue then the first Adam might be, and his payne is much more then sinnefull lust of the first Adam, who shoulde haue conscience here, that</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:2880:66"/>
                     <hi>ne this sinne is clansid all orst. And sith our Iesu is very God that neuer man forfete this mede, he is a sufficient medicine for all sinners that bene contrite, for Christ is euer and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and in all such soules by grace, and so he clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth more cleanely then any bodye or figure may clense, and herefore as Poule sayth, Christ is mediator of the newe lawe, &amp;c.</hi> Agayne vpon 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>Seeth mans thinking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge his werkes, seemeth moste in his power, and yet his thought mote come of God, much more eche other werke of man &amp;c. Thus should we put of pride and wholly trusten in Iesu Christ, for he that may not thinke of him selfe, may doe nought of him selfe, but all our sufficiencie is of God by the meane of Iesu Christ.</hi> Likewise vpon the 8. to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes. <hi>Sith God susteyneth man and moueth him and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth him for to trauell, how had it not come of grace, and thus reward of this trauell mote needes all come of grace.</hi>
                  </q> These places and many other shewe that Wicklefe was not ignorant of the righteousnes of fayth. It seemeth therefore that Melancthon had seene only the articles which his aduersaries had gathered against him, and not his owne writings and discourses.</p>
               <p>The prophecyes, which Bristow boasteth to be for their religion, be of Ieremye and Esay, for the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall continuance of the true Church of Christ, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is proued that the popish Church hath not bene from the beginning, those prophecyes appertayne not vnto her. How the Church is visible, is shewed in the 37. motiue whereunto I adde, that while the Papistes glory of a visible Church on earth, Ierusalem that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and therefore not subiect to the eyes of earthly men, but of such whose conuetsation is in heauen, is the mother of vs all. Finally if Bristow coulde as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proue, as he doth boldly say, that no Scripture is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, but all for them, he shoulde haue no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants to be his aduersaries, who more accept of the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, then of all other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues in the world.</p>

               <p>Such seedes of our doctrine (sayth Bristowe) as haue growne before this time, did alwayes growe in euell <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> grounde, namely in heretikes as denyall of prayer for the deade in Aerius, who beside that errour was an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian. He chargeth vs also with denying the ordinarie fast of the church, but that is false. For we hold that the fast which is appointed by the church, ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, although we hold that no man is bounde to the blasphemous, superstitious, and counterfait fast of the Popish synagogue. In that time in which Aerius liued, there were other times of fasting appointed, then such as the Popishe church obserueth. <hi>But the wedsnesday fast</hi> (sayth Bristowe) <hi>the church hath released.</hi> In what gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councell good Sir: are you able to shewe: likewise of other times of fast named in Epiphanius? if you be not able to shew this where is either your vniuersalitie, antiquitie, or succession in doctrine and discipline, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption.</p>
               <p>More the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this (sayth he) Aerius did hold, that a Bishop &amp; a Priest be equall, which also the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne. In preaching the word and ministring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. S.

Furthermore one of the Protestantes seedes is, that we must not pray to Saints,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2880:67"/>
but this was held of certayne heretikes in S. Bernardes time who were called Apostolici &amp; were also Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes, denying the baptisme of infantes. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is, that these opinions can not be good, because they are founde in some heretikes. And the contrary opinion must needes be true, because they are found in some holy men, as in S. Athanasius, Epiphanius, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine. &amp;c. Although these opinions are but fewe in comparison of so many articles of religion, in whiche we dissent from the Papistes, which if they coulde be founde in heretikes, we should soone heare of them: yet what Logike is in this conclusion of Bristow, you shall see by examples of the like, and euen of the same heretikes. Aerius, as Augustine reporteth out of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre, did also receiue into his felowship none but suche as wete continent, and had so renounced the worlde, that they possessed nothing in common, likewise they abstayned from fleshe.

               <p>I neede not to shewe, how often and how vainly Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe repeateth one thing, to make a great number of motiues. The euerlasting continuaunce of the true church hath bene seuen times at least before alleaged. But neither is it proued that the Popish church is that true church, nor yet that any sect or companie which shall continewe to the ende of the worlde is the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church of Christ. For although Antichrist is and shall be more and more consumed with the breath of the Lordes mouth, which is his holie worde yet shall he not be altogether abolished vntill the ende of the worlde. Yea at the ende of the worlde, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ sayeth, fayth shall be verie scant, and hard to be founde, and iniquitie shall haue the vpper hande. Therefore there shall be a great church of malignant hypocrytes euen to the ende of the worlde. It is true therefore, that Christes church is sure to continewe but not whatsoeuer sect shall continew, is thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be Christes true church. How vayne his bragge is, that Protestantes doe decaye: and shall come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, by their dayly increase in all partes of the world, God be thanked may be seene to all men. Likewise how true it is, which he affirmeth that Papistes doe increase, and to such numbers euen in Englande that there are more Papistes nowe, then when the Gospell was first preached, (notwithstandinge so many yeares prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of vs and large silence of them) who liuing in Englande can be ignoraunt? I confesse there are too many obstinate Papistes in Englande whome none of Bristowes motiues, hath either moued vnto Poperie, or confirmed therein, but onely great tolleration and lenitie which is vsed in these times. But if such seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie were vsed nowe, as in times past, the Pope shoulde not haue many confessors in Englande to glorie of. And to say the truth, what one of these Papistes, dare
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2880:68"/>
professe what he thinketh of the Popes auctoritie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the lawe is somewhat sharpe in that poynt. If the like lawe were of hearing masse we should haue as fewe suffer for masse as for the supremacie. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to our motiue <q>S. Augustine doth well to send Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratus the Manichee to followe that way of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrine which from Christ him selfe by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles is descended vnto vs, and from hence to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie shall descende. <hi>De vtilit. cred. cap.</hi>

And if the tradition be vncerteyne, how shall we know what came from Christ and his Apostles, but that which we finde in the Gospell of Christ and the Epistles of his Apostles.</p>
               <p>But the same Augustine (sayeth Bristow) biddeth the simple Donatistes to <q>

                  </q> Augustine speaketh of the Catholike church, which was the vine, whereof the Church of Rome at that tyme was but a growing braunch. For a litle before he sayth, <q>

But the place of Augustine which he citeth, is of the Church of Christ and not of Peters seate, round about the which, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes haue barked in vaine.

               <p>But Luther is charged to be a false Prophet, for that he sayth in his booke against King Henry, <q>That he was sure that he had his doctrines from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine should stand and the Pope should fall. That God should see whether first be wery and faile, the Pope or Luther.</q> The note of a false Prophet in Deu. 18 is to geue a signe which doth not follow, &amp; so hath Luther doone sayth Bristow. For Zwinglius hath ouercome Luther &amp; Caluine Zwinglius and the Puritans the Protestants in England. To this I aunswere, that Luther doth not take vpon him to foreshew things to come by any speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but only affirmeth that his doctrine in as much as it is agreable to the word of God, is from heauen, &amp; shall continewe, whereas the Popes doctrine being the doctrine of the deuill shall come to naught. And in this victorie, (if he please so to tearme it) hath not the Pope loste by preuayling of Zwinglius and Caluine. And was that opinion of Luther which they haue impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned, I meane of the carnall presence Luthers or the Popes? But whereas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> slanderous hypocrite, would make men think, that Caluine hath opposed himselfe against the doctrine of Zwinglius, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of the churches of Heluetia w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them of Sabaudia being publikely set forth to the worlde, doth openly testifie the contrarie. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the contention of those whom he calleth Puritanes in Englande, is not so great, nor about so great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that any such diuision is to be feared, which might cause desolation of the kingdome. Adde hereunto that Bristow sayd in the 40. motiue, that the Protestantes of England be in a manner all in heart Puritanes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he confesseth against him selfe, that there can be no

               <p>First he would haue it proponed by a Catholike, to his frend that is in heretike, to be considered, seing al these motiues beginning with holy Scripture, approued tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp;c. be for them &amp; agai st vs, what is the cause that we cry so shamelesly &amp; deceitfully the Gospel, the word of the Lorde, the touchstone of Gods booke?

Forsooth sayth Bristow, they all confesse it many wayes indirectly.

To the second I say, that if only Scripture be on our side it is more then all the rest against the Scripture, and againe if only Scripture be on ourside, then al the motiues be not on their side, for Scripture is one of them, the 8. in the motiues the first in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes. But the Papist <hi>must make his frend say as much directly or els say expressely to euery one of them whether he will be tried by them.</hi> As a frende to the presones, though

an enemie to the errours of such Papistes as are cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. I haue sayd expressely and particularly to euerie one of them, sheweing whether it be a true and proper note of the church, and if it be, that it belongeth to vs and not to them. Although Bristow say, <hi>that this way we know full well that they shall haue the victorie flying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euermore to our weake &amp; false castle of only Scripture.</hi> That the scripture onely is our castle, we do gladly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte, but that the same is a most strong true &amp; impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable castle, none but a blasphemous heretike will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. <hi>But you must</hi> (saith Bristow) <hi>still labour to get them (&amp; if you can) with their consent, out of the castle into the plaine fieldes aforesayde, to make them graunt expressely that there in your handes they can not stande.</hi> Nay Bristow you must beate vs from our castell if you can, for we will neuer consent to goe out of it for defense, except it be to offer you the aduauntage, not in the playne fieldes as you cal it, but among your pettie piles and small holdes. And so we haue done often. So did that reuerende father the Bishoppe of Salisburie, in that noble challenge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you were shamefullie foyled in your owne grounde and many of your fortes beaten about your eares. But you doe not well to teach your schollers to seeke a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aduersarie to fight withall, which must first of all be willing to laye downe his sworde and shielde and then you are good enough for him with your manlie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues with which when you haue treandled him about like a tenis ball, you sende him backe agayne to his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell of onely Scripture, to see whether they will beare him out in his opinions.

But that Iames speaketh of a dead faith as his wordes are playne <hi>Vers.</hi> 17. and of iustification before men. Paule of a liuing faith and of iustification in the sight of God. The third example is out of Iames 5. Where I must first note, that Bristow in translation doth manifestly corrupt &amp; falsefie the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. The Latine is, <hi>Infirmatur quis in vobis? If any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest you be daungerously sicke let him send for the Priests of the church and they to pray ouer him anealing him with oyle in the name of our Lord &amp;c.</hi> First Bristow addeth this word daungerously of his owne heade, which is neither in the Greeke nor vulgare Latine text, to draw the text of Iames violently, to their popish greasing which they vse only when a man is desperatly sicke, and past hope of recouerie in thei<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The other two examples out of the 2. of Machabees the one of praying for the deade, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Ieremie praying for the people, are no partes of the castell of Canonicall Scripture, and therefore with other errours in the same bookes I omit them. The
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2880:71"/>
last exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple is out of Genesis 48. The saying of Iacob the Patriarke of Iosephs two childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. God who hath fed me from my youth euen to this day: The Angell who hath deliuered me out of all aduersities, blesse these children which is (sayth Bristow) <hi>as if one would say, God and our Ladie blesse them.</hi> Nay rather God by Iesus Christ blesse them, for what other Angell but Christ the Angell of the great councell was the deliuerer of Iacob, which when he wrestled with him in a vision and mystery <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. he doubted not to call God. Euen the same Angell which led the children of Israel through the wildernes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Paul 1. Cor. 10. calleth Christ, who was not an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel by nature but by office, &amp; in that as the Mediator he was sent to deliuer the people before he came in the flesh. But if we should vnderstand, the Angell of whom Iacob speaketh, for so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e priuate Angel, appointed of God to protect him, yet is it not as if one would say now God &amp; our Lady blesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For that God vseth the ministery of Angels to defend &amp; prosper his seruaunts, but not the ministery of Saincts in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for any such purpose that we can learne by the holy Scriptures. Iacob might ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God would send his Angell to protect those children, euen as he had done for him.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2880:72"/>
but in the Hauen it selfe, that all the Cables of popishe motiues, or blasts of Diuelish doctrines shal not be able to stirre our ship from thence: which course God grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t them to keepe, who labouring in the sea of doubtfulnes, ride not wilfully among the rocks of Romish pride, nor be obstinately set on the sands of mens traditions, but seeke trueth in humilitie to Gods glory &amp; their safetie.</p>
               <p>Besids these motiues there are two demands which I cannot aptely reduce to any of the Motiues, namely the seconde which he termeth the building of the Church, and the laste which hee calleth Apostasie. In the former demaund he asketh vs whether we haue not read this argument vsed by Chrisostome againste the Painims and Iewes, that Christe is God, because his Church hauing but a small beginning, &amp; many stronge enemyes, to withstand the building thereof, yet could or can neuer be suppressed, but contrariwise of a litle spark hath set all the world on fire &amp;c. I answere, we haue read this argument, and allowe of it. Then sayth Bristowe, <hi>How hath it beene these many hundreth yeeres quite suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, yea and in Chrisostomes time no Church at all</hi> I answere that since it was first set vp, it was neuer for one houre quite suppressed, although by Antichriste these many hundred yeeres it hath beene greatly oppressed. And in Chrysostomes time the Church did openly florishe, although infected with some errors, yet holding strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the only tradition Iesus Christ, which church was a member of the same vniuersall Church, whereof our Church at this day is a parte, with which Church in Chrysostoms time, the popish church in that it disse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth from vs, hath nothing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon except one or two errors, hauing the whole substance of doctrine contrary vnto it: wherefore that argument sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, the popish church is nothing vnderpropped thereby: which though it had a small beginning, as the sect of Mahomet, yet grew it by sufferance of God, without great withstanding of strong enemies, yea God sending the effecacy of error, that it might preuaile and yet hath not increased ouer all <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now to the laste demaund of Apostasie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he chargeth vs. Firste for chaunging the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, wherevpon must insue a chaunge of the law. so this I aunswere, we haue chaunged no priesthoode, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by God, but retaine that eldership and ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordayned by our Sauiour Christe. Contrarywise the Pope hath changed <hi>Sacerdotium</hi> (which Bristowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth to be no other thing then presbiteratum) which is the ministration of the Gospel yet commonly called both of him and vs Priesthood, that Sacrificing priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood I say w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> the Apostle He. 7. affirm<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th to be euerlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and proper to the person of our Sauiour Christe, hath the Pope translated vnto his shaueli gs, and sette them vp to offer that Sacrifice which Christ only could offer, and by once offering found eternall redemption: yea the Priesthood of Melchisedech which the Lord by an othe confirmed only to our sauiour Christ. Psal. 100. Hee hath made common to all his Massemongers, Therfore the Pope hath manifestly made an Apostacy from the lawe of Christ.</p>
               <p>The second argument by which Bristow would charge vs with Apostasie is, <hi>for receiuing not one or two, but so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny olde heresies, besides as he is bolde to say a thousand more of their owne inuention.</hi> This beeing affirmed without all shew of proofe. It shall suffice to deny and turne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto him and his fellowes.</p>
               <p>The third argument is <hi>for taking from Christian men, so many arguments of Christes diuinitie, as the inuincible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuaunce and authoritie of his Church. The honor and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of crosses and reliques miracles, exorcismes, vnitie, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice &amp;c.</hi> I aunswere so many of these as are good and sufficient argumentes, wee holde still, the vnsufficient arguments doe rather disfornish then arme the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

faith, which we haue so strongly fortified with arguments out of the holy scriptures that all the power of darkenesse cannot preuaile against it,</p>
               <p>The fourth argument is, <hi>for leauing nothing vndenyed, not Fathers, not Councels, not Traditions, not Scriptures, nor (the onely witnesse of all canonicall Scriptures) the Churches institution, and departing from the Fathers of all ages since Christes time, agreeing with no Christian time, nor none with them.</hi> For denying of canonicall Scriptures, it is an impudent slaunder, as for Fathers, Councelles, Traditions, Churches authoritie, we affirme or deny, as they agree or dissagree with the trueth of the holye scriptures, the onely certaine witnesse of the will of God reuealed vnto men, which we thinke more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable then the Papistes doe, whiche denie, fathers, Councels, Traditions, yea the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, and submit all vnto the i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dgement of their Church, now when then the controuersie is, whether they be the Church of God, or of the Deuill: whereas the Scriptures are of bothe partes confessed to be the worde of God in generall termes, although in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the authoritie of their Church, Piggius calleth the holy Scripture a nose of Wax, and a dumbe iudge. Eccius tearmeth the written gospel a black Gospel and an inkish diuinitie. Hosius sayth, that this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of Christe, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> beeing vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode doth appertaine vnto laye men, contrary to their Churches determination, is the expresse worde of the Deuill. And for departing from the faith of the Fathers &amp;c. I aunswere it is false, there is but one true Faith of all true Christians, in al times from which wee will neuer departe, although wee haue departed from some erroneous opinions of some fathers, which because they are contrary to the woorde of God, by hearing whereof Faith commeth, they deserue not the name of Faith.</p>
               <p>Finally, whereas hee sayth, the authoritie of the Church is the onely witnesse of all canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2880:74"/>
it is vntrue. For although he should meane not the popish Sinagogue, butthe true catholike church of Christ, yet is it not the onely witnesse of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For euen the Iewish Synagogue, is witnesse of the olde testament, and many sectes of heresies of all the scripture, beside that the spirit of God is the chiefe and principall witnes of all, which speaketh so euidently in allthe canonical scripture, that if all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on earth should refuse to giue credite vnto them, yet his maiestie alone is sufficient to get credite vnto them, especially with all those whome he teacheth inwardly in heart, as he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth sensibly to their eares.</p>
               <p>The last argument is, <hi>That in place of all Religion and goodnes which they haue remoued, deuising a new Gospel of their foresaid onely vaine fayth, which teacheth all sinnes &amp; all heresies to presume of saluation.</hi> What can bee more impudent or false then this slaunder, seeing God and the worlde knoweth, that wee teach none other Faith but the fayth of the Gospell, which worketh by loue, and promiseth remission of sinnes and saluation to none, but such as earnestly repent, and are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to remoue all heresie, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all true Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and goodnesse.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Concerning the omission of titles accustomed to be giuen to the Archbishop of Canterbury, for which you excuse your selfe, I thinke M. D. Parker while he liued, did not much esteeme them giuen to him by any man, and least of all looked to receyue them at suche mens handes as you are: but touching the religion &amp; church, whereof he was a minister, I will aunswer you in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe and of all other ministers and members thereof, that no excuse will serue you, vpon so slender reasons as you bringe, to condemne the same of schisme and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, nor to defend that Synagogue of Satan, wherof you professe your selfe to be a Champion, to be the vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Church and spouse of Christ. For thinke you M. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that we wil more mislike the Church of Christ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by the hypocriticall crueltie of Antichrist for the space of 5. or. 6. hundreth yeares before our age, then we do the same, persecuted by the furious rage of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish tyrantes, for 300. yeares after the first planting of the same amonge the Gentills. And thinke you if we are now to learne, that all that glory and bright shining of Christes Church promised by the Prophets, is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and not carnall, heauenly and not earthly, eternal &amp; not transitory? Or that we know not your synagogue to be the very contrary kingdome and sea of Antichrist, euen by that outward glory, and glistering pompe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen shewe, that you boast of, according to the prophecy of Christ in the reuelation? <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. &amp; 17. And as for the citie built vpon an hill, whereof you haue neuer doone babling, by the playne context of the Gospel, is not the whole Church, but euery true pastor and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster thereof, who are also the light of the worlde, the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2880:75"/>
salt of the earth, and a candle set on a candlesticke, to giue light, not hiden vnder a bushell to be vnprofitable. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. And Christ hath alwayes bene with his Church, although the Church of Rome be departed from him, and he both liueth &amp; raigneth for euer, ouer the house of Iacob, though he be persecuted in his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers by the whore of Babylon, and his name is great amonge the Gentilles, from the Sunne rising to the going downe thereof, notwithstanding that all nations haue dronke of the cuppe of her fornications. The prophecyes of Gods spirit doe not one of them ouerthrow the other, but the one sheweth how the other is to be vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And whereas you say our Church hath bene vnder a bushell before these fiftie yeares, because no historie maketh mention of any congregation professing our faith in any townes or places of diuers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tryes at once, I aunswer this is as true as all your doctrine beside. For all auncient histories that write of the state of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, make mention of the same faith which we professe. And although towarde the reuelation of Antichrist, the puritie of the faith beganne to be pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet the substance thereof continued, vntill by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, that great defection &amp; apostasie was made, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apostle prophecyeth 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 3. And yet euen in the tyme of that a postasie, many histories make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the continuance of our faith and Church in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers contryes in Europe, namely England, Fraunce, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, or although vnder cruell persecution and tyranny, beside great nations of the East, which neuer submitted them selues to the Church of Rome, and yet retayned the substance of Christian faith and profession, though not without particular errors and superstition. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although they that were blind, or farre of from the Church of Christ, could not see her glory, although she had bene set vpon neuer so high an hill, no more then a citie built vpon the Alpes, can be seene in England, yet they that had spirituall eyes, and by Gods gr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The heathen tyrants, thought by their cruell perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, that they had vtterly rooted out the name and nation of Christians from the face of the earth.

By these inscriptions and glorious titles you see, that the heathenish tyrants, perswaded them selues, that they had vtterly defaced the religion of Christ, &amp; destroyed his Church out of the worlde. what maruell then, if Antichrist and his adherents, which to the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the former tyrants haue added most detestable hypocrisy, haue thought that they had so wholy subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the true religion of Christ and his true Church, that the name ether of Church or religion, might not seeme to haue remayned in the world, but that of the Romish Antichrist. But as Nero the Pontif. Maximus of Rome,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2880:76"/>
with Diocletiane and the reste were deceyued in their time, so their successors in place, office, and wickednes, the Popes of Rome are likewise disapoynted of their cruell purpose.</p>
            <p>But M. Sander glorieth that in all markes and signes of the true Church, the popish Church doth excel ours. But first of all, that which is the onely true marke and triall of the Church, namely the word of God, he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be a sufficient marke of the true Church, yet had he before confessed the Church to be the piller and stay of truth. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. but the rule of truth (if we beleue our Sauiour Christ) is the word of God <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17. 17. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word of God is the onely true tryall and marke of the Church.</p>
            <p>But let vs consider his reasons, by which he woulde perswade vs that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God is not the chiefe marke whereby the true Church of God may be knowen. First he sayth the marke whereby an other thing is knowne, ought it selfe to be most exactly knowne, wheras we are not agreed what Gods word is. Note this reason of his, by which he taketh away all authoritie and vse from the worde of God, not onely thereby to discerne the true Church, but also to teache vs any other thinge that is needefull for vs to know. But why I pray you are we not agreed what is Gods word? Forsooth because some cal onely the written letter and the meaning thereof Gods word, other thinke many thinges are Gods word which are not expressely written, but deliuered by tradition from the Apostles, and by the holy Ghost, which hath written his lawes in our hartes: of this later sort be the Papists, but they are easily confuted. For this principle must needes stand vnmoueable, that Gods spirite is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer contrary to him selfe. Therefore seeing the spirite of God hath pronounced of the Scriptures, that they are able to make the man of God perfect prepared to all good workes. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. it is certayne that God hath reuealed nothing by tradition, for our instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is not conteyned in his worde written, much lesse any
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2880:77"/>
thing that is contrary to his doctrine deliuered in the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>His second reason is, that we are not agreed vpon the written word of God, because the Protestants doe not admitte so many bookes of the olde testament as the Catholikes doe. I aunswer, the Protestants doe admit as many as the Catholike Church euer did or doth at this day. His third reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that the meaning of those bookes which we are agreed vpon, is altogether in question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene vs, therfore that can be no marke of the church, which it self is not knowne. I answer, although heretikes which are ouerthrowen in their owne conscience, will acknowledge no meaning to be true but their owne, yet are there many principles in the Scriptures so playne, as they are graunted by both partes, or els can not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shame be denyed of our aduersaries, out of which playne certeyne and immutable principles, all matters in controuersie may be proued and the same church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so discerned, which is the verie cause, why the Papistes dare not abide the triall by the Scriptues, but flye to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, euen as their forefathers the auncient Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian heretikes, of whome Irenaeus writeth <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <q>
                  <hi>Cum ex Scripturis arguuntur, in accusationem conuertuntur ipsaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Scripturam, quasi non rectè habeant, neque fuit ex au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritate, quia variè sunt dictae, &amp; quia non possit ab his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniriveritas, qui nesciant traditionem, non enim per literas traditam sed per viuam vocem.</hi> When they are conuinced out of the Scriptures, then fall they to accusing of the Scriptures them selues as though they were not right: nor of sufficient authoritie, because they are spoken doubtfully, and that the trueth cannot be found of them which knowe not the tradition, for that was not deliuered by letters, but by word of mouth.</q> Thus much Ireneus of the olde Heretikes, and what his iudgement was of the meaning of the Scripture which M. Sand. maketh so ambiguous, he declareth lib. 2. cap. 35. <q>
                  <hi>Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sae scripturae &amp; Propheticae &amp; Euangelicae in aperto, &amp; sine ambiguitat, &amp; similiter ab omnibus audiri possunt &amp;c.</hi> The
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2880:77"/>
whole Scriptures both of the Prophets, and of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells, are open and without ambiguitie, &amp; may be heard of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alike.</q> This speaketh Irenaeus not of euery text of Scripture, but of the whole doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, which is so playne and easie to be founde in the Scriptures, that no man can misse thereof, that seeketh not of purpose to be deceyued, as he sayth cap. 67. of the same booke.</p>
            <p>But M. Sander is content for disputation sake to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <note place="margin">1.</note> Gods word for a marke of the true Church, and will proue that it is first with the Papistes.</p>
            <p>For if by Gods word we meane the written letter of the Bible, they are before vs, because we haue none as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured copies thereof, which we receyued not of them, for since that day in which S. Peter and S. Paule deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Gods word to the Romaines, the Church of Rome hath alwayes kept it without leesing or corrupting.</p>
            <p>I aunswer we meane not by Gods worde the written letter onely, but receyuing and obeying the true and playne sense thereof to be the marke of the Church. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine I deny, that we had any assured copies of the olde and new testament of the popish Church, but the one of the Iewes in Hebrue, the other of the Greeke Church in Greeke. And whereas he talketh of a certayne daye in which S. Peter and S. Paule deliuered the Scripture to the Romains, it sauoreth altogether of a popish fable, finally how the Romish Church in these last dayes hath kept the Scripture from corruption, although I coulde shew by an hundreth examples, yet this one shall suffice for all, the very first promise of the Gospell, that is in the Scripture. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. that the seede of the woman shoulde breake the serpents heade, the popish Church hath ether willfully corrupted, or negligently suffered to be depraued, thus, <hi>ipsa conteret caput iuum,</hi> she shall breake thyne heade, referring that to the woman which God speaketh expressely to the seede of the woman.</p>
            <p>The second marke is, that the Papistes acknowledge more of the Bible then we doe, by the bookes of Toby, <note place="margin">2.</note>

I aunswer in that you adde vnto the word of God, it is a certayne argument, that you are not the true Church of Christ, for the true Church of Christ hath euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted those bookes for apocryphall, witnesse hereof <hi>Hieronym praef. in prouerb.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Sicut ergo Iudith &amp; Tobiae &amp; Machabaeorum libros legit quidem Ecclesia, sed eos inter Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicas Scripturas non recipit: sic &amp; haec duo volumina le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat ad aedificationem plebis, non ad auctoritate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ecclesiasticoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dogmatum confirmandam.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>Therefore as the Church doth in deede reade the bookes of Iudith, Tobias, and of the Machabees, but she receyueth them not among the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scriptures: so she may reade these two bookes (meaning the booke of Wisedom and Ecclesiasticus) for the edifying of the people, but not to confirme the authoritie of Ecclesiasticall opinions.</q> Nether is Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine <hi>de doct.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h plainely that the booke of Machabees is not accompted of the Iewes as the law, the Prophets and the Psalmes, which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ admitteth as his witnesses: yet it is receyued of the Church, if it be read or heard soberly. Whereby it is manifest, that the Church in his tyme receyued it not absolutely, as part of the Canonicall Scripture, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der condition of a sober reader or hearer. As for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ascribed to Gelasius, it hath no sufficient credit of antiquitie, and much lesse the late councels of Florence and Trent, which he quoteth. Beside that the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Gelasius admitting but one booke of Esdras, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the Canonicall booke of Nehemias, and recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth but one booke of the Machabees which will doe the Papistes but small pleasure.</p>
            <p>The third marke, the popish Church receyueth not <note place="margin">3.</note> only the hebrue text of the old testament, &amp; the greeke of the new, but also the greeke translation of the septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginta, and the common Latine translation, to be of full
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2880:78"/>
authoritie, whereas we giue small credit to those tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations, except they agree with the first Hebrue and Greeke copies. Therefore the Papists haue Gods word in more authenticke tongues and copies then we haue. I aunswer, The Tridentine councell alloweth none for authenticall, but the common Latine translation, that is the worst of all: but in that the popish Church admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth differing translations from the originall truth of the Hebrue and Greeke text, to be of full authoritie with the truth, it appeareth plainely that she is not the Church of Christ: which ether willfully confoundeth error with truth, or els lacketh the spirite of discretion to know the one from the other. And for more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike copies it is impudently sayd, that the Papistes doe receiue, for we receiue not onely all these which he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, but also the most auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Chaldee Paraphrastes, &amp; the Syrian text of the new testament, yea the Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call text of the whole Bible, beside, all vulgare translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of English, French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, which the Papistes can not abide. All those, I saye, we receyue as authenticall copies for Christian men to vse: but so that the tryall of all translations be made, by the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall truthe of the Heb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue and Greeke texts: in which tongue, the olde and newe Testament were first writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Papistes doe translate and expounde <note place="margin">4.</note> Gods worde in all maner of tongues, better then we, because they haue not onely internall vocation, but also externall vocation and commission from the Apostles, by lyneall succession of Bishops and Preestes: whereas we haue no commission, but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom the common wealth which hath none authoritie to make Preestes &amp;c: and yet how shall they preache if they be not sent? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. I aunswer concerning translations of the word of God into all tongues I neuer saw any, nether is there any translation to be shewed of any Papist, into any vulgare tongue.</p>
            <p>And as for the externall calling of the Papistes, I say
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2880:79"/>
it is not from any lawfull succession of the Apostles and auncient Church, whose faith and doctrine they do not follow in their interpretations, for if lyneall succession of Priestes and Bishops coulde make interpretations good, the doctrine of Arius, Nestorius, Macedonius, and many other heretikes, whose externall calling was according to the lyneall and ordinary succession of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Priestes, might be auctorised for Catholike. Yea the Papistes might not refuse whatsoeuer Luther, Bucer, Cranmer, and other haue taught, which had the same lyneall succession that M. Sander doth nowe bragge of. And as for our externall calling, he sayth falsly it is of the common weale &amp;c, whereas it is of the Church, and therefore ordinarye and lawfull, and the saying of S. Paule whom he citeth <hi>Rom.</hi> the tenth is of the inward calling and sending by God, whereof our doctrine agreeable with the Scripture and our whole intent to set forth the glory of God is a sufficient profe, the one to satisfie men, the other to aunswer our owne conscience.</p>
            <p>Fiftly he sayth it is no perfection at all on our side, <note place="margin">5.</note> that we reade Gods word to the people in our Church seruice in the vulgare tongue, for thereby we lacke the vse of the better tongues, as of the Greeke and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine. O maister of impudencie, what vse is there of the Greeke and Latine tongues, to be read to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that vnderstande them not? And why are those the better tongues? he sayth they were sanctified on Christes crosse for all holy vses, and especially to serue God in the tyme of sacrifice. But howe were they san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified I pray you? For sooth, because Pilate wrote the title in Hebrue, Greeke, and Latine, that it might be vnderstoode of all nations for what cryme he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. And is Pilate nowe become a sanctifier of tongues for Gods seruice? is the malicious scorne of an heathen tyrant, a sanctification of these tongues? O bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen foreheads of shameles Papistes. But heare more yet of this impudent stuffe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:2880:79"/>
This sanctification was the cause, that the Apostles in the East and West deliuered these tongues alone as holy, learned and honorable, not regarding the infinite multitude of prophane and barbarous tongues, whereof it came, that the East Church was called the Greeke Church, &amp; the West the Latine Church. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Acts</hi> the second, doth teach vs, that the holy Ghost hath sanctified all tongues of all nations to the praysing of God, and that the Apostles deliuered the magnifical prayses of God, in all languages. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 11. And although the Greeke and Latine tongues, were most vsed, &amp; most commonly vnderstoode in the Romane Empire, yet the Church of Christ was enlarged farther then euer the Romane Empire extended in Persia, Armenia, AEthio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, India &amp;c. where there was no knowledge, ether of the Greke or Latine tongues. And euen in the Romain Empire those nations, to whome the Latine &amp; Greeke tongues were not vulgare, vsed their Church seruice in other tongues. <hi>Hieronym. in epitaphio Paulae ad Eusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chium</hi> telleth, that at the solemne funeralls of Paule: euery nation that was present, did singe their Psalmes in order in their owne language. <hi>Hebraeo, Graeco, Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, Syroque sermone Psalmi in ordine personabant.</hi> In the Hebrue, Greeke, Latine and Syrian speache, the Psalmes were songe in order. But seeing Maister San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alloweth none other sanctification of the tongues, but Pilates title on the crosse, how is the Hebrue tongue which was one of the three, and the most principall, as the first tongue of the worlde, and for the excellencye therof called the holy tongue, how is that I say, shut out from Church seruice, why was there not an Hebrue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice established by the Apostles as well as the Greeke and Latine? But yet he bringeth another argument to proue that it is lawfull to reade seruice to the people in a tongue w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> they vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not, by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Christ, who in time of his sacrifice, did recite the beginning of the 21 Psalme, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me,</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrue tongue, which he knew the people did not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2880:80"/>
vnderstand, and did not interprete the same in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tounge. Good Lord into what foollishnes doth satan carry their minds, that wilfully striue against the truth? For what reason is this? Christ in his priuate praier, that concerned his owne person, spake with a tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that was not commonly vnderstood, therefore the ordinary pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like seruice ought to be in a strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge toung. Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed about with his enemyes, &amp; none within the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him but the virgine Mary, &amp; Iohn the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> loued him or regarded him spake Hebrue, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prieste in the church, must speake Latine or Greeke. But when M. Sand. hath played with this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as long as he can, his antecedent is vtterly false, for Christe resited not that texte of the Psalme in the Hebrue, but in the Syrian toung, which was the vulgar tounge vnderstood and spoken of all the people, as is manifestly proued by the word <hi>Sabac<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tani</hi> reported by both the Euangelists. Mat. 27. Mark. 15. Which is of the Syrian tounge, whereas the Hebrue texte is <hi>Hazab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tani,</hi> as I report me to all that can but read two tounges Hebrue and Syrian. And whereas the malicious Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds said he called for Elias, it was not because they vnderstood him not, but because they most dispightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mocked his most vehement praier, taking occasion of the like sound of the name of God &amp; of Elias, as scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deriders vse to doe.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, lest the Protestants should passe the Papistes in any one iote, they haue the vse of the vulgar tongues in Dalmatia, Assyria, &amp; AEthiopia, which acknowledge the supremacie of the Byshop of Rome. This is a loude lye, for neither the church of Dalmatians, Moscouites, Armenians, Assirians, AEthiopia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, nor any other of those East nations, that retaine the name of Christe, did euer acknowledge the Popes supremacie. I knowe they haue fayned Fables of Letters sent from Preto Ioannes and such like, which are meere forgeryes vppon the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of some one poore wanderer, that hath come out of those countryes. But M. Sand. will shewe the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2880:80"/>
cause, why all Nations are not suffered likewise to vse their vulgar tounges in their seruice. First he sayeth vulgar tounges cause barbarousnesse, for the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of those Countryes vnderstande not the Latine and Greeke tounges by this meanes. What an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surde reason this is, experience doth shewe. For when or where was greater ignorance in the Cleargie, then there, and at such time as the Latine seruice was vsed? How many in all England vnderstoode or coulde read the Greeke toung within these sixtie or eightie yeeres? I speake nothing of the Hebrue tounge. Contrarywise what age was euer more full of lyberall knowledge in all Sciences, and learned tounges, then this is euen in England, France, &amp; Germany, where seruice is vsed in the vulgar tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge? The<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore the vse of thevulgar tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge in Church Seruice is not the cause of barbarousnesse.</p>
            <p>The seconde reason is, that necessitie inforceth the Apostolike See to tollerate these Nations in their vulgar tounges, because they knowe none other, but Protestants by schisme are fallen from Latine to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe, that is from better to worse, and therefore not to be tollerated. But indeede the necessitie is, because they will not receiue your Latine tounge, and our schisme is from Antichriste to be ioyned with Christe, from whose doctrine the Church of Rome by horrible schisme is departed, for what the doctrine of Christe is concerning Publique Prayers in a tounge that is not vnderstoode, his Apostle Saincte Paule hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntly taught vs, the 1. Corinthes the 14. Chapter. Finally we defende that our naturall Engli<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he tounge, is better to edi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie Englishe men, then your balde La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge that you vse in your popish seruice is for any vse of any man learned or vnlearned.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly the Papistes doe not onely consider the written letter, but also the plain meaning of euery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and as the words doe sound, so doe they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them. And heerof he bringeth many exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples. To this I answere, that if they vnderstande all propositions,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2880:81"/>
aswel figuratiue as plain &amp; proper speaches as the words doe sound, they make monstrous interpretations, as if they vnderstande this proposition the rock was Christe as the words sound, they make a new transubstantiation of the stone into Christ, or this: This cuppe is the newe Testament, if theire interpretation be none other then the sound of the word doth giue, they make the newe Testament to be nothing but a drinking vessel. But to discusse his examples, the first is this text. Matth. 26.</p>

            <p>The 9. M.

Ambrosius &amp;c. and other, which liued before their time, and therefore were no partial iudges, so do we conuince the Popish heresies, and their argumentes of noueltie, not only by the manifest worde of God, but also by the testimonie of the most auncient fathers, although we may not admit all that they did write to be true, euen as the same Augustine being pressed with the auctoritie of Ambrose, Chrysostome, and Cyprian by the Donatists &amp; Pelagians, prouoketh from them onely to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>de nat. &amp; gra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

That the allegation of the fathers suffiseth not of it selfe, we agree with Maister Sander, but that there is any other triall of the truth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Scripture, we wil neuer graunt, seeing God hath therein deliuered his whole doctrine, whatsoeuer is necessarie for vs to beleue that we may be saued. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Papistes for the tenth marke ioyne tradition and practise of Gods church, which can neuer deceaue ama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. VVe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">10</note>. <hi>thinke sayth Chrysostom the tradition of the church to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of beleefe. Is it a tradition? aske no further.</hi> But howe shall we proue it to be a tradition of the church. The Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians (as I shewed before out of Irenaeus) denyed the Scriptures to be sufficient, without knowledge of the tradition. Therfore to discerne the tradition of <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> church from the tradition of the heretikes, we haue none other triall but by the Scriptures. Therefore Chrysostom saith in 2. <hi>Cor. Ho.</hi> 3. that S. Paule did write the same thinges which he told them before in preaching. As for the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall practise either of the Popes supremacy, or of the sacrifice of the masse which he braggeth of, shall neuer be proued, but the contrarie.</p>
            <p>The eleuenth marke is the auctority of generall cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells confirming the truth, &amp; condemning heretikes, &amp; <note place="margin">11</note>. such he maketh the late councell of Trent to be. But we deny that <hi>Conciliabulum,</hi> of a few Popish hypocrits, to be a generall councell, in which no man should haue a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitiue voyce, but they that were accused of heresie and whereof, he that is most of all charged with heresie, that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2880:83"/>
is the Pope, is made the supreme iudge, wherefore the Papists haue no lawfull generall councell on their side, although generall councells as he confesseth, are no sufficient triall of the true church, both because they may be hindered many wayes, and also because they may erre, as did the conncells of Arimine, and Ephesus.</p>
            <p>In respect of these considerations, he maketh the twelfth marke to be the supremacy of the Pope, whichis <note place="margin">12</note>. wholly theirs for triall whereof, this booke following was written. But for proofe that Christ hath appoynted such a iudge, ouer all, he citeth <hi>Ioan.</hi> 21. that Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded Peter to feede his sheepe, as though that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned not to euerie one of the Apostles, as much as to Peter. Also <hi>Lu.</hi> 22. that Christ hauing praied that Peters faith might not fayle, commaunded him when he was conuerted from his fall, to confirme his brethren, which perteineth only to the person of Peter, and can not with any cable ropes be drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Bishop of Rome, or any successor of Peter, for it concerneth his singular, full, comfort &amp; duty, in respect of his fall &amp; Gods mercy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that according to analogy, it may be applied to any man, that is so raised after his fall, and so that precept <hi>confirme thy brethren,</hi> geueth no speciall commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the Pope, but to euery. man whom God hath merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conuerted as he did Peter.</p>
            <p>With the twelfth marke M. Sander would haue ended, but that the Protestantes, affirme the lawfull preaching <note place="margin">13</note>. of Gods word, and the lawfull administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes to be a marke whereby they wilbe tried. But seeing lawfull preaching &amp; ministring must be tried by Gods worde, M.

900. yeres, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sayth no man aliue could once heare vs peepe. As though controuersie of nations would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a true church. By which reasons not only the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants may nowe proue them selues to be most like the Apostles in conuerting so many nations of Europe, but also the Arians, and most of all, the Mahumetists, might proue them selues the true church. It is not therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of nations, but conuersion of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apostles, which maketh vs like the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: &amp; the Papistes, Arians, &amp; Mahometists most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vnto them.

But I answer because they haue fiue more then the worde of God alloweth, or the primitiue church acknowledgeth: &amp; in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other they haue either altogether peruerted the institution, as in the Lordes supper: or shamefully corrupted it with superstition, as in baptisme: they are not the church of Christ, but the church of Antichrist.</p>

I answere, if you can not put a difference betwene impugning &amp; preuailing: you wil haue much to do to defend your Romish church to be the true church, against the Turkes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, who haue possessed a great part of <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

            <p>If either persecution, or not failing in persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be a marke of the church, it is more in the Papists the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the <note place="margin">15</note>.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2880:85"/>
the church of Christ is not diminished but encreased thereby, euen as Cyprian saith the blood of the martyrs is the seede of church.</p>
            <p>If antiquitie be a marke, it is proued to be on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists side by this reason. <hi>The church is all one, the later part of the church for</hi> 900. <hi>yeares last past is on the Papistes side therefore the former parte also.</hi> But this reason standing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a shamefull begging of that which is questioned, is soone turned vpon your owne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> necke. The church is in all but one, but the beginning of the church maketh not for you, therefore that which you say is the later part of the church, being contrary to that former, is no part of the church, so that by this reason, you shal neither haue antiquitie or any parte of the church.</p>
            <p>But if you appeale to particular examples (sayth M.

            <p>Although wee haue no certaintie of the writinges of Ignatius which are extant, yet is there nothing in them that fauoreth the Papists religion.

That he which hath had two wiues coulde not be a Priest in Hieronymus time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was a litle of that chaffe, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> afterward ouerwhelmed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good corne in the church of Rome. Hierom affirmeth that he, as helper, vnto the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Damasus Bishop of the city of Rome, did answere the synodicall consultation that came from the East &amp; the West. What is this to any purpose of the Papistes? Not only the Bishop of Rome was consulted, nor he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, except the matter concerned the whole church, when no member should be lefte vnconsulted, and not made priuye.</p>

And now you see what antiquity he can boast of, for when he hath wrested &amp; wrong all that he can, scarce two or thre errors haue any shadow of antiquity, &amp; those not in the greatest matters, wheras the whole substance of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of fayth in God, iustification by Christ, the true worship of God, the vertue of Christes death, the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of man, the right vse of the sacramentes the aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the holy scriptures, &amp; a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber more of such prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall heades of Christian learning, in which we differ from them, he is as silent as a stone.</p>
            <p>The 17. marke, is the name of Catholikes, which <note place="margin">17</note>. M. Iewel confesseth to haue bene of late geuen to the Papistes, which among other thinges, stayed S.

your archeheretike the pope, papistes, the onely name of Catholikes, which was geuen to you by your selues, to shadowe your heresies, cannot proue you to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, or your church to be Catholike, especially seeing you lacke the truth which Augustine in the same place, confesseth to be more worth then either successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the name of Catholike, or any other thing else.</p>
            <p>The eyghteenth marke is the succession of Priestes, and Bishops, euen from the seate of Peter vnto Pius the fifth in whose time this booke of M. Sander was written, which marke is approued by Augustine, by Irenaeus, by Tertullian, by Optatus &amp; by Hieronym, as he sayth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the most euident of all other, but therein he belyeth all these fathers whom he citeth, who neuer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged the bare successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of place &amp; persons, but ioyned with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of doctrine, receaued from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, against new &amp; late sprong vp heresies. Augustine shall speake for the rest, who after he hath alleaged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Donatistes, the successions of Bishops from Peter in the vnity of the Catholike church, among which was neuer a Donatist, the iudgement of the Bishop of Rome in absoluing of Cecilianus, and many such like reasons, whereunto he thinketh the Donatistes shoulde yeelde, yet in the ende, he addeth these words. <hi>Quamquàm nos non tam de istis documentis presumamus, quam de Scripturis sanctis.</hi> Although we doe not so much presume of this documents as of the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>These eighteene markes M. Sander will haue to be more richly seene in them, then in the Protestantes, but what markes they are, and how they are to be found in their church, I haue briefely shewed. But nowe he commeth to a general challenge to proue that we haue nothing which they lacke, and we lacke many thinges which they haue. <hi>First they haue a iustifying faith as well as we, but not iustifying alone, but with charity, which is the life of faith.</hi> But charitye is a fruict of a liuinge and vnfayned fayth, not the life thereof. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect not the cause, and we holde with Saynct Paule
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2880:88"/>
that a man is iustified by faith without the workes of the lawe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. for charitie is no instrument to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the mercie of God, but faith onely, therefore faith onely doth iustifie. We are iustified <hi>gratis,</hi> steely by his grace. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. therfore nothing can come in accompt of iustification before God, but onely faith. which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papistes haue not, they haue not a iustifying faith.</p>
            <p>We haue two Sacraments, and they haue seuen, but seeing they haue fiue more then Christ instituted, and haue peruerted the one, and polluted the other, they haue but one Sacrament at the most, and that horribly prophaned, I meane baptisme. <hi>VVe haue an inward priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> (he sayth) <hi>to offer vp Christ in our hartes, and they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him both in hartes and handes.</hi> But our spirituall priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is not to offer vp Christ, but spirituall sacrifices ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable by Christ 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 15. and they are horrible blasphemers, that take vpon them to offer vp Christ, whome none could offer but him selfe by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall spirite. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
            <p>He sayth, that the Papistes <hi>beleeue as well as we, that Christ by one sacrifice payed our raunsom for euer, when they shewe it to the eye in the eblation of their Masse,</hi> then the which nothing can be more contrary to the onely sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ once offred and neuer to be repeated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he founde eternall redemption thereby. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. 9. 12. &amp; 25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He addeth that they beleue Christ to be the head of the Church, <hi>and shewe it by a reall figure of one heade, in earth, meaning the Pope,</hi> whome now he maketh a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue heade, as though Christ were not present with his Churche, or that his Churche were a monster with two heades.</p>
            <p>As laye men receyue the communion in both kindes with vs, so they d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e with them in Austria by the Popes dispensation, as though Christes commaundement and institution were not sufficient without the Popes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation. Wherein also he affirmeth a monstrous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie, that the Sacrament was not instituted in two
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2880:88"/>
kindes, to be so receyued, but by an vnbloody sacrifice, to shewe the nature of his bloody sacrifice in which his soule and blood was separated from his body and flesh, and yet he sayth the body and flesh of Christ, is not well conteyned in the cuppe, as his blood in the paten, with the body and forme of breade, and no separation of the one from the other, and no more contayned or distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by both, then by one alone. Which saying is to be receyued with whoopes and hisses, of all men that haue their fiue witts.</p>
            <p>They haue mariage (he sayth) in greater price then we, because they teach it to be a sacrament, but we find it not instituted by Christ to be a sacrament of the new testament, therfore we receyue it as an holy ordinance, contayning also a great mystery, but yet no sacrament. But if it be an holy sacrament, why doe you thinke it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete for ministers of the Church? and why doth your Pope Syricius, or rather some counterfeating Canonist in his name, call holy matrimony a liuing in the flesh, such as can not please God. But although mariage be honorable in all men (you saye) it is not so in them that haue gelded them selues for the kingdome of heauen, who haue no more possibilitie to marye, then a gelded man to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eget children. You were best then to tel the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle that his saying was too generall, for he shoulde haue excepted them that so gelded themselues. But S. Paule sayth, notwithstanding your impossibilitie, if a virgine doe marye, she doth not sinne. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 28. You will reply he speaketh of them that haue not vowed, &amp; how proue you that Christ speaketh of them that haue vowed, longer then God would giue them grace to liue chast, which he affirmeth to be a peculiar gift, &amp; not in the power of euery man. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 12. But what if your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish geldings, by neying at euery mans wife, and by tombling in all beddes, where they are not kept out by force, proue them selues to be stone horses, are they still in the number of those, that hauing gelded them selues for the kingdom of heauen, may not possibly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2880:89"/>
and yet nether we will nor can possibly liue chast? But omitting these thinges, which they haue as well as we, now he commeth to those thinges, which we lacke, and yet many of them are very necessary: as insufflati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is blowing vpon exorcismes, that is coniuring: holy oyle in baptisme, chrisme in Bishopping, externall priesthood, sacrifice, altars, censing, lights, and so forth a large rablement of popish errors and superstitious ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. And that we saye falsly, in saying these are naught, he proueth by S. Paules saying to the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>praeterquam quod accepistis,</hi> beside that you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued. for once (sayth he) we haue receyued those thinges of our auncestors, as if S. Paule had not spoken of the Gospell, but of beggerly ceremonies, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are an other Gospell, and way of saluation, brought in by the Pope, then S. Paule deliuered to the Galathians: we hold the Pope &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iustly accursed. <hi>But we iustifie them</hi> (sayth he) <hi>by the word of God</hi> not written I am sure, but by your counterfeit word of traditions, &amp; as you say by bookes of auncient fathers, and yet not by bookes of the most auncient fathers: in whome is litle or nothing at all of suche drosse and chaffe, amonge a great deale of good corne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But seeing we made no new religion in those and such like thinges</hi> (sayth he) <hi>but keepe the olde: humilitie, obedience, and vnitie is our fault, if we haue any</hi> O fautles hypocrites, if the older truth had neuer bene reuealed vnto you, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your olde heresies, your faults had bene the lesse. but nowe your darkenes being conuinced of the light, your pride, rebellion, and schisme from Christ and his Church, is and appeareth most haynous and manifest.</p>
            <p>Now seeing M. Sander dare not encounter with vs in this very poynt of our contention, he sayneth an Idoll of an aduersary, to shew his manhood vpon, before his friendes, that they may prayse him for a worthy cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion. He imagineth that we reply, that Luther and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine did so change popish religion, as Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the Iewish religion, and then he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2880:89"/>
on lode, that Luther and Caluines authoritie is not like to Christes, whereas we make no such comparison: but affirme, that these godly preachers were sent of God, so to reueale and discouer the idolatry &amp; corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, mayntayned in the Church, as Elias, Elizeus, Ose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as and the other Prophets, were sent to restore and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the true worship of God, corrupted and decayed amonge the Israelites, reprouing and reforming all thinges according to the infallible rule of Gods worde. And whereas he trifleth of the continuance of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ, according to the order of Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech, I say it is horrible blasphemy, to make any succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors vnto Christ in <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> priesthood, which the holy Ghost sayth, he hath <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, such as passeth not from him by succession to others, because he liueth for euer. And whereas he quoteth Irenaeus <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. and Augustin. <hi>in Psal.</hi> 33. <hi>de ciui. Dei lib.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. <hi>cont. adu. leg. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. reade the places who will, and he shall finde, that these fathers speake not at all, of any propiciatory sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christes very body and bloode in the sacrament, but of the sacrifice of thankes giuing, which the Church throughout all the world doth offer to God, in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the holy mysteries, for their redemption by the death of Christ. But it is sufficient for blinde and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate Papists, to see the bookes margent paynted with quotations of doctors, by them which peraduenture ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer turned the bookes them selues, but borowed their quotations of other men.</p>
            <p>But M. Sander sayth, whereas we pretend that Luther and Caluine doe all things according to Gods worde, they are the more to be abhorred, not only because the one is contrary to the other, but also because they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to haue their doings figured and prophecyed in the Gospel, whereas there is but one Christ, which hath bene borne &amp; dyed but once, therefore these men haue no power to abrogate the Masse, or to take away the key of auncient religion. To their dissention, I aunswer it is not in many poyntes, but in one &amp; that not of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2880:90"/>
weight as for their pretence of theyr doinges, to be figured or prophetied in the Gospell, it is a dreame of M. Sanders drousie head, for they make none such, but they shew the abuses of the Romish church, by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Gods word, &amp; by the same they shew the way to reforme them and this, to the glory of Christ, who dyed but once, they abrogate the Masse, by which it should follow, if it were of any force, that he should dye often, for without death &amp; sheding of bloud, there is no sacrifice for remission of sinnes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. &amp; 26.</p>
            <p>If we deny the Masse to be that, they say it is, he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth: that as he doeth not reade, that the Iewish priestes did erre concerning the substance of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like sacrifice. So is it lesse possible, that the vniuersall church of Christ should erre in that publike act, wherin Christ is sacrificed. Here is a wise argument, hauing neither head nor foote, nor any ioynt to hange togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For whatsoeuer M. Sander readeth, we reade that Vrias the high Priest, made an heathenish altar in the Temple, at the commaundement of the king Achas, &amp; offered sacrifice theron, 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 16. VVe reade also in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus, that Caiaphas &amp; diuers other of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high Priestes were Saduces, which could not but erre in the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their publike sacrifice, when they beleued not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. Seeing the end of theyr sacrifices was, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eternall red<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ption by Christ. Now to the second parte of the argument, I say the vniuersall church dyd not erre, though the schismaticall synagogue of Rome departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christs institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But M. Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der chafeth vs away, with this double negatiue, no no maisters, Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs you may be, christ you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be.

But it is your Antechrist of Rome, that vsurpeth not only the office, but also receiueth the name of Christ &amp; God, of his Antechristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Canonists, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I know you will not deny, though your face be of brasse, because <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

After his large excursion, he returneth to D.

            <p>The conclusion of all his Preface is, that which was the cause of this treatise that there neuer lacked a chief Byshop in Saincte Peeters chaire, whose supremacy beeing graunted all other controuersies bee superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

               <q>THE state of the Question concerning the supremacie of Sainct Peter and of the Byshoppes of Rome after <note place="margin">Sander.</note> him.</q>
               <p>VPon our denyall of the supremacie of the Pope, and of S. Peter, he sayth we deny all primacie and <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> chiefe gouernment in the Church. Wherevpon he ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth three questions to intreate of.</p>
               <p>Whether it be against the worde of God, that there <note place="margin">1.</note> should be in his Churche any primacie or chiefe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie?</p>
               <p>Whether S. Peter had the same primacie or no? <note place="margin">2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Whether the Byshop of Rome had it after S. Peter. <note place="margin">3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To which we aunswere with distinction of the words primacie and Church, that we affirme, there is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and eternall primacy of the vniuersall Churche, which is proper onely to our Sauiour Christ, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was giuen to Peter, nor to any mortall man. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2880:91"/>
we arffime that in particular Churches, there is &amp; must be a primacie of order, which is temporall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the disposition of the Church. And such primacie in the Colledge of the Apostles might Peter haue for sometime, but that he had it not alwayes, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the councell of the Apostlesin the 15. of the Actes of which Iames in a manner by all writers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, was President and Primate: and vpon the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie beeing throughly debated, pronounced the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitiue sentence <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;c according to which the synodall Epistle to the Churches of Antiochia, Syria, and Cilicia, was written in the name of the Apostles, Elders and brethren.</p>
               <p>But concerning S. Peter, M. Sander moueth newe questions. First whereas Christ promised that Simon should be called Cephas or Peter, whiche is a stone or Rock. Ioh. I. and afterward performed his promise, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he chose him to be an Apostle, Mar. 3. Luk. 6. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when Simon confessed his godhead, the reason of the promise was declared that he would builde his Church vpon that Rocke: the question is, whether Peter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe be that Rock, vpon which Christ woulde builde his Church, or Christ himselfe, or the fayth and confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of peter.</p>
               <p>M. Sander the spokesman for the Papists, passing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the second question, that is whether Christe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe whom Peter confessed, by this rock, denyeth the fayth or confession of Peeter to be the perfect sence of that promise, affirming the Rock on which the Church is builded to be S. Peter, not barely confirmed, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the promise past, the present confession, and the authoritie of feeding Christes Sheepe giuen him after his resurrection, of which foure conditions the Protestantes (hee sayth) doe lack no lesse then three. But what doe the Papists lack, when in there sence they exclude the rock Christ, the only foundation, then the which none other can be layde. 1. Cor. 10. 4. 1. Cor. 3. 11. by any wise builder of the Church. Yet seeing M. Sand.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2880:92"/>
is so desirous to haue Peter to bee the stone whereof Christ speaketh, laying first Iesus Christ to be the head corner stone, I wil franckly yeelde vnto him, that which he coulde neuer win by force, that Christ saying to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thou art Peter, and vpon this Rocke or stone will I builde my Church, meaneth euen Peter him selfe vpon whome he would build his Church, but so that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not Peter a singular Rocke or stone to beare the whole building, (for then hee should put him selfe out of place) but one of the pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ncipall stones of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, euen as all the Apostles and Prophetes were, for so the holy Ghost speaketh, Ephe. 2. vers. 20. beeing builded vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Iesus Christe beeing the head corner stone in whome all the building beeing compacted, groweth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an holy temple vnto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Nowe let vs consider, whether any singular authority was committed to peter, when hee was willed to feede the sheepe of Christ. M. Sand. saith yea, because it was sayd to him alone, feede my sheepe, and no particular flock named, it must needes be ment the whole flocke. Marke these maine pillers of the popishe Rock. Christ saide onely to Peter, come after me Satan, for thou art an offence to me &amp;c. Therefore Peter onely was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie of Christe. If the Pope must needes haue the one texte as peculiar to him, let him take the other also. Againe Peter himself sayth to the elders, feede as much as in you lyeth the flocke of Christe 1. Peter. 5. Heere is no particular slocke named, therefore he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the whole vniuersall flocke. But he vrgeth far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that as Peter loued Christe more then the rest, so he did feede the flock of Christ aboue all other pastors. But if labouring in preaching the gospel, be the feeding of Christes flock, not Peter, but Paule laboured more then he, and all the rest of the Apostles. 1. Cor. 15. The answere of the Protestants to his demande, Why Peter alone in presence of other Apostles was commaunded thrise to feede the sheepe, that by thrise confession and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2880:92"/>
iniunction to feede, he might abolishe the shame of his thrise denying, and knowe that hee was restored to his Apostleship, from which he deserued to be depriued) M. Sand. liketh not for three causes. First he sayth, hee had not lost his Apostleship, because his fault was not externally proued, nor confessed in iudgment, nor stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernly defended &amp;c. as though Christ which knew and foretolde his infirmitie before he fell, had neede of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall proues, or a Commissaries court to depriue Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his office, O blockish reason. Although neither Caluine nor Beza doe affirme, that hee was altogither excluded from his office, by his fault, but that he deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued so to be, and therefore had neede especially to bee confirmed by our Sauiour Christ more then the rest as his offence was more shamefull then of any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore the seconde reason that hee bringeth of his restitution, if he had lost it is superfluous. Ioh. 20 For he was none otherwise restored then the rest were, but at this time especially confirmed, as his speciall case required.</p>
               <p>His last reason is, that admit Peter had not beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored before this time, yet nowe he was restored to a greater authority, then any other Apostle had receued at any time, and whereas we reply that all the Apostles were equall by testimonie of Cyprian and Hieromes, he aunsweareth by distinction, forsooth that they were equall in Apostleship, and yet Peter was chiefe of t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Apostles, and an ordinary chiefe shepheard or high <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ee was their Primate and their heade, and this distinction he promiseth to proue exactly heereafter. In the meane time it is a monstrous Paradox, that all the Apostles should be equall with Peter in Apostleshipp, and yet Peter be the chiefe of the Apostles. He that can proue inequalitie to be where he graunteth equallitie to be, and in the same respecte, is a straunge Logition. Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally where as some men graunting Peter to bee the rock, deny the honor to his successors, he will proue that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2880:93"/>
the Byshop of Rome and none other, hath all that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie which Peter sometime had, and consequently that the Protestants come neerer to the nature &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Antichrist, then any pope of Rome euer did or can doe.</p>

That Moyses was a Priest.</q>
               <p>THe Ecclesiasticall gouernment of the Church is a <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> ministery, or seruice, by the authoritie of Christ and his Apostle Peter: &amp; therefore neither properly nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly a Godlines or Hethenish dominion, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as vnlike to it, as our Sauiour Christ the paterne of all true ministers, was vnlike to an earthly Lorde or an Heathen Prince.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2880:93"/>
thren in Christ, as properly as euer he might be before the incarnation of Christ: who saith himselfe that his kingdome is not of this worlde: who himselfe was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and taught obedience both to God and Caesar, to eche in things that belonged to them: &amp; that dominion which he forbiddeth vnto his Apostles, like to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the nations. Luc. 22. Matth. 20. and which S. Peter forbiddeth the elders of the church. 1. Pet. 5. is not prohibited to all Christians, but to the ministers of the Church onely in respect of their ministery. And yet that there ought to be a gouernment of the church, &amp; some kind of primacy also, it is cleerer by the scriptures, then that it neede any proofe, especially such slender proues as M. San. bringeth, &amp; namely where he citeth this text, Feed my sheepe, to signifie that Peter should giue euery man his dewe portion &amp; iust measure of victuals in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient time: which thing neither Peter did, nether was he able to doe. And much lesse any man in succession to him, which is not equal in gifts with him. And therefore the example of a stuarde, who may prouide for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of one family, is fondly applyed to make one Stewarde ouer al the worlde, beside him that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie. For although the Apostles were not lymited to any certaine congregation, but were generall Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors into all partes of the worlde: yet were they not appoynted to giue to euery man his dewe portion, but to appoynt Pastors in euery Church and towne for that purpose. Tit. 1. Actes 14. verse. 23, &amp; they them selues to proceed in matters pertayning to their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Commission.</p>
               <p>And therefore although M. Sander in applying these woordes of Ieronime <hi>Cont.

soueraigne auctority, yet in that he argueth, that the like should be in the whole church militant, which is in euery parish, it is out of all compasse of reason. For that which is possible in the one, is altogeather impossible in the other. And the argument is no better, then if we should say, there is one steward in euery Colledge, or greate house: therefore there is is one steward ouer all the world. And wheras he would proue his matter good, by that <hi>S. Mat. cap.</hi> 10. rehearsing the names of the Apostles, calleth Peter the first: it is to childish &amp; friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. For in euery nomber, one or other must be the first &amp; it seemeth that Peter was first called to the office of Apostleship: therefore his primacy was of order &amp; not of auctority. Nether is he alwaies first named, for <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 9. where the question is, of the dignity of the Apostles, Iames is named before Cephas, or Peter as he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede elected to be the principall minister at Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, by consent of most auncient writers, neither doeth it folow, that because the high Priest of the old law was called <hi>Princeps populi, A prince of the people,</hi> therefore Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was made prince of all Christian men. For neither was the high Priest alone called the prince of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as M. S. seemeth to say: neither had Peter by those wordes (feede my shope) any auctority committed vnto him, more then to the rest of the Apostles. As for the name of Lord, or tearme of dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sometime geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ecclesiasticall writers to the Bishop or his gouernment, we striue not about it, so there be no such dominion by him excercised, as Christ &amp; his Apostles forbiddeth, &amp; as we see to be vsurped and practised by the Pope of Rome, &amp; his clergy, howsoeuer M. Sander in tearmes of distinction, would seeme to shadow it. But he will shewe out one of these places which we alleadge, as if it did vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forbid all superiority amonge the Disciples, <hi>luc.</hi> 22 that the ecclesiasticall primacy is cleerely establyshed and confirmed.</p>
               <p>First he sayth most vntruly, that we deny all supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority amonge the Discyples of Christe as though we
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2880:94"/>
denyed all gouernmente amonge Christians, excepte hee doe childishly vnderstande the Disciples of Christ for Ministers ecclesiasticall onely: and yet wee denye not all superioritie among them, but that kinde of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie which the Pope claymeth, and tyrannically v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpeth. Secondly he maketh a longe preamble before he come to the matter, that althoughe the Apostles did diuerse times striue for the primacie, as in the way to Capharnaum Mark. 9 vpon the request of Zebedees wife. Mark. 10. &amp; after his last supper Luk. 22. yet Christ neuer denyed, that there should be one greater among them, and often signifyed, that the same shoulde be S. Peter, especially when he sayde, thou arte Peter, and vppon this Rock I will builde my Church. If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde why they stroue for supremacie, when hee had determined it, he yeeldeth a substantial reason: because while Christe lyued vpon Earth, it was in his free choise to haue appoynted it otherwise, vntill at the last in the 21. of Iohn, he saide vnto him, Simon thou sonne of Iona. &amp;c. By these it appeareth, that M. Sander confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that no text of Scripture proueth the supremacie of Peter more directly and playnely then this of Iohn 21. which when euery Childe seeth howe little force it hath to proue it, you may easily iudge that the Papists them selues againste their owne consciences, doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force all other Textes vttered before to establishe it. And namely this of Luke 22. in which he sayth, that Christ taking vppe the strife that was among his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles about the primacie, ended his talke at laste with Simon Peter, shewing him to bee that one that was greater then the rest.</p>
               <p>What Asse if he coulde speake with mans voyce, would reason thus? that because Christe conuerting his speache from exhorting all his Apostles to admonishe Peter of his speciall daunger he stoode in by his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: signifyed that Peter was greater then all the Apostles. But wee muste heare him compare these words of Christe. Luke 22. with the words of S. Mathew
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2880:95"/>
and Marke in other places, which he sayth the Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgen. cent. doth huddle vp, as they were alone, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they differ much.</p>
               <p>The wordes of Christ Mat. 20. and Mar. 10. are these: <hi>VVhosoeuer among you wil be greater, let him be your serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. And whosoeuer among you will be first, shall bee your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant.</hi> In Sainct Luke 22. <hi>He that is greater among you, let him be made as the younger: and he that is chiefe, as he that ministereth.</hi> M. Sander will haue greate difference to be in these sayings. First generally that the former sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence speaketh not of the greatnesse among ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call officers, but all Christians, which is vtterly false, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this kinde of greatnes is prescribed vnto them to whome external dominion is forbidden, But that is not to all men, but vnto the Apostles onely and their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors: therefore this kinde of greatnes, is proper only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. For he speaketh not of greatnes by humilitie onely, but of greatnes without forraine dominion and worldly dignity, and ioyned with seruice, which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier to the ministery ecclesiasticall. Secondly he maketh sixe friuolous differences, which either are false or else make no diuersitie in the sence of the places.</p>
               <p>The first, Mathew and Mark speake of any man. <hi>VVho soeuer,</hi> S. Luke of one man, which by the article <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out. If the article <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doe alwaies pointe one certaine man, it is somwhat that M. Sand. saith, but <hi>If,</hi> ten thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d times and more, (as euery man meanely learned in the Greeke toung doth know) it signifieth not one certaine man: then is this a fond difference.</p>
               <p>The second, the other speake of a desire to be great, <hi>VVho so would be great,</hi> S. Luke of the effect already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, <hi>he that is greater.</hi> But the the words of S. Matth. 18. ver. 4. ouerthrow this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, with the former: for ther <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the greateste, is taken for any one that shall humble himselfe, as a Childe, and not for one made primate of the Church.</p>
               <p>The third difference is, that the letter speake of him that would be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> great. S. Luke of him that is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:2880:95"/>
greater, by which is mente the greatest of all after the Greeke phrase. But that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the others signifyeth the greatest according to the Hebrue phrase, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the word vsed by both, which call him also <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the first or chiefest of all. Therfore these three differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not worth three chippes.</p>
               <p>The fourth, S. Matthew calleth him that woulde be great <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a seruaunte. S. Luke giueth no name of seruice to him that is greater, but he is willed to be you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or vnderling. Yet S. Luke in another place. Cap. 9. vers. 48. calleth him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the least which shall be the greatest. But what fonde quarrelling is this? Doth not the Pope call himselfe seruaunt of the seruantes of God by which he acknowledgeth that the greatest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice belongeth to him that claimeth the greatest dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. though indeede, he yeelde no seruice, but vsurpeth all tyranny. Is M. Sander nowe ashamed of that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: that the Pope by solemne title hath so longe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed? As for a preeminence of order, we deny not but it was among the Apostles, &amp; must be in euery seuerall company: although it be not necessary, that it should be perpetual in one man, but as euery Church shall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine: but a primacy of authoritie ouer all the Church, we vtterly deny that euer it was graunted to Peeter or any man by our Sauiour Christe. M. Sand. citeth Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose in Luke 22. to proue it <hi>Qui lapsus es &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>Thou which didst slide before thou didst weepe, after thou haste wepte, art set vpright, that thou shouldesirule others, who before haddest not ruled thy selfe.</q> Loe (sayth he) Peter did rule others.

                  </gap> in this place may stande. Wherefore hitherto Peter hath found no supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, and muche lesse the Pope by prerogatiue of his chaire, who can not be sayd to sit in Peters chaire, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he taught Peters doctrine, which if he did teach as he doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrarie, yet Peters auctority could no more be deriued to him, then the auctority of Moses to euery one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scribes &amp; Pharizees w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> did sit in Moses chaire.</p>
               <p>He citeth Ambrose to proue, that there is a prelacie or preferrement in the church, because he forbiddeth contention thereabout, as though there could not be a prelacy or preferreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of euery Bishop ouer his church but there must be one Bishop ouer all the church. The like he alleageth out of Bede, which speaketh expressely of al the teachers of the church, &amp; not of one Pope ouer all. The conclusion of his disputation is, that the ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical primacy doth in al points resemble (as much as it possible may) the primacy of Christ, &amp; therefore he that denyeth the primacie among the Apostles to be a true primacy in his kinde is blasphemous against Christ him selfe. Nay rather, he that communicateth with any man, that which is peculiar to our Sauiour Christ, that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shoulde, be as S. Paule speaketh of him <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2880:97"/>
may be humble and yet great after the example of our Sauiour Christ is no question at all. But that any hath suche greatnes in auctoritie, as our Sauiour Christ hath cuer his whole Churche, is the thinge we denye. If Gregorie affirme that Peter by Gods commission had the primacie of the holy church, and was growne in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer aboue the rest: it is no maruel, seeing he was so nere to the open manifestation of Antechrist, which succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him the next saue one: whose tyranny beganne to encrease longe before Gregories time: yet was he in his pretended primacie more modest, then any that followed him to this day: Vtterly refusing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning as prophane, proude &amp; blasphemous against Christ, the title of vniuersall Bishoppe: which Ihon of Constantinople did vsurpe, and other Bishoppes would haue geuen to him.</p>
               <p>And whereas M. Sander frameth an obiection of our part, that no man can be both a minister &amp; a gouernour: therfore no ecclesiasticall minister can be a gouernour, he playeth with his owne shadow. For we deny not but a minister of the church which is a seruaunt, is also a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour. But we affirme that his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is spiritual, not worldly: vnlike to the earthly gouernment of this worlde, euen as the kingdome of Christ is not of this worlde. But it followeth not, because that euery Bishop &amp; shepherd is a gouernour: <q>therefore there must be one Bishop and shepherd gouernour of them all, other then our Sauiour Christ the arch or head shepherd &amp; Bishop of our soules. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4. &amp; 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 25 M.

                  </q> But such obedience as he requireth of other, let him yeeld himselfe. By this saying it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that although Leo take much vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, as to heare the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> can not be determined by the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans, yet he acknowledgeth, that in equitie, he was

               <p>But M. Sander maketh an other obiection for vs, on this maner. The Princes of the Gentiles, doe also serue their subiectes in conseruing peace, keeping out their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies &amp;c. but the clergie must be altogether vnlike to temporal gouernours: therfore there must be no prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or gouernment among them, although it be ioyned with seruice. Once againe I say, we make no such obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but we answere the Anabaptists that so obiect, that the gouernment of the clergy, as it differeth in matter which is spirituall, so also it differeth in forme &amp; maner from the regiment temporall, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is with outward pompe of glory &amp; with the material sword: &amp; this with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity &amp; with the sword of the spirit. Contrariwise M. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der answereth this obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so as he both strengtheneth the hands of the Anabaptistes, &amp; sheweth him selfe litle to differ from their opinion. First therefore he saith that <hi>Christ forbiddeth his Apostles and Bishops such a dominion, as is vsed among the Princes of the earth, not altogether such as ought to be amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them.</hi> But that he speaketh not of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical dominion, it appeareth by the title of <gap reason="foreign">

Secondly he sayth, <hi>that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the King be neuer so good, yet it is not the Kingly, but the Priestly power, which God chose fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning to rule his people withal. And although Kings serue Gods eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, &amp; they are commaunded to be obeyed, yet the making of Kinges ouer Gods owne people at the first came not of God by way of his mercifull election, but by way of his angrie permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> What Anabaptist could speake more heretically or seditiously against the lawfull auctority of Kings &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? But let vs see his reason. Nemrod he sayth, was the first King we reade of: which either by force vsurped, or was aduanced by euell men. I aunswere: if Nemrod was the first that vsurped auctoritie as a tyrant: yet was he not the first that exercised Kingly auctority lawfully ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2880:98"/>
was he ruler ouer Gods people. But what wil h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ouy of Melchisedech, King of Salem, was not he elected of God at the first, both to be a King &amp; a figure of the King of Kings, who should not haue had that dignity, if it had not bene of it selfe both lawfull and godly? Secondly he sayth God was angrie with his people for asking a King, when they had a Priest to rule them. I aunswere, he was not angrie for their asking of a King, but for refusing of a Prince ordeyned by him, which was Samuel a Leuite in deede, of the familie of Cohath, but no Priest of the familie of Aaron. For in his dayes were high Priestes, Eli, Achitob, Achimelech. But after the dayes of Eli, which was both high Priest and Iudge. Samuel was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned Prince or Iudge of the people, hauing aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie aboue Achitob or Achimelech the high Priestes in his time, which were sufficient to decide the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie of the supremacie, if M. Sander, would geue place to the Scriptures. But who can discharge him of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistrie, where he deny eth the making of a King to be Gods institution, affirming it to be, <hi>the fact and consent of men allowed in deede by God,</hi> when the Apostle expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sayeth, it is Gods ordinaunce <hi>Rom.</hi> 13? And where he sayth that Abel, Noe, Abraham, were directly from God chosen to be Priestes as Aaron, he sayeth most vntruly, for they had in their familie, the principalitie of ciuill gouernment as directly, as they had the Priesthoode. But neither of both in suche sorte, as Aaron had the Priesthoode: in whom the one was distincted from the other. And of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is testified that he was a Prince ordeyned of God <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 6. He setteth foorth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of Priests by their auctority in making Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with their holy mouth, as Hierom speaketh. But that proueth not the supremacy of one Priest aboue al men, nor of one Priest aboue an other. As for the ordeining of Peter to be generall shepherd, and high Bishoppe of the whole flocke, by commaunding him to feede his shepe: when he can conclude it out of that Scripture, in any lawfull forme of argument, we will yeelde vnto it.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2880:98"/>
But this is intollerable impudencie, that pretending to shew howe much the Pope is more excellent then any king, he asketh <hi>to what Christian king did Christ euer saye? As my father sent me I send thee.</hi> as though Christ had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sayde so to Peter in singular, and not to all his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in generall. As my father sent me, so I send you. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> 20. Concerning the rocke that he woulde builde his Church vpon, and the feeding of Christes sheepe, and lambes: we shall haue more proper place to examine afterward, what supremacie they giue to the Pope or to Peter ether. His farther rauing against the dignitie of kinges, who list to see, let him turne to the 57. page of his booke, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. And yet I can not omit that he sayth, that <hi>the pompe of a king is most contrary of all other degrees to the profession of Christian faith:</hi> and maketh worldly pompe as vnmeete for a king as for a Bishop. But the Scripture (he sayth) neuer calleth any king head of the Churche, nether doe we call any Kinge heade of the Church, but onely Christ: but in euery particular Church, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture alloweth the king to be the chiefe Magistrate, not onely in gouerning the common wealth, but also in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king godly lawes for the furtherance of religion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all sortes of men as well Ecclesiasticall as ciuill, subiect vnto him, to be gouerned by him, and punished also, not onely for ciuill offences, but also for heresie, and neglect of their duties in matters pertayning to the religion of God. For although many ciuill Magistrats at the first, were enemies of the Gospel: yet was it prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed, that kings should be nursing fathers and Queenes nursing mothers vnto the Church. <hi>Es.</hi> 49. Againe it is an impudent and grosse lye, when he sayth that God was angry <hi>because the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the high Priest was reiected,</hi> &amp; a kingly gouernment called for. For they reiected not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the high Priest, but of Samuel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge: who was no high Priest, although he was a Prophet, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there euer any high Priest Iudge but only Eli.</p>
               <p>But if all supremacie be forbidd<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n ouer the whole Church militant (sayth M. Sander) it is forbidden like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2880:99"/>
that there should be any superior in any one part of the Church. And this he proueth by a iolly rule of Logicke. <hi>For the partes (according to their degree) are of the same nature whereof the whole is.</hi> O subtile reason by which I wil likewise co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, there may not be one scholemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster for all the children of the worlde: therefore there may not be one schoolemaster for one towne in all the world. There can not be one Phisicion for all the world: therefore there may not be a Phisicion for euery citie: yea there can not be one Priest for all the Churches in the world: therefore there may not be a Priest in euery parishe. Againe he reasoneth thus: <hi>If a king be supreame head ouer his owne Christian Realme. it must be by that power which he ether had before his christianitie or beside it. For by his christianitie it is not possible, that he should haue greater power then the Apostles had.</hi> I aunswer: the kinges supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie is perfectly distinct from any power the Apostles had. For although he haue authoritie ouer Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call persons, and in causes Ecclesiasticall, according to Gods word: yet is he no Ecclesiasticall officer, but a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Magistrate, hauing chiefe authoritie in all causes, not absolute to doe what he will, but onely what God commaundeth him: namely to prouide by lawes, that God may be truely worshipped, and all offences against his religion may be punished. And whereas M. Sander inferreth, that an Ethnike Prince or Turke may be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame heade of our Church, we vtterly denye to any such the name of an head, which can not be a member, but euen an Ethnicke Prince or a Turke may be chiefe Magistrate ouer the faithfull, and make lawes for the mayntenance of Christian religion, as an hypocrite Christian may. They are also to be obeyed in all things that are not contrary to God. Nabuchadnezer, Darius, Cyrus, Artaxerxes, which were heathen Princes, made godly lawes for the true worship of God &amp; furtherance of his people: as in the prophecie of Daniel, the bookes of Ezra and Nehemiah, it is manifest. S, Paule appealed to Nero the Emperor. Eusebius testifieth <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 24
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2880:99"/>
that the Christians in a matter of a Bishopps election, and for a Bishops house, were directed by the decree of Aurelianus an heathen Emperour. And this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the Church is alwayes vnder the soueraigne authoritie of Christ, and the spirituall gouernment of her seuerall pastors and teachers, when Christ ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into heauen, ordayned for her edification and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and not one Pope ouer all. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
               <p>But now he will enter one degree farther, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that a king may be as good as it is possible for any mortall man to be, or as any Bishop and Priest is, yet he can nether baptize, consecrate, forgiue sinnes, praise, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, blesse, nor be Iudge of doctrine by his kingly authoritie. If he can doe none of those: he can not be supreame gouernour in all Ecclesiasticall causes. I denye this argument. For his supremacie is not to doe those thinges, or any of them, but to prouide and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, that they may be doon as they ought to be. But he riseth vp againe and sayth, that whosoeuer hath so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne authoritie, either in ciuill matters or Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, he may in his owne person execute any of those thinges, which any of his inferiours may do. So he saith, <hi>the king if he wil, may be Iudge in VVestminster hall, shrieue and constable, yea he may play the tayler, maister Carpenter or tanner.</hi> It is maruell he sayth not that he may be both a king and subiect. <hi>Likewise the primate,</hi> (he might as wel say the Pope) <hi>may helpe a Priest to Masse, cary the crosse in procession, digge a graue, &amp;c.</hi> I deny this rule to hold in all thinges. For there are some thinges, that the Prince may not doe for lacke of knowledge, and some thinges for lacke of calling, and yet he may commaund both to be done. For controuersies of lawe he may not decyde, except he haue knowledge of the law, nor minister Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, except he haue knowledge in phisicke, yet he may command both Lawyers &amp; Phisitions to doe according to their knowledge, likewise to preache, baptize, &amp;c. he may not, because he lacketh calling, for none may doe those thinges lawfully, but he that hath a speciall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2880:100"/>
but he may commaund those thinges to be done, &amp; to be well done, according to Gods lawe, whereof he ought not to be ignorant, and for that purpose is especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally commaunded to study in the booke of Gods lawe, that not onely in matters concerning his owne person, but in matters concerning Gods honor, he may cause all men to doe their duetie. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18. So did Dauid, Salomon, Iehosaphat, Ezechias, Iosias, commaund the Priestes to offer vp the sacrifices and to doe their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which it was not lawfull for their kinges to execute.</p>
               <p>And is it so straunge a matter, that a popish king may not commaund his Chaplayne to saye Masse, or to saye his Masse reuerently, and orderly as the lawes of pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doe require? if he may commaund ouer tho e mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which yet he may not doe him selfe, let M. Sander see how his rule holdeth, that whosoeuer hath authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in any matters, may doe all thinges him selfe, which any of his inferiours may doe, or which he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund to be done, whereupon he concludeth, that <hi>the king hath no right or supreame power at all in Ecclesiasticall causes, (vnlesse it be committed to him from the Bishop)</hi> so that a king if he be a Bishops commissary, may doe that by M. Sanders exception, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> nether by commaundement of God, nor his kingly power he hath auctoritie to doe.</p>
               <p>Another argument he bringeth as good as this, that the lesser authoritie doth not comprehend the greater, and therefore M Horne must aunswer him, whether to preache, baptize, forgiue sinnes &amp;c. be greater or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser ministerie then the kinges authoritie. If it be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: then it can not be comprehended in the kinges au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, which is lesser. What that reuerend father the Bishop of Winchester hath aunswered, it may be seene in his booke against M. Feckenham. But to talke with you M. Sander, what if I graunt, that the Ecclesiasticall ministery, is not comprehended in the kinges authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? will you thereupon inferre, that the kinges autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is not to commaund the ministers of the Church in these matters, to doe their dueties according to the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2880:100"/>
worde of God? In deede you conclude so, but your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is naught. For the king is Gods Lieuetenant, to see both the Church and the common wealth to be wel ordered. And the same thing may be greater and lesser then another in diuers respectes. As in authoritie of commaunding, the king is greater then the Phisition: in knowledge &amp; practise of phisicke, the king is lesse then the Phisition. So in authority of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding the prince is greater then the minister: but in authoritie of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration he is lesse, and no inconuenience in the world, to the dignitie of other estate or calling.</p>
               <p>The Bishop of Winchesters examples, M. Sander saith are euil applyed. For they only shew what was done, and not what ought to haue bene done: and so for many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces are subiect to much wrangling. 1. For either he was no good Prince which medled with disposing of holy matters, 2. or in that deede he was not good. 3. or he did it by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission from a Prophet or an high Priest, 4. or he was deceiued by flatterers, 5. or he was inforced by necessitie. But all these quarells notwithstanding, the examples of Scripture are so many, and so playne, that M. Sanders <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>angling can not obscure them. Dauid a good Prince, did well in appoynting the Leuits and Priestes to their seuerall offices, and forbidding the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uits to cary the arke and the vessells thereof without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission from Priest or Prophet, but onely by the word of God, not deceyued by flatterers, nor enforced by necessitie, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 25. Salomon did the like about the temple. He deposed Abiathar the high Priest, &amp; set Zadoc in his roome. 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 2. 27. &amp; 35. And such are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of all the godly kinges of Iuda. which being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended in the Scripture, are not vncertayne, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or vnknown in their circumstances: but much more certaine arguments for the authoritie of Princes in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical matters, then this text w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> he citeth <hi>(Feede my sheepe)</hi> to forbid them. But here he will aske whether a Christian king be Peters sheepe or no? I answer by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety no but a sheepe of Christes as Peter is. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2880:101"/>
admit Peter to be a sheepeheard, and the king to be his sheepe, what then? forsooth it is against the lawe of nature, for a sheepe to rule his sheepeheard. I graunt in those thinges in which the one is sheepeheard, and the other a sheepe. But I aske of him, is not a king also in some respect called in Scripture a sheepeheard? if he doubt, <hi>Esa.</hi> 44. 28. and <hi>Iere.</hi> 23. 4. may resolue him, and is not Peter and Paule in this respect also sheepe? If he deny it: let the Apostles speake for them selues: let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry soule be subiect, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. If nowe I shoulde reason that it is against the lawe of nature, that the sheepe should rule his sheepeheard: I am sure he would answer with making a diuersitie of respectes. You may then see what a wise argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he hath made, that may be turned backe on his owne head Wherefore here is no such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility as he inferreth, but that a King in some respect of ecclesiasticall gouernment may be aboue his owne pastor, as in other respect he is vnder him.</p>
               <p>M. Sander will goe forward for all this, &amp; putteth case that a Bishop shoulde come to a Christian King, as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose did <hi>Ep.</hi> 33. to the Emperour Valentinian offering his body and goods to his pleasure, but the thing which the Emperour vnlawfully required, he would not yeeld vnto, what could the Emperour doe to him? He coulde not excommunicate him. And if he imprisoned him or put him to death: he did but as Nero or the Turke might doe. <hi>Therefore if the King be neuer so much Christened, hee hath no power ouer the Byshops soule.</hi> If it were possible for the Pope to require an vnlawfull thing: I might put the like case of his holinesse. What if a Christian man should come to him &amp;c. he might excommunicate him as Cayphas did all that confessed Christe: hee might imprison him, as Annas did the Apostles: hee might commaund him to be smiten as Pashur did Ieremy, and Ananias Paule &amp;c. Therefore if hee were neuer so much a Pope, he hath no power ouer a Christian mans soule. Marke the pith of M. Sand. arguments.</p>
               <p>But if Auxentius the Heretike shoulde haue come to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2880:101"/>
the Emperour, had the Emperour none authoritie to call a synode to inquire of his heresie, &amp; he being found an heretike, to haue condemned him therefore? In these doings he had done as Constantine about Arius, and Donatus, and not as Nero with Peter and Paule. But Ambrose his authoritie is cited <hi>Ep.</hi> 32. <hi>Sivel scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum seriem &amp;c. If we call to mind ether the processe of holy Scriptures, or the auncient times, who can deny, but that in a cause of faith, in a cause I saye of fayth, Bishops are wont to iudge of Emperours, not Emperours of Bishops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And who sayth the contrarye, but that in causes of faith, the Emperour is ordinarily to be instructed of the Bishops, and not the Bishops of the Emperour? Or that the Prince hath absolute authoritie in matters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to doe what he will, when we say that in all thinges he mnst follow the direction of Gods worde, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof, especially in difficult matters, he is to receyue of the Ministers of the Church, as of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers the knowledge of law, although he be bownd to see iustice executed.</p>
               <p>But M. Sander will know how a king shall correct or depose a Bishop. I aunswer, if his cryme be apparant, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as Salomon deposed Abiather, if it be doubtfull, by order of iudgement and tryall according, of ciuill Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, if it be a ciuill cryme, and Ecclesiasticall if it be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie that he is accused of, if he can not be condemned vpon iust tryall, he is to be absolued, if this will not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the king, he hath no farther lawfull authoritie by any supremacy, and if he proceede further, he exerciseth ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. And Augustine doth iustly complayne of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of the Donatists, which when the cause had bene decyded by certayne Bishops, deputed by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, they would neuer be satisfied, but still appealed to the Emperour, &amp; <hi>accused the Bishops that were appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Iudges before the earthly king.</hi> M. Sander vrgeth that word vehemently, that he calleth Constantine an earthly king, and yet he is so blinde, that he will not see, that the same earthly kinge, which assigned those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2880:102"/>
to be Iudges, was still acknowledged of all partes, to be the supreame gouernour, Ep. 48.</p>
               <p>But omittinge the wordes of men, he will proue the dig nitie of highe Priestes aboue faithfull Princes, by the authoritie of God in the olde Testament. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 4. Because there God assigneth a sacrifice for the sinne of euery degree of men, according to their dignitie. And first beginneth with the highe Priest, next whom is the whole people, thirde the Prince, and last of all euery priuate man. There is no doubt but the highe Priest, as he was an image and figure of Christ, was chiefe in dignitie. Although in other respectes he was inferior to the Prince, as Aaron was to Moses, Achitob or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimelech to Samuel, Abiather and Zadoc to Dauid and Salomon. The like is confessed of euery minister of the Gospell, and therefore the authoritie of Philo and Theodoretus which he vseth in this poynt, might haue bene spared. And yet may a wicked minister be deposed by a godly Prince. Abiathar in the temple, at the altar, in the holiest place, and sacrificing, was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Salomon, yet was he iustly deposed by Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his treason.</p>
               <p>Maister Sander chargeth vs to affi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me, that the euill life of a Bishop, taketh away his authoritie, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> he denieth to be so, as long as the Church doth tollerate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte them in their places, whereupon he concludeth, that though the Bishop of Rome haue neuer so much abused his office, yet he can not leese his primacye. In deede the abuse of the man, taketh not away the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the office, but if the office be peruerted from the right vse, and degenerated into an heathenish ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannye, as the Bishop of Romes place hath bene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreth yeares, the name of a Bishop onely and that scarsely remayning, we iustly affirme that such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie as that sea had by consent of men, it hath cleane lost, by abuse of their authoritie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer he sayth, it hath no coullour of truth, that we affirme the Pope to gouerne, not as a Pastor, but to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2880:102"/>
beare a soueraintie, as Princes of the worlde, and that he will shewe by six differences, which he will consider in order.</p>
               <p>First no man succeedeth in that chayer, by right of <note place="margin">1.</note> inheritance. The like I may say of the Germane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, therefore this is no difference.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is not obtayned by right of battaile, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasion <note place="margin">2.</note> or otherwise, but by election. So is the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour at this daye, onely by election. And if Maister Sanders be not to impudent, he wil not deny, but there hath bene bickering and intruding by force, into that chayre, and that is worse entering, by symony, murder, treason and deuilish sorcery.</p>
               <p>The thirde, nether childe, nor woman, nor Infidell, <note place="margin">3.</note> nor Catechumeni can be chosen Bishop of Rome. No more can any suche be chosen Emperour by the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den bull and lawe of the election. And yet seeing boyes are made Cardinalls, which be electours of the Pope, and elegible, there is none impossibilitie, but a boye may be chosen Pope, as well as a woman hathe beene Pope, Ione I meane. Iohn the 23. was condemned in the councell of Constans for an Infidell, which deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the immortalitie of the soule.</p>
               <p>The fourth, the election of the Bishop of Rome as of <note place="margin">4.</note> all other Bishops, pertayneth onely to Ecclesiasticall persons, a king may be chosen by the people without the Clergie. To this I saye, that the Bishop of Rome was wont to be chosen as well by the people as by the Clergie. And so is the Emperour chosen by as many Bishops as ciuill Princes, except in case of equalitie of voyces. Nether is the Clergye euer excluded in any lawfull election of any kinge where he is made by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>The fift, to omit the Bishop of Romes temporall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, <note place="margin">5.</note> which he confesseth to be but accessory to his Bishoprike, in his Ecclesiasticall gouernment, he vseth not that force and power which worldly Princes do. He compelleth none, no not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes in Rome to baptisme.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:2880:103"/>
No more doth the Emperour. But what meanes vseth he to depose kinges, &amp; absolue their subiects from their othe of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, where he iudgeth them for heretikes, how maketh he warres and setteth all the worlde in an vprore, to defend his vsurped dignitie &amp; false doctrine? Doth he not by force compell Christians to his filthy Idolatrye, or els cruelly murdereth and tormenteth them?</p>
               <p>The 6. the Bishop of Rome (as Bishop) neuer puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth them with the materiall sword, which forsake his <note place="margin">6.</note> Church, No, but as Antichrist and a tyrant he impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them, hangeth them, drowneth them, burneth them, not as <hi>a Bishop sayth M. Sander, but as a temporall Prince and Lorde, as Moses being one of the Priestes of our Lord was also maister of ciuill gouernment.</hi> Behold, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisor of differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces at length maketh him a ciuill Prince and temporall Lorde, from whom he had labored by so many differences to distingush before. But now lest you should espye his impudent conclusion, he draweth into a new controuersie, whether Moses were a Priest. And first he will proue that Moses was a Priest, by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <hi>Psal.</hi> 98. Where it is sayd, <hi>Moses &amp; Aaron in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotibus eius.</hi> If he will not allowe the Hebrue worde <hi>Cohanim</hi> to signifie Princes, as it doth, in diuerse other places, yet sayth not the Psalme that Moses and Aaron were both Priestes, but that amonge his Priestes they were suche as called vpon his name, and were hearde, and Samuel who follow<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th in the same verse, confessed nowe by Maister Sander to be a Leuit, forgetting that before he made him highe Priest. But farther to proue that Moses was a Priest, he citeth Augustine, Ieronym, Gregor. Naz. Dionys. and Philo, but all to small pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for his cause.</p>
               <p>It must needes be confessed, that Moses as all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes before him, in their families, was a Priest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the distinction of the two offices was made, when Aaron and his posteritie onely were choosen <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to bee Priestes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:2880:103"/>
After which tyme he was no longer a Priest, nether did he any thing as a Priest, but as a Prophet, and as a Prince. But admit, he were both a Prince and a Priest, yet he commaunded Aaron as a Prince and not as a Priest. For Aaron was highe Priest, and therefore coulde haue no Priest aboue him. By which it is infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the office of a Prince is to commaunde the highe Priest, and so was it alwayes practised by all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Princes. But Maister Sander returning to his last and least difference, affirmeth that the Bishop of Rome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer condemneth any man for herefie or schisme to corporall death in his owne person, nor teacheth that they may be condemned of other Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. But who vnderstandeth not this mockerie? for as well it may be sayde, the Kinge neuer hangeth any man in his owne person, therefore none are executed by his authoritie, as the Pope neuer condemneth any to death in his owne person, therefore he perswadeth not his religion with fire and sworde. But will the Pope and the Bishoppe, that are so mylde and gentle, suffer them whome they condemne for heresie to escape their hands, before they haue deliuered them to death? O cruell and shameles hypocrites.</p>
               <p>Neuertheles Maister Sander sayth, they haue power ouer mens soules by that which our Sauiour sayd to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>To the I will giue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen. &amp;c. which wordes are deryued to the Bishop of Rome, by meanes of the chayre of S. Peter.</hi> A straunge kinde of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuation neuer touched in the Scripture, <hi>to which words the sayde Bishop referreth all his power, where as worldly Princes appeale to the lawe of the Gospell nether in getting, nor gouerning, nor establishing their dominion and power.</hi> Marke well this English Anabaptist. Is not this the lawe of the Gospell?</p>
               <p>There is no power but of God, and the powers that be are ordayned of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. for getting of demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and power. And is not this the lawe of the Gospell for their gouerning? that gouernours are sent of God
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2880:104"/>
for the punishment of euil doers, and for the prayse of them that doe well. 1. Pet. 2. vers. 14.</p>
               <p>And for the establyshing of theyr dominion, is not this the law of the Gospel, giue vnto Caesar the thinges that belong to Caesar. Matthew 22. verse 21. And againe, we muste be subiect of necessitie, not onely for feare but euen for conscience Rom. 13. verse. 5.</p>
               <p>As for the Popes pietie and lenitie, wherewith hee ruleth, when all the world seeth how proudely and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall yhe behaueth him selfe, it were folly to spend many wordes about it. As for his gentle tearmes of sonnes and brethren, wherewith hee saluteth Princes, and Byshops, and the seruaunt of the seruants of God, which he calleth him selfe: be simple and shorte clokes to hide his horrible presumption and tyranny, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he not only most sha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>efully reuileth most Christian Princes, as it appeareth in that trayterous Bul, which came from him against our moste gracious soueraigne Lady, but also taketh vpon him to depose them from their estate royall, vsurping to him felfe the name of holynesse, of heade of the Church &amp;c. of Christe, of God him selfe, and calleth Princes his vassalles. &amp;c. of which blasphemies his Cannon Lawes are stuffed full. And therefore it is too farre in the day, for M. Sander to make vs thinke there is no difference betweene white and black, Pride and Humilitie, Gentlenesse and Crueltie, Holynesse and hypocrisie, fayth and falshode, vice and vertue.</p>

               <q>OF the diuerse senses whiche are in the holy Scripture, and namely about these woordes (vppon this Rocke <note place="margin">Sander.</note> I will builde my Church) and which is the moste literall and proper sense of them.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:2880:104"/>
TO contende about the diuersitie of senses, it were <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> to take vppe a newe controuersie. I admitte that whiche Maister Sander confesseth, the lyter all sense onely to be of force to conuince the aduersary. And the literall sense not to bee alwayes according to the grammaticall sounde of the wordes, but according to the moste playne meaning of the speaker. As when Christe sayeth to Peter, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o thee I will giue the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen, hee meaneth not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Keyes of Yron, but authoritie in the Kingdome of Heauen, as Keyes are deliuered by the Maister to his Stuard, but not as keyes of a citie are deliuered, which betoken the giuing of possession of that Citie to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by him which receiueth the Keyes (as Maister Sander sayth) For that was no part of Christes mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to resigne the gouernment of his Church to Peter, for such giuing of Keyes is of the subiectes to their Superior, but to make him one of the Stuardes of his great house, to open and shut, according to his apoyntment. Otherwise, onely Christ hath the key of Dauid, which openeth and no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth Apocalips 3. verse 7.</p>
               <p>Likewise when he sayth: Thou art Peter, I confesse and agree with Maister Sander, that the lyterall sence is not, thou art a naturall stone, but thou art that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde my Churche, whiche a stone is towarde the house that is builded vppon that stone. But so that Peter is not the onely foundation, nor the Corner stone, which is onely Christe, but one of the twelue stones of the foundation, as it may more playnely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the Apocalips the 21. Chapter and the 14. verse.</p>
               <p>Furthermore I confesse, that what soeuer by necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conclusion may be gathered, of any true literal sense, is of equall authoritie in the word of God, with that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is expressed in playne words. As the consubstantiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Christ with God the Father, the blessed trinitie, and such like,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2880:105"/>
But whereas M. Sand. ioygneth to these, not onely the perpetuall virginitie of the virgine Mary, which is not certainly, though probably to be gathered, but also transubstantiation, the sacrifice of the Masse, and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, against which the sense of the scripture is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, I will not admit them for examples.</p>
               <p>But to come to his purpose, he findeth in the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, foure diuerse senses of these woordes (vpon this Rocke I will builde my Church) whereof three hee reiecteth, as vnperfect which haue auncient writers, as he confesseth for their Authors, the last hee hath no auncient writer to defende.</p>
               <p>The firste, that Christe is that Rock on whome the Church is builded, which Augustine holdeth.</p>
               <p>The second, that euery Disciple of Christ is the rock, which is Origens opinion.</p>
               <p>The third, that Peters faith or confeffion is the rock, which is Chrysostoms iudgement.</p>
               <p>The fourth, which is his owne, and therefore he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it the perfecte sense, is, that Peter concerning his office in Gods Church, through the promise of Christ which is past, and the faithfull confession of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, which is presently made, and the power of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Sheepe, which then was to come, is this Rocke vpon which the Church is builte. Heere I wishe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to note, that the Papiste reiecteth three senses of three seuerall auncient writers, and maketh the fourth him selfe, that you may see, with what equitie they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime againste vs, if vppon neuer so good ground, we departe from the interpretation of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But nowe let vs see what reasons hee hath to confute these three Doctors oppinions as vnsuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent interpretations.</p>
               <p>Firste he sayeth, If Augustines sense were true, all the three other shoulde be voyde, In deede his owne sense, vnderstanding Peter to be a singular Rocke, more then the other Apostles is made voyde thereby, as it is false. But the other two may stande very well
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2880:105"/>
well with Augustines meaning, for hee meaneth not Christe barely, but Christe whome Peter and euery true Disciple of Fayth confesseth, to be the rocke of the Church, Neither doth the worde <hi>thou,</hi> hinder this sense. Seeing Augustine vnderstandeth Peter to be a denominatiue a <hi>Petra,</hi> of the stone, nor the woorde, <hi>I will builde,</hi> for notwithstanding he hadde begunn to builde his Church before, yet hee woulde builde stil, and that more magnificall then before.</p>
               <p>The sence of Origine hee reiecteth, as not literall vppon which I will not stande.</p>
               <p>The sense of Chrysostome hee refuseth, sayinge, the Fayth of Peter is not the onely Rocke, wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Churche shall be builded, for then it had beene buylte vppon the Fayth of Iohn Baptiste before this time. A pythy argumente, as though there is any more then one Fayth Ephesians 4. verse 5. whiche is the same in Peter and in Iohn, and in all the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, the same I saye in kinde, not in number. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did Chrysostome meane, that the singulare Fayth of Peter were the Rock of the Church, but the same one Fayth and confession embraced of euery member thereof.</p>
               <p>That he sayeth <hi>I will builde,</hi> whereas hee had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begunne to builde, and did then presently build, What inconuenience is it but in a quarrellers minde. Hee speaketh of the Future tenses, to signifie the great amplyfication of his Church which he woulde make by the preaching of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>But of all senses Maister Saunder lyketh his owne beste, asperfect and contayning all the other therein. For first sayth he, if Peter be the Rocke, then Christe that made him is much more, as the geeuer and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of his power. But I deny that Christe did giue the same that he is him self, that is, to be the onely sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular founda<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion, Rocke, and corner stone of his Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly he sayth, if Peter in respecte of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2880:106"/>
be a Rock, then his confession is a Rocke. But then say I, they that make the same confession are as much a Rock as he.</p>
               <p>Thirdely he sayth, if Peter beeing captaine Disciple of all that euer were, be a Rock, then all other Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that are contayned in him as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe, may also be this Rock. Who had thought Peter had bene such an vniuersal thing to containe al disciples in him? Doth not this containe manifest blasphemie? to make all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples contained in Peter, whiche are contayned onely in Christe, as the members in their mystirall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whereof hee, onely is chiefe heade, Soueraigne, Captaine, or what other name of superioritie can bee deuised.</p>
               <p>But nowe that hee hath made such a monstrous iumbling of three opinions in one, he is not ashamed to charge Maister Iewell, for leauing the moste literall sense, and mingling three, opinions of these foure in one, as though his sense which is farthest of from the meaning of Christ, were the onely or moste lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sense. But seeing hee wisheth Maister Iewell or any of vs to discusse the meaning of Christe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly with all circumstaunces, for my parte considering all circumstaunces, I think the most simple and plaine meaning of Christe is, that Peter it a Rocke or stone, vppon which the Church is buylded, but none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, then euery one of the Apostles is, Ephe, 2. and 20. verse, and in the Apocalips the 21. chapter and 14. verse. Of which M. Sander also confesseth euery one to be a Rock in his kinde.</p>
               <p>But nowe let vs see the fiue circumstaunces, by which Maister Saunder will proue Peter for to bee such a Rocke, as none of all the reste of the Apostles is but he.</p>
               <p>The firste, Christe promised Symon before he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that he shoulde be called Peter, whiche was the firste cause of beeing the Rocke Iohn I. Admit this to bee a promise, &amp; not an imposition of a name, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2880:106"/>
of the giftes of fortitude &amp; constancie where with he woulde endue him, this proueth him not to be a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular rocke.</p>
               <p>The second, he was named Peter before he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed, which was the performaunce of the promise. <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. I dout not but that he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed Christ before he was made an Apostle, although he had not made that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne confession expressed in <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. Wherefore this circumstaunce is a friuolous argument. And his brother Andrewe which first brought him to Christ, confessed Iesus to be the Messias before Peter was come to Christ.</p>
               <p>The thirde, when he had confessed the Godheade of Christ which was the fru<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct of the gift &amp; of the promise, Christ pronounced him to be such a rocke, whereupon he would build his church, which was the reward of his confession.</p>
               <p>But all the Apostles made the same confession, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the same reward was geuen to all, that they should euerie one be a rocke or stone, on which the church should be builded.</p>
               <p>The fourth, Christ prayed that Peters faith might not fayle, which was the warrant of the perpetuitie of his strong confession <hi>Luc.</hi> 22. Christ prayed for all his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <hi>Ioan.</hi> 17. the speciall prayer for Peter, was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his greater weakenes, when he was left to him selfe.</p>
               <p>The last, to shew what strength Peter should geue, to his brethren after his conuersion, Christ bad him feede his lambes, wherby he was made such a rock, wherby he should stay vp his church, by teaching &amp; ruling y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as whose voyce the sheepe should be bound to heare in payne of damnation. First I answere, that the strength or confirmation which he should geue to his brethren, was not all one, with his feeding of the lambes, but was vsed to the strengthening of his weake brethren, the rest of the Apostles whom after his maruelous conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he did mightely confirme, though in his fall he was
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2880:107"/>
shewed to be the weakest of all. Then I say, the feeding of the sheepe of Christ, was committed to him with the rest of the Apostles, in which he had no prerogatiue of auctoritie geuen, but an earnest charge, to shewe his greater loue, by greater diligence in his office. So that hitherto Peter is none otherwise a rock, then euery one of the Apostles is.</p>

But nowe to the argument of this chapter. Chrysostomis cited to proue, that, where Christ sayth to Peter, thou art Simon the sonne of Iona, thou shalt be called Cepha, which is by intepretation Peter, a newe name is promised to Simon, <hi>in Ioan. Hom.</hi> 18. <hi>Honorifice</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:2880:107"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c. Christ doth forespeake honorably of him. For the certeine foretelling of things to come, is the worke only of the immortal God. It is to be noted, that Christ did not foretell at this first meeting all thinges which shoulde come to passe afterwarde to him. For he did not call him Peter, neither did he say, vpon this rocke will I builde my church. But he sayd, thou shalt be called Cephas. For that was both of more power, and also of more auctoritie.</hi> There is nothing in this sentence, but that we may willingly admit, Peter was not yet instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that he might be one of the twelue foundations of the church, as he was afterward. And that Chrysostom iudged no singular thing to be graunted, by that saying of Christ <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. to Peter, appeareth, by his wordes <hi>in Euang. Ioann. Praef.</hi> Where he applieth the same to Ihon. <q>
                     <hi>Tonitrui enim filius est Christo dilectissimus, columna omniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quae in orbe sunt ceclesiarum, qui caeli claues habet.</hi> For the sonne of thunder is most beloued of Christ, being a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of all the churches which are in the worlde, which hath the keyes of heauen. Neither doth Cyrillus, whom he citeth, make any thing for his purpose. <hi>In Ioan. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Nec Simon &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>And he telleth afore hande that his name shalbe Peter and not nowe Simon: by the very word si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifying, that he would build his church on him as on a rocke and most sure stone.</hi> These are the wordes of Cyrillus, but that he meaneth not his person, but his faith, he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth manifestly in his booke <hi>de Trinit. lib.</hi> 4. speaking v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the text of <hi>Math.</hi> 16. the grounde of M.

                     <hi>Peiram opinor per agnominationem nihil aliud, quam inconcussam &amp; firmissimam discipuli fidem vocauit, in qua ecclesia Christi it a firmata &amp; fundata esset, vt non labere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> I thinke he called a rocke, by denomination no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but the most vnmoueable and stedfast faith of that disciple, on which the church of Christ should be so established and founded, that it should not fall. Here is an other principall Doctor ioyning with Chrysostom, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst M. Sander, who affirmeth, that the rocke is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but Peters faith.</q> After these he nameth. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact and Euthymius two late writers, but he citeth
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2880:108"/>
nothing out of them presently. But after shewing the force of Gods promise to be effectual, to work al meanes necessarie for the performaunce of it, he citeth out of Euthymius in Luc 6. that it was like, that in Ioh. 1. Christ promised that Simon should be called Peter, &amp; in Luk. 6 called him Peter. All this needed not, we doubt not but Simon was called Peter. Yea but Cyrillus sayth <hi>in Ioan. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 64. <hi>that he being Prince and heade, first cried out saying, thou art Christ the sonne &amp;c.</hi> Therfore he was head before his confession, by promise and name. I will not here say, how contrary M. Sander is to him selfe, which in the cap. 3. sayd, that his supremacie was graunted to him as a rewarde of his confession. But I will aunswere Cyrillus by him selfe, <hi>in Ioan. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 28 that Peter was <hi>Ordine maior,</hi> superior in order, to auoyde confusion, not in degee, dignitie or auctoritie. And whereas M. Sander vrgeth so vehemently, that the name of Peter was not geuen for his confession, but was singular to him by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, so that it belonged literally to no Prophet, Apostle nor disciple but only to him, &amp; his successors, it is a most fond &amp; friuolus matter, for the name of Bonarges, was specially geuen to the sonnes of Zebedee, in respect of their excellent giftes, and at the same time that the name of Peter was geuen to Simon, which secing it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth not to their successors, which haue not the same giftes, no more doth the name &amp; dignity of Peter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to any that sit in his chaire, if euer he had any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed chaire among the Gentiles, which by Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, was appoynted to be the principall Apostle of the Iewes. Moreouer where he laboreth tooth &amp; nailc, to proue, that these wordes (vpon this rocke I will build my church) are to be referred to Peter, as I sayd before, I will graunt euen as muche. But that Peter by these wordes, was made a singular rocke more then all the Apostles, vpon which the whole church is builded, I vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny, neither shall he be euer able to proue it. For it is an impudent lye, <hi>that onely Peter at this time, had this high reuelation, to acknowledge Christ to be the sonne of</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:2880:108"/>
                  <hi>God.</hi> For he aunswered in the name of all the rest, who beleued the same which he in their name confessed. Did not Andrewe before Peter acknowledge him to be the Messias? Did not Nathaniel which was none of the Apostles, acknowledge him to be the sonne of God and the King of Israel. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 1. 49.</p>
               <p>But he reasoneth substantially, when he saith <hi>thou on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly art the rocke, because thou alone hadst this name &amp;c.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, thou alone hadst it geuen, thou alone didst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse me &amp; to thee alone I say thou art Peter. As though a man may not haue a name, whose signification is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to many. Salomon alone was promised to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and was called <hi>Iedidiah,</hi> that is the beloued of God, shall we therefore reason that Salomon onely was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God, as for that he onely confessed, I haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed before, that it is false, for Christ saying, thou art Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, meaneth not to say thou onely art a rocke, but thou well aunswerest thy name, which signifieth a rocke or stone, and I wil in deede vse thee as a rocke or stone, to builde my church vpon, yet not meaning the person, but the office and doctrine of his Apostleship.</p>
               <p>But nowe hath M. Sander no lesse then 21. reasons, to proue that Peter is the rocke, here spoken of, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> althogh they may for the most parte be easily auoided, yet I will graunt that Peter is one of the twelue stones, whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the church is builded, but not the only stone.</p>
               <p>Therfore his first foure arguments, I deny 1. Simon is alone promised to be called Peter, 2. he alone is called Peter, 3. Christ speaketh to him alone, saying. And I say to thee &amp;c. 4. Christ sayth of him alone, thou art Peter, therefore Simon alone is the rocke of the church, let him proue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequence if he can. The next 5. which proue that these wordes are to be referred to Peter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that they be not verie strong, yet I graunt the wordes may be aptly referred to Peter, the reasons are 1. vpon the pronoune. The 2 the worde rocke of which Peter is named, 3. the conference of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together, 4. the word I will build, 5. the word my church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:2880:109"/>
The 10, Argument I denye, that Christ. (by saying to Peter, Feede my Lambes, feede my sheepe) made him the heade stone of Gods militant Church nexte vnto Christe.</p>
               <p>The eleuenth, that Peter is shewed to be the Rocke spoken of, by geuing of the Keyes, I confesse: ebut see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the keyes are giuen to all the Apostles, this proueth Peter to be none otherwise a Rocke, then euery one of them, That Iohn receued the Keyes I shewed euen now out of Chysostome.</p>
               <p>The twelfth, that the propertie of a Rock in constant withstanding of tempests, agreeth with Peter, I graunt and so it doth to the rest of the Apostles, for whome Christ prayed as he did for Peter, who also strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and confirmed their brethren as Peter did.</p>
               <p>The 13. I confesse that hell gates shall not preuayle against the Church, nor against any member thereof, which is a small reason to make Peter supreame heade thereof.</p>
               <p>The 14. which is the authorities of those doctors that teach Peter to be the rocke whom he nameth when he citeth their sayings, or quoteth their places, I will seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally consider.</p>
               <p>The 15. their reason also when I see them, to deriue Peters authoritie to his successors, I will waighe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>The 16. the practise of 1500. yeares I deny.</p>
               <p>The 17. I deny that all generall councells, or any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councell for 600. yeares after Christ, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Peter to be the rocke in that sence, the Papistes do now.</p>
               <p>The 18. if the confession of Peter be the rocke, yet it is none inconuenience, that the church shoulde be builded theron, which began to be builded on the same confession offered by Iohn Baptist.</p>
               <p>The 19. though you confound the diuerse senses ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the fathers in your fourth sense, yet that proueth not your sense to be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:2880:109"/>
The 20. seeing the Apostles are certeyne foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and rockes vpon which the church is builded, I confesse that Peter must needes be one, but that he was the most principall rocke in respect of his name Peter, which is a stone, I say it followeth no more then that Salomon was best of al men beloued of God, because of that name <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didiah,</hi> which signifieth beloued of God.</p>
               <p>The 21. that all the Protestantes doe not agree in the interpretation of these wordes (vpon this rocke I will builde my church) it proueth not your exposition, to be true, for neither do all the old Doctors, nor yet the new Papistes agree in one, &amp; the same interpretation of this text. And oftentimes it may inuincibly be proued, that an heresie hath no grounde out of suche a text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, although the true and naturall sense thereof can not be found at all.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2880:112"/>
yet by the whole councell it was determined that the Archbishop of Constantinople should haue equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with the Archbishop of Rome in the East, onely the title of prioritie or senioritie reserued to the Bishop of Rome.</p>

To thee will I giue the keyes of the kingdom of heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt bind vpon earth, shall be bound in heauen: and whatsoeuer thou shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heauen. And to the same after his resurrection, he sayth: Feede my sheepe. And although he giueth to all his Apostles after his resurrection equall power, and sayth, as my father hath sent me, so also doe I sende you, receyue the holy Ghost. Whose sinnes you forgiue they shall be forgiuen, and whose sinnes you retayne they shall be retayned: yet that he might shewe the vnitie, by his authoritie, he disposed the beginning of the same vnitie, beginning at one. For verely the rest of the Apostles, were euen the same thing that Peter was, endued with equall fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship both of honour and of power: but the beginning
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2880:113"/>
procedeth from vnitie, that the Church might be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be one. Thus farre Cyprian.

These words shew how vaine M.

               <p>The 5. reason is vttered by Hierome <hi>aduersus Iouinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num lib.</hi> 1. aunswering the obiection of Iouinian, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to proue that Iohn the virgine was as excellent as Peter the maried man. <hi>At dicis, &amp;c.</hi> But thou sayst, the Church is built vpon Peter: <hi>Albeit the selfe same thing in another place, be done vpon all the Aposiles, &amp; all doe receiue the keyes of the kingdom of heauen, and the strength of the</hi>

                  <hi>Church be grounded equally vpon them, yet therefore one is chosen among twelue, that a head being made, the occasion of schisme may be taken away.</hi> Here he woulde haue three thinges to be noted. First that the Church is so built vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Peter the rocke, that in the same place where it is built vpon Peter, the like is not done vpon the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. But seeing he him selfe before vrged the future tence, I will build, this collection is false. Christ promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that he will builde his Church vpon Peter, but when he buildeth, he vseth all the Apostles as well as Peter.</p>
               <p>Secondly that the church is equally built vpon all the Apostles, therefore not more on Peter then on the rest.</p>
               <p>Thirdly that one is chosen head to auoyde schisme.</p>
               <p>But if all be equall, he as keth how one may be head? I aunswer, euen as the foreman of the Iury in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectes is chiefe, and yet they are all equall. But he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth they are equall in authoritie, as Apostles, but not as Bishops. But seeing the office of euery Apostle is aboue the office of euery Bishop, it will followe, that euery Apostle as Apostle, is aboue Peter as Bishop of Rome, which were a perilous matter for Maister San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to admitte. Howbeit concerning this distinction of his, more is to be sayd in a more proper place. In the meane tyme, he vrgeth, that Peter was chosen of Christ to be heade, to auoyde strife and schisme, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son seeing it holdeth alwayes, there ought alwayes one heade to be chosen, to be a heade and perpetuall rocke, by succession. I aunswer the reason of auoyding schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, may gayne so much, that in euery Church, such as the first of the Apostles was, such an head for such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose may be chosen, but it will not inforce one heade being a mortall man, ouer all the Churche, which no one man can keepe in vnitie, and how conuenient the headship of the Romish Church is to auoyde schismes, let so many schismes as haue bene made euen for the attayning of the same headship, beare witnes. Whereof one continued 39 yeares.</p>

As for Leo Bishop of Rome, it is well knowen, hee was too much addicte to maintaine the dignitie of his Sea, and yet he was farre from the tyranny which the later byshops vsurped and practised vnder pretence of Peters supremacie. His words ate cited in Ann. ass. ser. 3. <hi>Super hoc Saxum &amp;c. Vppon this stone, this soundnes and strength, I will builde an euerlasting temple, and the hight of my Church, which is to reach to Heauen, shall rise in the strength of this Rocke.</hi> A great extolling of Peter, vsuall to the Byshops of Rome, but yet no more is saide of him then may be truely faide vpon euery one of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</p>
               <p>The 6. reason is vttered by Augustine. Ep. 165. <hi>Petro totins ecclesiae figuram. &amp;c. Our Lorde saide to Peter bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the figure of the whole Church. vppon this rocke I will builde my church.</hi> And againe in Ioan Tr. 124. <hi>Ecclesiae &amp;c. Peter the Apostle by a generalitie that was figured, did beare the person of the Church, by reason of the primacie of his Apostleship.</hi> Heere he maketh much adoe aboute his primacie, by reason whereof he beareth the figure of all the Church, willing to inferre that because hee was primate of the Apostles, and in respect of his primacy represented the whole Church, therefore he was soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne ruler and generall officer of the whole militant Church. But it followeth not, that euery one which is made an atturney or Proxei to receiue a thing for a whole comminaltie, is thereby made generall ruler of al that comminaltie.</p>

So that all these reasons duely considered, the sayinges of the Doctors which affirme Peter to be a rocke or stone, on which the Church is builded, doe not prooue that hee was an onely foundation of the whole Church, but with the rest of the apostles, he was one and the firste of the twelue stones, whereon the Church was founded, and that in respect of his office and doctrine, not of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as he wasa mortal man.</p>

Sand. would auoyde by bringing in of two rocks, Christ &amp; Peter:</q> the particle exclusiue shutteth him cleane out of the dores, for Hillarie sayth not, that Christe is a Rocke, but that he is the onely Rocke. Therefore this is but one Rocke and one building, and not as M. Sand. sayth two Rocks and two buildings, for aswell hee might say two Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Now where Hilarie vpon Mathew acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Peter to be a rock and foundation of the Church, it is answeared before, that he was one of the xii. foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations spoken of Apoc. 21. in a farre other meaning then Christ is the onely Rock.</p>
               <p>The 3. authoritie is, Cyrillus Dial, 4. de trini. <q>The rock is nothing else, but the strong &amp; assured faith of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</q> This saith M. S. is that I would haue, for this disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was S. Peter, and the rock here spoken of is nothing else, but S. Peters faith, therfore it is not Christ. Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the rock is nothing but S. Peters faith, therfore it is not his person &amp; so no mortall man. For those woordes, nothing but Peters faith, do not exclude Christ because faith cannot be without necessary relation vnto Christ, but they exclude the person of Peter as a mortall man, because flesh &amp; blood reuealed not this confession vnto him, but the Heauenly father.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The 4. authorite is Chrysostome. Vpon this Rocke, that is, vpon this faith and this confession I will builde my church.</q> M. San. saith, he that beleeued &amp; confessed was Peter and not Christ, ergo the rock is Peter &amp; not Christ. Although this argument haue no consequence in the world, yet to admitte that it doth followe, I will reply thus, but he that beleeued and confessed was not Peter onely, therefore Peter onely was not this rock.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The 5. is Aug. de verbis dom. Christe was the rocke vpon which foundation Peter him selfe was also builte.</q> M. San. asketh if one Rock may not be built vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2880:116"/>
as Peter vpon Christ? yes verily, but Peter none otherwise then the reste of the Apostles, who were all foundation stones, laid vpon the great corner stone or onely foundation Rock Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>S. Augustine againe addeth in Christes person. <q>I wil not builde my selfe vpon thee, but I wil build thee vpon me. M San. following the allegory of building co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth that Christ is the first &amp; greatest stone, vpon which by all proportion, the seconde stone that should be laide, must be greatest that can be gotten next the first.</q> If this be so, it is meruaile the Angel which shewed vnto Iohn the building of the heauenly Ierusalem, shewed him not this second stone by it selfe, but the xij. stones lying e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually one by an other vppon the maine foundation.

But M. Iewel is fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike in M. San opinion, that denying any mortall man to be this rock, nowe proueth euery mortall man that is Christs disciple to be this Rock. Nay rather M.

learning is builte vppon S. Peter, but so it is builte vpon euery true Disciple of Christe by Origens iudgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Againe Origine sayth: If thou thinke that the whole Church is built onely vpon Peter, what then wilte thou say of Iohn the sonne of thonder, and of euery of the Apostles?</q> First M. Sand. chargeth the Bishop for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out in English this worde <hi>Illum,</hi> so that he shoulde haue saide, vpon that Peter, whereby he accuseth him to deny, that Peter is a Rock, whiche is an impudente lye. Secondly when this authoritie doth vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe his whole building of the popish rocke, he can say nothing, but that Iohn was a mortall man, and so were all the Apostles aswel as Peter, therfore M. Iewel saide not truely, that the olde sathers haue written, not any mortall man, but Christe himselfe to be this Rock, when Iohn and all the Apostles be rockes. As though there were no difference betwene the onely founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and rocke of the whole Church, which is Christ, &amp; all the other stones that are built vpon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Last of all Origen sayth: Shall we dare to say, that the gates of hell shall not preuayle onely against Peter? or are the keyes of the kingdom of heauen giuen onely to Peter?</q> M.

Peter of all the Apostles first confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the name of the whole Church. Admit this were true, as it can neuer be proued, that this was the first time that any of the Apostles confessed Christ: yet no primacy of superiority is hereby gayned. if the sentence as Origen expounded it, perteyneth to euery faithfull disciple: What aduauntage M.

               <p>In the second for continuaunce of the building pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, there must be alwayes some mortall man, which beeing made the same Rocke by election, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde by reuelation, shoulde make the same confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whensoeuer hee is demaunded, or consulted in matters of Religion. If this were true there were no necessitie of the holy Scriptures, neither yet of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes and Councelles, if one Pope were abe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue all the demaundes mooued by all menne of the worlde.</p>
               <p>In the thirde he sayeth, if there muste be some such one Rocke, it is not possible it shoulde be any other but the Bishop of Rome: First, because he alone hath beene the firste and chiefe in all assemblyes. Secondly, he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sitteth in Peters Chaire. Thirdly, and the consent of the world hath taken him so, euer indeede, but by the aduersaryes confession aboue a thousande yeeres. But God be thanked, the Churche hath no neede of any such Rock, neither is any such taught.

And the three reasons are all false, in manner and forme as they are vniuersally set downe, as in their proper places shalbe shewed.</p>
               <p>In the the fourth he gloryeth, that he hath chosen to proue that poynte which of all other is moste hard. <hi>That all the Apostles were not the same thinge that Peter was.</hi> And firste he will aske in what Gpspell or holye Scripture it is written, that euery other Apostle was the same Rocke, which Sainct Mathewe testifyeth Sainct Peter to haue beene. I answeare, not onely by necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry collection out of many places of Scripture, whiche he him selfe acknowledgeth to be the literall sense, as well as that which followeth the sounde of wordes, it is

proued, but also in plaine wordes of Sainct Paul Ephe. the second, verse. 20. Where the Churche is builded vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophetes, Iesus Christ beeing the head corner stone. And Apo. 21 verse. 14. Where the twelue precious stones, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the wall of the Cittie, had on them the names of the xij. Apostles of the Lambe.</p>
               <p>The 5. is either thus or nothing at all, for it is not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in him as the other bee. If Cyprian or Hierome were alleadged for this equallitie, it were sufficient for him to say, they were no Euangelists. For he sheweth it written: thou shalt be called Cephas and thou art Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. You see these men that bragge of the Doctors, will be holden by them, as long as they liste.</p>
               <p>The 6. whereas all holy Scriptures is on the popish Catholicks side, he lamenteth the vnhappines of these dayes, in w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> men altogither vnlearned in them, by the bare naming of Gods word, haue among Pedlers won their spurres, and amonge the ignoraunt haue gotten the opinion of knowledge.

               <p>The 6 Christ payed tribute for Peter, as vnder head of his family. ergo he was greater then the rest, A fond argument. This <hi>Didrachma</hi> was payd for euery man in the City where he dwelt, &amp; because Peter had a house and a family in the Cytie, Christ payed for him with whom he lodged, and him selse.

               <p>First, that Christ maketh his Church and splrituall kingedome subiect to tribute, yea, to Moses lawe, by which that kind of tribute was due.</p>

               <p>It is a strong argument, that the payment of trybute which argueth subiection, should make Peter so greate a Lorde, that he should be out of all subiection, which if Chrysostome had considered, hee woulde not haue grounded Peters primacie vppon so friuolus an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

hath, is thereby both a King and a Constable, but a King onely. Neither doth their staying or as he calleth it resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in some particular citie, proue that the Apostles either were or might be Bishops, that is geue ouer their generally charge and take vpon them a particular, or still reteyning their generall charge, to exercise the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Bishoppe any longer, then vntill the churche was perfectly gathered, where they remayned. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the holy Ghost distinguished their vniuersall charge into seuerall partes, to auoyde confusion, as in making Peter chiefe Apostle of the circumcision, and Paule of the Gentiles, yet were they not thereby made Bishoppes. And although the consent of writers is, that Iames was Bishoppe of Ierusalem, yet following the course of the Scriptures, we must hold that Iamesby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the holy Ghost, was appoynted to stay there, not as a Bishoppe, but as an Apostle for the conuersion of the Iewes, which not onely out of all Iurie, but out of all partes of the world, came thither ordinarily to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe. Of S. Peters sitting at Antioch as Bishoppe, we finde nothing in the Scriptures, and lesse of his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to Rome. But we finde that when Peter came to Antioche, Paule withstoode him to his face, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him openly, which he might not well haue done, if Peter had bene supreame heade of the church, &amp; in his owne see as M. Sander doth fantasie.</p>
               <p>Where he alleageth the text &amp; <hi>Episcopatum eius acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piat alter,</hi> and let an other take his Bishoprike, to proue that Iudas and so the Apostles were Bishoppes, it is too childish &amp; fonde an argument, seeing the Greeke word, which S. Luke vseth &amp; the Hebrue word which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet vseth, signifieth generally a charge or office, and not suche a particular office of a Bishoppe, as nowe we speake of.</p>
               <p>He citeth farther Theodorete <hi>in</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ad Tim.</hi> to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the name of an Apostle in the primitiue church did signifie such a Bishoppe.

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2880:122"/>
proofe <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. Epaphroditus to be the Apostle of the Philippensians, because S. Paule sayth of him Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus your Apostle, and my helper: whereas he meaneth that he was their messenger, vsing the worde <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the generall signification for a messenger, and not for the name of suche an officer as an Apostle or Bishoppe. He nameth also Titus and Timotheus which in the Scripture, are neuer called Apostles, likewise the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Elders at Ierusalem, which were in deede the true Apostles of Christs immediat sending, and not Bishoppes ordeyned by men. And whereas Hierome sayeth, <hi>that all Bishoppes be successors of the Apostles,</hi> he meaneth manifestly in auctoritie, within their seuerall charges, and not that the Apostles were Bishops. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise where Augustine sayth, <hi>that the Bishoppes were made in steede of the Apostles,</hi> it rather proueth that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, were no Bishoppes, for then if the Apostles were Bishoppes, he should say, Bishoppes were made in steede of Bishoppes.</p>
               <p>The last reason is, that if the office of Bishoppes had not bene distinct in the Apostles, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Apostleship, that office woulde haue ceased with the Apostleshippe, for the whole being taken away no parte can remayne, except it had an other grounde to stande in, beside the Apostleshippe, as the Bishoppely power had. In deede if the Apostleshippe had ceased before Bishoppes had bene ordeyned, Bishoplike power woulde haue ceased with it: but seeing the Apostles ordeyned Bishops and Elders in euery congregation, to continue to the worlds ende, the Bishoppes office hath not ceased, though the office of the Apostles is expired. Wherefore seeing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Scripture, reason, nor Doctors, this distinction of offices in the Apostles, can be proued, when Peter is called heade, Prince, chiefe, first, Capteyne of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles by Cyrill, or any auncient writer, we must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande, as Ambrose teacheth a primacie of confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or fayth, not of honor or degree <hi>de incar. dom cap.</hi> 4.</p>

He thinketh it out of contronersie, that S. Peter was the first of the Apostles as S. Mathew sayth, <hi>primus,</hi> the first, Simon which is called Peter. And he is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that he was first in the order of numbring, but he will haue him first in dignitie, because he is alwayes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med first. But that is nether true, nor a good reason if it were true, because he is named first, therefore he is of greatest dignitie. But <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 9 Iames and Cephas &amp; Iohn are sayde to haue bene pillers of the Churche, and yet Paule equall with them. Although if we graunted grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test dignity to Peter, yet thereupon did not follow grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test authority. For these three Apostles last named, were of greatest dignity among the Apostles, yet not of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authoritie then the rest. And although the auncient fathers of the worde <hi>primus,</hi> haue deriued the name of <hi>primatus,</hi> or primacy, yet haue they also expressed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this primacie doth consist, namely not in authoritie but in order, nether doth those names Prince, chiefe, heade, toppe, guide, mouth, greatest of the Apostles, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by some of them, signifie his authoritie ouer them, but his dignitie amongest them.</p>

the apostleship, euery Apostle was equall with all his fellowes, &amp; so is euery Bishop Priest, King, Duke, Knight with euery one of his degree. If this be as he sayth, then was Peter chiefe, nether as Apostle nor Bishoppe. But there may be another thinge (sayth he) coincident to some degree of men, not necessary for the being, but for their well being. One therefore was set ouer the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, for vnities sake, and to auoyd schismes as Cyprian &amp; Hierom write in places before cited. This must nedes be a primacy of order and not of authoritie, for amonge men of equall authoritie, as he confesseth the Apostles were, one may be chosen as the President or Primate, to auoyd confusion, the austeritie remayning equall to euery one, but one can not be preferred in authoritie to remayne still equall with his fellowes in auctoritie.</p>

Ep.</hi> 82. are cited to proue that the same primacie which Peter some time (but yet not alwaies) had among the Apostles, should be reteyned in succession of his chayre to mayntayne vnitie amonge all men, it hath no ground in the holy Scriptures, and yet those good men were farre from imagining suche an absolute power of Peters successor, as M. Sander defendeth in the Pope, although some times he doe handle it so nicely, as it might seeme to be a thing of nothing, wherein the Pope is aboue his fellow Bishops, where I sayd, that Peter had not alwayes the primacie of order among the Apostles, it is proued, both by the 15. of the Actes, where Iames was President of the councell, &amp; Gal. 2. not onely where Iames is named before Peter, but also where Peter ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayned and separated him selfe, after certayne came from Iames, fearing them of the circumcifion, left he should haue bene euill thought of, as he was before for keeping company with Cornelius. and in diuerse other places of the Actes of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>But M. Sander will adde another truth, to the former doctrine of Peters primacie, namely that seeing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles needed no heade, because they were not in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:2880:123"/>
of error, the head was appoynted ouer them for an example of the Church afterward, when that personall priuiledge of the Apostles ceased to be in their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. But how wil he proue that the priuiledge of not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, hath continued in Peters successors, more then in the successors of all the Apostles. Forsooth because Christ prayed that Peters faith might not fayle, that he might confirme his brethren. I haue often shewed that he prayed for the perseuerance of all his Apostles, and the cause of his speciall prayer for Peter, was proper to Peters person, therefore can not be drawne to his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors. And what madnes is it, to defend that the Pope can not erre? when Pope Honorius was condemned for an heretike both by the 6. Councell of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, and by the decree of Leo 2. Bishop of Rome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the same councell. <hi>Act.</hi> 18. <hi>Ep. Leon.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Constant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But M. Sander concludeth, to aunswer the argument of the equalitie of the Apostles, that Paule was equall with Peter in Apostleship: but by the appoyntment and will of Christ, Peter was heade, to shew that his Church hauing one Pastor in it aboue the rest, is one, as a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom one, by hauing one king in it. Howbeit we sinde the will of God for the supremacie and headship of Christ, ouer all his Church, to make it one, in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when of Peters headship or supremacie there is neuer a word And Paule sayth, that he was nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the highest Apostles, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. if nothing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, then was not Peter his superiour in any respect.</p>
               <p>That Paule reprehended Peter, M. Sander sayth, he might doe it by equalitie of his Apostleship. If that be so, why may not euery Bishop reprehende the Pope by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of Bishoprike. If you graunt they may, then haue you so many Canones against you, as you can neuer saue their authoritie and abide by your confession. But this fault you say, with Tertullian, was of conuersation, not of preaching, that Peter might not seeme to haue erred in doctrine.

               <p>Hereupon he taketh occasion to inueye against the pride of Luther, Zwinglius, Caluine &amp;c. and their bitter dissentions, shewing how farre they are vnlike to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. It is not to be doubted, that they were many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees inferior to the vertue and holmes of the Apostles, but yet as well in humilitie as all other vertues, if they come not nearer to them, then the Pope, and his pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Clergye, let God and all indifferent men bee Iudges.</p>
               <p>Moreouer where as it is obiected against the supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of Peter, that the Apostles sent him to lay hands vpon those whom Philip the Deacon had baptized: he aunswereth, that proueth no more their equalitie, then when the Canones of a Cathedrall Church doe chose their Deane or Bishop, to go about busines of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it proueth the Deane and Bishop to be inferior to the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But by his fauor, where the Deane or Bishop are sent about busines, it argueth the Bishop and Deane in respect of those busines, to be inferior to the whole chapiter, as Peter &amp; Iohn were to the whole Colledge of the Apostles, though the Bishop or Deane in other respects, be superior to the Canons, and Peter and Iohn were equall to euery one of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>Wherefore M. Sanders conclusion is vpon a false sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that Peter had authoritie to depose the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, if they had fallen as Iudas did, therefore the Pope hath the like ouer Bishops. For nether had Peter any

               <p>M. Sander fantasying that he hath proued Peter su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> to the Apostles, not in their Apostleship, but in his Byshoply degree, doth yet againe distinguish the order and office of a Byshop from the authoritie and iurisdiction of the same. And in order and office he confesseth that all Byshopps of the worlde, are equall as Hierome sayeth, <hi>ad Euagrium,</hi> and Cyprian <hi>De v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate eccles<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> but not in authoritie. But seeing he rehearseth the testimonie of Hierome imperfectly, I will set it downe at large, that you may see whether it will beare his distinction. <q>He writeth against a custome of the Church of Rome, by which the Deacons were preferred abooue the Priestes, whome hee proueth by the Scripture to be equall with Byshoppes, excepte onely in ordaining. <hi>Quid enim facit exempta ordinatione Episcopus &amp;c.</hi> For what doth a Bishop excepting ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which a Priest or Elder doth not? Neither is it to be thought, that there is one church of the city of Rome and an other of the whole worlde. Both Fraunce, and Britayn, &amp; Africa, and Persia, and the East, and India, &amp; all barbarous nations, worship one Christ, obserue one rule of truth. If auctoritie be sought, the world is greater then a citie. Wheresoeuer a Bishop be either at Rome, or at Eugubium, or at Constantinople, or at Rhegium, or at Alexandria, or at Tunis, he is of the same worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; of the same Priesthoode. Power of riches &amp; base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of pouerty make not the Bishop higher or inferior.</q>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:2880:125"/>
But they are all successors of the Apostles. And lest you should thinke he speaketh onely of equalitie in order &amp; office, &amp; not in authority. He doth in an other place shew that the authoritie of euery Priest is equall with euery Bishop by Gods disposition, &amp; that the excelling of one Bishop aboue other Priests, came only by custom. <q>
                     <hi>In Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sieut ergo presbyteri sciunt se ex Ecclesiae consue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine, ei qui sibi praepositus fuerit, esse subiectos: it a Episcopi nouerint, se magis consuctudine, quam dispositionis Dominicae veritate, presbyteris esse maieres.</hi> Therefore as Priestes do know, that by custom of the Church, they are subiect to him that is set ouer them: so let Bishops know, that they are greater then Priests, rather by custom then by truth of the Lordes appoyntment. If the authoritie then &amp; iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of Bishops dependeth vpon custo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not vpon gods appointment, Peter was not by our lords appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t preferred in bishoplik authority before the rest of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles, nor the Bishop of Rome, before other Bishops &amp; Priestes, but only by custom. as Hierom saith.</q> S. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans wordes also inferre the same. <q>
                     <hi>Episcopatus vnus est, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius à singulis in solidum pars tenetur.</hi> The Bishops office is one, whereof euery man doth partake the Bishops office wholy. Now if authoritie &amp; iurisdiction doe pertayne to the Bishops office, euery Bishop hath it wholy, as (to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low M. Sanders example) whatsoeuer is incident to the nature or kind of a man, is equally in euery man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But now the greatest matter resteth, to proue how S. Peter had more committed to his charge then the rest of the Apostles, and that he taketh on him to proue, by this reason. Peter loued Christ more then all the rest of the Apostles, therefore he gaue him greater authoritie in feeding his sheepe, then to the rest, But I deny the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. For Peter loued Christ more then the rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ had forgiuen him greater sin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, then to the rest, <hi>Luc.</hi> 7. 47. In consideration whereof, he required greater diligence in doing his office, but gaue him not a greater charge or authoritie.</p>
               <p>Now where M. Sander reasoneth, that Peter loued
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2880:126"/>
Christ most, because Christ first loued him most, and Christ loued him most, because he would make him go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of his Church, it is a shamefull petition or beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of that which is in question. For the nearest cause of Peters greater loue, was the greater mercy which he founde, which mercy proceeding from the loue of God as the first &amp; infinite cause, can haue no higher, superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, or former cause. But Peter in respect of greater loue shewed to him, in that greater sinne was forgiuen him, was bound to shewe greater loue toward Christ, which he required to be shewed in feeding his sheepe, yet this proueth not, that greater authoritie was giuen him, or that he did feede more then all men. For S. Paule sayth truly of him selfe, I haue labored more then they all, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. wherby it appeareth, that Peter as a man, was not equall with Christ in the effect of excellent loue, which was in him in comparable. And whereas M. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der talketh so much of his commission of feeding, I say these words <hi>feede my sheepe &amp;c.</hi> be not wordes of a newe commission, but words of exhortation, that he shew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding diligence in the commission equally deliuered to all the Apostles: As my father hath sent me, so I send you. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 20 21.</p>
               <p>But the auncient fathers expound it so, that it might seeme to be a singular commission to Peter. It can not be denyed but diuers of the auncient fathers, otherwise godly and learned, were deceyued in opinion of Peters prerogatiue, which appeareth not in the Scriptures, but was chalenged by the Bishops of Rome, which seemed to haue a shew of some benefit of vnitye to the Church, so long as the Empire co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued at Rome, &amp; the Bishops of that <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ie retayned the substance of Catholike religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet did they neuer imagine, that such blasphemous &amp; tyrannicall authoritie, yea such false &amp; hereticall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as afterward was mayntayned vnder the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that prerogatiue, shoulde or ought to haue bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thereby. But let vs see what M. Sander can saye, out of the aun<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:2880:126"/>
writeth: <hi>Dominus &amp;c. Our Lord hath commended vnitie in Peter him selfe. There were many Apostles, and it is sayde to one, feede my sheepe. God forbid there should now lacke good pastors, but all good pastors are in one, they are one.</hi> This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing for Peters authority ouer the rest, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the author supposeth the vnitie of all Pastors to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorically signified, in that Christ speaketh that to one, which is common to all good sheepeheardes, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feede his sheepe. And againe <hi>de sanct hom.</hi> 24 <hi>In vno Petro &amp;c. The vnitie of all pastors was figured in one Peter.</hi> So might it wel be without giuing Peter authoritie ouer all Pastors. Chrysostom is the next: <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de sacerdotio.</hi> who sayth that Christ did aske whether Peter loued him, not to teache vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter loued him, but to enforme <hi>vs quanti sibi curae sit gregis huius praefectura.</hi> howe great care he taketh of the gouernment of this flock. Here he would haue vs marke, that Chrysostom calleth it a rule &amp; gouernment of the flock, which Christ intendeth. Yea sir, we see it very wel, but you would make vs blind, if we could not see, that Chrysostom speaketh not of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rule, graunted to Peter only, but of the gouernment of euery Churche by euery Pastor. And therefore you daunce naked in a net, when you alledge the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing absolutely, as though they pertayned to Peter onely. <hi>Petrum Christus auctoritate praeditum esse voluit, &amp;c.</hi> whereas Chrysostom speaking to euery Priest, &amp; shewing how careful he ought to be in his office, in respect of his high calling &amp; the excellent dignitie thereof, sayth: <q>
                     <hi>Eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ne nune nobisium contendes fraudemistam tibi non bene ac foeliciter cessisse, quiper eam vniuersis Dei optimi maximi bonis administrandis sis praeficiendus, quu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>praesertim ea agas, quecu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Petrus ageret, illu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christus auctoritate preditu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> esse vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit, ac reliquos item Apostolos longe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praecellere.</hi> Wilt thou then stil contend with vs, that this fraude hath not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened well &amp; luckely to thee, which by it, art to be made ouerseer of all the goods of God almightye, especially when thou doest those thinges, which when Peter did, Christ would haue him to be endued with authoritie, &amp;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:2880:127"/>
also farre to excel the other Apostles.</q> Here M. Sander wil haue vs note 3. things, 1, Peters authoritie, 2. passing the Apostles, 3. farre passing. We marke them all, that they are directly ouerthrowing M. Sanders rocke of the popish Churche. For they declare, that Peter in doing those things, was endued with authoritie, &amp; farre passed the other Apostles, euen as euery Priest (to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom speaketh) when he doth the same thinges, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the same authoritie, &amp; farre passeth all other men. So that here is none other authority, nor excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Peter then such as is common to all ministers in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting their charge, and was common to all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles when they did the same things that Peter did. For Chrysostom proueth to Basil, that he did him no hurt, when by pollicie he caused him to be called to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery against his will, seeing that thereby he was made partaker of the reward of the faithfull &amp; wise seruaunt, and equall in authoritie with Peter, if of loue towardes Christ he would diligently feede his flocke. So that Leo had no iust cause to saye that in respect of any greater authoritie, <hi>Peter had a speciall care of feeding the sheepe committed to him.</hi> but rather in respect that he had grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cause to loue Christ, which had so mercifully forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him so shamefull a fall.</p>
               <p>But Arnobius is a lesse partiall witnes then Leo a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome, &amp; he vpon the Psal. 138. writeth thus. <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Apostolorum nomen &amp;c. None of the Apostles receiued the name of a Pastor. For our Lord Iesus Christ alone saide. I am the good pastor, &amp; againe my sheepe follow me. Therefore this holy name, &amp; the power of this name, after his resurrection he graunted to Peter repenting. And he that was thryse denyed, gaue to his denyer, that power which he had alone.</hi> Arnobius (saith he) noteth none of the Apostles euer to haue had the name of a pastor giuen to him by Christ, beside S. Peter alone. But I demaund of M. S. where he hath in Arnobius this word euer? For he sayth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter had this name after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> resurrection w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> none of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

to such as repented after baptisme, prouing by exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Peter, that they are to be receyued, seeing Christ gaue him greater dignitie after his repentance, then he had before his fal. But that Peter had greater authoritie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest of the Apostles he neuer thought or sayde. M. Sander cutteth of both the head and the tayle. In this discourse lest the meaning of Arnobius might appeare, for thus he writeth: <hi>Dicis cert<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Which that I may teach, this I shew, that none of the Apostles receyued the name of a sheepeheard, &amp;c. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the ende following the wordes before cited by M.

This speaketh Arno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius of the general authoritie which Peter had ouer all the Church, as euery Apostle had likewise, &amp; was a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and ouerseer of Bishops as well as Peter, and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor of the vniuersal Church, which thing Arnobius ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did deny. These therfore be M. Sanders arguments, none of the Apostles had the name of a Pastor before Christes resurrection, <hi>ergo</hi> they neuer had it. Peter was called to greater dignitie after his fall then he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>ergo</hi> he was greater then his fellow Apostles.

               <p>So Peter is heereby declared to haue the greateste loue, but not to haue the greatest authoritie. M. Sander vrgeth that he is the Vicar of Christes loue and pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall office. The one indeede Ambrose sayth, the other Sander sayeth but is not able to proue: no not by that which followeth in the same place of Ambrose, that <hi>Peter had committed to him to feede, not onely the Lambes with milke, as at the first, nor yet the little sheepe, as at the seconde time, but the sheepe, to the end that he beeing more perfect, might gouerne the more perfecte.</hi> For euery one of the Apostles hadde the same charge to feede the sheepe of Christe, and not the Lambes or little sheepe onely. Neither doth the woorde of gouernment helpe him. For euery Apostle had the like gouernment ouer the whole flock w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> Peter hath, and there is an ordinary gouernment in euery particular church, 1. Co. 12. w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not the gouernors to be rulers one ouer another, wherefore this collection is not only vaine, but also ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculus, that Peter should haue authoritie to gouerne Patriarches, Archbishops and Bishops aswell as Parishe priests, because he must feed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sheep of Christ, I wil not here stand to discus how properly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of lambs litle sheep &amp; sheep, is obserued by Ambrose, but taking it according as he distinguisheth it, yet heere is nothing giuen to Peter but primacie of loue, or as else where he

This conclusion M. S. (as his manner is) hath left out, by which it is apparant, that Ambrose inferreth no singularitie of authoritie in Peter, as more perfet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest of the Apostles, but as perfect in such degre, as the rest of the Apostles which were likewise prepared to martyrdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were equal w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him therin.</q> The testimony of Bernard a late w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That Cyprian ad Quintum sayth: <hi>Neque quisquam &amp;c Neither doeth any of vs make him selse a Byshoppe of By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi> He aunsweareth that although no man may make himselfe, yet Christe may make a man Bishop of By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopes, but where findeth he that Christe maketh the Pope a Byshop of Byshoppes? Howe Peter might bee called a Byshop of Byshoppes, I haue shewed before But the Councell of Carth. 3.

                  </gap>ster Sander confessing and truely, that the Apostles tooke the Keyes belonging to their Apostolike office immediatly of Christe, saith they receiued the Keyes of their Byshoplike office of Peter. But what lock was there, that they could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and shut by their Aopstolike Key? When Christe sayth, Whatsoeuer you binde or loose, &amp; whose sinnes soeuer you forgiue or retayne, which was the power of their Apostolike Keyes? If the Apostolike Keyes were so sufficient, what neede they any Byshoplike Keyes? Into these absurdities both he &amp; Optatus doe followe, whiles the one will vrge a prerogatiue of Peter, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will forge a Byshoplike office in the Apostles, whereof the Scripture giueth vs no instruction.</p>
               <p>As for Leo and Gregorye Byshoppes of Rome, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were not come to the full pryde of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, yet the mysterie of iniquitie hauing wrought in that seate, neere fiue or sixe hundreth yeeres before them, and then greatly increased, they were so decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the longe continuaunce of error, that they thought the dignitie of Peter was much more ouer the reste of his fellowe Apostles, then the holy Scriptures

               </p>
               <p>THat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of Apostles, which had general charge to preach ouer the whole world, is ceased with the <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> Apostles liues, it is in deede graunted of vs: but that theyre Apostolike authoritie was extraordinary, or that all their authoritie is so determined, that it hath no successors in it, wee doe vtterly deny. For the same authoritie of preaching, of ministring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of binding and loosing, which the Apostles had is perpetuall in the Church, in the Byshops and elders, which are all successors of the Apostles. And if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike authoritie, hath no successors in it, what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Pope almoste in euery Bul and decretall Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, to brag so much of the Apostolike authoritie, &amp; to ground all things <hi>Apostolica Authoritate</hi> by the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like authoritie. By which it is euident, that M. Sand. new distinction of Apostolike and Byshoplike authoritie in the Apostles, is not acknowledged by the Popes them selues, but inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted lately by such as he is, to haue a star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hole, to seeme to auoid such arguments and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, as proue all the Apostles equall in authoritie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:2880:130"/>
But let vs vs see what reasons he hath to proue, that S. Peters Pastorall authoritie was ordinary, and muste goe to his successors, more then the Pastoral authoritie of euery Apostle. First S. Peter being but one man was not able to preach to all men at once, nor to gouerne nations newely conuerted, the refore hee had twelue companions adioyned to him.</p>
               <p>But the worlde beeing conuerted, it is easy for the Pope without such fellowes, to gouerne all the faythful, by helpe of many inferiour officers. As thoughe the Church had not inferior officers in the Apostles time. If S. Peter then was not able to rule, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> had such greate giftes muchlesse the Pope, which is nothing compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with him in gifts, &amp; is often a wicked man &amp; an here tike is able to gouerne all the Church, for he hath not so great an helpe of the conuersion of the worlde, as he hath a want of Peters gracious giftes, meete for such a gouernment.</p>
               <p>Secondly he would haue vs mark, the peculiar names of a Rock, of a pastor, &amp; of a confirmer of his brethren, which are giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Christ to S. Peter alone, which argue that Peters supremacy must necessarily continue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. But who will graunt to M. S. that Christe gaue these peculier names to Peter alone, indeed that which is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the names is ordinary and perpetual in the Church. Peter was a Rock, not his person, but his doctrine that remaineth stil in the Church, he was a shephearde and confirmer of his brethren, and there bee nowe many shepheards and confirmers of their brethren.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he sayth the Church neuer wanted a visible rock on the earth, beside the eternall Rock Christ: who in this life might bee so strongly fastened in the Faith of Christe the great Rocke, that he (though not for his owne sake, yet for the Churches sake) might be able to stay vppe all other small stones, which ioyned vnto him, vntill Christ came in the fleshe, who likewise ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted Saincte Peter and his successors to be this ordinary rock, as Adam Enos Henoch, Noe, Abraham,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:2880:130"/>
Isaac, Iacob, Moyses, Aaron and his successors, who sate in the chaire of Moyses vntill the comming of Christ. Against this I say, that the church militant on earth, hath her foundation in heauen, and not on earth, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the churche hath not a visible rocke in earth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it is not true, that some one, hath alwayes bene this visible rocke on earth. For who was greater Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham or Melchisedech? out of all controuersie Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech, then was not Abraham the onely rocke. After the death of Iacob and the twelue Patriarkes, who was the visible rocke vntill Moyses was called. And yet had God a church among the Iewes all that time.</p>
               <p>Thirdly who is so impudent to say, that all the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of Aaron were so strongly fastened in the faith, that they were able to stay all the small stones that leaned vpon them. Was not Vrias the high Priest an idolater? 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>What were Iason, Menclaus, Lysimachus by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte of the booke of Machabes? Was not Caiphas &amp; Annas Sadducees by the testimonie of S. Luke <hi>Act.</hi> 5. and of Iosephus? Where is then the visible rocke, whose faith neuer failed &amp;c? we see there was none suche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ, therefore there neede to be none suche af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.</p>
               <p>His fourth reason is, of the name of a pastor, which si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth an ordinarie office, for as the sheepe continue after S. Peters death, so must there be also a shepheard, as Peter was. But how proueth he that Peter was an on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shepheard? forsooth Chrysostom sayth <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotio. Christus sanguinem &amp;c. Christ hath shedde his bloode to purchase those sheepe, the care of whom he did commit both to Peter &amp; to Peters successors.</hi> But whom doth Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom take for Peters successors? the Bishops of Rome only? No verily but all true pastors of the church as his wordes going before doe manifestly declare: <hi>Neque e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim tum volebat testatum esse quantum à Petro amaretur, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidem id multis nobis argument is constabat.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Verum hoc ille sum agebat, vt &amp; Petrum &amp; caeteros nos edoceres, quanta</hi>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:2880:131"/>
                     <hi>beneuolentia ac charitate ergasuam ipse ecclesiam afficeretur, vt hac ratione &amp; nos quoque eiusdem ecclesiae studium cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramque toto animo susciperemus.</hi> For his purpose was not then to testifie vnto vs, howe muche he was beloued of Peter for that was euident vnto vs by many arguments. But this thing then he intended, that he might teache both Peter and all vs, what beneuolence and loue he beareth towarde his church that by this reason we also might take vpon vs with all our hart, the loue &amp; charge of the same church.</q> This sentence sheweth that Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome accounted him selfe &amp; euery true pastor of the church a successor of Peter and not the Bishop of Rome alone.</p>
               <p>As for Leo a Bishop of Rome I haue often protested that he was more addicted to the dignitie of his see, then the Scripture would beare him, and therefore was ouerruled and resisted, in the generall councel of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon.</p>
               <p>His fift argument is a rule of lawe, where the same reason is, the same right ought to be. The reason of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters confession and power is such as agreeth to any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary office, of the church, therefore the office of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being a rock, of strengthening his brethren and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Christes sheepe, is an ordinarie office. But I say, that Peters confession made him not a rock, but decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him so to be, being appoynted of Christ for one of the twelue foundations of the churche, the office of strengthening and feeding as it was not singular in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so it is not ordinarie that it should be singular in any man.</p>
               <p>His sixt reason, Irenaeus, Optatus, and Augustine did recken vp such successors of Peter, as had liued till eu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of their ages or times. Therefore Peter had succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors in his pastorall office. It is not denyed, but he had them, and other Bishoppes also successors in his pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall office, at least the Bishoppes of Antioche, whereby your owne cofession he was Bishoppe, before he came to Rome. Therefore his succession was not singular to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2880:131"/>
the Bishoppes of one see.</p>
               <p>His seuenth reason, no man may preache to them to whom he is not sent, therefore there must be a generall pastor to sende other to preache, to them that are not conuerted, to plant newe Bishoprikes, to controll them that are negligent, to supplie the thinges that lacke: to excommunicate such as liue in no diocesse &amp;c. For sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he quoteth <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. where mention is onely of the sending of God, and of the sending by men. But all his questions and doubtes, may be aunswered. Either the whole church in generall councells, or euerie particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar church in their synodes, as they shall see most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, may sende preachers as the Apostles and Elders sent Peter and Iohn into Samaria &amp; order all such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as he imagineth must be done onely by the Pope. But he asketh who shall summon all other Bishoppes to generall or prouinciall councells. And I aske him, who summoned, the foure great &amp; principall generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells? and so many prouinciall councels, but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Princes in whose dominion they were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? So that here is no necessary affaires of the church that doth require one generall pastor or Pope of Rome when all thinges may and haue bene done best of all without him.</p>
               <p>As for placing of Bishoppes, in sees vacant, vniting of two Bishoprikes in one, or diuiding one into two, may better be done by the auctoritie of those churches, with consent of their Princes, who seeth and knoweth what is needefull in those cases, then by one which sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge in his chaire at Rome, requireth halfe a yeares trauell, from some parte of the worlde, to him, before he can be aduertised of the case, and yet must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande it by heare saye, and therefore not able to see what is expedient, so well as they that are present, and see the state of the matter. Finally it is against all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhoode, that Christ woulde make suche a generall sheepehearde ouer all his flocke, as many thousande sheepe, which liue vnder the Sophi, the Cham, the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:2880:132"/>
Turke, can haue none accesse vnto, for suche thinges as are supposed necessarie to be had and to be obteyned from him onely. Wherefore if the Pope were heade of the churche, suche as by crueltie of tyrauntes are cut from him shoulde be cut from the bodie of the church. Yea if Hethenish tyrauntes coulde so much preuayle, as they do in hindring this gouernment of the Pope, (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be so n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

For there are greater arguments to proue the primacie of Iames. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne the greatest shewe of Peters primacy, that we reade of in the Scriptures, is the primacie or heade A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postleshippe of the circumcision. So that if one Bishoppe should succeede him, in that primacie, he must be chiefe Bishoppe ouer the Iewes, and not ouer the Gentiles. For the chiefe Apostleshippe ouer the Gentiles, was by God committed to Paule. <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 7. &amp; 8. But if M. Sander say, as he doth in an other place, that the Pope succeedeth both these Apostles, and therefore hath both their auctoritie. First he ouerthroweth his owne rocke of the church, which he will haue to be Peter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Secondlie his argument of vnitie, which he vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in this chapter he subuerteth, if the Popes aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie be deriued from two heades. Thirdly he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth his owne distinction of Bishoplike and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like auctoritie, if the Apostolike auctority of Paul should

               <p>Nowe let vs consider what weighty reasons he hath, to proue the title of this chapter. S.

               <p>But S.

This proueth, that the auctoritie came first from Christ, but not that it was geuen first to Peter.</q> And if we should vnderstand it so, that it was first geuen to Peter, yet he meaneth not, that it was geuen to reside in his person, but that in him as the attorney of the rest, it was geuen to them also, as he saith, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. <q>
                     <hi>Petrus tamen super quem aedificata ab eodem Domino fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat ecclesia, vnus pro omnibus loquens &amp; Ecclesiae voce respondens, ait Domine ad quem ibimus &amp;c.</hi> Yet Peter vpon whome the churche had beene builded, by the same our Lorde, as one speaking for all, and aunswering in the voyce of the church sayeth: Lorde whether shall we goe &amp;c. as he spake for all, so he receaued for all.</q> Which thing if it had bene so (as we sinde not in the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:2880:133"/>
Scripture) yet could it haue beene no ordinary matter, to discend to one by succession. For the power beeing once receiued by one in the name of the reste, and by him deliuered to the rest, it should be continued in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of euery one that hath receiued it, and not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day to be fetched a new from a seuerall heade. For that beginning came from vnitie, which Cyprian spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, when Peter beeing one, was the voice &amp; mouth of the rest, and so receiued power for the rest, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once receiued, the church holdeth of Christe, and not of Peter or his successors, no more then a corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion holdeth of him, that was their atturney, to receiue either lands or authoritie from the Prince, but holdeth immediatly of the Prince. Wherfore this argument fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, although the authoritie had begon in one, that it should continue in one.</p>
               <p>The second reason is, that the most perfect gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is meete for the Church, but most perfection is in vnitie, therefore there ought to be one chiefe gouernor of all. This one chiefe gouernour is our Sauiour Christ, ruler both in heauen &amp; in earth. Who ascending into heauen, did not appoynt one Pope ouer all his church, but Apostles, Euangelistes, Prophets, Pastors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that we might all meete in the vnitie of faith, and grow into a perfect man. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. &amp; 12.</p>
               <p>The third reason is, that the state of the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, must be more perfect then the law, but in the law, there was one high pastor, the high Priest on earth, therefore there must be one now also and much rather. I aunswere we haue him in deede, our chiefe Bishop &amp; high Priest, of whome the Aaronicall Priest, was but a shadow, namely Iesus Christ, whose gouernment is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse perfect and beneficiall to his church in that he sitteth in heauen, and hath as before is cited lefte an ordinarie ministerie on earth in many Pastors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ouer euerie seuerall congregation and not in one Pope ouer al, which could not possibly either know, or attend to decide, the one thousande parte of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:2880:133"/>
which are determined by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auctoritie of Christs law, and such ministers as he hath ordeyned.</p>
               <p>The fourth reason is of auctority. Cyprian <hi>ad Iubaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num: Ecclesia quae vna est &amp;c. The church which is one was founded by our Lordes voyce vpon one, which receaued the keyes thereof.</hi> And againe, <hi>de simplicitat. praelat. Quamsis &amp;c. Although Christ after his resurrection geueth equall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to all his Apostles and sayth: as my father sent me so do I send you: receaue the holy Ghost. If you remit to any man his sinnes they shal be remitted. And if you r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>teine them, they shal be reteined, yet that he might shew the vnitie, he disposed by his auctoritie, the originall of that vnitie, beginning of one.</hi> 
                  <q>But Cyprian proceedeth: <hi>Hoc erant &amp;c. Vere by the rest of the Apostles were the same thing that Peter was, endued with equall fellowshippe both of honor and of power, but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning proceedeth from vnitie, that the church might be shewed to be one.</hi> These wordes are playne to declare, that Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian acknowledgeth no inequalitie of the Apostles, in respect of any auctoritie they had.</q> Also that the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the church vpon one, and the receauing of the keyes of one, was not an ordinarie office to discende, by succession, but a singular priuiledge, for that one tyme to shewe the beginning, and not the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce of the power to proceede from one, but to be helde alwayes of one, which is Iesus Christ, without any shadowes of one Bishoppe on earth to signifie the same, when Christ is reuealed with open face vnto vs nowe sitting in heauen. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>

                     </gap>na &amp;c. That in one chaire in which Peter sate, vnity might be kept of all men, least the rest of the Apostles shoulde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one challenge a chaire to him selfe: so that he shoulde nowe be a schismatike and a sinner, that agaynst a singular chaire, should place an other. Therfore in that one chaire which is chiefe in giftes, Peter sate first.</hi> His meaning is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende the vnitie of the churche against the Donatistes, but of the auctoritie of Peters chaire ouer all other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes chaires, if he had spoken any thing M. Sander

would not haue concealed it, which doth vs great wrong to thinke that we can not distinguishe a chaire of vnitie, from a chaire of auctoritie.</p>
               <p>The place of Hierom <hi>cont. Iouin. lib.</hi> 1. hath bene aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered once or twise, shewing that among the Apostles which were equall, Peter was chosen to be primate, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide contention, which was a primacy of order and not of auctority. As for the collection of Lco Bishoppe of Rome, that Peters primacy was a platforme, for other Bishops to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that they must haue a Bishop ouer them, if the very Apostles had an head among them, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoreth of the ambition incident to that see, which was appoynted to be the seate of Antichrist. Although nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Leo him selfe, challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged so much as the Pope doth nowe, neither the Bishops of his time, would yeeld vnto him in so muche as he challenged. For beside the whole generall councel of Chalcedon, that concluded against him, about the priuiledges of the Bishop of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, wherein they made him equall with the Bishoppe of Rome, the title of seniority onely reserued, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by his Epistles, that many Bishops acknowledged not such primacy ouer them, as he claimed, whereof he complameth in diuerse of his Epistles.</p>

But he reasoneth a fortiori, that there ought to be much rather one Iudge ouer all the world. Howbeit I haue shewed the in consequence of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by example of one Phisitian, one Schoolemaister, one Iudge in temporall matters ouer the whole worlde, to whom it is as impossible to discharge suche an office ouer all, as it is profitable for one suche to be in euerie towne. He sayth that particular flockes, are voluntarie, and likewise particular pastors, but one flocke and one pastor, is of absolute necessitie on earth. In deede the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites of particular flockes, and the persons of particular
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:2880:134"/>
pastors, are left to the appoyntment and choise of the church. But that there should be particular flockes and pastors, it is of Gods ordination, though God by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles appoynted it to be so, yet is it of as absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, while the church is dispersed in diuerse places of the world, as that there is one flocke and one shepheard ouer all Iesus Christ, and yet he is not ashamed to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge vs pag. 298. <hi>Let the text be named where.

Are all thinges that were spoken to him singular vnto him? Christ sayd to him and to none other of the Apostles, come after me Satan, thou art an offense to me, for thou sauerest not the thinges that are of God but of men. Christ sayed to Peter and to none other, put vp thy sworde into thy scaberd, Christ sayed to Peter and to none other, thou wilt denye me thrise.

An other altar or a new Priesthoode can not be appointed beside one altar and one Priesthoode. Whosoeuer gathereth else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where scattereth abroad &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But if the worde were <hi>petrum</hi> and not <hi>petram,</hi> yet the whole discourse of that Epistle sheweth, that Cyptian meaneth by these wordes to set forth not the past orall preheminence of one man ouer the whole church, but one Bishop in euery diocese. For he writeth against fiue Elders or Priestes, which had chosen one Felicissimus a schismatike, to be Bishop in Carthage against him.</p>
               <p>But what other malicious ignorance, or shameles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence is this, that he peruerteth the saying of Christ of him selfe, to the Pope? <hi>There shall be one sheepefold &amp; one shepheard. Ioan.</hi> 10 Yet see his reason. <hi>A flocke of shepe is one by force of one pastor, therefore if the Pastor on earth be not one, the flocke is not one on earth.</hi> If this argument be good, howe is the flocke one vpon earth, when there is no Pope? For the see hath bene voyde diuerse times, many dayes, many monethes, &amp; somtime many yeares. Howe was the flocke one, when there were two or three Popes at once and that so often, and so long together? Therefore the flocke on earth is one by that one onely shepheard Iesus Christ, whose diuine voice all the shepe heare, though in his humanity, he be ascended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and not by any one mortal man, to whom they can not be gathered, nether being so farre abroad dispersed, can heare his voyce.</p>
               <p>And the whole order of the church on earth, tendeth to an vnitie in Christ, &amp; not in one man whatsoeuer, as one generall pastor. For if that one shoulde be an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike,

               <p>THe first reason is, that although Peter at the first <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> was rather high Bishoppe of the circumcision, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Gentiles, yet because he did at length settle him selfe at Rome by Gods appointment, and left a successor there, he sayeth he may well affirme, that the Bishop of Romes primacy is warranted by Gods word. A strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge kind of warantise, for to omit that the primacy ouer the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2880:136"/>
Gentils by Gods worde, is giuen to another, namely to Paule, from whom he can neuer proue, that it was taken afterward. Where hath he any worde of God to proue, that by his appointment, Peter setled him self at Rome, and appoynted there a successor? He quoteth Irenaeus <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. who reporteth that Linus the first Bishop of Rome was ordayned not by Peter onely, but by Peter &amp; Paule the Apostles, who founded the Church there, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as Polycarpus by the Apostles in Asia, was made bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in Smyrna, which Church with the Church of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus founded by Paule, and continued by Iohn the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, he citeth as witnesses alike, with the Church of Rome, of the tradition of the Apostles, against Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus and Marcion which being voyd of Scriptures, brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the tradition of the Apostles. But of Peters pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, or his successors ouer all Bishops, Irenaeus sayth not a word. No more doth Tertullian, whom likewise he quoteth, <hi>de praescrip.</hi> but euen as Ireneus would haue the tradition of the Apostles, against those heretikes that boasted of it, to be tryed by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that were founded by the Apostles.</p>
               <p>His second reason is, vpon a false supposition, that he hath already proued, Peter alone to be the rocke, to haue chiefe authoritie in feeding &amp;c. all which thinges are vntrue.</p>
               <p>That Peter came to Rome, he is not content that it be testified by all auncient Ecclesiasticall writers. But he sayth it is witnessed by the expresse word of God. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. <hi>The Church which is gathered together in Babylon saluteth you.</hi> Although the history of Peters comming to Rome, and sitting there 25. yeares, testified by so many writers, is proued false, in many circumstances, by the playne worde of God, yet I am content to admitte, that he came thither, towarde the later ende of Ne roes raigne. But that in his Epistle, he sent salutations from Rome, I can not admitte: seeing that in such manner of saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, men vse not to write allegorically, albeit, that in the reuelation of Saint Iohn Rome the sea of Antichrist
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2880:136"/>
is mystically called Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But Babylon from whence S. Peter did write, is more probably to be taken, for a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of that name in Egypt, where Marke was with him, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the consent of antiquitie affirmeth, to haue bene Bishop of Alexandria a citie of Egypt also, who coulde not haue bene with him at Rome. Seeing it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the first and seconde of the Epistle to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, and by diuerse of Saint Paules Epistles, that if euer Peter was at Rome, it was but a short tyme in the later ende of Nero his Empire. Whereas Marke dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the eyght yeare of his raigne, before Peter coulde be at Rome. For in the tenth yeare Paule was brought prisoner to Rome, Saint Luke accompanying him, who would not haue omitted to shewe, that Peter was there to haue mette him, as the rest of the brethren did, if he had then bene at Rome. Agayne Paule in so many Epistles as he writeth from Rome, sending salutations from meane personages, would not haue omitted men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peter, if he had bene there. Saint Luke then affirming that he taryed two yeares in prison at Rome, which must be vntil the twelfe yeare of Nero, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that if Peter came, he came very late to Rome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two yeare before his death, at which tyme it was not possible, that Marke which was dead foure yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, could be at Rome with him, wherefore Babylon in that text can not be taken for Rome.</p>
               <p>Another reason of the Popes supremacy he maketh, that Peter not onely came thither, but also dyed there. A simple reason, why the city of Rome should haue that prerogatiue, because she murthered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles. Rather might Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> clayme it, in which Christ the head of all dyed. After this he telleth the fable out of the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait Egesippus, of Simon Magus flying in the ayer, &amp; the Emperour Nero his great delight in his sorcerye. The credit of Egesippus he desendeth, by blaming his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slatour for adding names of cities, which had none such when Egesippus liued. But that Simon Magus shewed no experiment ofsorcerye before Nero, as this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfait
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:2880:137"/>
Egesippus reporteth it is plaine, by Plinius <hi>lib.</hi> 30. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>natur. Histor.</hi> who shewing how desirous Nero was, and what meanes he had to haue triall thereof, yet neuer could come by any. It was a practise of old time, to fayne such fables, for loue of the Apostles, as Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian witnesseth, <hi>de baptis.</hi> of a Priest of Asia, that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted &amp; confessed, that he fained for the loue of Paule, a writing vnto Tecla, in which many absurd things were contayned. Againe so many Apocriphall gospells, epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, itineraryes and passions, as are counterfaited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Apostles, and auncient fathers, who knoweth not to be fables and false inuentions. Amonge which this fable of Simon Magus and Peter is one. That S. Luke maketh no mention of Peters death, he preuenteth the objection, because he continued not his storye so farre: which doubt (sayth he) he woulde not haue omitted, if he had gone so farre fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ward in his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But seeing he brought Paule to Rome, both in his iorney, and in his history, why maketh he no mention of Peters being there? which if their story were true, must haue sit there twenty yeares before.

But if we consider the recordes of the very time in which Iulius lyued, we shall not finde that the dignitie of his Sea was such, as that he hadde such authoritie as Sozomenus aseribeth to him, and much lesse such as M. Sander imagineth of him.</p>
               <p>In Epiphanius there is an Epistle of one Marcellus, which beside that he called him his fellow minister, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth no such dignitie of his Sea lib. 3. to. 1.

Cap. 8. &amp; cap. 11. they were as bolde to depose him with the byshops of the West, as he was to check them, that they called not him to their councel. Wherein as I confesse, they did euell, yet thereby they shewed eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that the Christian worlde in those dayes, did not acknowledge the vsurpation of the bishop of Rome, as M. Sander saith they did. Neither durst they eaer to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:2880:141"/>
dissent from him, if it had beene a Catholike doctrine receiued in the Church, that the Byshopp of Rome is head of the Church, Byshop of all Byshops, Iudge of all causes, and one which cannot erre. As for Athanasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Paulus, &amp;c. and other Byshops beeing tossed to and fro, by their enemyes, no maruaile if they were glad to finde any comfort at the Byshop of Romes hands, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing first sought to the Emperors for refuge, of whome sometime they were holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sometime they wer hindred as informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was giuen either for them or against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>But Arnobius he sayeth giueth a maruailous witnes for the church of Rome in Psa. 106. <hi>Petrus in deserto. &amp;c Peter wandering in the desert of this worlde, vntill he came to Rome, preached the baptisme of Iesus Christ in whome all floods are blessed from Peter vnto this day. He hath made the going forth of the waters into thirst, so that he which shall goe forth of the Church of Peter shal perish for thirst.</hi> 
                  <q>It is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous witte of M. Sander, that can find such maruelous prerogatiue of Peter, in this place which Arnobius would haue in the example of Peter to be vnderstoode of all men. <hi>Quid est ascendunt?

Learne in Peter, to thend that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which thou shalt find in Peter, thou mayst see in all men. Peter went vp as high as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, when he sayd: Although I should dye with thee, yet will I not deny thee &amp;c. and so applying the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Psalme to Peter, and in him to all Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to that maruelous testimony of the church of Rome, which M. Sander reporteth, shewing how af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his repentance God exalted him to be a preacher of that baptisme of Iesus Christ in whome all floodes are blessed from Peter to this day.</q> Where M. Sander vseth a false translation, saying the floodes are blessed of Peter, and expoundeth the floodes to be the churches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Arnobius speaketh of all waters, which in Christ are sanctified to the vse of baptisme, from the Apostles time vntill this day. But it is a Catholike argument that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:2880:141"/>
goeth out of the Church of Peter, goeth out of the Church of Christe, therefore Rome is the mother Church and Peter the heade thereof. Euen lyke this, whosoeuer goeth out of the Church of Paule, or of any of the Apostles wheresoeuer they planted it, doth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish therefore Corinth and Paule, or any other Citie &amp; the Apostle that preached there, may be taken for the head and Pastor, and mother Church of all other, yet is this with M. Sander a meruailous testimony.</p>
               <p>Optatus succeeded Arnobius. Cont. Pamen de nat: lib. 2. <hi>Negare nonpotes. &amp;c.</hi> Thou canst not deny, but that thou knowest that to Peter first the bishops chaire was giuen in the citie of Rome, in which Peter the head of al the apostles hath sit: wherofhe was also called Cephas, in which chair vnitie might be kept of al men, so that he should be a scismatike w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> should place any other chaire against the singular chaire. Vnto Peter succeeded Linus, vnto Linus succeded Clemens, &amp; so nameth all the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops vntil Siricius which liued in his time, of whom he saith, <hi>Qui noster est socius,</hi> which is our fellow. In this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence Optatus laboreth to proue against the Donatists which were scismatikes, that ther is but one Catholike church fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they were departed. He vseth the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of vnitie commended in Peters chaire whom he calleth head of the Apostles in respecte of vnitie, &amp; not of authority, which appeareth by this that in the end he accounteth Syricius bishop of Rome and Peters succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, not head of all Churches nor vniuersall Bishop of al Bishops, but <hi>Socius noster,</hi> our fellowe or companion, as one consenting with him in the vnitie of that Church, which was first planted by the Apostles, and not as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall gouernor of the vniuersall Church of Christe. Wherefore although Optatus doe more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssary vrge this argument of the vnitie of Peters Chaire, yet his meanining was not to set foorth an vnrepr oua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble authoritie thereof, such as the Pope nowe challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, but onely to make it tbe beginning of vnitie.</p>

               <p>Heere sayeth Maister Sander wee haue a Chaire of healthfull doctrine, and that is afterwarde called the Chaire of vnitie, therefore it is not the Chayre of euery Byshop, which are many, and of which many haue beene Heretikes, but the only chayre of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

of Rome, <hi>in which Chaire the Pope be he neuer so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, is constrayned to say good thinges and cannot erre.</hi> But seeing I haue often proued that many Byshops sitting in that Chayre of Rome haue spoken euill thinges, and were fylthy Heretikes, it followeth, that this is not a wodden Chayre that Augustine speaketh of, but the Chayre of true doctrine, such as the Chayre of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses was, in which not onely Aaron and his successors, but euen the Scrybes and Pharisees did sit, hauing the authoritie of Moses, while they vttered nothing but that which God deliuered by Moses. But when they preached false doctrine they did not sit in the chaire of Moses, but in the chayre of pestilence, as the Pope &amp; all other heretikes doe.

               <p>But Sainct Augustine <hi>Contr epist fundament</hi> confesseth that the successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of priestes from Saint Peter vnto this present time stayed him in the Catholike Church.

Epist. 165. <q>Hee sayeth, <hi>Quamuis non tam de istis documentis presumanus quam de Scripturis sanctis.</hi> Although we presume not so much of these documents as of the holy spriptures. Wherefore as the argument of sucessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was wel vsed against heretikes, so long as there was succession of doctrine with succession of persons:</q> so now to alleadge the onely succession of persons where the doctrin is cleane changed, is as folish &amp; ridiculous,

               <p>The laste authoritie cited out of Augustine, is, Epistle 162. speaking of the Churche of Rome. <hi>In qua semper Apostolicae cathedrae viguit principatus.</hi> In which alwayes the principalitie of the Apostolike chaire hath flourished.

although it be expounded sufficiently by her Maiestie in her iniunction, not to be suche as he most slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously doth deforme it, yet I will here, as I haue done diuerse times before in aunswere to these Papistes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that we ascribe no supremacie to our Prince, but such as the worde of God alloweth in the godly Kinges of the old Testament, and the church hath acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Christian Emperours and Princes vnder the new Testament.</p>
               <p>First therefore we ascribe to our Prince no absolute power, in any Ecclesiasticall causes, suche as the Pope challengeth, but subiect vnto the rules of Gods worde. Secondly we ascribe no supremacie of knowledge in Ecclesiastical matters to our Prince, but affirme that she is to learne of the Bishops and teachers of the church, both in matters of faith and of the gouernment of the church. Thirdly we allow no confusion of callings, that the Prince should presume to preach, to minister the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, to excommunicate, &amp;c. which perteine not to her office. But the supremacie we admit in Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall causes, is auctoritie ouer all persons to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund, and by lawes to prouide, that all matters Ecclesiasticall, may be ordered and executed according to the word of God. And such is the true meaning of the othe, that he calleth blasphemous and intollerable. And as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of honor geuen to the Bishoppes by Christian Princes, which he bringeth forth, they deny not this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, nor make any thing against it.</p>
               <p>The first is of the Emperour Philippus, counted of some for the first Christian Emperor, although it be not like to be true, yet admitting the story written by Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius to be so. This Prince without due repentance, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him selfe to receaue the holy misteries, &amp; being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused by the Bishop of the place, tooke it pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him selfe to the discipline &amp; order of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church. I answer, this example toucheth not the auctority he had in ecclesiasticall causes. For in receauing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, the Prince differeth not from a priuate person.</p>

But he pusheth at M. Nowell with a two horned argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, called a dilemma. If the Priest in these causes, be superior to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Emperor, other causes be greater or lesser then these. If they be greater, the Emperour which is not supreame gouernor ouer the lesser causes, can not be in the greater, if they be lesser, then the Priest w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> gouerneth the Emperor, in greater causes, must nedes gouern him in lesser causes. These hornes are easily auoyded not by distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the causes, but of the gouernments. The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Prince is one, &amp; of the Priest an other: this spiritual, the other external, &amp; therefore no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety betwene them. For put the case, that Philippus had seene the Bishop prophane the sacrament, in ministring to infidels, or otherwise vncertainly behauing him selfe in his office, might he not iustly haue punished him, as supreame gouernour ouer the Bishoppe euen in those matters? I say not to doe them, but to see that they be well done, and to punishe the offendors. Neither is the meaning of the othe any other. And according to this meaning, M. Nowell, M. Horne and M. Iewel dare war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the King to be supreame gouernour in all Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall causes, although it please M. Sander to say, the contrarie of them. Whose trayterous quarelling vpon the wordes of the othe, ought not to trouble any mans co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, when the meaning is publikelie testified both by the Prince, and by the whole consent of the church.</p>
               <p>The next exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple is of Constantinus the great, which in the Synode of Nice, when the Bishops had offered vnto him bills of complaint, one against an other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disclosing the contentes of them, he sayd, as Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus reporteth <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Deus vos constituit sacerdotes &amp;c. God hath made you Priestes, and hath giuen you power to iudge of vs also, and therfore we are rigtly iudged of you, but ye can not be iudged of m<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e. For which cause, expect ye the iudgement of God alone among ye.</hi> Here M. Sander noteth, first, that he calleth them Priestes, whereby he woulde proue, they had power to offer externall sacrifice, which is a simple reason, for then all Christian men &amp; women
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2880:145"/>
within the Scripture are called Priestes, haue the same power. Secondly he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth, they haue power to iudge the Emperour, for none can be greater then a Priest: In their challenge and spirituall gouernment, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour meaneth, and not as the Popish church practised, to dispose the Emperour. Thirdly, that Priestes can not be iudged of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If this be so, one Priest can not be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of an other, and where is then the Popes suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, but he aunswereth, if one Priest iudge an other, it is Gods iudgement, and not the iudgement of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath set one Priest aboue another. O blockish aunswere: as though God hath not set one Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all his subiectes. You see howe Popish Priestes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce them selues, to the honor of God, and withdraw their obedience from Gods Lieutenaunts on earth. An vndoubted note of Antichristians. You will aske me then, what sence these wordes haue, you can not be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of men? I aunswere either they are ment, as Sainct Paule speaketh, of the vprightnes of his conscience in doing of his office, which is not subiect to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men, or else Ruffinus as he was a bolde repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, frameth the Emperours wordes, accord<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng to that estimation which he woulde haue men to haue of the clergie. For it is certeyne by recordes of Constantinus time, that he did iudge Bishoppes and tooke vpon him as supreame gouernour in ecclesiasticall causes, Maister Sander confesseth, he iudged certeyne Priests, or eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall causes, but he did it as Augustine sayeth, <hi>Epist.</hi> 162. <hi>as one that would afterward aske pardon of the holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> at the importunitie of the Donatists: And as Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus recordeth he sayd, <hi>Deschis. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Petitis à me &amp;c. Ye aske of me iudgement in the world, whereas I my selfe looke for Christes iudgement.</hi> And Augustine reproueth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natistes <hi>that they would haue an earthly King to be iudge of their cause.</hi> In deede the importunitie of the Donatistes was wicked who would so referre the matter to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without knowledge of ecclesiasticall persons, who were only meete iudges in respect of knowledge in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:2880:146"/>
that case, they would haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause decided. But the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour acknowledging his auctoririe appointed iudges ecclesiastical persons, first the Bishop of Rome Melchia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, whom he commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with other Bishops to heare the cause of Caecilianus, as Eusebius who <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>But to leaue this cause of the Donatistes Eusebius in his life <hi>libr.</hi> 1. sayeth of him: <hi>Quoniam nonnulli va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis locis inter se discrepabant, quasi communis quidem Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus à Deo constitutus, ministrorum Dei synodos conuocauit, ne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

He sheweth howe he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the vniuersall synode of Nice, as it were leading foorth the armie of God to battell. <q>To this Emperour did Athanasius the great, Bishoppe of Alexandria, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from the synode of Tyre, where he was iniurious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, as both Socrates testifieth <hi>lib.</hi> 1. and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Epistle of Constantine him selfe vnto that synode, commaunding all the Bishoppes to come vnto his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and there to shewe before him, <hi>(quem syncerum esse Dei ministrum neque vos sanè negabitis,</hi> whome you can not deny to be a syncere minister of God) how sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely they had iudged in that councell.</q>

Let this suffice to shewe what supremacie Constantinus did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise in causes Ecclesiasticall.</q> Nowe Maister Sander draweth vs to see, what honour he gaue to the see of Rome.</p>
               <p>First he taketh it for most certayne, that Constantine was baptised by Syluester, which is an impudent lye and forged fable, as is manifest by Eusebius, who liued in his tyme and after him, who knewe him familiarly, and affirmeth that he was baptised in his iorney towardes Iordane, where he had purposed to haue bene baptised, if God had spared him life. But this manifest testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye of Eusebius, Maister Sander refuseth, becau<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e he was suspected for affection to the Arrian heresi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Beside that he was vniustly suspected, what reason is it, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit his story, who wrote at such tyme, as many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands aliue could disproue him, for any affection to that heresie, whereto the baptisme of Constantine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned nothinge in the worlde? As for the stones and pillers of marble, in which any such matter is grauen, bearing the name of his baptistry except Maister San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der could proue, that they were sette vppe in his tyme, are simple witnesses against the historye of Eusebius, which lyued in his tyme. Nether the forged pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call of Damasus, nor the writings of Beda. Ado, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus, Gregorius Turene<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sis, Zonarus, Nicephorus late writers, following the fable of the Romish Church, are of any credit in respect of Eusebius, and the eldest wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Ecclesiasticall story, that agree with Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us that he was not baptised many yeares after Syluester was deade.</p>
               <p>And concerning the donation of Constantine, it is
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2880:147"/>
too absurd for any wise man to defend, which hath bene so long before disproued by Laurentius Valla, no enemy of the Romish religion, although a discouerer of that fable. Agayne his forsaking of the citie of Rome, and building of Constantinople, is as great a fable, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he bewtified Byzantium, and made it an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall citye, as placed conueniently to keepe the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall Empire, yet he forsooke not Rome, but still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned it as the chiefe see of his Empire, so did the Emperours that followed him, vntill (after it was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the barbarous nations,) they made lesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of it. And therefore although Constans the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of Heraclius could not conueniently remoue the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet he remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence what he thought good, by which it appeared he had authoritie in the citie, by the prouidence of God and not by chaunce, as M. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der dreameth, that he was prohibited by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in respect of the Popes supremacie, or els the world should be gouerned by chaunce.</p>
               <p>But leauing Constantinus the father, we must come to Constantius his sonne which was an Arrian, of whom Athanasius complayneth, that he had no reuerence of the Bishop of Rome <hi>Ep. ad Solit. vit. agen.</hi> nether consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>that it was an Apostolike see, nor that Rome was the mother citie of the Romane Empire.</hi> There were other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolikes sees beside Rome, and the Christian worlde was larger then the Romane Empire, therefore this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing for the singular prerogatiue of that see.</p>
               <p>But the noble Emperours Gratianus, Valentinianus &amp; Theodosius made a law, <hi>lege</hi> 1. <hi>Cod. de summ. trinit That all their people should continue in that religion, as the religion which is vsed from S. Peter vnto this day doth declare him to haue deliuered to the Romanes, and which it is euident that Bishop Damasus doth follow, and Peter Bishop of Alexandria a man of Apostolike holines.</hi> This law proueth, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours had authoritie in Ecclesiasticall causes. And that they ioyned the Patriarch of Rome with the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of Alexandria, not because he of Alexandria agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:2880:147"/>
with him of Rome, but because they both agreed with Peter, and Peter with Christ.</p>
               <p>From these Emperours, he commeth to Bonifacius, who writing to the Emperour Honorius, and humbly desiring his ayde to appease the tumults of his Church, vseth these wordes. <q>

For the same councell and Emperours decreed that the see of Constantinople in the East should haue the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie that the see of Rome had in the West, the title of senioritie onely reserued to the Bishop of Rome. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Bishop of Rome, Leo by letters and his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats in the councell cryed out against it as lowd as they could. <hi>Cont.

               <p>The saying of Iustinian <hi>in cod de summ. trinit.</hi> is exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and aunswered in the 69. article of M.

The report of the councell of Sinuessa is too full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and confusion to be credited for authenticall authoritie.</p>
               <p>And yet it is playne that Marcellinus the Bishop of Rome was conuicted by witnesses to haue committed I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, before he confessed the sinne, and receiued sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation and accursing of the Synode, howsoeuer that patche is thrust in after the Actes of the councell, <hi>prima sedes, &amp;c. the first see is not iudged of any,</hi> which in euery counterfait decretall epistle almost must haue a place.</p>
               <p>To proue that Phocas did not first make the see of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:2880:148"/>
Rome heade of all Churches, when the history is plaine he did, M. Sander bringeth in these and such like alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before, which acknowledged a certaine primacie of the see of Rome. And certaine it is the Bishops of Rome before Phocas tyme, affected a great primacie, which of many was acknowledged, but yet neuer absolutely, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie, vntil Phocas for a great summe of money receyued of Boniface the thirde, strake the stroke, and made the decree, for which in all popish wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he is highly praised: although in the Greeke church his decree was not long obserued. Touching the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Emperours and Princes of later times, although I could shewe they haue often resisted the Pope, yet I know many may be alledged that haue submitted them selues to his Antichristian tyranny, which I will not sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to examine, because they can be no preiudice to the truth approued by examples of the eldest age. As for the history of Lucius king of Britayne, that sent to Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius for preachers, if it were true, it maketh nothinge for the supremacy of the romish Bishop. I will therefore conclude this chapter, with a saying of Socrates <hi>in proe. lib.</hi> 5. to shew what authoritie he iudged them perours to haue in Ecclesiasticall matters. <q>

Peters chayer, it is no meruayle if Satan haue thrust him into that see, which of olde tyme was accompted the toppe and castell of all religion.</p>
               <p>But let vs see his reasons taken out of Gods word, by which it is proued, that the Pope can not be Antichrist him selfe. The first is, because in S. Paule he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;c. the man of sinne which signifieth one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular man, and not a number of men in succession, and this is affirmed to be the Greeke article in this worde man, by Cyrillus in <hi>Ioan. lib. 1. cap. 4.</hi> But how frendly Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus was deceaued, you shall see, by some examples, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out of the new Testament.

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:2880:149"/>
argument is thatis taken of the nature of the Greke ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. Nether is Hierom or any of the auncient writers to be heard without authoritie of the Scripture, which supposed that Antichrist should be one man. Although none of them directly affirmeth that he should be one man, as Christ was. Hierom <hi>in Dani. cap.</hi> 7. sayth we must not thinke that Antichrist should be a Deuill, <hi>but one of the kind of men in whom Satan should dwell.</hi> This proueth not that he should be a singular man, no more then the fourth beast, which signifieth the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e Empire, out of which he should rise, should be one singular Emperour. No more doth it proue that because Antiochus was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of him, he must be but one man. And as litle that Ambrose <hi>in</hi> 2. <hi>The.</hi> 2, sayth, <hi>Satan shall appeare in homine, in a man,</hi> which may signify the kind of men and not one singular person. Likewise Augustine calling Antichrist the Prince, and last Antichrist, meaneth no one person for the words Prince and last, may agree to a whole suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of men in one state, as well as the wordes king and beaste, to a whole succession of Emperours in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel. To conclude, there is not one whome he nameth, that denyeth Antichrist to be a whole succession of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in one state of deuilish gouernment. And Irenaeus thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it probable of the Romane kingdom, <hi>lib.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>The second argument is, that Antichrist is called the aduersary, &amp; therefore is the greatest enemy of Christ, <hi>denying Iesus Christ to be God and man, or to be our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</hi> I aunswer, the Pope doth so, denying the office of Christ, although with the deuills, he confesse in wordes, Iesus to be the holy one of God, and to be Christ the sonne of God. <hi>Marke</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Luke.</hi> 4. 41. his diuinitie the Pope denieth, by denying his onely power in sauing, his wisedom in his word to be onely sufficient, his goodnes in the vertue of his death to take away both payne and guylt of sinne, which he arrogateth to him selfe by his blasphemous pardons. Christes humanitie he denyeth by his transsubstantiation, his mediation, in which he is principally Christ, he denyeth by so many meanes of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:2880:150"/>
saluation as he maketh, beside Christ <hi>videlicet</hi> mans merits, ceremonies inuented by man, pardons, a newe sacrifice of the Masse, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The third argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is, that Antichrist shall not come, before the Romane Empire be cleane taken away. For that which Saint Paule sayth, <hi>ye knowe what withholdeth, &amp;c.</hi> Although it be not necessary to expound this of the Romane Empire, yet following the olde writers that so vnderstood it, I say the Romane Empire was remoued before Antichrist the Pope was throughly enstalled. For beside that the see of the Empire was remoued from Rome, the gouernment it selfe was in a manner cleane remoued, the title of the Romane Emperour onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning, at last an other Empire by the Pope was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Germanye, whereof litle beside a name remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at this day, the Pope clayming authoritie of both the swordes, and he that is the Emperour in title, if he haue no landes of his owne inheritance, scarse equall with a Duke by dominion of his Empire.</p>
               <p>The fourth argument is, that the deedes &amp; doctrine of Antichrist against Christ, must be open and without all dissimulation, because Saint Paule maketh a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene the mysterye of iniquitie, and the open shewing of Antichrist. I aunswer, they are open to all faithfull Christians, although they be hidde from such as be deceiued by Antichrist. Here M. Sander aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to that which he supposeth might be obiected, that some gloses of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> canon law, call the Pope God, or make him equall with Christ, yea they call him God aboue all Gods: but he thinketh to auoyd it by saying, they call him not God by nature, but by office vnder Christ, where they say he is equall with Christ. This bla<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>phemy will not so easily be excused. Nether is it to be thought that any man will euer cal him selfe God by nature. But to omitte these flattering gloses of the canon lawe, doth not the Pope exalt him self aboue all that is called God and worshipped as God. When he commaundeth to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayne from meates and mariage, whereof God hath
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:2880:150"/>
created the one and instituted the other, as good and holy, for greater goodnes and holines then God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or instituted in them. Doth he not exalt him selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue God the redeemer, when he affirmeth his rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be, ether onely from sinnes committed before baptisme, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or onely from the guilt of sin whereas his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish pardons can absolue from both. Doth he not extoll him selfe aboue God the holy Ghost, when he taketh vpon him to sanctifie the creatures of the world, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then God hath sanctified them to apply the merits of Christ, otherwise then Gods holy spirite worketh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication by faith, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The 5. argument is, that Antichrist should be recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued moste speciallye of the Iewes, of which hee brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the opinion of diuerse olde writers, but because the Scripture sayth no such thinge, but contrary that he shall sit in the Church of God. We deny the antecedent or proposition of this argument. But M. S. alledgeth the saying of Christ <hi>Ioan. 5 I came in my fathers name, and ye haue not receyued me, if another come in his owne name ye wil receyue him.</hi> This other man sayth M. S. is Antichrist, and so expounded by the auncient fathers. I aunswer they haue no ground of this exposition. For Theudas the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian, Cocabas, and such like, deceyued the Iewes in their owne name, yet none of them was this Antichrist.</p>
               <p>The 6. argument is, that Antichrist according to the prophecy of Daniel <hi>cap.</hi> 7. &amp; the interpretation of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, shal subdue 3. kings, the kings of Egypt, Africa, and Ethiopia, which seeing the Pope hath not done, he is not Antichrist, I aunswer, Nether Hierom nor any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical writer, whom he followeth, hath any directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the Scripture, for this interpretation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is more like, that the Emperour is the litle horne which first diminishing as it were a thirde parte of the strength of the fourth beast, at length began vtterly to oppresse &amp; destroy it, I meane y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth of Rome.</p>
               <p>The 7. reason is, <hi>Antichrist shal preuaile in his raigne but 3. yeares &amp; an halfe, Dan 7. which time the Apocal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

42. <hi>monethes.</hi> I aunswer, this tyme must not be limited by measure of man, but as God hath appoynted it. Daniell nameth no yeres, but a tyme, tymes, &amp; halfe a tyme. And Hierom in his accompt of 1293 daies differeth from S. Iohn <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. 6. who setteth them downe 1260. dayes.</p>
               <p>The 8. reason is, <hi>that Helias shall come at the tyme of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, as Hippolitus, Augustine, Hierom &amp; Theodoret teach, who is not yet come, although the Pope haue long florished.</hi> I aunswer, The Scripture speaketh of no comming of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias, but of Christes two witnesses, which haue neuer fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the greatest heate of the popish tyranny. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>The 9. reason is, that <hi>Antichrist shall be of the try be of Dan, by the <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The 10. argument is, that <hi>Antichrist shall not come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the later ende of the world as August ne and Theodore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus iudged.</hi> but Gregory seeing the ambition of Iohn of Constantinople affirmed, that the tyme of the reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Antichrist was euen at hand, and that the same Iohn was the forerunner of Antichrist, and Antichrist should shortly be reucaled, &amp; an army of Priests should waite vpon him. Nowe seeing he, whosoeuer tooke that which Iohn refused, by Gregories iudgement should be Antichrist, and it is certayne, that Pope Boniface the 3. soone after the death of Gregory and his successors, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped not onely that, but more also, it is certayne by Gregoryes prophecye, that the Pope is Antichrist.

fonde chalenge. And although none within that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe had pointed out the see of Rome, yet the fulfilling of the prophecye in the later tymes, did sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare who it should be. And most of the auncient writers name Rome to be the see of Antichrist. Although they could not foresee that the Bishoprike of that see should degenerate into the tyrannye of Antichrist. M. Sander aunswereth, that Tertullian and Hierom, call Rome Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, <hi>because of the confusion of tongues of di<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

As for Idolatrie and persecuting of Sainctes, although it might be sayd in tyme of Irenaeus, and Tertullian, yet could it not be sayd in the dayes of Hierom, Augustine, Ambrose, Primasius, and a number that liued in time of the Christian Emperours. And whereas Hierom <hi>ad Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gasiam,</hi> expoundeth the name of blasphemye written in the foreheade of the purple harlet to be Rome euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, it agreeth very well vnto the see of the Popedom, which they boast to be eternall, although the Empire of Rome shall be cleane taken away. For M.

For that Rome where Peter satte, was buylded vpon seuen
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:2880:152"/>
Hilles, and not gone downe into the plaine of Campus Martins, nor ouer the Riuer. Beside this it is plaine, that although the people haue remoued their habitations from the hilles, yet the Pope hath not, for on them be still to this day his Churches, Monasteryes, &amp; courtes. For on the Mounte Caelius be the monastery of Sainte Gregory, the church of Iohn and Paule, the Hospitall of our Sauiour, the rounde Church, the great Minster of Laterane, in which are sayde, to be the heades of the Aposiles Peter and Paule, and the goodlyest buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in the worlde, where the Byshops of Rome dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vntill the time of Nicolas the seconde, which was almost eleuen hundreth yeeres after Christe.</p>

                  </gap>christ is not a common pettit heretike, but the greatest and most daungerous enemy that euer the Gospel had.</p>
               <p>The names of Benedictines, Fraunciscanes &amp;c. Maister Sander woulde excuse, because these sectes maintaine no doctrin, dissenting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope, but all seeke the perfectiou of the Gospell by diuerse wayes, as though there were any other way but Iesus Christ. Sainct Paule 1. Cor. 1. condemneth the holding of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of Paule, of Apollo, when the Doctrine was all one, and counteth them schismatikes, that so did. And the purer P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:2880:154"/>
possessing nothing, in abstayning from Marriage &amp;c. for Heretikes, and called them Apostolicos, witnesse Epiphan. <hi>Cont. Aposto. haer,</hi> 61.</p>
               <p>The thirde Marke of an Antichristian, is, dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement among Heretikes: and heere not content to charge vs with the dissagreeing of Anabaptistes from vs, he amplysieth the dissention betweene Luther and Zwinglius, about the presence of Christes body in the sacrament, for which contradiction, he thinketh it muste needes followe that one of them is an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christe.</p>
               <p>I aunswere euery errour stifely mayntayned, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not an Heretike, except it be in an article of fayth necessary to saluation.</p>
               <p>Cyprian againste the Byshopps of Rome Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus and Cornelius, helde an errour in Baptisme, as greate as that same of Luther, dissenting from Zwinglius in the Supper of the Lorde, yet is not Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryan accoumpted for an Heretike. Maister Sander replyeth and sayeth, that Cyprian was not so stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, that he woulde excommunicate them that held the contrary.</p>
               <p>Luther also and Zwinglius, althoughe they coulde not bee reconcyled in opinions, yet agreed to abstaine from contention, at Marpurge Anno domini. 1529 Sleid. lib. 6. Maister Sander sayth, further, that in the contention of Cyprian, and Stephanus, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Faythe was not fully and vniuersally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in any generall Councell. But hee forgeteth that the Byshoppe of Rome was one partie, whose iudgement should haue ended the striefe if his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie had beene such then, as he vsurped moste ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously afterward.</p>
               <p>Nowe where as he defendeth the Papists for their vnitie, which he sayeth, could not bee with out the spirite of God, I aunsweare he might as well defend the Doctrine of the Mahometistes, where is greater vnitie then euer there was amonge the Papistes: who
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:2880:154"/>
to omit an hundreth small contentions of the schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are not yet agreed, of the greatest question of all, whether the Pope be aboue the councell or the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell aboue the Pope. For seeing some of the Papistes, make the Popes determination to be the rule of truth, other make the councell, there is no vnitie among the Papistes in truth, when they are not agreed what is the onely rule of trueth: whereas we all agree, that the word of God is the only rule of truth, wherby we would haue all doctrine tried and examined.</p>
               <p>The fourth marke of an Antichrist, is, to reigne but a short tyme, and here he woulde haue vs to marke howe Luthers kingdome is come to an ende, whose doctrine Melancthon hath chaunged although Illyricus woulde defend it. What depe roote y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of God deliuered by Luther, hath taken, it is so well knowne, that it can not be dissembled. Neither hath Melancthon departed from him, except it were in his opinion of the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. Wherefore this is a great impudency, to triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phe ouer the decay of Luthets doctrine, which dayly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, to the ouerthrow of the Popish kingdom.</p>
               <p>The fall of Hosiander an heretike, no man either marueleth or pitieth. The doctrine of Zwinglius and Oecolampadius of the Sacrament is the same that Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine teacheth, as euery wise man doth know, and their learned workes shall liue and be in honor, when the Popes decretalls and his Masse bookes &amp;c. shall stoppe mustard pottes, and be put to viler vses.</p>
               <p>Neither is Caluines doctrine failed, by our othe of supremacie, for Caluine in the right sence of it, taught the same supremacie of Christian Princes which we sweare to acknowledge, in our soueraigne.</p>
               <p>Neither doth Beza teache any otherwise of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending of Christ into hell, then Caluine did, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise expounded the place of the Psalme, cited in Actes the 2. then Caluine doth, as all men that wil read them both may see, notwithstanding the shamelesse ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of M. Sander.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:2880:155"/>
The long continuaunce of the Popish kingdome, is a small cause to bragge of, when it being sound enemie to the kingdome of Christ, is nowe entered so farre into destruction, out of which it shall neuer escape, although Maister Sander sayth it doth florish, when it is banished out of so many regions and dayly decreaseth in euerie place, Gods holy name be praised therefore.</p>
               <p>The fift marke of Antichrist (he sayeth) is to preach without commission, as Luther did, who was sent of none. I aunswere in the state of the church, so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie deceaued, as it was in his time, God sendeth extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily, immediatly from him selfe, as Helias &amp; He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizaeus &amp; the Prophetes were sent to the Iewes &amp; Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, which were not of the Priests &amp; ordinary teachers, so Christ sent his Apostles and Euangelists. And so was Luther and such as he sent to repaire the ruines of the churche. And yet the Papistes haue small aduauntage against the calling of Luther, seeing he was a Doctor, authorised to preache in that church, where he first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne, which after he had reformed the abuses therof, and restored true doctrine in many poyntes banished, by the false doctrine of Antichrist. The same reformed church hath euer since sent forth ordinarie pastors and teachers and shall doe to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>The sixt <hi>marke of an Antichrist is, that heretikes preferre the temporall sword before the spirituall. And therefore Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ shall by force of armes compell men to a new faith, for he shall come as S. Paule sayeth in virtute, that is to say in power or strength.</hi> O impudent falsifier of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth not Sainct Paule say that his comming shalbe according to the efficacy of Satan in all power &amp; signes and lying wonders, &amp; in al deceitfulnes of vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. by which is shewed seduction by false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but he shall mainteine his kingdom by cruelty, as it is manifest in the Reuelation <hi>cap.</hi> 13. &amp; 17. &amp;c. But M. Sander hath a great quarel against the B. of Winchester for saying in his booke against Feckenham, <hi>that the ciuil Magistrate, may visit, correct, reforme and depose any Bishop</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:2880:155"/>
                  <hi>in their owne realme.</hi> Which is directly to say that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the King is higher and greater in Gods churche, then the power of a Bishop. And what inconuenience is this, in thinges perteining to his office, seeing that the Bishops power in his spirituall office of preaching mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string &amp;c. is confessed to be aboue the King? Hereby we make the body aboue the soule (saith M. Sander) the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral reigne aboue the kingdom of heauen. Not a whit, no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Salomon in deposing Abiather, &amp; Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Emperors in deposing proude Bishops of Rome. Onely this we say, that M. Sander dissembleth. The cause must be iust, for which <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> King shoulde depose a Bishop or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, for! thinke there is equall right in deposing of the greatest Bishop, &amp; the poorest Priest from his benefice. This latter was alwaies lawful by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lawes vpon iust cause. Now if the cause be iust, it must be either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest or doubtfull. If it be manifest as Abiathers was for murther, treason, adulterie, &amp;c. the King obseruing the processe of the lawe, as in all other mens causes, may proceede against a Bishop. If the cause be doubtfull, it is either for life or doctrine. The triall of the Bishops life, ought to be as all other mens are, with due co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration of his accusers. The triall of doctrine is not in the Kings knowledge ordinarily but in the knowledge of the eccle siasticall state, who are iudges of the doctrine by reason of their knowledge, &amp; to depose him from his ministery by reason of their calling, if he be culpable, and the King hath power to exclude him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his place &amp; from his life also if his offence deserue it. But that in spiritual matters the King should rule y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishops, &amp; pastors otherwise then Gods word woulde haue them ruled, none of vs did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer affirme: for that were tyranny &amp; not Christian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. And of such tyranny of Constantius the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Emperour, doth Athanasius complaine: <hi>In Episi. ad sol. vit. agent.</hi> and shew the iudgement &amp; aunsweres of the Christian Bishops, Paulinus, Lucifer, Eusebius, Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Liberius, Hosius, vnto him, when he would haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced them to subscribe against Athanasius, for defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:2880:156"/>
the eternall diuinitie of our Sauiour Christ.</p>
               <p>But yet the same Athanasius, appealed, him selfe, to the godly Emperor Constantinus the great, although in the end the Emperour being caried away by multitude of false witnesses, as any mortall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be, &amp; deceiued, as Dauid was about Mephibosheth, gaue wrong sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce against him <hi>Socr. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 34. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same Emperor in his letters before, threatned to depose him, if he were disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he neuer repined but acknowledged his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctority. <q>
                     <hi>Si cognouero quòd aliquos eorum qui ecclesiae student prohibueris, aut ab accessu ecclesiae excluseris, mitta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euestigio qui te meo iussu deponat ac locum tuum transferat.</hi> If I shall know (sayth the Emperour) that thou wilt prohibit any of them that fauour the church or exclude them from entring into the churche, I will sende one immediatly which shall depose thee by my commaundement, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue thy place.</q> 
                  <hi>Socr. li.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 27. Thus Athanasius iudging Constantius the hereticall Prince for an Antichristian image, in vsurping auctority in matters of faith against the truth, obeieth Constantinus a defender of the truth, &amp; seeketh aide of his auctority in ecclesiasticall causes, according to the truth: M. Sander fearing we would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect against him that Constantinus, Martianus, &amp; other godly Emperors, vsed to sit in generall cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels with the Bishops, replieth, that it was only to kepe peace, wheras they did not only kepe peace, but also prescribe &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Bishops, to proceede according to Gods word as Constantine did in the Nicene councell. <q>
                     <hi>Euangelici e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim &amp;c.

                  </q> They did also publish the decrees of the councell by their auctoritie, like as they called the councells together to make their decrees.</p>
               <p>But Ambrose sayth <hi>Ep.</hi> 32. that euen an heretical Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour comming to yeares of discretion, will be able to consider, <hi>what maner a Bishop he is, who layeth the Priestly</hi>

The seuenth marke of Antichrist is, the withstanding of the externall and publike sacrifice of the church, by which he meaneth the sacrifice of the Masse. Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is a setting vp of a new altare &amp; sacrifice propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, against the only propitiatory sacrifice of Christes death once offred, by which one oblation he hath made perfect for euer, them that are sanctified <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. The auctor of this sacrifice, which is the Pope, he is in deede Antichrist the sonne of perdition.</p>
               <p>But Maister Sander for proofe of the sacrifice of the Masse, alleageth the prophecie of Malachie <hi>cap.</hi> 1. with 16. fonde comparisons of the defectes of the Iewes, and the perfection of the Gentiles, which he affirmeth to be the <hi>vniforme interpretation of the auncient fathers, of whom no one denyeth the body and blood of Christ to be here ment, albeit some of them expoundeth this prophecy of prayers and inwarde righteousnes which are alwayes ioyned with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody sacrifice.</hi> I aunswer no one of the auncient fathers, vnderstandeth this prophecy of the sacrifice of Christes body and blood, otherwise then of a sacrifice of prayse and thankes giuing, for proofe whereof, I must referre the reader to myne aunswer to M. Heskins <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. 34. 35. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36. where he shall finde the places of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors set downe, which are by M.

               <p>But one other straunge reason of M. Sander to proue the sacrament of the Lords supper to be a sacrifice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory, I may not omit because I remember not that I haue reade it before. <hi>Euery publike and externall facte which is made by Gods authoritie to put vs in minde of that grea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e also be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the nature of that Sacrifice whereof it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce. As if the killing of a Calfe, which signifyed the death of Christe, was an externall sacrifice, how infinitely more shall the body and blood of Christ beeing made of bread and wine, to signifie his owne death be a publike and external sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reason M. Sander maketh no small account of.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:2880:157"/>
But how beastly an absurditie his principle is you shall easily perceiue, if you consider, that Baptisme is a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and externall fact made by Gods authoritie, to put vs in minde of the death and bloodshedding of Christ, yet no man was euer so mad, to say baptisme is a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Againe the Calfe that was killed was by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment a sacrifice of the only &amp; singular sacrifice of Christes death, &amp; not by vertue of the signification, for the Iewes had other ceremonies then sacrifices, which did signifie the death of Christ: But the Lords supper is not by Gods appointment a sacrifice, therefore the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification cannot make it so.</p>
               <p>The 8. mark of the false prophets of Antichrist, is to spoyle Christ of his inheritance, which God gaue him in all nations, as the Protestants doe, <hi>VVhich for</hi> 8. <hi>or</hi> 9. <hi>hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth yeres, can not shew any nation, town or village, church or chappel in the wide worlde, where they had publike prayer.</hi> I answere, seeing the spirit speaketh expressely, of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Apostacy, and of the flying of the Church into the desert, it is no more derogation to the inheritaunce of Christ, that his Church among many nations was in persecution vnder Antichrist for 7. or 8. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth yeeres, then that the same was in persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the heathen Emperors, for 300. yeeres and more. For the nations were then the inheritance of Christ, in as glorious wise as when the Church flourished in outward peace vnder the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Emperours. Yet was there townes &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, not only in Fraunce, Italie, and Germany, but also in the east parte of the worlde, great nations, among w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> Christ had a visible Church, which were neuer subiecte to the church of Rome. If M. S. reply that they held some errors which we deny, as prayer for the dead &amp;c. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, holding the onely foundation Iesus Christe, they might be true Christians, although they were infected with some such errors as these.</p>
               <p>The 9. Mark of Antichrist is, <hi>intollerable pride, to make him selfe iudge of the sence of Gods word, and of the text also.</hi> I allowe this marke, &amp; it agreeth to none that euer was
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:2880:158"/>
so aptly, as to the Pope, whom the Papistes affirme, that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not erre in the sence of the Scripture, who affirme that he hath auctoritie to receaue &amp; reiect what bookes of Scripture he wil. But M. Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der saith this note agreeth to vs, and that we make our selues iudges of the sense of Gods word, and of the text. But we vtterly deny that: for we make the spirit of God in his worde, iudge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. No sayth M. Sander, &amp; bringeth an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of these word's of S. Paul. <hi>He that ioyneth his virgin in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage doth well, and he that ioyneth her not doth better.</hi> Here vpon (saith he) we grounde this doctrine, <hi>Virginitie is a better state and more acceptable to God, then the state of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi> This we graunt in some respect, as the Apostle speaketh, but not simpyl. The question is of these words, <hi>he doth better</hi> what is ment thereby: M. Sander chargeth vs to say, that S. Paule meaneth he doth better in the sight of the worlde, which is an impudentlye, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al his foolish dialogisme, is a fighting with his owne shadow. Beza expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth <hi>he doth better</hi> that is <hi>more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously,</hi> not in respect of the worlde, but in respect of godlines, for the reasons before alleaged by S. Paul, &amp; S. Paul him selfe is auctor of this interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verse 35. of that 7. chap. 1. Cor. <hi>This I say for your commodity,</hi> when he exhorteth to virginity. And that his purpose was not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely and simply, to preferr virginity aboue mariage, as a thing of it selfe more acceptable to God, it is plaine by these words. First he saith, of virgines, I haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the Lorde. But he hath a commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to preferre those things that are most acceptable to the Lord. Secondly he sayth: I suppose this to be good for the present necessity, by which words he doth emply, that it is not alwaies &amp; absolutly better, but at somtimes &amp; in some respectes, for them that haue the gift of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, and for none other. So we holde virginity to be better then mariage, according to the meaning of the best auncient writers, whereof some were too great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollers of virginitie, yet not like the Papistes.</p>
               <p>But M. Sander sayeth the Protestantes make them
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:2880:158"/>
selues Iudges, not only of the meaning of Gods worde, but also of the bookes them selues. For they reiect not only the book of wisdom, Tobie &amp; the Machabees, with other such bookes, but also the Epistle of S. Iames. Nay rather the Pope is Antichrist, for receauing these books of Wisedom, Tobie, Machabees, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> were neuer receaued of the church of the Israelits, nor of the vniuersalchurch of Christ for Canonicall Scripture, as I haue often she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. And as touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Epistle of S. Iames, it is a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse slaunder of him to say, that the Protestantes reiect it, but we must heare his reason. First Luther calleth it a strawen Epistle. So Luther called the Pope supreame heade of the church, and the Masse a sacrifice propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, if Protestantes be charged to holde whatsoeuer Luther sometime helde, and after repented. But the confession of Zurich with the consent of the churches of Heluetia and Sabaudia, writeth thus, of it. <hi>Iacobus ille dixit &amp;c. That Iames sayed, that workes doe iustifie, not speaking agaynst Sainct Paule, otherwise he were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected.</hi> Here saith M. Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, they thinke it possible, that S. Iames might be contrarie to Sainct Paule, and so his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to be no holy Scripture. A wise collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I promise you. S. Paule him selfe sayed. If I my selfe or an Angell from heauen, should preach any other Gospel then you haue already receaued, let him be accursed. Ergo S. Paul thought it was possible, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him selfe or an Angell shoulde be auctor of a new Gospel, &amp; so his preaching should not be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospel. Who seeth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> madnes of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
               <p>But S. Iames his epistle (he sayth) hath alwayes bene clearely admitted among true Catholikes, &amp; for witnes hereof he quoteth most impudenly Euseb. lib. 1. ca. 23. in which booke and chapter, Eusebius clearely affirmeth that it is a counterfet epistle. I say not this to allowe the iudgment of Eusebius, but to shewe the impudencie of M. Sander. But he saith we reiect S. Iames because he is contrary to our deuilesh doctrin of only faith. We teach only faith none otherwise, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the apostle teacheth, that a man is iustified by faith, without workes. We teach
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:2880:159"/>
not that a man is iustified by a dead faith, which is voide of good workes, but by a liuing faith which worketh by loue. We say with Sainct Iames, if a man say he haue faith and hath not workes, his faith shall not saue him. For Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s faith, which was imputed to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes by God, was not without good workes, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by his obedience in offering his sonne, wherein God tried him, neither to know him, nor to iustifie him, whom he knew and iustified before, but to shewe his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience &amp; to iustifie him before men. So it is true that S. Iames sayeth a man is iustified of workes and not of faith onely. For a solitarie srutles faith doth not iustifie before God, but a faith which is fruteful in good workes is the onely instrument to apprehend iustification, and the workes as Augustine sayth follow and shewe a iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man they goe not before to iustifie. Thus our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine agreeth verie well with the Epistle of S. Iames &amp; Sainct Paules doctrine, wherefore we haue no neede to reiect the Epistle of Sainct Iames, as contrarie to our doctrine.</p>
               <p>But the Protestantes do not onely make them selues iudges of the whole bookes, but also ouer the very letter (saith he) of Christs Gospell finding fault with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Euangelists, and bring the text it selfe in doubt. Example hereof he bringeth Beza in his annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon <hi>Luk</hi> 22. of the words: This cup is the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in my blood which is shed for you. In which text, because the word blood in the Greke, is the datiue case, the other worde that followeth is the nominatiue case, Beza supposeth that S. Luke vseth a figure called Soloe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophanes, which is appearaunce of incongruity, or else that the last worde which is <hi>shed for you,</hi> might, by error of writers, being first set in the marge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of Mathew &amp; Marke, be remoued into the text. Hereupon M. Sander out of all order &amp; measure, raileth vpon Beza &amp; vpon al Protestantes. But I pray you good Sir, shall the only opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Beza, &amp; that but a doubtful opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in dite all the Protestants in the world of such high treason against the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:2880:159"/>
worde of God? For what gaineth Beza by this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? Forsooth the Greeke text is contrary to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentary heresie. For thus he should translate it: <hi>This cuppe is the newe Testament in my blood which cuppe is shed for you.</hi> Not the cup of gold or siluer (saith he) but the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor in that cuppe, which is not wine because wine was not shed for vs, but the bloode of Christ. Why then the sence is this. This blood in the cup which is shed for you is the newe Testament in my blood. What sence in the world ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these words haue? By which it is manifest, that the words <hi>which is shed for you</hi> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be referred to the cup, but to his his blood. For the cup was the newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in his blood, which was shed for vs, which sense no man can deny, but he that will deny the manifest word of God. Neither doth the vulgare Latine transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion geue any other sense, although M. Sander is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to say it doth. The vulgare Latine text is this. <hi>Hic est calix nouum Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tum in sanguine meo qui pro vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis fundetur.</hi> What grammarian in construing, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre <hi>qui</hi> to <hi>calix</hi> and not rather to <hi>sanguine.</hi> Againe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmus translateth it euen as Beza. <hi>Hoc poculum nouum Testamentum per sanguinem meum qui pro vobis <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r.</hi> Now touching the coniecture of Beza, that those words by errour of the scriuener, might be remoued from the margent into the text, is a thing that somtime hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened as most learned men agree, in the 27. of Mathew where the name of Ieremy is placed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> text, for that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is in Zachary, &amp; yet neither of the Prophets was named by the Euangelist, as in most ancient recordes it is testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. The like hath bene in the first of Marke, where the name of Esay is sette in some Greeke copies, and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in your vulgare translation, for that which is cited out of Malachie which name was not set downe by the Euangelist, but added by some vnskilfull writer, &amp; is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by other Greke copies. But this place you say is not otherwise found in any old copy, as Beza confesseth: then remaineth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> second opinion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> S. Luke in this place, vseth Soloe cophanes w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is an appearance of inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and yet no incongruitie. Wherein I can not maruayle more at your malice (M. Sander) then at your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which put no difference betwene soloecismus &amp; soloecophanes, but euen as spitefully as vnlearnedly, you affirme that Beza should teach, that S. Luke wrote false Greeke, whereas Soloecophanes is a figure vsed of the most eloquent writers that euer tooke penne in hande, euen Cicero, Demosthenes, Greeke and Latine, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and diuine, and euen of S. Luke him selfe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, whereof for examples, I referre you to Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus vpon the word Soloecophanes. The apparance of incongruitie is, that it seemeth, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap> which wanteth, is vnderstoode, as it is commonly in the Greeke tongue, and so the translation must be <hi>hoc poculum nouum Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum est in sanguine meo, qui pro vobis effunditur,</hi> or <hi>effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus est.</hi> So that this is nothinge els, but an impudent and vnskillfull quarelling, against Beza, wheras you Papists defend against the manifest institution of the cuppe, &amp; the practise of the primitiue Church, the communion in one kind of bread onely <hi>Con. Const. Sess.</hi> 13. 21.</p>
               <p>The tenth marke of an Antichristian <hi>is to agree with the members of Antichrist, which are heretikes.</hi> To agree with them in heresie is a poynt of Antichristianisme, I confesse, but not to agree with them in any thing. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery heresy affirmeth things that are true. But let vs see in what points of heresie he chargeth vs to agree with the olde heretikes. First Eunomius sayde, that no sinne should hurt him, if he were partaker of the faith which he taught, so the Protestants saye of their faith. Yea sir, but their faith is not Eunomius faith, &amp; yet they say not that no sinne shall hurt them, but no sinne shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them: &amp; so say you Papistes of your popish faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly Acesius the Nouatian Bishop affirmed, that mortall sinnes committed after baptisme, might not be forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Priest, but of God alone. The Protestants
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:2880:160"/>
deny the Priest to haue any right to forgiue sinnes. This is a lowd lye &amp; false sclaunder, for we hold that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of God, hath authoritie to forgiue all sinnes, that God will forgiue, according to the power giuen to them <hi>Ioan.</hi> 20 But you Papistes agree with the heretike in this poynt, that you deny the Priest to forgiue all sinnes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the power giuen, but haue your <hi>casus Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pales</hi> &amp; <hi>Papales,</hi> by which you abridge the power giuen by Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, the Messalians denyed that baptisme doth plucke vp the roote of sinnes, the same is the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</hi> The Protestants haue none opinion common with the Messalians, who affirmed that our owne merits &amp; satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with prayers continual were necessary for pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp the roote of sinnes, whereas we affirme, that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme saueth vs according to the Scripture 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. by forgiuenes of our sinnes, whereby euen the roote of sinne is plucked vp, although co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiscense remayne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the acte of baptisme, which you Papistes also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to remayne &amp; to be the roote of sinne, although you graunt it not to be sinne. But we limit not the effect of baptisme, to the time passed before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> acte of baptisme onely, as you doe, but extend it to our aeternall saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he that beleueth &amp; is baptised shall be saued. <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 16. Therefore you Papists both in this &amp; in your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual lipplabor maintained in your Abbeyes, agree with the Messalians.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, AErius taught, that we must not pray for the dead, nor keepe the accustomed fastings, &amp; that there is no difference betwene a Priest &amp; a Bishop. The supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of praying for the dead, was iustly reproued by AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, so was the fast of custom and decree rather then of consideration, for the first that praied for the dead were heretikes, Montanists, as Tertullian &amp; his sect, the first that made prescript lawes of fasting, was Montanus the heretike also, as Eusebius witnesseth <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. Of the third opinion was Hierom Euagrio, affirming that the distinction was made by men and not by God.</p>

                  <hi>Fifthly, Iouinian iudged virginitie equall with mariage, so doe the Protestants.</hi> I haue shewed before howe it is equall, and how it is superior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly, S. Hierom reproueth Vigilantius of heresie, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying prayer to Sainctes, and giuing honour to reliques.</hi> For praying to Sainctes, there is no mention in S Hierom, the immoderate honoring of reliques was iustly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and yet it was not then the one halfe of that it hath bene since.

                  <hi>Seuenthly, the Arrians would not beleue the consubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the same, because that word was not written in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. So do the Protestants deny many thinges vpon the like pretence.</hi> This is a meere sclaunder. for we stande vpon the sence of the Scripture, and not the wordes onely.</p>

                  <q>Eightly, Eusebius noteth it for an haynous impietie in Nouatus, that he was not consummate with crisme, which the Protestants call greasing. In deede Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Bishop of Rome reporteth that Nouatus was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in tyme of necessitie being very like to dye. <hi>Iacens in lecto pro necessitate perfusus sit, nec reliqua in eo qu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Secondly that the Chrisme which Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius speaketh of, was ether a seale of the extraordinarye gifts of the holy Ghost, which in some remayned in the Church vntill that tyme, or els he magnifieth that cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony intollerably: to deny the holy ghost to such as had it not, being none of the institution of Christ, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that the Papistes them selues hold at this day.</p>

                  <hi>Ninethly, Lucius the Arrian persecuted holy Monkes, so doe the Protestants.</hi> Nay they punish none but filthy, idle, Idolaters, and hypocrites.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly, the Montanists and Luciferians sayd there was a stewes made of the Church.</hi> They sayde so falsly when the Churche was chaste. but Esaye say de truely: how is the faithfull citie become an whore, when the Church of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sraell was so in deede.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleuenthly, the Donatists sayd the Church was lost from all the world, &amp; preserued only in Africa. So say the Protestants that the Church was lost in all partes of the world, and raysed vp againe in Germany.</hi> The Protestants say not so. For the Churche hath bene scattered ouer the face of the earth, since the first preaching of the Apostles vnto this day. But the Papistes saye that the Church was lost out of all the world and preserued only in a part of Europe, when of all partes in the world onely a part of Europe, which is the least part of the world, was subiect to the Church of Rome.</p>

                     </gap>rians vsed the law and the Prophets, but they peruerted the sense of the Scriptures by a certayne peculiar interpretation of their owne. So doe the Protestants.</hi> Nay so do the Papistes, that submitte all vnderstanding of the Scripture, be it neuer so playne, to the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Pope, and popish Church: as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of Images forbidden, and the cuppe to be receyued of all, doe most manifestly declare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly, it hath alwayes bene a tricke of Iewes and heretikes to be still in hande with translating holy Scriptures, that by chaunging they may get some appearance of Scripture on their side, as Theodotion, Aquila, Symmachus. So doe the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts now.</hi> Hieronym was no heretike, yet did he translate the Scriptures both into Latine and into the Dalmatian tongue. And the Papistes haue played the part of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian heretikes, to confirme the vulgare Latine tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, which is so manifestly corrupt and false, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the truth of the Hebrue and Greeke textes vpon pretence of auoyding vncertaynty of translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:2880:162"/>
there is none so bad as that.</p>
               <p>I might heere runne through a great number of the olde heresies, in which the Papists consent with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Heretikes. The Valentinians in their crosse. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanistes in their purgatory, and prescript fastings. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocratians in their images. The Hemerobaptists in their holy water. The Offenes and Marcosianes in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and straunge tounge in prayers. The Heraclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites in annoynting them that are redy to dye. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians in praying to angels. The Archonticks in their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kery. The Marcionists in extolling virginitie &amp; fasting, &amp; in permitting women to Baptize. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatits in abstaining from flesh. The Apostoliks in their vowe of continence. The Cyrians in worshipping the virgine Mary. The Pelagians in their opinion of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and freewill. The Eutychians in denyinge the truethe of Christe his bodye. The Anthromor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites in making Images of God, and many other, but that I haue doone it elsewhere, more at large. But of these, Epiphanius, Augustine, and others are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
               <p>The 11. and last marke is, <hi>that Antichristians shoulde goe about to make voyde, and deny the supernaturall graces which God hath giuen to his Church, so that the seale of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist by Hippolitns iudgement should be Nego I deny. So doe the Protestants which deny fiue sacraments of the church, the sacrifice of the Masse. &amp;c.</hi> And so maketh rehearsall of a greatnumber of popish errors, which indeed we deny, because they be contrary to the trueth of Gods worde. Among which he rehearseth some false and shamelesse slaunders, as, <hi>that we denye our sinnes to be taken away by the Lambe of God, saying they tary still but that they are not imputed.</hi> In deed, if we say we haue no sinne, we deceiue our selues, and the trueth is not in vs. But we say all the sinnes that we haue, are taken away, when they are not laid to our charge.</p>
               <p>Secondly he chargeth vs to teach, <hi>That no iustice is at all made in vs by spreading charitie in our heartes, VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:2880:162"/>
                  <hi>S. Paule saith Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>many shalbe made iust: but they say onely that Iustice shall be imputed.</hi> We say with Saincte Paule Rom. 5. that beeing iustifyed by faith we haue peace with God, reioycing in hope, which doth not confound vs in the middest of afflictions, because the loue of God is powred foorth in our heartes. I meane the loue of God towarde vs, and not our loue towarde him. Wee say likewise with Sainct Paule, that by the obedience of one which is Christe, many shalbe made righteous. But howe can we be made righteous by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Christe, but that his obedience is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and made perfecte vnto vs? O putide and absurde slaunders.</p>
               <p>He chargeth vs thirdly, that wee deny Baptisme, to remit our sinnes, which is false, excepte as Sainct Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter denyeth the woorke wroughte to saue vs. 1. Pet. 3. verse 21. not the washing of the filth of the body, but the aunsweare of a good conscience vnto Almightie God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he chargeth vs to deny that Baptisme is necessary to Children, which are borne of christian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes wherein he lyeth moste impudently: although wee agree not with the Papistes that the Infantes of Christians excluded by necessitie from Baptisme, are damned. In which errour although Augustine was, yet he is no more to be followed, then in an other errour, about the same infantes, to whome bothe he and Pope Innocentius thought the Sacrament of the Lordes Supper as necessarye as the Sacrament of Baptisme, affirming that Infantes whiche haue not receiued the Lordes Supper were damned. Contra duas Episto. <q>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag. ad Bonifac. lib. 2. cap. 4. <hi>Ecce beatae memoriae Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius Papa sine Baptisino Christi &amp; sine participatione corporis &amp; sanguinis Christi vitam non hobere paruulos dicit.</hi> Beholde Pope Innocente of blessed memory sayeth, that without the Baptisme of Christe, and the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the body and bloode of Christe, little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue no lyfe.</q>

               <p>To conclude, we deny nothing that they can proue to be true, but such matters as we proue by the onely rule of trueth to be false. But the Pope sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be Antichrist, which denyeth al the soueraignitie of the office and prerogatiue of Christ.</p>
               <p>He denyeth that Christe is the onely heade of his vniuersall Church in Heauen and in earth.</p>
               <p>He denyeth that Christ onely is a Prieste, according to the order of Melchizedech.</p>
               <p>He denyeth that Christ onely is our Mediatour, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of intercession, as of redemption,</p>
               <p>He denyeth that Christs woorde is sufficient for our saluation.</p>
               <p>He denyeth that the sacrifice of Christe his death is the onely purgation of our sinnes.</p>
               <p>He denyeth that the merites of Christ are our onely justification.</p>
               <p>He denyeth that God onely is to be prayed vnto.</p>
               <p>He denyeth the veritie of Christes bodye by his transubstantiation.</p>
               <p>Finally he denyeth all honor and glory to be dewe onely to God by Iesus Christ, and therefore he is none other, but euen that detestable monster Antichriste whome I beseech the Lord, speadely to confound and abolish by the spirit of his mouth which is his holy woorde, and by the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his comming.</p>
