            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the number, and wit of such as use to write Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, may seem to have exhausted all that can be said upon such occasions: yet I have a new way of address left me, which is, to write nothing of you, but
<pb facs="tcp:55274:3"/>
what is true, by the confession of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who admire more the greatness of your Parts, than of either your Interest, or Success: And how you have made so great a turn in this Kingdom, without either Blood or Forfeiture, shewing neither revenge, as to what is past, nor fear as to what is to come; continuing no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er your unkindness to any man, than you think he continues his opposition to his Prince.</p>
            <p>All have at sometime confest, that you have been the Ornament, as well as Defence of your Native Countrey, to whom every Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish-man is almost as dear, as every man is to his own Relations. And I am sure that your enemies will find it easier to put you from your Office, then to fill it; and none of them can wish you to be removed, without being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a loser by it. Nor can I be so unjust, even to such as oppos'd you, as not to acknowledge that I have heard them talk of you so advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously (when design and interest oblidged them to dissemble) as almost convinced me,
<pb facs="tcp:55274:3"/>
that the most of them opposed you only in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, rather from the glory of having so great an Adversary, than from the justice of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. And your Countrey has in their late Confluences, (where they crouded in mighty numbers, and with a remarkable joy to meet you, when a privat man) shew'd greater respect to your naked merit, then to the highest Characters by which others were marked out for publict honour.</p>
            <p>Having writ this Book to inform my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men, and to illuminat our Law, I could not present it more justly to any, than to your Grace, who has derived your Blood from a Noble Family, which has been still eminent in our Courts of Justice, since we had any; and who are your self, the greatest States-man in <hi>Europe,</hi> who is a Schollar; and the greatest Schollar, who is a States-man: For to hear you talk of Books, one would think you had bestowed no time in studying men; and yet to observe your wise conduct in affairs, one might
<pb facs="tcp:55274:4"/>
be induced to believe, that you had no time to study Books. You are the chief man who does nobly raise the study of the Civil Law, to a happy usefulness, in the greater and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> and who spends the one half of the day in studying what is just, and the other half in practising what is so: All which may be easily believed, from me who am as great an instance of your generosity, as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of it. Especially since you have left me nothing to wish, so that what I say, needs not flow from flattery, and so must be presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to flow from conviction and gratitude in,</p>

            <head>THE DESIGN.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He great concerns of men, are their Lives, Fortunes, and Reputation, and these three suffering at once in Crimes, it is the great interest of mankind, to know how to evite such accusations, and how to defend themselves, when accused: And yet none of our Lawyers have been so kind to their Countrey, as to write one Sheet upon this pleasant and advantagious Subject, which made it a task both necessary and difficult to me.</p>
            <p>In prosecuting this design, I was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise and abreviat those many and great Volums which make up our Criminal Registers, and having added to them these Observations I have my self made, during my twenty years attendance upon that Court, either as Iudge, or Advocat; I collatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:55274:5"/>
all with our Statutory Law, the Civil Law, and the Customs of other Countreys, and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Doctors: And, as I may without vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty say, that few valuable Authors treat of Crimes, whom I have not read; So there is nothing here which is not warranted by Law, or Decisions, or in which, when I doubted, I did not confer seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously with the learned'st Lawyers of this Age; and yet I doubt not but in some things, others may differ from me, as the best Writers do amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And having only designed to establish so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly the Principles of the Criminal Law, I wanted room for treating learnedly each particular case, or even for hinting at all such cases as may be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; And without wearying my Readers with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, (which was very easie) I have furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Book with as much reason as is ordinarly to be found in Legal Treatises.</p>
            <p>The reason why I have so oft cited the <hi>Basilicks, Theophil.</hi> and the <hi>Greek Scholiasts,</hi> was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because none before me have used them in Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Treatises, but because I conclude them the
<pb facs="tcp:55274:5"/>
best Interpreters of <hi>Justinians</hi> Text: For these Books having been Writ in the same Age, and place, and some of them by those who compiled the Latine Text, they must understand it best of all others, of which I have given many instances in this Book, and shall here adde one, there forgot, which is, that the Latine Interpreters doubt much what is meant by <hi>remittendum</hi> in the constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Si quis Imperatori male dixerit,</hi> some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting it <hi>pardoned,</hi> some <hi>to be sent back</hi> to the Emperour: But the <hi>Basilicks</hi> render it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifies only <hi>ignoscendum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but admire much the wisdom of God, who gives not only inclination, but pleasure to such as toyl for the good of others; for I am sure few men would have from any weaker impulse bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so much time, and so many thoughts upon an imployment, which without bringing gain, will certainly bring envy and censure: For I find it is the genius of this Age to admire such as make the publick good bend to their designs, and to hate such as design to inform them, as if he were
<pb facs="tcp:55274:6"/>
more my friend who would set my Family by the ears, than he who instructed my Children and Servants in necessary duties.</p>
            <p>There are but too many who endeavour now to make all whom they hate, pass for such as love Arbitrary Government; but as in many pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of my former life, I have preferred my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys interest to my own, so in this Book I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to oppose Arbitrariness, where it is most dreadful, and that is, in matters Criminal, in which Life and Fortune are equally expos'd; for he who disinterestedly declares his own opinion, before private cases occurr, (wherein interest or inclination may byass him) doth in so much prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude himself, and others too (as far as his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can reach) from the power of being Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary; and let others say what they please, I will stand more in awe of my conscience then of my enemies, and govern my self more by my own reason, then by the giddie multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. I hope I need not be jealous that our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blict differences will make any unkind to this
<pb facs="tcp:55274:6"/>
Book, which is published for their service, and which is now more accurate, than when it at first pleased them in Sheets. I did Print it, not only to correct the many false Copies which were abroad, but to divert me from refining too much upon our publict debates; and I wish the reading it may have the same effect upon others. And that all of us would turn things to their true light, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider without passion how happy we are, who live under a Prince of our own Religion and Blood, whose clemency is as extraordinary as his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, who governs us by our own Laws, and countrey men; and distribute, all his own revenue amongst us: That we enjoy by his prudence a profound Peace, whilst others bleed or starve in lasting Wars. That all the Commerce of <hi>Europe</hi> is gathered in amongst us; that we are free from those sucking Taxes under which they groan; and are but lately rescued from a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, in which, after we had emptied our Veins and Purses for Religion and Liberty, we became Atheists and Slaves.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD Almighty having created this Lower World to be equally an instance of his power, and of his goodness, did fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it with great variety of excellent, and wonderful productions: but lest these should be defac'd at pleasure by man, who having ruin'd himself, doth little value, and is much inclined to ruine every thing besides; therefore God did not only imprint upon his soul some <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, common principles whereby he is led to love order, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55274:9"/>
did likewise fence the aeconomy and government he had placed in the world with rewards and punishments, And it was just, that as these who did vertuously, were to be rewarded, so these who were vitious should be punisht, which punishments are the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-matter of the Criminal Law, and of this Treatise.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Transgression, or <hi>peccatum,</hi> is by <hi>Modestinus l. obligamur, ff. de. obl. &amp; Act.</hi> made the root of all enormities, and is divided <hi>delicta</hi> into <hi>quasi delicta, &amp; crimina. Quasi delicta,</hi> are such faults and transgressions as are not so hainous that they deserve to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht criminally; such as small ryots, <hi>delicta,</hi> are such as deserve a more severe punishment, but yet because they tend not to wrong the Common-wealth, and publict security immediately, therefore do not deserve to be punisht by any express Law as Crymes. Crymes are these injuries done to the Common-wealth which are so immediat and heinous, as that they are punished by express Law. This distinction is used by <hi>Matheus</hi>: but <hi>Farinacius</hi> makes <hi>delictam</hi> the <hi>genus,</hi> and divides it, <hi>in crimen, &amp; male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium,</hi> with us this subtilty is not observed, for the word Crime, comprehends both Crymes, and Delicts. The Summonds rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for accusing in both, are called Criminal Letters, and the Court in which both are judged, the Criminal Court. Neither use we the word <hi>malefice</hi> in any Cryme, but in witch-craft, in which it signifies that prejudice, and damnage, which arises from the unlawful means used by Sorcerers.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In what consists the nature of a Cryme may be doubted, and <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Reg. Maj. c. i.</hi> A civil Action is defyned to be that which concerns Lands or Goods; And a Criminal Action that which concerns Life or Limb. But <hi>Skeen</hi> in his observations upon that place, do's confess all that to be a Cryme which concerns the publick good, whether a corporal punishment, or pecuniary mulct be craved: but this is also too general, especially since the Law divides Crymes in publick and privat Crymes: and therefore I offer these considerations, 1. All transgressions of Law are not Criminal, <hi>v g.</hi> to make a disposition in defraud of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, is not criminal, though it be prohibited. 2. That is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55274:9"/>
not only to be accounted a Cryme which bears expresly to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable by corporal punishment, or pecunial mulcts: for in my Lord <hi>Renton's</hi> case against <hi>Hoom,</hi> it was found, that poynding of Oxen in time of labouring was Criminal, though it be not appoynted by the Act whereby it is prohibited, to be punished by a definit punishment. Nor is it exprest to be a Cryme, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, single Adultery, is punishable, albeit it be not declared to be a Cryme by any expresse Law with us. 3. That cannot only be thought a Cryme, which is committed against the Law of Nature, for poynding of Oxen is no more such, than making frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent dispositions.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The true nature then of a Cryme may be comprehended, under these general conclusions, First, that is a Cryme, which is declared such by an express Statute, as Murder, Treason; and it were to be wisht, that nothing were a Cryme which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be so, by a Statute; for this would make Subjects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuseable, and prevent the arbitrariness of Judges. And I find by the general consent of Criminalists, nothing is to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Cryme or punisht criminally; but what is forbid by the Law, under an express pain or punishment; for they observe, that as there can be no punishment inflicted, but where a <hi>delict</hi> is committed: so there can be no <hi>delict</hi> but where the Law hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted a punishment, <hi>Cabal Cas.</hi> 1. And this is clear, <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>si quis §. divus ff. de Religios. &amp; sumpt. fun. l. haeres ff. de usufr. leg. Surd. consil.</hi> 301. And yet Lawyers assert that such as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey, and transgress any prohibiting Law, may be punisht arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarly, as contemners of the Law, sutably to the degree of their contempt, though they cannot be punisht Criminally as guilty of a Cryme, <hi>Cabal ibid.</hi> 2. The transgressing any Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Law, which prohibits that which either the Law of God, or the Civil Law, punishes criminally, by corporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a pecuniary mulct, is a Cryme, and thus the poynding Oxen, in time of labouring was declared a Cryme in the former decision, because though it was prohibited by an express Statute, which did bear no punishment; yet it ought to have been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55274:10"/>
according to the Civil Law, whereby it is declared to be a Cryme. 3. That is a Crime whereby the publict peace is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly disquieted. Or whereby the Law of Nature is violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Thus Incests, and Rapts, were accounted Crymes with us, before they were declared to be such by an express Law. And Bestiality, and Sodomy, are Crymes; though yet we have no Statute against them. 4. That is a Crime, which long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome hath punisht, by corporal punishment, or by a pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mulct, in the Justice Court, as single and not manifest Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
               <p>From all which, it appears that the Law of God is the first fountain of our Criminal Law; And thus the lybel in single Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is only founded upon the Law of God. And in usury we ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel upon the Municipal Law, and the Law of God joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 2. Our Statutes, or Acts of Parliament, are our proper Law; but even these may run in desuetude, so far that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the foundation of a criminal pursuit, for former transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, since the people who know not Law, so much by reading the Books of Statutes, as by seeing the daily practice of the Countrey, should not be ensnar'd by pursuits; upon old buried Laws; which scarce Lawyers study or know. Nor can the people be thought to have contemn'd, what they cannot be presum'd to have known. And our Judicators<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ordaining such ancient Laws to be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by proclamations, do confess, that before these proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; these Laws were not binding: for else the renewing them had been unnecessar, and if it were otherwise, we have so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paenal Statutes now in desuetude, that the Leidges would be certainly ruined by them. And thus Collonel <hi>Borthwick</hi> having pursued the Maltmen Criminally for contraveening the 92. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. Parliament; <hi>Ia.</hi> 4. The Councel upon a supplication representing thir grounds, sisted that pursuit. But desuetude must be universal, ancient, and notorious, else the want of any of these three qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, will alter this conclusion. And yet I think that desue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude cannot <hi>in futurum</hi> abrogate a Cryme, and enervate the Law altogether, since the Parliament only, can rescind their own
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55274:10"/>

               <p>The decisions of our Criminal Court, as of all our other, do bind the same or succeeding Judges, rather out of decency, then necessity; for nothing tyes Judges but Laws, and none can make Laws, but the Parliament, which is very suitable to <hi>l. Nemo C. de sent. &amp; inter.</hi> where <hi>Iustinian</hi> doth expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>ne ullorum judicum sententiae pro jure reputentur.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof given in that Law, is <hi>quod non exemplis, sed legibus est judicandum,</hi> and the other reason <hi>L. ult. C. de legibus quia imperator est solus legum conditor.</hi> And if we consider how much circumstances influence particular cases, how Judges may fail where parties are nam'd, and that decisions pass necessarily upon less premeditation then is necessary to Laws; it will be found reasonable, not to trust decisions too much. Likeas our Judges, do make express Acts of <hi>Sederunt,</hi> as we call them, when they resolve to regulat future cases; which were unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessar if all decisions did of themselves bind. Nor doth the decisions of the very Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> bind even the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themselves for the future, as <hi>Conan</hi> observes, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 15. And so frail, and fallible a thing, are mens judgements; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where votes are numbered, and not weigh'd: or where experience may discover the errors, which the sharpest reason could not foresee; that therefore Judges should no more be tyed from altering their decisions, then Philosophers to continue in the errors of their Youth. But yet when the arguments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> weigh equally, and reason seems puzled where to encline,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55274:11"/>
the authority even of our former decisions, should cast the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, especially where the same reason then urg'd, was there pressed; and in the interpretation of Laws (of which decisions are the best interpreters) if a whole tract of decisions can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, it would infallibly bind, wherein <hi>Craig diag. de jure quo utimur</hi> agrees with <hi>Callistrotus, l.</hi> 38. <hi>de. leg. in ambiguitatibus quae ex legibus profisciscuntur consuetudinem, aut rerum perpetuo judicatarum auctoritatem vim legis obtinere.</hi> Where these decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have proceeded upon a debate; by which the reason of Judges is much ripened, and the future inconveniences fully considered: for as <hi>Pomponius</hi> well observes, <hi>l.</hi> 2. §. <hi>his legibus ff. de origine juris, his legibus latis caepit ut naturaliter evenire solet, ut inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatio desideraret prudentium authoritate necessariam esse disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem fori.</hi> And <hi>Durie</hi> in the case of <hi>Hoom</hi> of <hi>Cowdoun-knowes,</hi> shewes us how the L. of Session thought it not derogatory from their honour, to retreat a sentence after debate, which they had pronounced, when no Advocats were compearing.</p>
               <p>We follow the Civil Law in judging Crimes, as is clear by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Acts of Parliament, wherein the Civil Law is called the common Law. And <hi>Robert Leslies</hi> Heirs are by the 69. <hi>Act. Par.</hi> 6. <hi>Ia.</hi> 5. ordained to be forefaulted for the Crime of Treason, committed by the father according to the Civil Law. And fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faultor in absence was allowed by the Lords of Session, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1669. because that was conform to the Civil Law; and falshood is ordain'd to be punisht, according to the Civil and Canon Law, <hi>Act</hi> 22. <hi>Par.</hi> 5. <hi>Q. M.</hi> And that the Civil Law is our rule, where our own Statutes and customs are silent, or deficient, is clear from our own Lawyers, as <hi>Skeen Annot. ad. l.</hi> 1. <hi>R. M. c.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. And by <hi>Craig l.</hi> 1. <hi>diog.</hi> 2. As also from our own Historians, <hi>Lesly. l.</hi> 1. <hi>cap. leg. Scotor. Boet. l.</hi> 5. <hi>hist: Camer. de Scot. Doctr. l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. And the same is recorded of us, by the Historians, and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers of other Nations, as <hi>Forcat lib.</hi> 1. <hi>hist. Angl. Petr. diamitis Geograph. Europ. tit. D. Escosse</hi> and <hi>Duck de auth. jur. civ. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. and though the <hi>Romans</hi> had some customs, or forms, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the genious of their own Nation: Yet their Laws, in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55274:11"/>
Criminal cases, are of universal use, for Crymes are the same almost every where, as <hi>Boet.</hi> well observes, <hi>leges Romanas à Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiniano collectas tanta ratione &amp; sermonis venustate esse, ut nulla sit natio tam fera vel ab humanitate abhorrens; quae eas non fuerit admirata.</hi> And <hi>K. Ia.</hi> 5. was so fond of the Civil Law, as <hi>Boet.</hi> observes, <hi>lib.</hi> 17. that he made an Act, ordaining, that no man should succeed to a great Estate, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Civil Law, and erected two professions of it, one at <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi> and another at <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> And when <hi>Iames</hi> the 2. did by the 48 act of his 3. Parliament ordain that his Subjects should be governed by no forraign Lawes, he designed not to debar the respect due to the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawes; but to obviat the vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Pope, whose canons and concessions were obt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uded upon the people as Laws by the Church men of these times.</p>
               <p>The 4th branch of our Criminal Law are the Books of <hi>Reg. Maj:</hi> which are in <hi>criminalibus</hi> lookt upon as authentick. Thus the Thief must be punisht before the recepter, and assysers must be <hi>pares curiae,</hi> &amp;c. For which, and many other maximes, there is no warrand besides what is contained in these Books of <hi>Reg: Majest:</hi> But why should this be doubted, seing they are cited as such, Act 47. Parl. 6. <hi>Ia.</hi> 3. where it is said, that wilful and ignorant Assysers shall be punisht after the form of the Kings Law, in the first Book of the Majesty, and by the 98. <hi>act.</hi> 14. <hi>p. l.</hi> 3. transgressions of that act are to be punisht conform to the Kings Laws, and of <hi>Regiam Majestatem,</hi> likeas by the 54. <hi>P.</hi> 3. <hi>I.</hi> 1. a Comittee of Parliament is ordained to meet and examine the Book of the Law, that is to say, <hi>Regiam Majestatem,</hi> and <hi>Quoniam atta chiamenta,</hi> which is repeated, 115. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. <hi>P. I.</hi> 3. And albeit they contain many things which are not in use with us; yet they have been in use, and this objection would conclude, the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament not to be our Law. It is then my opinion, that <hi>K. Ia.</hi> the 1. hath brought down some of these collections from <hi>England</hi> with him. Nor find I these books cited before this time.</p>
               <p>It is doubted whether the Secret Council can by any Act, or Proclamation, either introduce a cryme, which can infer tinsel of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55274:12"/>
life, or escheat; for the Parliament can only dispose upon our lives, and fortunes. And it being the representative of the Nation, every man is in Law, said to have consented, to what the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth; I find <hi>Craig</hi> to have been of opinion that no Act of Secret Council can infer a Crime, <hi>pag.</hi> 38. Nor can the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, by their Acts, warrand any to do what would be otherwise a Crime: for <hi>ejus est nolle, cujus est velle.</hi> And none can take away a cryme, but such as can introduce a cryme, and therefore M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Archb: Beath,</hi> being pursued, for killing some men, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that these men, were bringing Meal from <hi>Ireland,</hi> And that by Act of Council, it was lawful to sink or kill such as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened the Act. To which his <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat did reply, that the Acts of Secret Council, could not warrand the killing of a free Leidge, and the committing of murder: which reply was found relevant. But since the Council are to secure the peace, and that many accidents may emerge wherein the publick peace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preserved without this power, it were hard to limit them too much.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Whether <hi>dolus</hi> or a wicked designe, be requisite in all crymes; is largely treated of, by the Doctors, and is most fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, in the process of <hi>Ochiltrie, Balmerino,</hi> and the Marquiss of <hi>Argyle.</hi> And by the texts, § <hi>placuit just. de furt. l.</hi> 3. <hi>ff. De injur. l. pen. ff. ad. Leg. jul. de Adult.</hi> It seems, that the wickedness of the designe, makes only an action criminal; but in my judgement, this inquiry may be resolved, in these conclusions, 1. That see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man can only offend in what is voluntar to him, it must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the will is the only fountain of wickedness. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, it was at first the designe of Law-givers, only to punish such Acts as were designedly malicious. 2. Because design is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and conceal'd act of the mind, which escapes the severest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. Therefore in some cases, this <hi>dolus</hi> is allowed by Law, to be inferred from conjectures, and presumptions, where the act is such, as of its own nature, may be good or evil, accordingly as it is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiat: as in poyson, the giving whereof may be occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ignorance, mistake, or malice, 3. Some acts are so irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55274:12"/>
of their own nature, that the Law requires only that the act be proved, without proving the <hi>dole,</hi> or wicked designe, as in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy, Adultery, &amp;c. 4. Some acts, though they be not wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their own nature, yet because the design cannot still be proved, therefore the contraveening the Law is equivalent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, <hi>&amp; dolus presumitur contra versantem in illicito,</hi> as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with a woman after the Church hath forbid the same, and therefore the Doctors divide <hi>dolum in verum, &amp; presumtivum.</hi> 5. Where the Law hath expresly required, <hi>dole,</hi> and <hi>defigne</hi> there, it must be expresly libelled and proved, as in the Act 37. <hi>Par.</hi> 2. <hi>K. Ia.</hi> 2. where it is statuted, that if any man wilfully recept rebels, he shall be forefaulted; but albeit <hi>lata culpa,</hi> be equivalent, to <hi>dolus,</hi> in lesser Crymes, yet the Doctors conclude, that where the cryme may infer death, or mutilation (losse of life, or limb, as we speak) there the grossest negligence, or <hi>lata culpa,</hi> is not equivalent to <hi>dolus. Clar. Quest.</hi> 84, <hi>Num.</hi> 7. It is likewise much debated, whether an endeavour, to commit a crime, be a crime, albeit the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffect follow not.

Corn. de sicar,</hi> yet is generally concluded by the practicians of all Nations, that <hi>simplex conatus,</hi> or endeavor, is not now punishable by death: <hi>Clar. Quest.</hi> 91. <hi>Gothofr. §. Conatus.</hi> But for clearing this, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the principles of reason, I shall form these conclusions, first, That all indeavour, is an offence against the Common-wealth: though nothing follow thereupon: albeit sometimes the punishment be conniv'd at, or mitigated, according to the several degrees of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but that it is in it self criminal, appears from this, that simple designe is punishable in treason, and some other atrocious crimes; because in these, especially in treason, it would be too late, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a remedy, when the Cryme is committed. 2. In lesse atrocious crymes, the designe is punisht, if the comitter proceeded to act that which approached nearly to the cryme it self, <hi>Si diventum sit ad actum, maleficio proximum.</hi> But this is not <hi>simplex conatus,</hi> but in effect is a lesser degree of the crime, to which it approaches; as if a thief, have put ladders to the house, which he resolves to rob;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55274:13"/>
or if he mix poyson, but the potion be spilt upon the ground by an accident: And albet it be commonly received, that even in these cases, <hi>affectus non est puniendus, sine effectu,</hi> by the same punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the cryme designed: yet I would distinguish in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt an effect disappointed, by an interveening accident; and that which is stopt, by the repentance of the committer, for, where the designe was only disappointed, I think the ordinar punishment, should not be remitted, in cases <hi>ubi deventum est ad actum proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Basil: de extraord: crim: l.</hi> 1. And therefore the court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> did very justly condemn a thief, to be hanged, who had entered the house of one <hi>Girard</hi> to steal and murder, but was deprehended before the theft was committed <hi>Goth. §. Conatus num:</hi> 16. For since the punishment is only remitted <hi>in conatu,</hi> or indeavor, because of the favourable circumstance, that nothing followed thereupon. So I think this may be counter-ballanced by the depravity of the designe, in many cases. As if one should design to kill a whole family, or burn a whole town, and seing men are punisht, not meerly for what is done, because that cannot be helped, as lawyers affirm, but because, the committer of a cryme, may commit the like; Therefore I conclude that he who designed to commit a crime, should be punished as if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it; if he was only letted by accident, because the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth cannot be otherwise secure. And therefore it was admired, why in <hi>Iuly.</hi> 1670. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stanfields</hi> servant, was not punisht with death for indeavouring to burn her Masters house, albeit she was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended before any prejudice was done: But I would here add, as a caution, that great praemeditation, should be proved before <hi>Cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> be punished capitally; for that showes the confirmed malice of the designer, and is aequivalent, as to <hi>him,</hi> to successe. 3. In mean crymes, where the effect followed not, upon the designe, but was hindred by repentance: I think little or no punishment should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, for, <hi>nihil tam naturale, quam unum quod<expan>
                        <am>

                     </expan> eodem modo dissolvi, quo colligatum est.</hi> The like should also hold, where the design was taken up in passion or without premeditation, because there the committer, is not for the future, so much to be fear'd: but this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55274:13"/>
subject will be more fully cleared in the particular subsequent titles; for in some crimes, <hi>Conatus</hi> or indeavour, is more punishable then in others.</p>
               <p>Whether what tends to a crime, though it be not arrived at the full guilt requisite, to make it fall expresly under the statute, or Law, by which that crime is punished, to which it approaches: has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes doubted. As for instance, to misconstruct His <hi>Majesties Government, and proceedings; or to deprave His Laws,</hi> is expresly declared punishable by death, by the 10. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. <hi>P. I.</hi> 6. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then may not papers, as tending to misconstruct His <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties</hi> proceedings, and Government, or bearing insinuations, which may raise in the people jealousie against the Government be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht by that Law? And that such <hi>insinuations</hi> and <hi>tendencies</hi> are not punishable criminally, may be argued thus. 1. It is the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of mankind to know expresly what they are to obey; especially where such great certifications are annext, as in Crymes. 2. The Law having taken under its consideration this guilt, has punisht the actual misconstructing, or depraving, but has not declared such insinuations or tendencies punishable, <hi>&amp; in statutis, casus omissus habetur pro omisso.</hi> 1. This would infallibly tend to render all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es arbitrary, for tendencies, and insinuations, are in effect the product of conjectur: and papers may seem innocent, or criminal, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the zeal, or humour, as well as malice of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Men being naturally prone to differ in such consequential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and too apt to make constructions in such, according to the favour, or malice, they bear to the person, or cause. Are not some men apt to construct that to tend to their dishonour, which was design'd for their honour, and to think every thing an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Law, or priviledge, which checks their inclination and design? Whereas some Judges are so violent in their loyalty, as to imagine the meanest mistakes do tend to an opposition against Authority. And thus zeal, jealousie, malice, or interest, would become Judges, if tendencies and insinuations were allowed to be Crimes. 4. Men are so silly, or may be in such haste, or so confounded; and the best are subject to such mistakes, as that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55274:14"/>
no man should know when he were innocent. Simplicity might oftimes become a Cryme: and the fear of offending, might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion offence. And how uncomfortably would the people live, if they knew not how to be innocent? Whereas on the other part, it may be represented, that there are some Crymes which cannot be determined as to all degrees of guilt. Such as is the misrepresenting the Government, which may be done so cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and in such various, and different wayes, as cannot be specified in any Statute. 2. If the misconstructing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be a great guilt, certainly, what tends to it must be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable to some proportion. 3. It is the interest of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, that all disorders should be punish'd; and surely it is a great prejudice to the Government, that such insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or tendencies, should escape unpunished. And as in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law, there are many Actions which have no definit and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant names, but are comprehended under the general names of <hi>actiones in factum</hi>; And that there are <hi>actiones utiles,</hi> arising from the reason of the Statute, as well as <hi>directae,</hi> which arise from the words of the Law: So in criminal, there are Actions arising from the parity of reason, or at least, which inferring guilt in some degree, are sustain'd with us, <hi>tanquam crimina in suo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> 4. The doing what may tend to misconstruct, or raise jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, is expresly declared punishable by the 60. <hi>Act</hi> 6. <hi>Par. Q. M.</hi> whereby it is declared, that such <hi>as sow evil reports, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorow raising such rumors, to stirr the hearts of the people to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> And by the 9. <hi>Act</hi> 20. <hi>Par. I.</hi> 6. It is declared, that by the former Laws, every thing was declared punishable, which <hi>tends to sedition, and dissention amongst the people.</hi> And if endeavours be punishable, much more ought tendencies: since tendencies are express deeds. Nor hath the Judge more latitude, nor is he more arbitrary here, then he, and the inquest both are, in judging what is arte and part, for that is determined by no Law: and because it could not be determined, therefore a lybel founded upon arte and part in general, was ordained to be sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as relevant by our Statutes.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55274:14"/>V. What persons may be punished, or are capable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Crymes; will be clear by determining what persons are not capable, and whether a minor may be punished for a Crime, is contraverted amongst the Doctors; and for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the difficulty, we must distinguish betwixt such Crimes as are committed by contrivance, <hi>&amp; dolo malo.</hi> And in these a minor is to be punished, if the <hi>dole</hi> can be proved, <hi>l. un. God. si adversus dotem.</hi> The sum of which Law is, that <hi>ubi Minor deliquit. per dolum restitutio non procedit, sed ubi per culpam ibi subvenitur ei per restitutionem.</hi> 2. In Crymes against the Law of Nature, such as Murder, <hi>A minor,</hi> is lyable though not to the ordinar punishment, but in meerly statutory Crymes, such as usury, forestalling of Mercats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is not at all to be punished, except <hi>ubi malitia supplet aetatem,</hi> which, because it is not presumable, should not therefore be inferred, but from very pregnant, and convincing probation. And seeing arte in all Crimes, seems to require judgement and contrivance; it would appear, that though the Crime it self were punishable in minors: Yet art and part should not, seeing that, in effect, depends upon Acts of the judgement; wherein minors may be mistaken, because of their fragility, and less age: and thus <hi>Iohn Rae</hi> was not put to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an inquest, for being arte, and part, of theft, because he was not the principal committer, but went alongst with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was not past twelve years of age, 1. <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1662. 3. Though a minor be punishable where he is <hi>pubertati proximus,</hi> yet he is to be punisht more meekly; and thus the Viscount of <hi>Frendraught,</hi> was put to the knowledge of an Inquest, for being accessory to the away-taking and privat imprisonment of <hi>Gregory,</hi> though this was a statutory Cryme. And thus <hi>Midlton,</hi> and <hi>Machan</hi> were put to the knowledge of an Inquest. 26. of <hi>August</hi> 1612. and the 9. of <hi>March,</hi> 1671. It was found after a most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious debate, that two boyes, the youngest whereof was not twelve years of age, should go to the knowledge of an Inquest, for casting down of a house at their fathers command: albeit it was alledged, that this act was not of its own nature criminal, as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55274:15"/>
murther, or bestiality, but its guilt depended upon circumstances, which minors were not oblieged to know, as if the house belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their father, of which they were informed, and so were not guilty. There are some Crymes also, wherein minors may be punisht, and are repute majors, <hi>per fictionem juris</hi> (according to the opinion of some Lawyers) such as fornication, adultery, sodomy, <hi>&amp; omnia delicta carnis</hi>; because the guilt there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the commission of the fact, and not in a contrivance, and so minors may be equally guilty of these Crimes with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors. Yet I differ from these Doctors in this; for since the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting these Crimes, may be occasioned, by levity, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillancy of judgement in minors: and seing furious persons would not at all be punished for such Crimes, I do think the age is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to be considered, even in these cases; and that minors are not to be as severely punisht, as majors; seing they are not of so solid a judgement as these are. I find, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Reg. Maj. c.</hi> 32. §. 15. And in <hi>annot.</hi> 100. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 41. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. that a minor is not oblieged to answer for any Cryme by which he may loss life or limb. And a case is there cited betwixt His Majesty and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Parbroth, annot. c.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 12. And <hi>Skeen</hi> cites for this <hi>l. pen. C. de autorit. tut. &amp; l.</hi> 1. §. <hi>occisorum ff. ad §. C. Sillan. &amp; Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>de delict. puer. extrav.</hi> The reason seems to be, because a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor may (being pursued whilst he is minor) omit some defence competent to him. And since a minor is not oblieged to debate <hi>de haereditate paterna,</hi> whilst he is minor; much less should he be oblieged to defend in a criminal pursuit, <hi>ubi calore juvenili potest dicere vel tacere quod ei nocere potest.</hi> So that it seems, that albeit a minor may be punisht for several Crymes committed by him when he was minor, yet is he not oblieged to answer for any till he be major. But yet in the Viscount of <hi>Frendrauchts</hi> case, it was found that a minor was oblieged to answer to an inditement even during his minority: But whether a minor confessing will be restored against his confession, is fully debated in the title <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55274:16"/>
should be only extended to such as are absolutly furious. 2. It may be argued, that since the Law grants a total impunity to such as are absolutely furious, that therefore it should by the rule of proportions, lessen and moderat the Punishments of such, as though they are not absolutely mad, yet are hypocondrick and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to such a degree, that it clouds their reason, <hi>qui sensum aliquem habent sed diminutum,</hi> which Lawyers call <hi>insania,</hi> and the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 3. That such as shew any acts of resentment, or revenge, in the wrong they do, may be punished with some degree of severity; since they show some degree of judgement: But yet the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris</hi> is justly condemned by all Lawyers, for having caused execute a mad man, who had killed one that had struck him two dayes before, but since he did show memory and revenge in that act, he might have been punished justly to some moderate degree. 4. Since there are some mad men who have lucid intervals, whose fury has its tides, and waxes and wanes, like the moon upon which it depends; <hi>quos furor, stimulis suis variatis vicibus accendit. l.</hi> 14. <hi>ff. de officio praesidis,</hi> that therefore they should be thought capable to commit crymes when they are in their lucid interval; but not when they are agitated by their fury. But here it may be doubted, whether the crymes committed by a mad man who has lucid intervals, should be persumed to have been committed by him when he was in his fury, or in his lucid intervals, and the general conclusion is, that though every man be presum'd to be sound in his judgement, till the contrary be proved, <hi>quia qualitas quae inesse debet, inesse praesumitur: Alciat praesump.</hi> 1. Yet, when a man is once proved to have been furious, the Law presumes that he still continues furious, till the contrair be proved, for madness is but too sticking a disease; and is seldom or ever cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And this presumption should rather hold in the committing of crymes, then in any thing else; for the committing of a cryme, looks liker the madnesse, then the lucid intervals. And yet if my opinion were of authority enough, I would limit this rule in two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, 1. If the madnesse had fixt to an ordinary interval, as the hight of the moon in lunaticks, I would presume that if the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55274:16"/>
Cryme were not committed at that time, it behov'd to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd it was committed in the lucid interval. 2. If the person offended was one against whom the offender had prejudice in his lucid intervals, or before his madnesse, or if he shew any wit or contrivance in the execution of the wrong he did, I would presume, that the offence was committed in the lucid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval: But because the Cryme in these cases would be founded upon presumptions, I think the punishment should be lessened upon that accompt; and possibly that Judge would not be much mistaken who would remit something of the ordinary punishment in all Crymes committed, even where the lucid intervals are clearly proved: for where madnesse has once disordered the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and much more where it recurts often, it cannot but leave some weakness, and make a man an unfit Judge of what he ought to do, <hi>est tantum adumbrata quies, intermissio, sed non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipiscentia integra</hi>: And as our proverb well observes, <hi>once Wood, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is statute by the 24. <hi>Chap. Stat.</hi> 2. <hi>Rob.</hi> 2. That a mad person shall be kept by his friends, and if he commit any wrong, it shall be imputed to his friends, and keepers; but though these may be made lyable civily for any damnage the furious man doth, as a Master is in Law liable for the prejudice done by a wild beast, which he keeps; yet it were too severe to punish them corporally for the murders, and other Crymes which he commits, except where they are commanded by the Judge to keep him exactly, which ought not to be extended against such as are only his Curators, or nearest of kin. <hi>Bartol. ad l. divus, ff. de off. praesid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is generally agreed to by Lawyers, that furious persons committing a Cryme in their fury, cannot be punisht for it, though thereafter they return to themselves: for in puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing Crymes, the time of the commission is to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; though <hi>Iason, Tiraquel.</hi> and some others are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if the Cryme was very atrocious, the mad man reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, may be punished. And for this they instance the Queen
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55274:17"/>
of <hi>Castile,</hi> who punished with death, a man who had in his fury wounded her Husband King <hi>Ferdinand</hi>; and they cite <hi>l.</hi> 14. <hi>ff. de officio praesidis.</hi> But the instance is founded upon the passion of a woman; and that Law speaks only of Crymes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in a lucid interval. And whereas <hi>Caballus</hi> thinks such a punishment necessar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, for satisfying the discipline of the Church; I should rather think, that the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch should of all other, least punish that misfortune, it being against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian charity, to add affliction to the afflicted. And it were bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish for Church men to be more severe, then the madness it self was, which was so charitable as to take its leave. As a man should not be punished in his health, for what he did when he was mad: so upon the other hand, a man who committed a Cryme in his health, ought not to be punished bodily, if he thereafter turn mad: for then he is not sensible of correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is one of the great designes of punishment. And to punish him then, were to endanger his soul: nor would the people be deterred from vice, but would rather be troubled with passion at such a spectacle: but yet he may be punished in his goods, <hi>Clarus quest.</hi> 6. tells us of one who was scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for perjury, though it was alledged he was mad, but this last seems too severe, for the reasons foresaid; and since a mad man is lookt upon as absent, it may be justly doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may be process'd during his madness, for a Cryme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him while he was in health, even in order to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting a pecuniary punishment: and that because absents can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by our Law be try'd criminally: and because, mad men cannot inform their Friends or Lawyers, so as they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their just defences. But since absents may be tryed for Treason, by the late Act, it would therefore appear, that mad men may be likewise accused for Treason during their mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; It may be likewise doubted if he who used any means to make himself mad after his sentence, may not be put to death, notwithstanding of his madness, since that madness was occasioned by himself, and so should not disappoint the Law.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55274:17"/>
But <hi>Clarus quest.</hi> 6. is of opinion, that it ought to defend him from all corporal punishment, and <hi>Caballus Casu</hi> 298. <hi>num.</hi> 27. is also of opinion, that even he who commits a Cryme whilst he is mad, though he himself occasioned the madness, yet he is not to be punished by the ordinar punishment, for the Law doth not presume that they made themselves furious upon design.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Whether a collective body of people, or university, such as a Burgh, or Incorporation, may commit a Crime, seems debate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: And <hi>Ulpian.</hi> seems to deny it <hi>l. sed &amp; ex dolo ff. de Dol. Mal.</hi> whose words are, <hi>sed an in municipes de dolo detur actio, dubitatur, ego puto, ex suo quidem non posse dare, quid enim municipes facere possunt.</hi> But I conceive that we may clear this point by these po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, 1. That properly Incorporations cannot commit a Crime; for they are <hi>jus, non persona.</hi> 2. Crimes which consist in omission, may be fixed upon Incorporations, as if their Magistrates omit what the Law commands. <hi>L.

Even these Crymes which are ordinarly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by privat men, such as <hi>Murder, Oppression,</hi> &amp;c. are in Law sometimes charged upon the Incorporations; if these things be done by command of the Rulers, <hi>l. Metum. ff. quod metus causa.</hi> 5. No deeds of the Magistrats can infer a Cryme against the Incorporation, except the body of the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur: for they represent not the people in their Crymes, but in their Government: and they were not impower'd in their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to commit Crymes, <hi>l. si procurator §.

concur'd not, <hi>&amp; in damno vitando, potior est conditio ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How far Incorporations may be punished, may be likewise clear by these positions, 1. The Incorporation offending, may be ordained to restore, in so far as they got advantage. <hi>l. Metum autem. ff. quod met. caus. &amp; l. sed &amp; ex dolo ff. de dol. mal.</hi> 2. In these Crymes wherein the fathers may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the children, such as Treason, Incorporations may be likewise punished, for their innocence is not more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, then that of Children. <hi>Bartol.</hi> gives several instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where Towns have been for Treason condemned to be plow'd. 3. If an Incorporation offend in doing things that are only proper to be done by Universities, then the University may be punished, by confiscation of a part of their common-good: but if an University should proceed to commit a Cryme, which is usually committed by private persons, such as the going with displayed Banners to oppress their neighbours, then, as the deeds of privat citizens cannot wrong the Incorporation; so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the deeds of their Rulers. And <hi>Bart.</hi> is of opinion, that if the Incorporation be fin'd, such as are innocent should not be liable to pay any part of it, but it should all fall upon the actors; <hi>Arg. l.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. de Magistrat. conveniend.</hi> for they were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered in their election to commit Crymes, as said is.</p>

               </list>
               <p>CRymes are divided by the Civil Law, into publick Crymes, and privat Crymes, publick Crymes are defined to be these, which any privat person may pursue, for publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and whereof the punishment is stated by an express Law, §. 1. <hi>institut. de publ. jud.</hi> And a privat Cryme which none can pursue, but the party injured, and which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be a publick Cryme by an express Law. But many of the Doctors, do of late conclude, that all Crymes which are punishable by the Statute of any particular Countrey, are <hi>eo ipso,</hi> to be accounted privat Crymes, <hi>statuta enim sunt loges judiciorum privatorum Bal. ad leg. ult Cod. qui testa fac. poss.</hi> Yet this appears to be a mistake, for if a Statute should allow any person whatsoever to pursue the Cryme, therein forbidden; that Cryme would be doubtless a publick Cryme; for the true notion of a publick Cryme, seemes to be that, wherein the Common-wealth is immediatly concerned either by Interest, or Example; by Interest, as in Treason, or coining of false Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; by Example, as in Murder, Witchcraft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55274:19"/>
though the Common-wealth be not immediately concerned, as a body, yet every particular person of that body is concerned; because he who committed that Cryme, may commit the same again, <hi>&amp; semel malus, semper praesumitur malus, in eodem ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere malitiae.</hi> So that every ones having power to pursue a Cryme, or a Crime being declared publick, by an express Law, are not the true constitutive differences, betwixt a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cryme, and a private; but are only the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for when the Kingdom, or State, doth find that any Cryme, is of dangerous, and universal consequence, then they allow, very justly, that every privat man may accuse. With us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the vestiges of this distinction, are yet to be seen for, albeit his <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat may pursue without the concurse of the party injured: Yet no other person will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to pursue any Cryme, <hi>nisi suam vel suorum injuriam prosequatur,</hi> and that every privat person, may not pursue in all Crimes; is clear, from <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Reg. Maj.</hi> where in Treason, it is said, that every man may pursue, which had been unnecessar, if every person might pursue in every Crime, and thus <hi>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi> cal</hi> having raised Letters in his own name, against <hi>Charles Lindsay,</hi> for killing his Father, in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1668. the Justices would not sustain the pursuit at his instance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could not prove that he was son to the defunct, and since his <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat, represents in all criminal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, the publick: and as it is presumeable, that he will not refuse his concurse, so he will be punished, if he refuse the same. It were therefore inconvenient, and unnecessary, that every privat man should be allowed the liberty, of pursuing Crimes, in which he were not interested: this distinction is much abused in the Books of <hi>Reg. Maj.</hi> For in them publick Murder is defined to be that, which is committed by forethought fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and private Murder, which is committed without being known to any, but the persons who were complices, <hi>stat. Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="2">II The Civil Law, likewise divides Crimes in ordinary, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55274:19"/>
extraordinary; extraordinary were these wherein the Law had appointed no particular punishment; ordinary crimes were such as were punishable by a liquid pain, determined by the Law, and was therefore called <hi>crimen legittimum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Crimes are likewise divided, into such as were capital, or not capital. Capital crimes are such, as are punishable by death, banishment, or loss of liberty: so called <hi>à capitis diminutione</hi>; but with us these crimes are only called capital, which are punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by loss of life or limb.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Crimes are either occult, or manifest: occult crimes are these, which either are occult of their own nature, as Hamesuck<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>en, Conspiracy, Adultery, or such as are occult by accident, such as Murders committed by Inn-keepers upon their Guests. Though murder of its own nature be not occult, since it is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times openly committed. This division is considered by Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, either in order to probation; because in occult crimes less exact probation is accepted: And thus with us the being rob'd at Sea was found probable by these in the Ship, because no other probation could be had there. And it is against the interest of the Common-wealth that Crimes should pass unpunish'd: Or they consider this division with respect to prescriptions, because it is debated whether when a Statute appoints a Crime to be pursu'd betwixt and such a day, that time should run in occult crimes, from the time the crime was committed, or from the time it was known. In occult crimes also, torture is admitted more easily then in other crimes.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Crimes are divided in such as are atrocious, and such as are not. Atrocious crimes are these wherein the guilt is very great.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. In <hi>Scotland,</hi> crimes are divided in statutory, and such as are not punished by an express Statute, as common Adultery, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And albeit it was controverted in the Lord <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touns</hi> case, <hi>Ian.</hi> 1666. that the poynding of Oxen in the time of labouring, could not be accounted a crime, because it was not declared punishable by an express Statute; yet the Justices found, that <hi>eo ipso</hi> it was forbidden by a Statute: It was in so far a crime,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55274:20"/>
because Authority was thereby contemned, especially having been formerly declared a crime by the Civil Law. And it were unreasonable to think that Adultery, albeit it be not notour, should be a crime, albeit its penalty is not exprest by a Statute. And with us especially of old it was most ordinary to forbid crimes without express sanctions, as may be seen in several Acts of Parliament: Likeas by the Civil Law, extraordinary crimes were declared to be such, as were forbidden by Law, but where the penalty of the Law was not determined, from all which it appears, that the essence of a crime consists in its being forbidden, and not in having its punishment stated by an express Statute, though I wish it were otherwise.</p>
               <p>What Crimes are called Crimes of the Crown, or Pledges of the Crown, is treated largely <hi>Title Regalities:</hi> What Crimes are called <hi>Crimina excepta,</hi> is declared in the <hi>Title Treason.</hi>

               <p>BLasphemy is called in Law, <hi>divine laese Majesty,</hi> or <hi>Treason</hi>; and it is committed either by denying that of God which belongs to him, as one of His Attributes: or by attributing to him that which is absurd, and inconsistent with his Divine Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">II. These who swear by the Head, or Feet of God, are guilty of this Crime by the common Law, <hi>c.</hi> 51. <hi>si quis per dei capillum</hi> 22. <hi>quest.</hi> 1. <hi>videntur enim amplecti anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitarum haeresin quae membra deo tribuebat</hi>: By that Cannon they are also punishable, who delate not Blasphemers. Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it regularly what is spoken in passion be more moderately puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, yet it lessens not a Blasphemers Crime, <hi>Hostien. tit. de maled</hi> except he speak at such a rate, as clearly indicats that he is furious, or somewhat distracted: or if he recover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and testifie immediatly his contrition; thus <hi>Socin.</hi> relates <hi>consilio</hi> 102. that a Jew who had denied the Omnipotence of God, was absolved from a pursuit of Blasphemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he immediatly threw himself upon the ground, and kist
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55274:21"/>
it, and testified an extraordinar horrour, which Lawyers say, is an extraordinar punishment, and oftentimes exceeds the fear of Death. And there are some Lawyers, as <hi>Abbas &amp; felin ad cap.</hi> 13. <hi>de jure jur.</hi> who conclude, that either he who blasphems passionatly, is unlawfully imployed when he falls into that passion, as in playing at Cards, Drinking, &amp;c. and then his passion doth not lessen his Crime: But if he be honestly employed, as doing business, treating for his Friend, and then if he blaspheme only in passion, it lessens his guilt, and should mitigat his punishment: but why should passion excuse Blasphemy more then Murder; if it be not because the fall cannot be repaired by Repentance, a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing killed, but the fault in Blasphemy may be extinguished by Repentance.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Clarus</hi> thinks that these who Blaspheme in jest are to be less severly punished; and that Rusticity mitigats the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary punishment in this case; but <hi>Gothofredus</hi> is, as to the last, of a contrary opinion, because Rusticity excuses not from the knowledge of the Law of Nature, much less of God, but they may be reconciled thus, that open gross Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, is equally punishable in both; but not consequential and indirect Blasphemy, as if a Countrey-man should erre in the Persons of the Trinity, which some remot High-landers are so ignorant of, as not to know, those should rather be pitied then punished, except they add obstinacy to Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>vid. Cabal cas.</hi> 296.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The punishment of Blasphemy, is Death by the Law, <hi>Nov.</hi> 77. by the Canon Law: Publick repentance for the first fault, and the standing at the Church Door, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Mitre, or Paper Hat for a relapse.</p>
               <p n="5">V. By our Act 21. <hi>Sess.</hi> 1. <hi>Par.</hi> 1. <hi>C.</hi> 2. Blasphemy, Railers against God, or any of the Persons of the blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, shall be likewise punishable by death, if they obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly continue therein. From which Act it is observable, 1. That this Crime can only be tryed before the Justices;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55274:21"/>
and therefore not before the Lord of a Regality, though they have equal power, as hath been formerly observed. 2. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction is only excepted here, so Ignorance, Passion, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticity, or Railery excuses not; <hi>nam exceptio firmat regulam in non exceptis,</hi> and yet these may excuse from the ordinar punishment, in some circumstances; but are never defences against the relevancy. 3. It may be doubted, why the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying God, or any of the Persons of the Holy Trinity, is only punishable by death, if they continue obstinat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And yet the railing upon, or cursing God, or the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is simply punishable, without obstinacy: and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence seems to be, that cursing, or railing against God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed from Ignorance, but argues Malice: whereas the denying Gods Attributes, or the Trinity, may proceed from Ignorance.</p>
               <p>It may be doubted, if with us a person who should call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Son of God, or the Messias, could be punished as a blasphemer; and it is said that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> thought he could not: and therefore <hi>Iames Nailor</hi> was only scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this Crime. Yet I think he could be reached by our foresaid Act, as a person who rail'd upon God, and the Trinity. For to make our selves equal with them, is to rail against, and vilifie them.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Cursing of Parents, <hi>viz.</hi> Father, or Mother (but no others) is punishable by death, if they be past sixteen, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarly if they be below sixteen, and above punishable, (<hi>vid tit. parricid) Act</hi> 20. <hi>Par.</hi> 1. <hi>Sess.</hi> 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.</p>

               <p>HEresy is committed, when a Christian owns pertinatiously errors condemned by the Church. I said when <hi>a christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> own'd them, because Pagans and Mahumetans are not punish'd as Hereticks. <hi>Simancas de haereti. cap.</hi> 31. <hi>num.</hi> 3. for these are enemies to our faith in general, and erre not in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular points of it. I said who err'd pertinatiously, because such as erre ignorantly, or as having err'd perversly, do not pertinatiously adhere to their error; are not to be esteem'd haereticks. And this repentance is to be receiv'd any time, even after sentence to stop the execution. <hi>Carer. fol.</hi> 642. except they have relaps'd in their Heresy, for their second fall is not to be taken off by repentance, but though their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance secures them against death in the first fall, yet the are to be punished by perpetual Imprisonment. <hi>Igneus: in: l. ff. ad Sillan: Cook. hoc. tit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Though some make the adoration, and invocation of Spirits to be Heresy, yet others do more judiciously determine that if these devils be invocked to reveal things to come, then that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation is of the nature of Heresy, for that is to attribute omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to the Devil, which is one of Gods attributes, but if the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55274:23"/>
Devil be invocked for a particular end, or interest, such as that he may learn the invocker how to prevail with a mistriss, or how to gain a Princes favour, in these cases the invocker is not to be call'd a Heretick. <hi>Clarus. §.

               <p>By our Law Heresie was in the first instance try'd by the Church, and the Secular power did not meddle to condemn Hereticks, till they were first condemned by the Church, <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. <hi>Par.</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 28. In which it is ordain'd that the Bishops shall inquire into Heresie, and if they be found, that they be punished <hi>as the Law of the Holy Kirk requires: and if it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, that Secular power be called in support, and helping of holy Kirk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which Act it is observable, first, that the Kirk was Judge to Heresie, <hi>in prima instantia,</hi> during Popery: and this is conform to the opinion of almost all the Doctors, who think heresie <hi>crimen mere Ecclesiasticum, Alcia. in c.</hi> 1. <hi>num.</hi> 37. <hi>de offic. ord.</hi> but they justly conclude, as in this Statute, that the cognition belongs to the Church, and the punishment to the Secular Judge; and this Canonists calls <hi>tradere h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum brachio Seculari</hi>: and <hi>Clarus</hi> do's so far appropiat this try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the Ecclesiastical Judge, that he allows not so much the Secular Judge as the power of mitigating the punishment: and yet now the Justices are Judges competent, <hi>in prima instantia,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55274:23"/>
to such as hear or say Mass, but the reason is, because such are in general condemn'd by the Church, as guilty of Heresie, and yet the Popish Church are still Judges to the Protestants, thogh they be condemn'd in general as Hereticks; for the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks are try'd and condemn'd first by the Ecclesiastick Judge among them.</p>
               <p>The second thing remarkable in this Act, is, that amongst Ecclesiasticks, the Bishop is the first Judge in Heresie, which is also conform to the opinion of the Canonists, <hi>Clar. h. t. num.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>After the Reformation, there was a Confession of Faith made, and is set down by King <hi>Iames</hi> in his first Parliament, and Ratified <hi>Act</hi> 4. And they who profess not the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may not be a Judge (but this is not extended to Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Offices) Procurator, nor Member in any Court, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>pa.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9. and such Church-men as will not subscribe that Confession, are deprived, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Pa.</hi> 3. <hi>Act</hi> 46. and all such as refuse to subscribe, are to be repute Rebels and enemies to the King and his Government, <hi>Act</hi> 47.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Our Law fearing the pains taken by the Romish Church, more then the hazard arising from any else, have been more severe to these, than to others: And therefore the sayers or hearers of Mass, or such as are present thereat, are punished, 5. <hi>Act</hi> 1. <hi>P. I.</hi> 6. by confiscation of all their goods, moveable, and immoveable, and an arbitrary punishment of their persons for the first fault, banishment for the second fault, and death for the third fault. It may be doubted, if such as hear Mass for curiosity, may be thus punished, which is very ordinary abroad; and it seems that Heresie must be an act upon design, and yet this Law makes no distinction here. 2. It may be doubted, if by confiscation of Goods immoveable, be meant Land and Heritages, for they are call'd <hi>bona immobilia</hi>: and yet I rather incline to think that this should only extend to Heritable Bonds, and such like, but not to Lands: for Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage uses alwayes to be exprest distinctly, when the confiscati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55274:24"/>
of it is design'd: And if Heritage were forefaulted by the first fault, the punishment of the first would be greater then the punishment of the second fault, which is only banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Nor do's Heritage use to be exprest under the word Goods. But thereafter the sayers of Mass, and trafficking Papists, and the receivers of them against the King's Majesty, and Religion presently profess'd, are declared guilty of treason, <hi>Act</hi> 120. <hi>Pa.</hi> 12. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. But from these words, <hi>Against the King's Majesty, and Religion presently professed,</hi> it may be argu'd, that only such Jesuits, and others, as traffick to the prejudice of the King's Person, and Government; such as these who attempted the Gun-powder-treason, or to kill the King, or raise Rebellion, are only guilty of Treason, which seems the rather, because it were hard to make simple endeavouring to perswade others in meer matters of Religion to be treason. It is also observable from this Act, that such Jesuits, or traffick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Papists, or receipters of either, as satisfies the King and Kirk, are not to be guilty of treason; so that here treason is taken away by repentance: but it may be doubted, if though they be not guilty of treason, they may not be punish'd as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, conform to the above-cited 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. <hi>Pa. Ia.</hi> 6. for the Act only declares that the penalty foresaid shall not strike against them. And though (as I observed formerly) such as are guilty of Heresie, may by repentance save themselves from the punishment of death, yet are they still declar'd lyable to other punishments, such as perpetual imprisonment. But yet since our Law appoints no other punishments against Traffick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and receipters of Jesuits, but what is exprest here, and that the punishment here exprest is taken off in case of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; I rather believe that no punishment can be inflicted, in case of repentance, against these. And it is very reasonable, that meer errors in faith should be pardon'd by meer repentance; but as to the sayers and hearers of Mass, the former Act seems to stand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:55274:24"/>The Sellers also, and dispersers of erronious and Popish Books, are to be punish'd arbitrarily, by the Rubrick of the 25. Act 11. <hi>Pa. Ia.</hi> 6. but the statutory words run only against the home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bringers of such Books, the Books also are to be destroyed, and warrand is given to Magistrats of Burghs with a Minister, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tromet with them without hazard of spuilzie: But yet <hi>de pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctica,</hi> other Officers, such as Sheriffs, and Lords of Regality do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tromet with such Books, though they be not warranted. And though <hi>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius,</hi> and though the Act or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains a Minister to be present (which was certainly apointed that it might be known whether the Books were Popish) yet <hi>de praxi,</hi> Magistrats use to intromet without having a Minister present.</p>
               <p>I find no express punishment against other Hereticks in our Law, nor <hi>de praxi,</hi> are other Hereticks punish'd corporally; but whether they may not be punish'd conform to the common Law, and upon that general Act of <hi>K. Iames</hi> the First, I will not determine. As also, it is ordinary to banish only Jesuits, and sayers of Mass, as was done <hi>December</hi> 9. 1573. Mr <hi>Iohn Robertson</hi> was banished by order from the Council, he enacted himself under the pain of death never to return to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. The common Law, or Doctors have introduced many specialities in the tryal of this Crime, as first, that less clear probation is admitted in proving Heresie, then other Crimes, <hi>Clar. §. Haeresis, num.</hi> 20. And by an old Act of <hi>Sederunt, socii criminis,</hi> Women, and Pupills, are to be admitted with us, to prove hearing, and saying of Mass, else that Crime could not be proved. 2. A Heretick may be try'd after death, <hi>Alber. in rubr. h. t.</hi> which they say holds not only in a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick found guilty by probation (<hi>Haereticus verus</hi>) but in these who were cited to compear for Heresie, but compeared not, whom they call <hi>Haereticum praesumptum,</hi> but this holds not with us, no not in these who are guilty of Treason, as being Traffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quing Jesuits or Papists, for only Perduellion is by our Law to by try'd after death: But though the Heretick cannot be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd after death, yet his opinions may be condemn'd, as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, even after his death.</p>

               <p>SImony is the selling or buying any Church Office, <hi>cupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas emendi aut vendendi aliquid spirituale aut spirituali an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexum.</hi> So called from <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who offered to buy the Grace of God. And the Canonists teach, that it is Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to paction for any advantage in administrating the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but not to take reward after they have administrate them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In this Crime, infamous persons, whoors, and other witnesses, who are not <hi>habiles,</hi> or at least, who are not <hi>omni exceptione majores,</hi> are here receivable <hi>cap. sicut. de Simon.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is ordinarly carried on with much privacy, and clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine dealing, for which reason likewise, Lawyers conclude, that it may be proved by presumptions. It is <hi>crimen mere ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticum,</hi> and cannot be punished by Laicks, the punishment is depravation.</p>
               <p n="3">III. With us, Simony is once mentioned, and that is, <hi>Act</hi> 1. <hi>Par.</hi> 21. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. Wherein it is Statute, that if the Arch-Bishop, or Bishop deprehend that the person who is presented, hath made any Simonaical paction with the Patron; whereby he hath so hurt the Benefice, as that he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a sufficient maintenance for himself, and his successors, suitable to the value of the Benefice, that the Bishop may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse the presentation, and the Lords of Session are declared to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55274:25"/>
be Judges to any debates arising betwixt the Bishop, Patron, and Person upon that account. From which Act it is observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, 1. That it is implyed, and tacitly acknowledged, that Simony is a Crime by our Law, seing this is punished as a Branch thereof: and therefore I conceive, that what ever is punisht as Simony by the Canon Law, is punishable with us; and that a Minister, or other Benefic'd Person who bargains, or transacts with any to get them a Church, or Benefice, and gives or promises Money therefore, is punishable even by our Law. 2. That by this Act, a paction, whereby the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent reserves to himself, a competencie suitable to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is not Simony; and what this conpetencie is, is left arbitrary to the Judge, because it is not determined. 3. That this Crime is probable with us by Oath, because of its clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine convoyance, as said is. By the <hi>Stat. Eliz.</hi> 31. the person committing Simony, is declared uncapable to enjoy that Ecclesiastick Office.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Baratry is a kind of Simony, (<hi>Socinus reg.</hi> 55. <hi>Bald. part.</hi> 5. <hi>Consil.</hi> 21.) which with us is committed by these, who go to <hi>Rome</hi> to buy Benefices, without licences from the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, or their ordinar, <hi>I.</hi> 1. <hi>P.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 106. the pain of it is banishment, and never to bruik honour, or imployment for the future, within the Kingdom. This word comes from the <hi>Italian</hi> word Baratry, which signifies, corrupting of Judges; for our Law presumed, that these who went to <hi>Rome</hi> to get a Benefice, designed to get it by corruption. But though Baraters are called <hi>canpones beneficiorum</hi> by the Doctors; as <hi>Craig</hi> observes, <hi>pag.</hi> 371. Yet our Kings being of old very submissive to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> durst not directly at first, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid application to <hi>Rome</hi>; but did only forbid the carrying abroad Money out of the Kingdom; knowing that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be done there without Money: But thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Crime growing greater, the Parliament did by the 84. <hi>cap. P.</hi> 6. <hi>I.</hi> 3. forbid expresly the going to <hi>Rome,</hi> to purchase Benefices, or to be its collectors, under the pain
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55274:26"/>
of being demean'd as Traitors, and never to bruik Benefice, or use Worship; which is ratified by the 53. <hi>Act</hi> 5. <hi>P. I.</hi> 4. But though the punishment is that of Treason, by these Acts; yet by the 2. <hi>Act</hi> 1 <hi>P. I.</hi> 6. the punishment of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratry, is declared to be prescription, banishment, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to bruik Honour, nor Office within the Kingdom: and all applications to <hi>Rome</hi> are punishable as Baratry. This Act being after the Reformation. And by this last Act, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that Baratry may be punisht, either by the Justices, or Lords of Session. And upon this Act <hi>Iames</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> was exauctorated after the Reformation, for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. The Sons of Noble Men, and others passing to Schools beyond Sea's without the Kings Licence, are also said to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Baratry, <hi>I.</hi> 6. <hi>P.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 71. And the Council uses to ordain Noble Men, who breed their Children abroad, in Popish Schools, to bring them home under a great fine, as they did lately to the Lords of <hi>Mordingtoun,</hi> and <hi>Semple</hi> in <hi>anno.</hi> 1668. Before which Act also, all Laicks going out of the Kingdom, without consent of the King, or Licence from the Chancellor, committed Baratry. <hi>I.</hi> 4. <hi>P.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 53. And though <hi>Craig</hi> debates <hi>pag.</hi> 371. whether the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of this be the same with Treason, because it is said to be punishable as Treason, <hi>cap.</hi> 84. <hi>Pa.</hi> 6. <hi>I.</hi> 3. Yet it is clear, that this punishment is restricted by the Act 2. <hi>P.</hi> 1. <hi>I.</hi> 1. To the being declared incapable of Trust, and Banishment. This Prohibition of Laicks go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad, was first at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and is now in vigour at <hi>Naples,</hi> and many other places. And though it be now in desuetude, at least is not punisht, except in Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours: Yet I see no reason, why any should say, that this Crime takes only place in Vassals, holding immediatly of the King; for the Act is general. And yet Merchants are warranted by divers Acts of Parliament, to Traffique abroad, and so fall not under this Prohibition.</p>

               <p>UNhappy man retains in nothing so much a desire to be like his Maker, as in that he would be Supreme: and no wonder that this Crime should be incident to him in this laps'd condition, when his will is crooked, and his judgement blind; since the very Angels in their purity, and Man in his innocence, were tempted by it: so that since men have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected themselves to Government, we may easily conclude they found a great convenience in this submission; else they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offered so much violence to their own inclination. To So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and Laws, we owe every moment the preservation of our lives and fortunes, which nothing but Discipline does se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure: and without an intire submission, these Societies would be but Companies of Robbers, and Laws but meer toyes. How many dangers do Governours incurr? And by how many cares and fears are they disquieted? Wherefore it is most just, that those who govern, should be more secure against their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, then against their enemies, since they may be most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily wrong'd by those who live in their own bosome, and who have easie and open access to them. In other Crimes, one, or at most few, are wrong'd: whereas in rebellion, and <hi>Laese Majestie</hi> the whole Society is offended. And therefore it was most just, that those who design the ruine of the Common-wealth, or the Supreme Governour (which Crime we call Treason) should of all others be most severely punished.

Laesa Majestas</hi> was that whereby the Common-wealth was only wronged in a part, or by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; as to suffer the enemies of the Common-wealth to escape, or to conceal them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The 2. is, the Crime of Laese Majestie might have been pursued before the ordinary Judge <hi>in foro</hi>; but Perduellion could not be pursued but in the great Meetings of the People, <hi>à populo Romano, comitiis cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiatis in campo martio.</hi> Whence probably did arise the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treason by Parliaments with us. The 3. was, that the Crime of ordinary Laese Majestie was not punished with death, as Perduellion was, but with ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shment. The 4. was, that the ordinary Laese Majestie was punish'd by death, but Perduellion was punishable after death.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Treason may be with us divided in Perduellion, which we call High Treason, called by the <hi>English</hi> Law <hi>alta proditio,</hi> or rebellion, which is only with us a rising in Arms against the King; and in ordinary Treason and Laese Majestie, such as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55274:28"/>
to conceal, and not reveal Treason. And in Statutory Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which is not Treason properly of its own nature, but is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be so by a particular Statute, as is that of Murder un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der trust, Theft in Landed-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Perduellion in the Civil Law, is that which we call Rebellion in our Acts of Parliament, and it was so called <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagan. Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>qui sunt rebelles:</hi> And there it is Statute that <hi>rebelles &amp; infideles, imperii, qui quom docunque aliquid machinantur contra prosperitatem imperii.</hi> But I find not the word <hi>Rebellion</hi> used in the Law before that time. Yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Rebellion is in our Law taken for that which is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against the Kings Person, as in the 3. <hi>Act</hi> 1. <hi>Parl. K. Ia.</hi> 1. where it is said, No man shall rebell against the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son openly, nor notourly: But the Adverb there used <hi>openly and notourly</hi> in that, and the subsequent Acts, interprets suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the word rising against the Kings person, to be the same with us that is called Perduellion in the Civil Law, <hi>viz. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis hostili animo adversus principem, vel rempublicam anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus sit.</hi> To raise Arms against the King then, or to rise in open rebellion, is the first and highest degree of Treason, <hi>Ia.</hi> 2. <hi>Par.</hi> 6. <hi>Act</hi> 25. where it is called a raising in fear of War against the King; which Act comprehends all the kinds of Treason, like <hi>lex prima ff. ad L. Iul. Majest.</hi> And therefore I will follow that method. And though it be added in that Act, that it shall be Treason to rise in fear of War against his Person, or Majesty, of what ever age he be of, without the consent of the three Estates: Yet the consent of the three Estates will not defend the rising in Arms against the King, as was found in the case of the Marquiss of <hi>Argyle,</hi> being pursued upon this Act, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. for rising in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Marquiss of <hi>Montrose</hi> then the Kings Commissioner. For the Analysis of that Act must run run so, as that these words, <hi>Without consent of the three Estates,</hi> cannot be added to all the former treasons committed against the Kings Person, which are contained in that Act; For many things in that Act
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55274:28"/>
could not be justified by the Authority of the three Estates, for else the three Estates, and not the King, would be Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign: for they only are Soveraign, against whom Treason can be committed. But these words must only be taken as added to the last Crime prohibit, which is the assailing of the Castles, or Houses where the Kings Person is, which may be lawfully done by Authority of the Estates. For if the King being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry young, were taken prisoner, as our Kings oft-times were in their minority, it had been absurd to think, that these who went to assail, by the authority of the three Estates, that Castle where the Kings Person was, should be punish'd as Traitors, because of their obedience. But to suppress all pretext that might arise from that Act, it is declared by the 5: <hi>Act</hi> 1. <hi>Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>Sess. Ch.</hi> 2. That the King hath the only power of making War, and Peace. And that it shall be Treason for any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, less or more, upon any ground or pretext whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to rise, or continue in Arms, to maintain any Forts, Strengths, or Garisons, or to make Leagues or Treaties amongst themselves, or with forraign Princes, without his Majesties authority and approbation first interponed thereto: or to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any of these things under the pain of Treason. From which Act it is observable, 1. That the authority of the three Estates is not able to defend the rising in Arms, or making Leagues, seing that is declared to be his <hi>Majesties</hi> prerogative. 2. That the rising in defensive Arms is Treason by these words, <hi>upon what pretext soever.</hi> 3. That <hi>nudus conatus</hi> is in this case Treason by these words, <hi>to attempt.</hi> By the <hi>English</hi> Law the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring to raise a War is not Treason, except it be <hi>de facto</hi> rais'd; and with them, if three or four rise to throw down private Houses, or for any privat cause, it is but a Ryot; but if these three or four rise to reform Laws, or Religion, or upon any publick account, then it is accounted the Levying War against the King, <hi>Cook hoc tit. pag.</hi> 9. who likewise tells us, that if three conspire to Levy a War, it is Treason, if in the meer conspirers, if the rest thereafter Levyed actually a War, though

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55274:29"/>
he was not present; and in that sense only I would interpret the severe <hi>l.</hi> 19. <hi>Basil. h. t. propter cogitationem dignus est poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And the <hi>English</hi> Law requires still <hi>ouuert fait,</hi> an open deed. This rising in Arms is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called <hi>seditio regni vel exercitus Reg. Majest. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; cap.</hi> 11. <hi>ibid. ad tit. sedit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second species of Treason, is to commit Treason against the King's Person; and I find that this is the first kind of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son exprest in the former Act 25. <hi>Parl.</hi> 6. <hi>Ia.</hi> 2. whereby it is declared Treason to lay hands upon his person violently, what ever age he be of. Which words were added to clear that it was Treason to rebell even against his authority before he was Proclaimed, or Crowned. For the being Crowned or Proclaimed, is <hi>tantum declaratoria juris, sed nihil novi juris tribuit,</hi> it being the <hi>jus sanguinis,</hi> and succession of blood which makes him King. This species of Treason is likewise decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Act</hi> 3. and 4. <hi>Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. and in thir cases <hi>affectus sine ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu punitur:</hi> and thus the Master of <hi>Forbes</hi> was hurled through the Calsey, hanged and quartered, for imagining (this is an <hi>English</hi> term which signifies a design) to shoot K. <hi>Iames</hi> the 5th. 17. <hi>Iuly</hi> 1537. And the Countess of <hi>Glames</hi> was burnt for imagining to poyson the said King <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth, 17. <hi>Iuly</hi> 1537. By the Law of <hi>England,</hi> it is not Treason to kill a King out of possession, <hi>Cook pag.</hi> 9. But this seems unjust, if the King's title be clear, as our Kings was in exile. Though in dubious cases, such as betwixt the <hi>Bruce</hi> and <hi>Baliol,</hi> posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may difference the case. To kill the King's eldest Son, is with them Treason, 25. <hi>Stat. Edw.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>The third species of Treason is, the resetting any who hath committed Treason, or that supplies them in <hi>redde,</hi> help or counsel, <hi>cujus opera dolo malo hostes populi romani pecunia alia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve re adjuti erant:</hi> This is likewise discharged, <hi>Act.</hi> 97. <hi>Parl.</hi> 7. <hi>Ia.</hi> 5. Where all the Liedges are forbidden to reset, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, or maintain our Soveraign Lords Rebels, under pain of death: and if any disobey, to inforce (<hi>id est,</hi> to second the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55274:29"/>
King) against notour rebels, against his person, when they be required and commanded, they shall be punished by the King as favourers of such Rebels, except they have for them a reasonable excusation, <hi>Act</hi> 4. <hi>Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. From which Act it may be debated the refusing to assist against rebels that are not notour, or against Rebels that have not committed any other Treason then Perduellion, cannot infer with us the guilt of Treason. The Doctors here debate, whether a Wife re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting her own Husband, or a Father his Son, commits Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And albeit it may be alledged, that the relation of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and Subject, is the chiefest of all others, and so all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relations should cede to it; and rebellion against the State looses all relations, <hi>l. post liminium ff. de capt. &amp; postlimin:</hi> Yet the ordinary distinction is, that if any of these relations assist a Rebel with things that are necessary for him as a man, as meat, drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In that case they are not guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; But if they assist these relations with any thing that may be serviceable to them in their Treason, then they are guilty, <hi>Farin. quest.</hi> 113. <hi>num.</hi> 280. And <hi>Matheus hoc tit. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>num.</hi> 20. For albeit Rebels lose all the priviledge of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Law, yet they retain those priviledges that flow from the Law of Nations, and Nature, <hi>Bartol. ad l. amissum, ff. de capt, &amp; postlim.</hi> And thus <hi>Caesar</hi> pardoned <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Sons, and <hi>Tiberius Piso</hi>'s Son, albeit they followed their Fathers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were declared Traitors. But I find in our Law many decisions of this question, as in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1537. where <hi>Ianet Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas</hi> Lady <hi>Glames</hi> is convict and burnt, for fortifying and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>George Dowglas</hi> her Brethren, Traitors and Rebels. And 18. <hi>Iuly</hi> 1537. the Mr. of <hi>Glames</hi> is hang'd and drawn for concealing, and not revealing the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable design of his Mother to poyson the King: but the Countess of <hi>Errol</hi> being pursued for assisting the Earl of <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> at least for not revealing a Letter she had received from the Earl of <hi>Bothwels</hi> Lady, desiring assistance: It was alledged for the Lady, that the Countess of <hi>Bothwel</hi> was no Rebel,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55274:30"/>
though her Husband was, and that she had not consented. This was delay'd, <hi>Anno</hi> 1596.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The fourth species or point of Treason is, to stuff the Houses of them who are convict of Treason, and holds them against the King, or that stuffs any of their own Houses in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the King's Rebels, which is expressed also by the former Act: Yet I think this rather exegetick of the former point, then a separat point of Treason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for both these may be comprehended under help <hi>redde</hi> or counsel. <hi>Robert Stewart</hi> was hang'd for keeping out his House against the King: and the Earl of <hi>Orknay</hi> his Father was hang'd for hounding out his Son; the one the 5. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and the other the 1. of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> 1615. And <hi>Cunninghame</hi> of <hi>Tourlands</hi> was forefault and execute for assisting his Brother in keeping out the House of <hi>Cunninghame-head,</hi> 15. <hi>February,</hi> 1601. But yet when Houses are ordained to be rendered (being kept only for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat causes) under pain of Treason, though the party disobey, yet if he thereafter yeeld, that manner of keeping out Houses will not be punished as Treason, but Arbitrarily, as in <hi>Burgies</hi> case, 1668.</p>
               <p>The 2. of <hi>February,</hi> 2674. <hi>Mackloud</hi> of <hi>Assint</hi> was Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel'd for having Garrison'd his House of <hi>Arbreak,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating his <hi>Majesties</hi> Liedges, to the number of 400. men, under Pay and Collours. Against which it was alledg'd, that <hi>Assint</hi> here only fortified his House, and convocat his men to oppose the Earl of <hi>Seaforth,</hi> but not the King: Nor did he pretend any quarrel against the Government, but against pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat oppressions. To which it was answered, that this was expresly Treason by the 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> K. <hi>Ia.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. whereby it is Statute, that none rebel against the King's Person or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: And the House being here Garrison'd to defend against the Sheriff, who was comming to eject in his <hi>Majesties</hi> Name: To resist him, was to resist his <hi>Majesties</hi> Authority, and being Garrison'd in furtherance of Rebels and rebellion, it was Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by the 25. <hi>Act</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> K. <hi>Ia.</hi> 2. Likeas the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55274:30"/>
being of about 400. men, or thereby, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Captains, Ensigns, and other Officers. It was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Treason by the 75. <hi>Act</hi> 9. <hi>Parl. Q. M.</hi> and the 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. <hi>Parl. Ch.</hi> 2. The Justices did find the Garrisoning of the House not relevant to infer Treason, but only to infer the punishment of deforcement, whereupon the pursuers were forced to alledge of new, that they insisted against him for having Garrison'd his House after the publication of the Letters of Fire and Sword raised at the Pursuers instance against <hi>Assint,</hi> upon which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate they found that the Garrisoning and providing of the House after the publication of the Letters of Fire and Sword, was relevant to infer the punishment of Treason. Likeas they refused to sustain that Article wherein was Libel'd the raising of Men, and the disposing them in Companies under Collours, to be relevant, except it were alledg'd that they were an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men or upwards, and were under Collours, or Muster'd, or under weekly or daily pay. And that all this was done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the publication of the Letters of Fire and Sword: both which Interloquutors seem'd surprizing. For as to the first, it seem'd that the Garrisoning of any House against a Sheriff, or any Judge, is to Garrison it against the King' Authority; for a Sheriff doth represent the King in his Authority as much as any Souldier doth. And it is undenyable, that to Garrison Houses against the King's Souldiers, is Treason. Nor can it be denyed but that if this were allowed, no sentence could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive execution in <hi>Scotland,</hi> since every man might Garrison his House, and every man might deny that he Garrison'd his House against the King. And to put in a Garrison, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize them to defend the House, was so clearly a War-like action, that there was no place left to debate upon intentions. And though the defending Houses be ordinarily pursued as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, yet the formal Garrisoning of it imports much more. And the commission of Fire and Sword did not add any thing to the Crime committed, in Garrisoning the House: For the design of such Letters is only to warrand and command the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55274:31"/>
Liedges to prosecute them as Rebels; So that before the rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Letters they were accounted open and notorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, for Letters of Fire and Sword are only granted against such; and therefore <hi>Assint</hi> in Garrisoning his House to defend such, did expresly commit Treason against the 25. <hi>Act</hi> 6. <hi>Par. Ia.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The second part of the Interloquutor seem'd likewise very hard; for raising men in fear of War, and Listing them under Colours, or swearing them to Colours, is certainly <hi>exercitum comparare,</hi> though there were no commission of Fire or Sword; for the design of these Letters is not to make a Traitor, but to prosecute actual Rebels. And though this Army was not Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied to oppose immediatly the King's Government, yet even to raise an Army within the Kingdom, though no design could be proved, was Treason, for that was to usurp the King's power: But much more was this Criminal, when the Levy was made, upon the wicked design of opposing the execution of the King's Laws, to see which executed was the chief part of his Kingly Government. And it is clear by the foresaid 17 <hi>Act</hi> 6. <hi>Parl. Ia.</hi> 2. that it is Treason to make War against the King's Liedges against his forbidding, and if any do, the King is <hi>to gang upon them,</hi> with assistance of the hall Lands, and to punish them after the quality of their trespass.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The fifth point of Treason is to assail Castles, or places where the King resides, or is for the time, <hi>ibid.</hi> But this must be only understood to be Treason, if the assaulter know the King to be there, or if he be not, upon design to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue him, <hi>quo casu,</hi> he must be warranted by the Estates, as said is.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The sixth point of Treason is, to raise a fray in the King's Host or Army wilfully, <hi>Ia.</hi> 2. <hi>Parl.</hi> 12. <hi>Act</hi> 54. upon which Act the Mr. of <hi>Forbes</hi> was hanged for raising sedition in the King's Host at <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> 14. <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1537.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The seventh point of Treason is, to trouble any who kills a declared Traitor, which Act extends only to the Kin,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55274:31"/>
Friends, Fortifiers and Maintainers of these who are killed as Traitors; because it is presumeable that when these who are so related trouble the killer, it is presumeable the trouble arises upon that account. 2. These relations are discharged to bear the killers any grudge, or injure them by word or writ. <hi>Nota,</hi> It appears that the reason of this grudge needs not be proved, but is presumed presumption, <hi>juris &amp; de jure,</hi> for here <hi>lex prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumit &amp; disponit super praesumpto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">XI. The eighth point of Treason is, to impugn the dignity and authority of the three Estates: or to seek and procure the innovation and diminution of their power or authority, <hi>Act</hi> 130 <hi>Parl.</hi> 8. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. But this is to be understood of a direct impugn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their authority, as if one contended that Parliaments were not necessary, or that one of the three Estates may be turned out.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The ninth point of Treason is, to decline the King's Authority, or the Authority of his Council in any case, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spiritual or Temporal. And the King's Council are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be Judges competent to all causes whatsoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spiritual or Temporal, of what ever degree or function the defenders who are summoned shall be, <hi>Act</hi> 129. <hi>Parl.</hi> 8. <hi>K. Ia.</hi> 6. which Act was made to repress the insolencies of the Ministry, who about that time used constantly to decline the King's Authority in Ecclesiastick matters. Conform to which Act Mr. <hi>Andrew Crightoun</hi> was sentenced to be hanged and demain'd as Traitor, <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1610. And Mr. <hi>Iames Guthrie</hi> was execute in <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. for declining the King and his Councils jurisdiction at <hi>Striviling,</hi> when he was chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged for some words spoken in the Pulpit. From this Act it may be observed, that the King is in his own Person Judge competent over all Causes, and all Persons, even though the pursuit be at his own instance, which will appear both from the Rubrick and Statutory part of the Act, albeit <hi>regulariter</hi> no man can be Judge in his own cause.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:55274:32"/>XIII. The tenth point of Treason is, to conceal and not reveal Treason: But concealing in this case is not Treason, except the concealer could have proved it; for else he had by revealing and not proving made himself guilty of Treason. This concealing of Treason is by the <hi>English</hi> Law called mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prision of Treason, and is punish'd only by imprisonment du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life, forfeiting of goods, and of the profit of Lands during life. For this Crime the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> was execute by King <hi>Iames</hi> 6. for having conceal'd the design'd death of King <hi>Henry</hi> his Father: And it may be doubted whether concealing be Treason, where the King is not in a condition to repress or punish the Treason that is intended, for there the end of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing seems to cease, which is information in order to resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. It hath been likewise doubted, whether the not reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treason was punishable where the Treason was design'd by the Prince or Queen: But since they are likewise Subjects, and may commit Treason, therefore there can be no doubt but it is Treason in any others to conceal their treasonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The eleventh point of Treason is, to flee from his <hi>Majesty</hi> or his Lievtenant, which is not extended only to such as are sworn to Collours, but even to such as are warned to, and do attend the King's Host, <hi>vid. tit. the jurisdiction over Souldiers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">XV. The twelfth point of Treason is, to deny his <hi>Majesties</hi> having the only power of calling and dissolving of Parliaments, <hi>Act</hi> 3.1. <hi>Parl. Ch.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. By the common Law it is Treason to kill any of the Princes Counsellors, because they are a part of the Princes own body, <hi>l. quisquis C. h. t.</hi> But with us the pursuing or invading any of the Session, Secret Council, or any of his <hi>Majesties</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for doing his <hi>Majesties</hi> service, is only punishable by death, but not as Treason, <hi>Act</hi> 4. <hi>Parl.</hi> 16. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. By <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> here are meant only Officers of State, else it might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Messengers. And I heard it resolved that this Act
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55274:32"/>
extended not to such as invaded the Lyon. And these words, <hi>Any of the Session,</hi> are not extended to Advocats, Clerks, Macers, or any else besides the Lords, as is clear by the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the Act. But I think the quality adjected that they were invaded for doing his <hi>Majesties</hi> service, may be proved by circumstances and presumptions, as if a pursuer who had lost a Cause, should invade the next day a Lord who had voted against him. And the words, <hi>This being verified and tryed,</hi> import so much. But the <hi>Stat. Edward.</hi> 3. is much more clear, making it Treason to kill the Officers therein mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only, <hi>viz.</hi> Chancellor, Thesaurer, chief Justice of either Bench, or any Judge of either Bench sitting in Judgement on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and from this Statute of our Neighbouring Nation, we may argue that the killing none below a Lord of Session should infer the punishment of this Act. The killing a Member of Parliament is not in <hi>England</hi> Treason, though the Parliament be a higher Judicatory then any exprest in the Act. And <hi>Cook</hi> tells us that they allow not <hi>argumentum à fortiori</hi> to infer Crimes. And with us the killing a Member of Parliament would not infer death by this Act, since they fall under no qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification therein specified. In <hi>England killing Officers</hi> falls on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Statute, but with us, <hi>invading or pursuing them</hi> is death, though it take no effect. <hi>Quaritur,</hi> If to invade them when they are out of the Kingdom would fall under the Statute, since they are not under that character elsewhere. Or if he who invaded them during their being suspended, would fall under this Act, since during that time they retained the character, and the exercise is only suspended. And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by the Doctors that a Statute punishing such as invade Magistrats, is only to be extended to such Magistrats as are once admitted, but not to such as are only named or elected; for such Statutes are extended <hi>in gratiosis,</hi> yet they are restricted in such odious points as thir, <hi>Cabal. cas.</hi> 148.</p>

               <p n="17">XVII, The third branch of the division is Statutory Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which comprehends under it several other points of Treason, which because they relate to other Crimes, therefore I shall also refer the Reader to these Titles wherein these Crimes are principally treated of. But it will appear by these Acts, that these Crimes are not declared to be Treason, but only to be punishable as Treason, and therefore these Statutory Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have not at all the other priviledges competent to Treason, as that they may be proved by Women, <hi>&amp; alios testes inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> or that he who accuses in these will commit Treason, if he prove not his accusation. Thus wilful Fire raising is Treason, <hi>Ia.</hi> 5. <hi>Parl.</hi> 3. <hi>cap. ultimo.</hi> Theft in Landed-men is Treason, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 50. <hi>vid. tit.</hi> Theft, Murder under trust is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 51. <hi>vid. tit.</hi> Murder, sayers of Mass, Jesuits, trafficking Papists and their resetters, commit Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 120. <hi>vid. tit.

Poyson.</hi> Thieves who take leill men upon Bond to re-enter them, commit treason, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. But though this Act speaks generally of the taking of any <hi>Scottish-man,</hi> yet it may clearly appear by the narrative, and the whole strain of the Act, that the same strikes only against such Thieves as kept correspondence with the <hi>English,</hi> and took <hi>Scottish-men</hi> prisoners into <hi>England.</hi> But custom hath interpret this other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, for <hi>Duncan Macgrigor</hi> was 15. <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1643. convict and hang'd as a traitor, for arte and part of taking <hi>Iames Anderson</hi> and <hi>Iohn Mackie,</hi> and the taking of Captain <hi>Cairns</hi> found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant as an Article of Treason against <hi>Assint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To usurp any Prelats place after his decease, is likewise trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Ia.</hi> 5. <hi>Parl.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 125.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. This Crime hath in it many specialities; wherein it differs from other Crimes: As first; He who accuses any man for treason, doth incur the pain of treason, if the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be acquit, which is occasioned (as the Act bears) because
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55274:33"/>
of the odiousness of treason. But since the the Act sayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly that this shall take place where <hi>the party calumniat is called, accused, and quit of the Crime of Treason</hi>; therefore it may be inferred, that though the pursuer raise Summonds of treason, and should pass from the same before the Pannel go to the knowledge of an Inquest, that <hi>eo casu,</hi> though the pursuer might be punished <hi>poena extraordinaria,</hi> yet he could not be punished as a traitor. It may be likewise doubted, if this holds in Statutory T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eason, as Theft in Landed men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And since the reason inductive of that Act is the odiousness of treason, it would appear that this rigid Law should not take place in these points of treason, which are not so odious of their own nature.</p>
               <p>Another speciality in treason is, that it can only be tryed by the Justices, <hi>Reg. Maj. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>e.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. and that because of the Kings immediat interest, since it is not presumable that the Fis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal in Inferiour Courts would be as careful as his <hi>Majesties</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat, who cannot appear there, and because of the intricacies and great consequence of that Crime: but it may be doubted whether Lords of Regality, or Subjects having a Justitiary, are Judges competent to Treason, and it seems not, for the reasons foresaid.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. The second priviledge of treason is, that those who are pursued for treason should be immediatly committed to prison, and their goods should be put under sicker Burrows, <hi>id est</hi> Caution, under which they must remain ay and while they suffer an Assize, <hi>Ia.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 49. and <hi>Reg. Maj. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1. But it seems very hard in our Law, that there is no time prescribed for the pursuer to insist, but that the person suspect may be kept in prison for a long time, though he be very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and offer himself to a tryal; whereby the most innocent of Subjects may be ruined in their Fortunes and Families, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any just cause. And yet upon the other hand, it were hard that Traitors should be allow'd to go abroad, because probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be presently had, which it may be the traitor hath abstracted, or that the King or State should be forc'd to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover too soon by a pursuit, a treason, which he is bound in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55274:34"/>
policy to cover for some time. And as in War, so in Treason (which is as dangerous) many things are allow'd to be done which are not otherwise regular, the interest of all preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the interest of any one, or a few.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. The third speciality in treason, is, that all Charges of treason should be execute by Heraulds and Pursevants, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coats of Arms, and by Macers, and that for the greater solemnity, else these Charges are declared null, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 125. Likeas, the ordinary custome is to execute Summonds of treason after that manner. But it was found upon the 5. of <hi>December</hi> 1666. in the Action intented at his <hi>Majesties</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocats instance against <hi>Mackulloch</hi> and others, that this Act did only relate to Summonds of treason, or any other Charges, wherein men are ordain'd to obey, under pain of Treason. But that inditements of treason given to men who are in prison, may be execute by ordinary Messengers: And yet the Act sayes, that all Executions given otherwise then is appointed by that Act, shall be null.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. Women, and others, may be Witnesses in this Crime, though in other Crimes they cannot: and one Witness is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient here, and <hi>famosi &amp; impuberes</hi> of what ever age, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable as Witnesses, by an express Act of the <hi>Sederunt</hi> of Lords of Session, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1591. Likeas, <hi>Cod. fab. hoc tit. def.</hi> 4. sayes, <hi>est privilegium criminis Laese Majestatis ut faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius probetur.</hi> And that it may be proved <hi>per famosos &amp; so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cios criminis.</hi> And that it was decided in <hi>Savoy,</hi> 1591. <hi>vid. Pappon. lib.</hi> 24. <hi>tit.</hi> 2. But the <hi>English</hi> do most justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that because the punishment is severe in treason, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to be proved by manifest and direct proof, and not by presumptions, or strains of wit, <hi>Cook pag.</hi> 12. And that two witnesses are necessary for proving treason, he proves most learnedly, <hi>pag.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>By the Civil Law, <hi>famosi, &amp; mulieres</hi> were admitted to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse in this Crime, though not in any other Crime, <hi>l.</hi> 7, and 8. <hi>ff. ad l. jul. maj.</hi> But this last priviledge should only hold
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55274:34"/>
in Perduellion, <hi>Mascard. de prob. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>conclu.</hi> 462. and not in Statutory Treason. And that this should hold in no spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of treason, was <hi>Math.</hi> opinion, <hi>pa.</hi> 372. because <hi>per l. ult. cod. de prob. in capitalibus causis Idoniis testibus atque ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertissimis documentis opus esse dicitur nec excipitur crimen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestatis.</hi> Neither doth it follow, that because persons who are not admitted in other Crimes, are admitted to be accusers in this, that therefore these who are unfit to be Witnesses in other Crimes, should be admitted in this: for there is little hazard in an unfit accuser, but there is great hazard in unfit Witnesses. And this I think much more suitable to reason then the former Statute; for the greater the hazard is, the probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be so much the clearer. And though <hi>testes inhabiles</hi> may be received, or one Witness may prove sufficiently for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Pannel to the torture, (which is all that can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd from that Act of <hi>Sederunt,</hi> which sayes only that they ought to be received Witnesses, but sayes not, that they ought to be received in all cases). Yet it were against all reason that any condemnatory verdict or sentence could be founded upon such probation.</p>
               <p>I find also by the Law of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that <hi>socii criminis, &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosi,</hi> are admitted to be Witnesses; not in treason generally, but in Perduellion. And that Act is by their Lawyers restricted so, that the Pannel cannot be condemned to death or forfeiture upon such depositions, but only to torture: Nor will he be tortured upon such depositions, except the deponent be upon Oath, and abide the torture also at his deposition, <hi>Cod. fab. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>tit.</hi> 5. All which seems most reasonable, but yet it seems that no man is to be repute <hi>socius criminis,</hi> but he who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict, or hath confess'd the Crime, and dilates others; for else a man being accused for treason, cannot alledge that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses led against him were <hi>socii criminis,</hi> for that were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess himself to be guilty: for no man can be <hi>socius criminis</hi> to the Pannel, except the Pannel be guilty himself, and was <hi>socius</hi> to the witness therein <hi>nam relata se mutuo ponunt.</hi> And this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55274:35"/>
was so found in <hi>Assint</hi>'s Process, but it was there alledg'd, that though <hi>socius criminis</hi> could not be received for the Pannel, yet he could be received against him: And that was the sense of the Doctors, who exclude <hi>socius criminis</hi> from being a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in treason. But as to this, I doubt very much, for if a person confessed his accession, it seems unjust that he could condemn others, being infamous himself. And yet in open treasons, as rising in Arms, it seems necessary to receive such as were in Arms; for none else can come near an Army of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and so the Crime must be proved by these, or by none.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. The fifth priviledge is, that treason is not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht by death in all cases, as other Crimes are. But that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son committed against the K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngs Person, or Common-wealth, may be inquired into after death, and the committers Heir may be forefault therefore, <hi>Ia.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 69. which Act bearing to be founded upon the Civil Law; these general words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, <hi>against the Kings Person, or Common-weal,</hi> must only be extended against such treasons, as were by the Civil Law accounted Perduellion: And therefore it is most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to know the Civil Law in this case, and what was therein called Perduellion. Seing albeit all treasons may by an natural interpretation be said to be committed against the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or Common-wealth, yet the Civil Law declared only that species of the Crime of treason, which they called Perdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellion to be punishable after death, <hi>l. ult. ff. ad l. jul. Maj. plane non quisquis legis juliae Majestatis reus, est in eadem conditione: Sed qui Perduellionis reus est, hostili animo adversus rem publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam, vel principem animatus.</hi> So that the infallible mark of Perduellion is <hi>hostilis animus,</hi> a design of raising Arms. And therefore we may conclude that not only Statutory Treasons are extinguished by death, but that even simple concealing, and not revealing, or a malicious design to poyson the King, and such other treasons as shew not a desire of rising in Arms, are likewise extinguish'd by death. And yet the <hi>Basil. l.</hi> 12.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55274:35"/>
                  <hi>h. t.</hi> say, that all the heads of treason are extinguisht by death, <hi>excepto capite proditionis, &amp; insidiarum contra principem,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Albeit the bones of the Defunct Traitor are ordinarily taken up, and brought to the Pannel in pursuits of this nature, as was done in the forefaultur of the Laird of <hi>Restal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig</hi>; yet this is not necessary, but it is necessary in pursuits of this nature, that the Defuncts nearest of Kin be called, as Defenders, for their interest; both because their Estates are to be taken from them by their forefaultur, and to the end they may defend the Defunct, and object both against the relevan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Libell, and the hability of the Witnesses: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Basilicks</hi> add very well, that <hi>haereditas publicatur, nisi crimen ab haeredibus purgetur,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>It may be doubted, whether since the forefaulting after death, is founded upon the Civil Law, and that the former Act bears expresly, that these pursuits may be intended conform to the common Law, if these pursuits should not prescrive with us in five years, as they do by the common Law: and it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear they should, since these pursuits are intented conform to the common Law, and <hi>quem sequitur commodum eum d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>The sixth priviledge of Treason is, that the Kings Advocat is to be the last Speaker to the Assize in Perduellion, though in other cases the Pannel's Advocats are to be last Speakers; And the last Speaker has much advantage, for he may answer all is alledg'd by the opponent, <hi>Art.</hi> 11. <hi>Regulations</hi> 1670.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. The last priviledge of Treason is, that albeit of old no persons could be condemned in absence by the Justices; yet the Parliament still could have proceeded against Traitors in absence. And now by a late Act of Parliament, it is found, that in the case of Perduellion, and of treasonable rising in Arms against the Kings Authority, the Justices may proceed to the receiving of probation, and pronouncing of sentence
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55274:36"/>
even in absence of the Party: Which being first propounded as a Querie to the Council, they remitted the same to the Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to whom his <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat gave in the following Reasons, and Queries, upon the 15. <hi>August</hi> 1667. Whether or not a person guilty of high Treason may be pursued before the Justices, albeit they be absent and contumacious? So that the Justice upon citation, and sufficient probation and evidence, may pronounce Sentence and Doom of forefaultur, if the Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be proved. The reason of scruple is, that Processes of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faultur are not so frequent; and that in other ordinary Crimes, the defenders, if they do not appear, are declared Fugitives, and that the following reasons appears to be strong and relevant for the affirmative, 1. By the common Law, albeit a party absent cannot be condemned for a Crime, yet in Treason which is <hi>crimen exceptum:</hi> This is a speciality, that absents may be proceeded against, and sentenced. 2. By the first Act of King <hi>Iames</hi> the 5th. his 6. Parliament, it is declared, that the King hath good cause and action to pursue all Summonds of Treason committed against his Person and Common-wealth, conform to the common Law, and good equity and reason, notwithstanding there be no special Law, Act, or provision made thereupon. And therefore seing by the common Law, persons guilty of Laese Majestie may be proceeded against, and sentenc'd, though they be absent. It appears that there is the same reason why the Justices should proceed against, and sentence persons guilty of Treason, though absent, and that he is sufficiently warranted by the said Act so to do. 3. It is inconsistent with Law, Equity and Reason, that a person guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Treason should be in a better case, and his <hi>Majesty</hi> in a worse, by the contumacy of a Traitor, the same being an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (if any can be added) to so high a Crime; and that he should have impunity, and his <hi>Majesty</hi> prejudged of the casuality arising to him by his forefaultur. 4. The Parliament is in use to proceed and pronounce doom of forefaultur, though the party be absent: and in so doing they do not proceed in and by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55274:36"/>
a legislative power, but as the Supreme Judges: and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being the fountain of Justice, what is just before them, is just and warrantable before other Judicatories in the like cases. 5. By the above-mentioned Act of Parliament, it is Statute, that Summonds and Process of Treason may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and pursued after the death of the Delinquents, either his Memory, or Estate, delating the one, and forefaulting the other, whereupon sentence may follow to the effect fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said. And therefore, seing sentence may follow when the Delinquent cannot be present, and is not in beeing, it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all reason, that when they are wilfully and contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously absent, they should not be proceeded against, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced, if they be guilty. And it were unjust that his <hi>Majesty</hi> should call a Parliament for punishing and forefaulting of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, being absent, or that he should wait till they die; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seing in the <hi>interim</hi> the probation may perish, by decease of the Witnesses.</p>

But the Parliament retain still a power cumulative with the Justices; and when Processes of Treason are intented before them, they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55274:37"/>
may proceed as formerly, and thought this last Act a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of all our Law. Nor is it imaginable but that if it had been safe, that that priviledge would had been granted to his <hi>Majesty</hi> formerly: And that it is contrary to the Civil Law, is clear, <hi>per l.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; l. penult ff. de requirendis reis, nam annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur bona, &amp; si reus post anum non comparuerit, &amp; satis dede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit de stando; non recuperabit bona, non tamen de delicto habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur pro confesso. Divi fratres rescripserunt, l.</hi> 1. <hi>ne quis absens puniatur, &amp; hoc jure utimur, ne absens damnetur.</hi> And that no probation can be received against absents in Treason, is clear by <hi>Matheus hoc tit.</hi> and albeit <hi>per extrav. constitutionem Hen.</hi> 7. It is ordained, that probation may be received in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, yet this is repute no part of the Civil Law, and is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by no Nation, and by that extravagant constitution this priviledge is allowed to all species of Treason, which we find to be unjust. And albeit Treason may be in some cases puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed after death, yet it cannot be from that inferred, that it may be punished in absence, since after death the malice of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just pursuers ordinarily ceases, and the hazard of Death is then over: so that the event of the pursuit is not so terrible, nor dangerous. And in these Processes, the nearest of Kin are called, who may propound against both relevancy and probation, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was competent to the Defunct. Whereas when a person is pursued in absence for Treason, no man can in our Law be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to propound any thing in his defence. And albeit it seem unreasonable that a person guilty of Treason should be in a better condition by his contumacy, then if he compeared. To this it may be answered, that this would prove too much, for this absurdity may be as well press'd in absents for all other Crimes, and against such as are absents in all the several indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Treason; and yet the Justices are never allow'd even by the late Act to proceed to sentence against any, but such as are pursued for rising in Arms against the King. But the true answer to this seeming absurdity, is, that the Law is not so inhumane, as to punish equally presum'd and real guilt:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55274:37"/>
what may be a Crime, as what is found one. And it hath been oft found, that men have been absent, rather out of fear of a prevailing Faction, or corrupt Witnesses, or by inadvertence, or not being truly cited, or by being violently detained, then out of a consciousness of guilt; yet since so judicious a person proposed this overture, and since Council, Session, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament have fortified it by their Authority, I submit my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their determinations.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. It is ordinary for his <hi>Majesty,</hi> to command, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, by privat warrands, under all highest pains, or as you shall be answerable to us. And the certification here being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definit, it may be doubted what the punishment may be, in case of contravention. And 1. It would appear that the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veeners cannot be punish'd as guilty of Treason, for only Laws can make Traitors in this Kingdom. 2. It seems that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a contempt of the chief and Supreme Magistrat, it may be punish'd arbitrarily; if the command be lawful, and in case of importance, since even inferiour Judges may punish such as contemn or disobey them, in what is necessary for their juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Likeas Lawyers are of opinion, that <hi>in obediens prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepto superioris sub paena indignationis, est arbitrarie puniendus, Cabal. casu</hi> 30. <hi>Bald. in l. legis virtus, ff. de legib. Menoch. cas.</hi> 365. But in that case, they determine that the arbitrary punishment cannot extend to death. And though some Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors are of opinion, that commissions are to be punish'd in this case more severely then omissions, yet I conceive some omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may infer greater contempt, and be more dangerous then commissions. Nor allow I the distinction used by <hi>Lucas de penna, ad l.</hi> 1. <hi>C. ut dignit. ord. servet.</hi> who sayes, that if the contempt be of dangerous consequence, as if one being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to take care of a Castle, or to stop the passage of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that then the contempt is to be severely punish'd by death: but if the contempt be of things indifferent, or mean, then the contempt is only punishable arbitrarily. And yet he is too se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in making it to be punishable by death, except the person
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55274:38"/>
commanded were a Souldier, or one who were obliged by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of his Office to obey under that peril. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would rather distinguish betwixt such commands as use to be punish'd by death, if contemn'd, such as Military commands; and in these, the contempt may be punish'd by death, for Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom comes in place of Law, <hi>&amp; sibi imputet,</hi> who hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken such an employment as requires such obedience. But if the King should command any Country Gentle-man, or Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, to fortifie, or keep a Castle under all highest pains, it is probable, that their omission could not be punish'd by death, and is only punishable by losing of the Princes favour, <hi>&amp; quod Princeps non exhibebit se gratiosum:</hi> which <hi>Bartol</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makes the punishment of that disobedience in all cases, <hi>ad extrav. qui sunt rebelles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">XXV. The punishment of Laese Majestie was death, <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>C. h. t. animae omissio,</hi> as <hi>Iustinian</hi> calls it in his Institutions, together with the Confiscation of all his Estate that lyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Territories of him against whom the Treason is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but is not extended to his Estate lying else-where, <hi>C.</hi> 2. <hi>de constil. in</hi> 6.

               <p>With us the punishment of Treason is death, and Confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation likewise of all the Traitors Estate, whether Heretable, or Moveable, Feudal, or Allodial. And the solemnity used in Parliament at the pronouncing of such sentences are, that the Pannel receives his sentence kneeling, and that after the Doom of the forefaulter is pronounced against him, the Lyon and his Brethren Heraulds come in in their formalities, and tear his Coat of Arms at the Throne, and thereafter hang up his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curchion revers'd upon the Cross: Which had its rise from the old <hi>Roman</hi> customs, for as <hi>Tacit,</hi> observes, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>deterrere omnes à simili culpa volebant, non poenae modo, sed ignominiae m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another speciality introduced in the punishment of Perduel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, by the common Law, was, that <hi>memoria damnabatur,</hi> and that his Children were declared uncapable to bruik any Estate or Office; which the Emperours <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, l.</hi> 5. <hi>c. ad l. Iul. Maj.</hi> calls a mitigation of the punishment due to Children, who as they say should have died for their Fathers Crime. But this is so unjust, that no Nation doth now use it, as <hi>Matheus</hi> observes, <hi>p.</hi> 352. And it is expresly against <hi>l. Crimen ff. de poenis,</hi> and the Scripture, <hi>Deut. Chap.</hi> 24. <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. And the opinion of <hi>Plato, lib.</hi> 9. <hi>de legibus.</hi> And therefore <hi>Amazias</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14.5, 6. would not kill such as were the Children of those who kill'd his Father, because (as is exprest there) <hi>The Father shall not be put to death for the Children, nor the Children for the Fathers.</hi> And <hi>Achan</hi>'s pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, <hi>Ioshua</hi> 7.14. wherein he and his sons and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were stoned to death, and burned for his own Crime is no concluding argument against this opinion, since that was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expresly upon Gods revealed will, who can dispense with, or alter the Laws of Nature: but it is very probable that the reason of that severe sentence was, that God knew the whole Family to be involved in the guilt. And it is very probable that they were resetters of the theft, or conscious to it, since the stollen goods were taken out of the Tent were they were. And I remember that our Parliament in <hi>Anno</hi> 1661. having adjected to the Marquiss of <hi>Argyles</hi> Sentence the dishabilitation of his Children, his <hi>Majesty</hi> did expresly command it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinded in the last Session of that Parliament; in which the Children were rendered capable to bruik Estates or Honours, as the other Subjects were. I know it is the opinion of some Lawyers, such as <hi>Budeus,</hi> that this <hi>l.</hi> 5. was thereafter abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:55274:39"/>
is only introduced in favours of the Friends, but not of the Children: Yet it is more just to think that by this Law the former was abrogat, even <hi>quo ad</hi> Children, since the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son given in that Law is general, <hi>Sancimus ibi esse poenam ubi &amp; noxia est propinquos, notos, familiares procul à calumnia submovemus quos reos sceleris societas non facit. Nec enim ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitas, vel amicitia nefarium crimen admittunt. Peccata igitur suos teneant auctores: nec ulterius progrediatur metus, quam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periatur delictum. Hoc singulis quibusque judicibus intimetur.</hi> Nor can it be concluded, that it is clear that the former Law was not abrogat by that Law, since <hi>l. pen. C. Theod. de bon. proscrip.</hi> the same Emperour <hi>Honorius</hi> leaves no Estate to the Children of Traitors; for it does not follow, that because they are to succeed to no Estate of the Traitors, that therefore they should be uncapable to gain, or to succeed to any other Estate. But after all these Laws the <hi>Basil. l.</hi> 5. <hi>h. t.</hi> extends the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Another punishment of Perduellion by the Canon Law, <hi>cap. felicis de paenis in</hi> 6. is, that the Traitors House shall be thrown down, and not re-built, which is not in observance amongst us. Nor was it lawful to mourn for him when dead, or to give him a publick Burial, <hi>l.</hi> 11. <hi>ff. de his qui not. &amp; l.</hi> 35. <hi>ff. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig.</hi> And with us it is ordinary for the friends of such as are condemned for Treason, to get a warrand for attending them in mourning upon the Scaffold. But I do not find that the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him in mourning, or the burying him, was ever account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Crime in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find that some Lawyers believe, that the fear of losing an Estate excuses him who has complyed with the Enemies of his Prince, <hi>notae ad Clar. h. t. num.</hi> 9. <hi>Imol. Consil.</hi> 34. But this was expresly repelled in the Marquiss of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Process 1661. But certainly the fear of life might excuse; for there can be no Crime where there is not a voluntar act, and nothing can be voluntar which is forc'd.</p>
               <p>Though repentance is no relevant defence against a ditty of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55274:39"/>
Treason, especially where there is once a deed of Treason com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; yet such is the clemency of Princes, that by the <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Basil. h. t.</hi> I find that he who in the beginning of a conspiracy reveals, is to be rewarded, but he who after the Treason is committed reveals the Authors, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is only to be pardoned.</p>
               <p>Sometimes likewise to punish the atrociousness of this Crime, the very Parents are banish'd, and all the Family are ordain'd to change their name; as was done <hi>Ravillac</hi>'s case by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Paris</hi>: for though these could not be corporeally punish'd, yet the State may justly deny their protection, and Countrey, to any who may be presum'd will bear revenge, or probably were infected with their Friends Crime.</p>
               <p>But though these punishments may be inflicted after proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet if the Pannel was only denounced for not appearing in Tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, is Sedition properly, and thus Treason and Sedition properly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55274:40"/>
differ, though oftentimes Sedition may be accompanied with qualities which may raise it to Treason.

               </p>
               <p>I find not Sedition to be expresly declared Treason with us in any case; for by the 78. <hi>Act Ia.</hi> 2. <hi>Parl.</hi> 14. <hi>the raising of Commons in hindering the common Law</hi> (which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sedition) or the making of Leagues and Bonds within Burgh, without the command of their Head Officer, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be punishable by Confiscation of Moveables, and that their lives shall be in the King's will. From which Act it is likewise to be observed, that the command of the Magistrate doth in things belonging to his Office excuse the Liedges, and therefore it may be asserted that the Liedges rising in obedience to commands of the Sheriff, or Lord of Regality, are not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable, except it was clearly palpable to them that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection was in contempt of his <hi>Majesties</hi> Authority, which appears to be the meaning of the foresaid <hi>l. si quis contra evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentissimam jussionem,</hi> &amp;c. And seing the Liedges are oblidged to obey their Magistrats, and to rise when he calls them, as is evident by many Acts of Parliament, and without this allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance his <hi>Majesty</hi> could not be served: it were hard to punish them for that obedience, which would be punishable if they refused it.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The convocating the Liedges in Bands of Men of War, for daily, or monethly wages, without special licence, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared likewise to be punishable by death, by the 75. <hi>Act</hi> 9. <hi>Parl.

1. <hi>Ses. Charl.</hi> 2. And yet it may be contended that such Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as these are punishable as Treason, since the making of Bonds and Leagues amongst the Liedges is declared by the foresaid 4. Act to be one of his <hi>Majesties</hi> Royal Prerogatives. And sure it is Treason for any of his <hi>Majesties</hi> Liedges to usurp his royal prerogative. But sure it is, that to convocat the Liedges simply without Bonds or Leagues, can no wayes be accounted Treason, much less the being present as such Convocations, though in Arms: And thus it was found in the case of a Baxter who was pursued as guilty of the Convocation raised against the Customers in <hi>Anno</hi> 1665. That naked assistance at such meetings <hi>per se</hi> was not relevant to infer death, but only an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary punishment, as is clear by the 5. <hi>Act</hi> 1. <hi>Parl. Ia.</hi> 1. whereby all men are forbidden to travel with more not they can sustain, and if they do, they may be put under sicker Burrows till the King declare his will.

               <p n="1">1. POyson is by our Law declared to be punishable as the Crime of Treason, but it is not declared Treason, <hi>Act</hi> 31.7. <hi>Parl. Ia.</hi> 2. By which all persons are discharged to bring home Poyson for any use by which any Christian man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may take bodily harm, and that under the pain of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and that being convict, they shall forefault to the King Life, Land, and Goods; but notwithstanding of these words, <hi>for any manner or use,</hi> Apothecaries and others do daily bring home Poyson. But to this it may be answer'd, that they bring the same home, not as Poyson, but as Druggs, and the Law presumes that the Liedges are in no hazard of that Poyson which is in the hands of skilful men. This was likewise the opinion of the Doctors <hi>Gothofred prax. criminal. §. vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi> But notwithstanding that the buying or giving of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is declared Treason by the Law, yet I find no instances in the Journal Books where any have been convict as Traitors upon this account: But on the contrary, <hi>Iohn Dick</hi> for poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning his Brother and Sister is only ordained to be execute,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55274:42"/>
but is not forefault, <hi>ult. March</hi> 1649. If any Stranger bring home Poyson any manner of way, it is provided by the 32. Act of that Parliament, that they shall be punished the same manner of way, and that no remission or safe conduct shall be profitable to them.</p>
               <p>The reason of this severity proceeds from the abominable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that Crime, <hi>plus est enim hominem veneno necare quam gladio dicit gloss. in §. ead. l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Those who give Poyson were by the Civil Law called <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narii</hi> and they were only punished capitally, <hi>per l.

               <p>The buying of Poyson, though with a design to kill there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, if murder do not actually ensue, is not thought capital by the Doctors, but only punishable <hi>paena extraordinaria, Gotho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred. prax. criminal. §. venenum num.</hi> 21. Yet with us the very buying is by this Act of Parliament capital.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Whether to give Druggs that are not of their own nature poysonable too frequently, and contrary to the nature of the disease, be punishable by this Law, or as murder, or be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at all, was debated in <hi>Kennedies</hi> case, the 8. of <hi>February</hi> 1676. and that it was punishable was contended, because <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenum</hi> or <hi>pharmacon</hi> was in Law <hi>nomen generis,</hi> and exprest good Druggs as well as ill, <hi>l. venenum ff. de verb. sig.</hi> And the best of Druggs, given in great excess, is Poyson; for Poyson consists in excess of quantity as well as quality, and whatever overpowers our nature is poysonable to us. And since the one may kill as well as the other, and that killing is that which is punish'd, the Law should punish the one as well as the other.

And whatever may be said where the design was not known, yet here the design of killing was communicated to <hi>Kennedie.</hi> And it is proved that he refused to give meer poyson, left the external marks after death should discover that Poyson was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but that it was safer to give constant purgations to be thrown in by his Servant in his drink upon all occasions, and that without his knowledge, and contrary to the nature of his disease, he having a Flux: All which circumstances shew a design to kill.

Nor needs it be proved that the Defunct died of this Poyson, for even one who got true Poyson might have died of other diseases, but it is sufficiently proved, that after the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thir Purgatives, he died the next morning of such a loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as made his Bed to swim. And as this is like the natural product, so <hi>presumitur contra versantem in illicito,</hi> especially all this design of Murder being to conceal the Servants theft, in which this Apothecary was a sharer.</p>
               <p n="3">III. From these words of the Act, <hi>through the which any Christian man or woman may take bodily harm,</hi> it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that 1. The poysoning of a Jew or Pagan falls not under this Act, though it may be pursued as Murder: And it may be doubted whether the poysoning of an Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55274:43"/>
person can fall under this Act, since they are not Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: But to prevent all this, the <hi>English</hi> Statute bears, that to kill any reasonable creature <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> by Poyson, or otherwayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Cook</hi> observes, that to poyson a Jew or Turk falls under their Satute.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. From these words likewise it may be observed that the poysoning of bruit Beasts does not fall immediatly under this Act, nor yet the poysoning whole Fields, to the end Beasts may die. Albeit both these Crimes be punishable by death by the Laws of other Nations, as <hi>Carpz.</hi> observes, <hi>tract. crim. Quest.</hi> 21. <hi>num.</hi> 24. And since Theft is punishable by death, much more ought the poysoning of Beasts be, since not only is the party less'd by wanting his Beasts as much as in Theft, but the Common-wealth is more prejudg'd then in Theft, since the Beasts so poyson'd, are made unserviceable as to all uses; and men are likewise in danger by eating or using of them: And this is worse then houghing of Oxen, which is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital by our Law.</p>
               <p>But if a Beast be poyson'd, that men may be thereby poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd, then the poysoning of Beasts will infer death.</p>
               <p>From these words, <hi>may take bodily harm,</hi> it may be infer'd likewise that the giving of Poyson whereby men do fall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitick, or Lame, should fall under this Statute, though the person dies not, since that may be constructed bodily harm.</p>
               <p n="5">V. As also it may be concluded, that since to bring home Poyson whereby men may die does infer death, that therefore the giving of Poyson, though death do not follow, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Poyson was not strong enough, or because the party poisoned did counter-act its force immediatly by suitable reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, should be punishable by death; for these are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat deeds then to bring home Poyson: And generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is in this Crime punish'd as the consumat Act, where the indeavour comes to any deed that approaches the Crime, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. ad l. Pomp. de parricid.</hi> though <hi>Carpz.</hi> is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair opinion, asserting that <hi>conatus</hi> or indeavour is only to be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55274:43"/>
punished even in that case by an extraordinary punishment. The administrating Drinks or Medicaments to procure or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease love, is thought not punishable, though death do not follow, because there was no design there to kill, <hi>Carpz. ibid. &amp; l. siquis ff. de poenis,</hi> though this be punishable, as that Law asserts, by a lesser punishment, <hi>nam est res mali exempli.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. Indeavour is punishable in the poysoning of Parents, and in reiterated indeavours, though death follow not. And the poysoning of Magistrats, or Masters, since these great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations are so odious in the very contrivance, that these ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations are as odious as success: And as the Judge may mitigate the punishment upon the accovnt of lessening circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, so he may highten the punishment upon the account of aggradging circumstances, <hi>Vasq. contraver. illust. cap.</hi> 14. and <hi>Carpz. num.</hi> 50. <hi>quest.</hi> 20. <hi>part.</hi> 1. gives us several deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to this purpose, and amongst other decisions, tells us of two Mountibanks who were burnt with hot Tongs to death, for having poyson'd ten several persons.

               <p>IT is most unnatural that the Elements which were created to be Servants to Man, should have dominion over him: And therefore these who raise Fire are repute great enemies to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and more criminal then either Theives or Murderers. For in Theft, the thing stollen remains still with the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whereas it is absolutely destroyed by Fire: And in Murder the Crime extends never further then the design, whereas in Fire-raising, the merciless Element which is imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, debords oft beyond its commission, and involves in the common misery those against whom the Fire-raiser had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, with those who were his known enemies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55274:44"/>
those who raise Fire within a Town are burnt; whereas those who burn only a House are not so grievously punished.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>A Fire-raiser,</hi> or <hi>Incendiarius,</hi> is by Lawyers defined to be he who of design raiseth Fire, whether he kindle the same with his own hand, or commissionat another, or executes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self anothers Commission. And because of the atrociousness of this Crime, the attempt is punished, though the effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not, and threatnings, though nothing follow, are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, <hi>Damhaud. rubrica de Incendiariis,</hi> but because this Crime is of so high a nature, and that it is improbable that any would be so merciless to commit the same, therefore the Law requires that the Fire-raising which is punishable, be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>dolo malo:</hi> And with us it is required they be <hi>combustores domorum nequiter &amp; malitiose,</hi> as <hi>Skeen</hi> translates it, <hi>ad cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Malcolmi</hi> 2. And wilful Fire-raising is only declared punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by death, <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Parl.</hi> 3. <hi>I.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But since design and <hi>dolus</hi> are acts of the mind, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are inferr'd from presumptions, and what presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are necessary in this case, are very well related by <hi>Far. quest.</hi> 110. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. And <hi>Iohn Meldrum</hi> was execute upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions, 2 <hi>Aug.</hi> 1633. where he being pursued for burning the House of <hi>Frendrick:</hi> The only presumptions adduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him were, great threatnings, capital enmity, his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting himself in his own Examinations, common brute and open fame, that he was the burner. But I think that case very hard, and not to be drawn in consequence, for though the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and design may be proved by presumptions, because that is an act of the mind, yet the burning it self being an external act, should only be proved by Witnesses and confession. 2.

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:55274:45"/>III. It is doubted among the Doctors, whether he that burns his own House may be punished as <hi>Incendiarius,</hi> since <hi>quilibet est rei sua arbiter</hi>; and dominion is defined to be the using of any thing as we think fit. But since Fire-raising is oft-times punished, not only for the prejudice it hath done, <hi>sed quia flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma potuit longius è vagari,</hi> therefore Fire-raising should be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in this case. And as it is not presumable that any man will burn his own without design, so if this were not punished, men might upon the pretext of burning their own waste and destroy their own, and ruine their neighbouss. And he might very well be presumed to have had a design against his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but though the immediat dominion belong to private persons, yet the King has also an interest, <hi>&amp; dominium dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum.</hi> And as no man can kill himself lawfully, so neither can he burn his own House, except he can instruct that he did the same upon a just and reasonable cause.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The punishment of Fire-raising by the Civil Law, was various, and suitable to the several degrees of the Crime; for raisers of Fire within a Town were burnt alive: Those who burnt Corns beside Houses were bound and beat, and then burnt, but not burnt quick, as we speak, <hi>lex</hi> 28. <hi>parag. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiarii ff. de poenis,</hi> but the burning of a House or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage was not so highly punish'd. And <hi>Clarus Quest.</hi> 68. thinks that the Statutory pain of Fire-raising, if it be capital, should not take place in small Fire-raising: But since a small spark may kindle a great fire, this conclusion seems very unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, if the Fire was designedly rais'd.</p>
               <p n="5">V. According to our Law, the burning of folks in their Houses, and Corns, and wilful Fire-raising, is Treason: And Laese Majestie, <hi>Ia.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. From which Act it is to be observed, 1. That the Particle <hi>and,</hi> is not here copulative, but a disjunctive, for either of these cases, <hi>viz.</hi> the burning of Corns is <hi>per se</hi> Treason. 2. It is observable, that all Fire-ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sing is not Treason (though the Rubrick of the Act bear, that all Fire-raising is Treason) which may be concluded by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55274:45"/>
these reasons, 1. That all punishments should be commensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat to the Delicts and Crimes which are punished; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since Fire-raisings are very various, it were unjust that they should be all equally punished, especially the punishment here being Treason, which were too severe for burning Peets in a Moss, or a little Cottage standing in a Moor, where the guilt is so small, that the offenders in these cases should be capital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished. And in a case pursued against <hi>Mackenzie</hi> of <hi>Suddie,</hi> upon the 29. <hi>Iuly</hi> 1693. for burning some fewel standing upon a Moor, the Justices would not sustain this as Treason. 2. If all Fire-raising were by this Act Treason, there needed not a posterior Act have been made, <hi>cap.</hi> 146. <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. declaring that wilful Fire-raising in Coal-heughs, upon malice and despite, is punishable as Treason. 3. By the foresaid Act of <hi>K. Ia.</hi> 5. it needed not to have been said that the burning of Folks in their Houses, and the burning of Houses and Corns should be Treason, if generally all Fire-raising were Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>For the better understanding then of that Act, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that there are three several species of Fire-raising declared to be Treason by that Act: The first is, the burning Folks in their Houses, which must be interpret likewise to be the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Dwelling Houses, though the People were not acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally there, or were possibly there, and escaped. Which spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Fire-raising is most severely punished, both because Fire-raising was of all others the most horrid, <hi>&amp; domus sua est uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuique tutissimum refugium,</hi> and because ordinarily the burning of all the persons dwelling in the House is thereby designed, as well as the burning the House it self.</p>
               <p>The second species is, the burning Houses and Corns, which is suitable to the foresaid 28. Law <hi>ff. de poenis,</hi> where it is said, that <hi>qui acervum frumenti juxta aedes positum combusserit, vinctus, verberatusque, igne necatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third species is, willful Fire-raising, which differs in this from Burning, that Burning is of a particular place, with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55274:46"/>
design to destroy no more: But Fire-raising is the burning a particular place, with design to burn more; as to kindle a little Corn upon design to burn the whole Field.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The other Act making the burning of Coal-heughs to be Treason, was practised upon <hi>Iohn Henry,</hi> 14. <hi>Iune</hi> 1615. who was hang'd thereupon. And the reason of this Law was founded upon the favourableness of that Manufactory, which some do ruine by putting fire in them, which is so easie, that nothing could defend against it, but the severity of such a Law as this, and upon the greatness of the hazard which did arise by such Fires as this, which could never be quenched when once kindled.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. I was once consulted whether the drowning of Coal-heughs was Treason by this Act, since <hi>erat eadem ratio utrobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> but I thought not, because penal Laws, especially in which the punishment is so severe as Treason, should not be extended, as is elsewhere largely debated. And the hazard of drowning a Coal-heugh is not equal to the burning of it; for drowning can be easier removed, and cannot spread so far.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. So odious is this Crime, that it is expresly provided it shall be one of the four points of the Crown, and so can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be cognosced by the Justices; and all remissions granted for Fire-raising are declared null: But this last is not <hi>in viridi obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantia.</hi> And Fire-raising being included in the Earl of <hi>Caith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> remission, it was sustained, though thir Acts were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. If <hi>dole</hi> and design canot be proved in the Fire-raising, so that it were accidental, <hi>sed si culpa incendio causam dederit,</hi> there is a Civil Action, by the Civil Law allow'd, <hi>ex lege aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia:</hi> But for the further understanding <hi>incendii culpas,</hi> the more exact Doctors do distinguish betwixt <hi>incendium ex culpa lata, ex culpa levi, &amp; ex culpa levissima commissum.</hi> And since <hi>culpa lata aequi paratur dolo,</hi> therefore they make it to be corporeally punishable, though in that case the punishment is not extended to death; but if the same be committed only <hi>ex
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55274:46"/>
culpa levi,</hi> then it is to be punished by a Fine: but if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter have not wherewith to pay his Fine, he may Subsidiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be punished in his person: But if the Fire be raised <hi>per cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam levissimam,</hi> then the committer can never be punished corporeally, even though he want Money wherewith to pay his Fine, <hi>dicunt tamen aliqui culpam levissimam in faciendo, aequiparari culpae levi in committendo, Alex. con.</hi> 55.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. By our Law, he who burns a House in a Town by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governance, and <hi>not of set purpose,</hi> as the Act sayes, he shall be punished at the sight of the Magistrats of the Town, and his Goods, shall be given to him who suffers the prejudice, and shall likewise be banished for three years; and if he have no Goods, he shall be scourged at the Mercat Cross, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Town, and shall be banished for seven years; but if he who owes the House, do either by himself, his Wife, or Bairns, <hi>(id est</hi> negligently) burn his own House, albeit no Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour be thereby prejudged, yet he shall be banish'd the Town for three years: And if he to whom the House is set burn the same negligently, he shall repair the dammage, and be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for three years: Or if a Stranger, or Traveller, burn, as said is, he shall be Arrested, and repair the skaith, which if he be not able to do, he shall abide in Sickerness (<hi>id est,</hi> in Prison) at the King's will: And if the Governours of the Town be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent in the execution of their Office, they are to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ten pounds: And if Fire happens in Husband-Towns, in Barronies, they are to be punished by the Lords, <hi>id est,</hi> Barrons in like-manner as Magistrats do within Burgh, <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. <hi>Parl.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 75.</p>
               <p>By this Act likewise, no Fire is to be carried from on House to another, but in a covered Vessel, under the pain of an Un-law; but since this Un-law is not exprest, it is therefore Arbitrary to the Judge to raise it as high as his Jurisdiction will suffer, though in justice he should proportion it to the Crime, especially since it is not tax'd here of design, that it may be proportioned, as said is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:55274:47"/>Upon this Act there may be several doubts raised, as first. What is meant by the word <hi>misgovernance,</hi> for clearing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the common distinction made by the Doctors, and related by <hi>Alexander Consilio</hi> 55. would be considered. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that misgovernance in this case does include <hi>culpam levis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simam,</hi> the meanest fault, because the Act bears <hi>misgovernance,</hi> and <hi>not of set purpose</hi>; so that whatever is not of set purpose, or designed, is punishable by this Act. Likeas, the word <hi>reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly,</hi> which is likewise used in this Act, as exegetick of the former, may be properly enough extended to <hi>culpa levissima</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet it may be argued upon the other hand, that since the punishment of Servants raising Fire by misgovernance, is to be Scourged publickly, and then Banished, and that Masters are punished if they burn their own Houses, after that manner, it were hard to extend this punishment <hi>ad culpam levissimam:</hi> and as the Law interprets obligations to give Wine or Corn, neither to be extended to the best, nor worst of that species; so in this case, misgovernance should be interpret, as that it may properly neither be meant of <hi>culpa lata,</hi> nor <hi>levissima,</hi> but of <hi>culpa levis,</hi> which is <hi>media</hi>: and the word misgovernance properly doth imply a fault that is considerable, <hi>&amp; verba poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam imponentia, sunt strictissime interpretanda,</hi> as Lawyers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve. 2. It may be doubted, whether if Children who are not come to that age at which they are only punishable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, should burn the Fathers House, if the Father be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable by this Act, <hi>eo casu</hi>; and albeit it would seem that he is, seing accident without judgement is punished in this case, by repairing the dammage done, yet it is more suitable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to conclude that he is not, because 1. He who hath no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Law of himself, or any thing else, cannot be said to do any thing by misgovernance. 2. Children in Law are <hi>equiparat</hi> to fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ious persons, or Idiots; and as the Father could not be punishable for what is done by his Children, being fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and Idiots, so neither can he be punishable for what is done by them whilst they are <hi>impuberes.</hi> 3. <hi>Quia accessorium
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55274:47"/>
sequitur naturam sui principalis, &amp; subsidiarium naturam ejus cui est subsidiarum,</hi> and therefore, where the Child himself cannot be punished, we ought to conclude that the Father ought not to be punished for him.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. The Doctors do conclude that the Master of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is bound not only for his own, but likewise for the fault of any of the Family who raiseth Fire, for having choos'd them himself, he ought to be lyable for their fault, and he ought to blame himself for not choosing of better Servants. But this is to be restricted to the injuries done by the Servants in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective imployments to which they were made overseers by Masters: As for instance, if the Cook should leave the Fire securely at night in the Kitchin, but a Laquie belonging to the House should thereafter come in to the Kitchin and scatter it so as that both their Masters and the Neighbours House were burnt, they conclude that the Master would not be lyable to make up his Neighbours dammage, since the Master was not to be blamed, the person choos'd by him having done his duty, <hi>Carpz. part.</hi> 1. <hi>quest.</hi> 39. <hi>num.</hi> 51, <hi>&amp;</hi> 52. But this seems un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, for it may be alledged that the Master should not have choosed any such Servants: And it is all one to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by whom the prejudice is done, or whether it was done without the committers office, or not. And therefore it were fit to consider whether the person who did the injury was known to be a profligat or vicious person before he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd. And it seems that this may be the interest of the Common-wealth, because it would secure Neighbours, and be advantagious for the Common-wealth, that none should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy Servants who are not sufficient.</p>

               <p>THat there are Witches, Divines cannot doubt, since the Word of God hath ordain'd that no Witch shall live; nor Lawyers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> seing our Law ordains it to be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with death. And though many Lawyers in <hi>Holland,</hi> and elsewhere, do think, that albeit there were Witches under the Law, yet there are none under the Gospel; the Devils power having ceased, as to these, as well as in his giving Responses by Oracles.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Wierus,</hi> that great Patron of Witch-craft, endeavours to maintain his opinion by these Arguments, 1. That such as are accused of Witch-craft are ordinarily silly old Women, whose Age and Sex disposeth them to Melancholy, and whose Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy disposeth them to a madnesse, which should render their Confessions very suspect: And in this Crime there are seldom other prooves; whereas the things confest are so horrid, that it cannot be imagined any reasonable creature would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them. 2. God can only work the Miracle ascribed to Witches; he who is the Author of Nature being only able to alter or divert its course. And the Devil doth but delude the fancy of poor Creatures, as Feavers and Melancholy misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent objects: Nor are such as are cheated in the one more guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then they who are sick of the other. And it is severe to burn men and women for doing that which is concluded impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be done by them. 3. It is unjust to punish them for doing ill by Charms, except it could be first proved that these Charms produc'd the effects that are punishable; and Lawyers should argue thus, those who kill or hurt Men or Beasts by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful means, are punishable by death. But so it is, that Witches and Charmers kill Men and Beasts by unlawful means, and therfore Charmers ought to be punished by death. Off which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55274:49"/>
Syllogism <hi>Wierus</hi> denyes the Minor; for it can never be proved that Verses, Crosses, or laying Flesh in the Threshold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can destroy Men or Beasts, these being causes very dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to such effects, there being no Contract betwixt the Agent and Patient in these cases. 4. These who execute the will of God are not punishable, for that is their duty, and so cannot be their Crime. But so it is, that whatever the Devil or Witches do, is decreed by God either for tryal or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment expresly, and without his permission nothing can be done. And if the Devil were not acting here by obedience, or were at liberty, he would not leave any one man undestroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or any of Gods works undefaced.</p>
               <p>But that there are Witches, and that they are punishable capitally, not only when they Poyson or Murder, but even for Enchanting and deluding the world, is clear by an express Text, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. <hi>Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live:</hi> And it is observable, that the same word which expresses a Witch here, is that which is used in <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. to express those Magicians who deluded only the people by transforming a Rod into a Serpent, as <hi>Moses</hi> had done, though no person was prejudged by their cheat and illusion. Likeas, <hi>Lev.</hi> 29. and 27. It is ordained that <hi>a man or a woman that hath a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar spirit, or that is a Wizard, shall surely be put to death; they shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them.</hi> Which Laws were in such observation amongst the Jews, that the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. was afraid to use her Sorcerie before the King, because the King had cut off those who had Familiar Spirits and Wizards out of the Land. And so great indignation did the eternal God bear to this sin, that he did destroy the Ten Tribes of Israel because they were addicted to it.</p>
               <p>Not were the Jews only enemies to this vice, but even the Henthens following the Dictats of Nature, punished Witches as enemies to the author of it; for the <hi>Persians</hi> dashed their heads against Stones, as <hi>Minsing</hi> observes, <hi>ad §. Item lex
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55274:49"/>
Cornelia inst. de pub. jud.</hi> and <hi>Tacitus lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Annal.</hi> tells us, that <hi>Publius Marcius</hi> and <hi>Pituanus</hi> were execute for this Crime: for which likewise <hi>Valerius Maximus, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>eap.</hi> 3. tells us, that <hi>Publicia</hi> and <hi>Lucinia</hi> were with threescore and ten other <hi>Romans</hi> hang'd. But since it is expresly condemned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and by many general Councils, such as <hi>Aurelian, Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and <hi>Anaciritan,</hi> it should not be lawful for us to debate what the Law hath expresly condemn'd, by the same reason, that we should deny Witches, we must deny the truth of all History, Ecclesiastick and Secular: And <hi>Plutarch, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Sumps. cap.</hi> 7. observes, <hi>Quodammodo Philosophiam tollunt qui rebus mirabilibus fidem non habent opportet autem qua ratione aliquid fiat, ratione tractare, quod vero id fiat, ex ratione est sumendum.</hi> It is sure that the Devil having the power and will to prejudge men, cannot but be ready to execute all that is in Witch-craft: And it is as credible that God would suffer men to be convinc'd by this means, that there are Spirits, and that by thir means he would give continued proofs of his power in repressing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and of the necessity that silly men have of depending upon his infinit power.</p>
               <p>To the former Arguments it may be answered, that as to the first, all sins and vices are the effects of delusion; nor are Witches more deluded by Melancholy, then Murderers are by Rage or Revenge. And though it hath never been seen that persons naturally mad, have been either guilty of, or punished for this Crime, the Devil designing in this Crime to gain only such as can damn themselves by giving a free consent. Yet if Madness could be proved, or did appear; it would certainly defend both against the guilt and punishment: And therefore such a series of clear circumstances should concurr before a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be found guilty of this Crime, as should be able to secure the Pannel, and satisfie the Judge fully in the Quaerie. But since daily experience convinces the world that there may be such a Crime, and that the Law exacts either confession, or clear proofs, who can condemn the Law as rigorous in this case,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55274:50"/>
since without believing these there could be no Justice admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat, and whilst Judges shun'd to punish it in some cases, they behov'd to suffer it from the same arguments to go unpunished in all cases.</p>
               <p>To the second, it is answered, that though neither the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil nor Witches can work miracles, yet the offering to cheat the world by a commerce with the Devil, and the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that the Devil is able to do such things for them, should be a sufficient Crime; but much more when they believe all those things to be done by themselves, they giving their own express consent to the Crime, and concurring by all that in them is to the commission of it. Likeas, it is undenyable that the Devil knowing all the secrets of Nature, may be applying Actives to Passives, that are unknown to us, produce real ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which seem impossible.</p>
               <p>To the third, though Charms be not able to produce the effects that are punishable in Witches, yet since these effects cannot be produced without the Devil, and that he will not imploy himself at the desire of any who have not resigned themselves wholly to him, it is very just that the users of these should be punished, being guilty at least of Apostasie and Heresie.</p>
               <p>The fourth Argument is but a meer and silly Sophism, for though God in his providence permits at least all things that are done, to be done, yet such as contemn either the commands of him or his Vicegerents ought to be punish'd.</p>
               <p>I cannot but acknowledge that there are some secrets in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which would have been lookt upon in the first Authors as the effects of Magick: And I believe that in the duller Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a Philosopher drawing Iron with a Loadstone might have run a great risque of being burnt; and it is hard to give a judgement of <hi>Naudeus</hi> learned Book in favours of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Magicians, the <hi>Assyrian Chaldeans,</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Gymno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophists, and the Druids of the <hi>Gauls</hi>; for it cannot be denyed but that many true Mathematicians and Physicians have past
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55274:50"/>
for Magicians in the duller ages of the world, but as to this, there is now no fear since Learning hath sufficiently illuminat the world, so as to distinguish betwixt these two. But I am still jealous of those Sages who were frequented by Familiar Spirits, though they were otherwise very excellent men, such as <hi>Porphir. Iamblicus, Plotin.</hi> and others, who pretended by the purity of their lives to be so spiritual, as to deserve the friendship of Spirits: For besides that the Primitive Fathers and Doctors of the Church have testified against such, as meer Magicians. It is not intelligible how those Spirits which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented them could be good, since they were tempted to fall from the true Religion to Paganism, and did offer such Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices as the true God did never allow; and if such impostures were allowed, it were easie for any to defend themselves, being truly Witches.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Albeit Witch-craft be the greatest of Crimes, since it includes in it the grossest of Heresies, and Blasphemies, and Treasons against God, in preferring to the Almighty his rebel and enemy, and in thinking the Devil worthier of being served and reverenced, and is accompanied with Murder, Poysoning, Bestiality, and other horrid Crimes. Yet I conclude only from this, that when Witches are found guilty, they should be most severely punished, not with Scourg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng and Ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shment, as the custom of <hi>Savoy</hi> was related to be by <hi>Gothofred, hoc tit.</hi> but by the most ignominious of deaths. Yet from the horridness of this Crime, I do conclude, that of all Crimes it requires the clearest relevancy, and most convincing probation. And I condemn next to the Witches themselves, those cruel and too forward Judges, who burn persons by thousands as guilty of this Crime, to whom I shall recommend these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is not presumeable that any who hear of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God to men, and of the Devils malice against them; of the rewards of Heaven, and torments of Hell, would delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly enter into the service of that wicked Spirit, whom they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55274:51"/>
know to have no riches to bestow, nor power to help, except it be allowed by permission, that he may tempt men: And that he being a liar from the beginning, his promises deserves no belief, especially since in no mans experience he hath ever advantag'd any person: whereas on the contrary, his service hath brought all who entered in it to the Stake.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Those poor persons who are ordinarily accused of this Crime, are poor ignorant creatures, and oft-times Women who understand not the nature of what they are accused of; and many mistake their own fears and apprehensions for Witch-craft; of which I shall give you two instances, one of a poor Weaver, who after he had confess'd Witch-craft, being asked how he saw the Devil, he answered, <hi>Like Flies dancing about the Candle.</hi> Another of a VVom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, who asked seriously, when she was accused, if a VVoman might be a VVitch and not know it? And it is dangerous that these who are of all others the most simple, should be tryed for a Crime, which of all others is most mysterious.</p>
               <p n="3">III. These poor creatures when they are defamed, become so confounded with fear, and the closse Prison in which they are kept, and so starved for want of meat and sleep, (either of which wants is enough to disorder the strongest reason) that hardly wiser and more serious people then they would escape distraction: And when men are confounded with fear and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, they will imagine things very ridiculous and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, and as no man would escape a profound melancholy upon such an occasion, and amidst such usages; therefore I remit to Physicians and others to consider what may be the effects of melancholy, which hath oft made men, who appeared other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes solid enough, imagine they were Horses, or had lost their Noses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And since it may make men erre in things which are oblivious to their senses, what may be expected as to things which transcends the wisest mens reason.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Most of these poor creatures are tortur'd by their keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who being perswaded they do God good service, think it
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55274:51"/>
their duty to vex and torment poor Prisoners: And I know <hi>ex certissima scientia,</hi> that most of all that ever were taken, were tormented after this manner, and this usage was the ground of all their confession: and albeit the poor miscreants cannot prove this usage, the acters being the only witnesses, yet the Judge should be afraid of it, as that which at first did elicit the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and for fear of which they dare not retract it.</p>
               <p n="5">V. I went when I was a Justice-Depute to examine some Women, who had confest judicially, and one of them, who was a silly creature, told me under secresie, that she had not confest because she was guilty, but being a poor creature, who wrought for her meat, and being defam'd for a Witch she knew she would starve, for no person thereafter would either give her meat or lodging, and that all men would beat her, and hound Dogs at her, and that therefore she desired to be out of the World; whereupon she wept most bitterly, and upon her knees call'd God to witness to what she said. Another told me that she was afraid the Devil would challenge a right to her, after she was said to be his servant, and would haunt her, as the Minister said when he was desiring her to confess; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she desired to die. And really Ministers are oft-times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet in their zeal, to have poor creatures to confess in this: And I recommend to Judges that the wisest Ministers should be sent to them, and those who are sent, should be cautious in this.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Many of them confess things which all Divines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude impossible, as transmutation of their bodies into beasts, and money into stones, and their going through walls and closs doors, and a thousand other ridiculous things, which have no truth nor existence but in their fancy.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The Accusers here are Masters, or Neighbours who had their Children dead, and are engaged by grief to suspect these poor creatures. I knew one likewise burnt because the Lady was jealous of her with her Husband: And the Crime is so odious that they are never assisted or defended by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:55274:52"/>VIII. The Witnesses and Assysers are afraid that if they escape that they will die for it, and therefore they take an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable latitude. And I have observed that scarce ever any who were accused before a Countrey Assize of Neighbours, did escape that tryal.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Commissions are granted ordinarily to Gentlemen, and others in the Countrey who are suspect upon this account: and who are not exactly enough acquaint with the nature of this Crime, which is so debateable amongst the most learned: Nor have the Pannels any to plead for them, and to take notice who are led as Witnesses; so that many are admitted who are <hi>testes inhabiles,</hi> and suspect: And albeit their confessions are sent to, and advised by the Council before such Commissions be granted, yet the Council cannot know how these confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were emitted, nor all the circumstances which are necessary and cannot be known at a distance. Very many of these poor silly Women do reseal at the Stake from the conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssions they emitted at the Bar, and yet have died very penitent: And as it is presumeable that few will accuse themselves, or confesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their own life, yet very many confess this Crime.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The method I shall use in treating of this Crime shall be, 1. Upon what suspicion Witches may be apprehended. 2. What Judges are competent. 3. What Ditty's are relevant: 4. What probation is sufficient. 5. What is the ordinary punishment. As to the first, I know it is ordinary in <hi>Scotland</hi> not only that Magistrats do apprehend Witches almost up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any dilation, but even Gentlemen, and such as are Masters of the Ground, do likewise make them prisoners, and keep them so till they transmit them at their pleasure to Justices of Peace, Magistrats, or to some open Prisons. But all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedor is most unwarrantable, for Gentlemen, and such as are vested with no authority, should upon no account without a special warrand apprehend any upon suspicion that they are Witches, since to apprehend is an act of jurisdiction; and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>efore I think no prison should receive any as suspect of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55274:52"/>
Witch-craft, until they know that the person offered to them be apprehended by lawful Authority. 2. Since imprisonment is a punishment, and constantly attended with much infamy to the name, and detriment to the affairs of him who is imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, especially in Witch-craft: I do conclude that there must some presumption preceed all inquisition. For the meanest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of inquisition, though without captour, does somewhat defame. And that the person should not be apprehended ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it appear by the event of the inquisition, that she lyes under either many or pregnant suspicions; such as that she is defamed by other Witches; that she hath been her self of an evil fame; that she hath been found Charming, or that the ordinary Instruments of Charming be found in her House. And according to <hi>Delrio</hi>'s opinion, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>ad assumendas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formationes, sufficiunt levia judicia, sed gravia requiruntur ad hoc ut citetur reus, &amp; ut judex specialiter inquirat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Witch-craft was <hi>crimen utriusque fori,</hi> by the Canon Law: and with us the Kirk-sessions use to inquire into it, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Scandal; and to take the confession of the Parties, to receive Witnesses against them; as is clear by the Process of <hi>Ianet Barker</hi> and <hi>Margaret Lawder, Decemb</hi> 9. 1643. But since so much weight is laid upon the depositions there emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Kirk-sessions should be very cautious in their proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</p>
               <p>By the Act of Parliament <hi>Q. M.</hi> 9. <hi>Parl.</hi> 73. <hi>Act.</hi> All She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, Lords of Regalities, and their Deputes, and all other Judges having power to execute the same, are ordained to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that Act against Witch-craft; which can import no more, but that they should concur to the punishment of the Crime, by apprehending, or imprisoning the party suspect: But it doth not follow, that because they may concur, that therefore they are Judges competent to the cognition of the Crime; since the relevancy in it is oft-times so intricat, and the proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor requires necessarily so much arbitrariness, and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is so severe, that these considerations joyntly should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriat
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55274:53"/>
the cognition thereof solely to the Justice Court. Nor find I any instances wherein these Inferior Courts have tryed this Crime. And albeit the Council do oft-times grant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions to Countrey-men, yet that seems dangerous; nor can I see why by express Act of Parliament it should have been appointed, that no Commission should be granted for trying Murder, and yet Witch-craft should be so tryed by Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. The Justices <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hen are the proper Judges in Witch-craft.</p>
               <p n="5">V. As to the relevancy in this Crime, the first Article useth to be <hi>paction</hi> to serve the Devil, which is certainly relevant, <hi>per se,</hi> without any addition, as is to be seen in all the indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, especially in that of <hi>Margaret Hutchison, August</hi> 10. 1661. And by <hi>Delrio, Carpz. p.</hi> 1. <hi>quest.</hi> 49. and others; but because the Devil useth to appear in the similitude of a man, when he desireth these poor creatures to serve him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they should be interrogat, if they knew him to be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil when they condescended to his service.</p>
               <p>Paction with the Devil is divided by Lawyers, in <hi>expressum, &amp; tacitum,</hi> an expresse and tacit paction. Expresse paction is performed either by a formal promise given to the Devil then present, or by presenting a supplication to him, or by giving the promise to a Proxie or Commissioner impowered by the Devil for that effect, which is used by some who dare not see himself. The <hi>formula</hi> set down by <hi>Delrio,</hi> is <hi>I deny God Creator of Heaven and Earth, and</hi> I <hi>adhere to thee, and believe in thee.</hi> But by the Journal Books it appears, that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary form o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> expresse paction confest by our witness, is a simple promise to serve him. Tacit paction is either when a person who hath made no expresse paction, useth the words or signs which Sorcerers use, knowing them to be such, either by their Books, or Discourse; and this is condemned as Sorcery, <hi>Can.</hi> 26. <hi>quest.</hi> 5. and is relevant to infer the Crime of Witch-craft, or to use these words and signs, though the user know them not to be such; and this is no Crime, if the ignorance be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55274:53"/>
and if the user be content to abstain, <hi>Delrio, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>quest.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Renouncing of Baptism is by <hi>Delrio</hi> made an effect of Paction, yet with us it is <hi>per se</hi> relevant, as was found in the former Procels of <hi>Margaret Hutchison:</hi> and the solemnity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by our Witches, is the putting one hand to the crown of the head, and another to the sole of the foot, renouncing their Baptism in that posture. <hi>Delrio</hi> tells us, that the Devil useth to Baptize them of new, and to wipe off their brow the old Baptism: And our Witches confess alwayes the giving them new names, which are very ridiculous, as <hi>Red-shanks, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. The Devils mark useth to be a great Article with us, but it is not <hi>per se</hi> found relevant, except it be confest by them, that they got that mark with their own consent; <hi>quo casu,</hi> it is equivalent to a Paction. This mark is given them, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadg'd, by a nip in any part of the body, and it is blew; <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> calls it <hi>Stigma,</hi> or Character, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>quest.</hi> 4. and alleadges that it is sometimes like the impression of a Hares foot, or the foot of a Rat, or Spider, <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>num.</hi> 28. Some think that it is impossible there can be any mark which is insensible, and will not bleed; for all things that live must have blood, and so this place behov'd both to be dead and alive at once, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd to live without aliment; for blood is the aliment of the body: but it is very easie to conceive that the Devil may make a place insensible at a time, or may apply things that may squeez out the blood.</p>
               <p>This mark is discovered amongst us by a Pricker, whose Trade it is, and who learns it as other Trades; but this is a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cheat: for they alleadge that if the place bleed not, or if the person be not sensible, he or she is infallibly a Witch. But as <hi>Delrio</hi> confesses, it is very hard to know any such mark, <hi>à nevo, clavo, vel impertigine naturali,</hi> and there are many pieces of dead flesh which are insensible, even in living bodies: And a Villain who used this Trade with us, being in the year 1666.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55274:54"/>
apprehended for other villanies, did confess all this Trade to be a meer cheat.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Threatening to do mischief, if any evil follow imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, hath been too ordinarily found a relevant Article to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Witch-craft with us. Thus <hi>Agnes Finnie</hi> was pursued in <hi>Anno</hi> 1643. upon the general Article of having witch'd se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral persons; and particularly for these Articles, 1. That <hi>William Fairlie</hi> having nick-named and called her <hi>Annie Winnie,</hi> she sware in rage he should go halting home, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 24. hours he took a Palsie. 2. That <hi>Beatrix Nisbit</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to pay the said <hi>Agnes</hi> the Annualrent of two Dollors owing by <hi>Hector Nisbit</hi> her Father, she told her she should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it, and within an hour thereafter she lost her Tongue, and the power of her right Side. 3. That <hi>Ianet Greintoun</hi> having refused to carry away two Herrings she had bought from the said <hi>Agnes,</hi> and to pay for them, she told her it should be the last meat she should eat, and within a little after she fell sick: Against which Articles it was there alledged that this Libell was not relevant, and could not go to the knowledge of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest: 1. Because no means were condescended upon from which the Witch-craft was inferred: And if this Libell were relevant, it would be relevant to Libell generally that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel were a Witch. 2. Assizers are only Judges to the matter of fact, and not to what consists <hi>in jure.</hi> But so it is, that if this Libel were to pass to the knowledge of an Inquest, all the debate <hi>in jure</hi> behoved to be before the Assize before whom the Pannels Procurators behoved to debate how far <hi>minae &amp; damnum sequutum</hi> are relevant, and how far any person is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable as a Witch, though no Charms or other means com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly used by Witches be condescended upon; and as to the threatnings, they were not relevant, seing they had not all the requisits which are exprest by the Doctors as requisite, for they were not specifick, bearing the promise to do a particular ill, as that <hi>Fairlie</hi> should take a Palsie, or <hi>Nisbit</hi> lose her Tongue. 2. There was not a preceeding reason of enmity proved, nor
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55274:54"/>
is it probable that for so small a matter as a Herring, or the Annualrent of two Dollors, she would have killed any person, and exposed her self to hazard; nor was the effect immediat, nor such as could not have proceeded from any other natural cause, without all which had concur'd. <hi>Delrio lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect</hi> 3. is very clear, that <hi>minae etiam cum damno sequuto,</hi> are not so much as a presumption: but though all these did concur, it is very clear, both from <hi>Delrio ibid.</hi> and <hi>Farin. quest.</hi> 5. <hi>num.</hi> 37. That all these threatnings are not sufficient to infer the Crime of Witch-craft. Lastly, It was offered to be proved, that some of these persons died of a natural disease, depending upon causes preceeding that threatning: Notwithstanding of all which, the Libell was found relevant, and she was burnt. But I think this decision very hard, and very contrary to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all received Writers, who think, that albeit <hi>minae</hi> be <hi>adminiculatae</hi> with all the former advantages, <hi>&amp; probatae de ea quae solet minas exequi,</hi> yet the same are only sufficient to infer an Arbitrary punishment, not Corporal, but Pecuniary; and certainly such a wicked custom as threatning, is in it self a Crime: And thus it was only well found to be <hi>crimen in suo genere,</hi> in the Process led against <hi>Katherin Oswald, Novemb.</hi> 11. 1629.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Sometimes Articles are Libel'd, wherein the malefice hath no dependence at all upon the means used: And thus it was Libel'd against <hi>Margaret Hutchison, August</hi> 20. 1661. That <hi>Iohn Clarks</hi> Wife being sick, she came to the Bed side when all the Doors and Windows were fast, and comb'd her head several nights; and the last of these nights she came to the Bed side, and put her hand to the Womans Pape, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Child died, which Article was found relevant <hi>per se.</hi> And it was Libel'd against <hi>Ianet Cock, September</hi> 7. 1661. that a Woman called <hi>Spindie</hi> being at enmity with her, she gave her a cuff, whereupon <hi>Spindie</hi> immediatly distracted; and being reproved therefore by the Minister of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly distracted; which Article was likewise found rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55274:55"/>
being joyned with fame and dilation: Which decisions are in my opinion very dangerous, for they want a sure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and are precedents whereby Judges may become very arbitrary. And against these I may oppone a third alledgiance used in the former Process against <hi>Agnes Finnie,</hi> wherein it was alledged, that the conclusion of all Criminal Libels should be necessarily inferred from the deed subsumed, and that <hi>conclusio semper sequitur debiliorem partem: nam libellus est syllogismus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podicticus; sed non probabilis</hi>; and therefore except the Libel could condescend upon some means used by the Pannel, from which the malefice were necessarily infer'd, it could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that these Malefices were done by her, or that she was guilty of the wrong done. Thus <hi>Bodin lib.</hi> 4. does conclude, that <hi>veneficae non sunt condemnandae licet sint deprehensae cum bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonibus, ossibus, aliisque instrumentis egredientes exovili licet oves immediate moriantur.</hi> And <hi>Perkins cap.</hi> 6. asserts, that neither defamation nor threatnings, albeit what is threatned does follow, nor <hi>mala fama,</hi> nor the Defuncts laying the blame of their death upon the person accused (called <hi>inculpatio</hi> by the Doctors) can infer this Crime, though all these be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; for in his opinion, nothing can be a sufficient ground to condemn a Witch, except the Pannels own confession, or the depositions of two famous Witnesses, deponing upon means used by the Pannel. And it is remakable, that in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter immediatly subsequent to that wherein Witches are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be put to death, GOD hath expresly ordained, that <hi>out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word shall be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And in the Process deduced against <hi>Isobel Young</hi> for Witch-craft, <hi>Feb.</hi> 4. 1629. and against <hi>Katherine Oswald, Novemb.</hi> 11. 1629. This point is likewise debated, it being Libel'd against the said <hi>Katherine,</hi> that by her Witch-craft she caused a Cow give blood instead of milk; and caused a Woman fall and break a rib in her side. Against which it was alledged, that there was no necessar connexion there, <hi>inter terminum à quo &amp; ad quem inter causam &amp; effectum</hi>: But on the contrary,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55274:55"/>
the Cowes giving blood for milk might proceed from another natural cause, <hi>viz.</hi> from lying upon an Ant or Emmot hill; and therefore I think that because we know not what vertue may be in Herbs, Stones, or other things which may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, it were very hard to find Cures performed by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of these, without the using Charms, or Spells, to be Witch-craft: But when these outward applications are used, to do hurt; as for instance, if the said <hi>Margaret Wallace,</hi> being at enmity with <hi>Iohn Clark,</hi> and after she was forbidden to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent his House, did continue to frequent the same, and did throw in blood or any unusual thing upon his Wifes Pap: if the Child who suck'd the same had thereafter died, I think this Article, joyned with preceeding defamation of her by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Witch, might have been found relevant, because she was there <hi>in re illicita.</hi> And since the Law cannot know exactly what efficacy there is in natural causes, it may very well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge any such superstitious forbidden Acts, as it pleases, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pain of Witch-craft. Nor can these who are accused, complain of severity, since <hi>sibi imputent,</hi> that use these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden things against the express commandment of the Law; and therefore since the Law and Practick hath forbidden all Charms, it is most just that these who use the same should be severely punished, whatever the pretext be upon which they are used, or after whatever way or manner, or to whatever end, whether good or bad.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Albeit <hi>per leg.</hi> 4. <hi>Cod. de mal. &amp; Math.</hi> these Magick Arts are only condemned, which tend to the destruction of mankind, but not these whereby men are cured, or the fruits of the ground preserved; yet I have oft-times imputed this constitution to <hi>Tribonian,</hi> who was a Pagan, and a severe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Christians, or else that it behoved to be so interpret, or that thereby remedies, assisted by Godly Prayers, were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, else what mean these words, <hi>suffragia innocenter adhibita.</hi> But since I am informed from the Ecclesiastick Historians, as <hi>Zozim. lib.</hi> 2. that <hi>Constantine</hi> was not yet turn'd Christian
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55274:56"/>
when he past that constitution; but however this constitution is omitted in the <hi>Basilicks:</hi> and the Gloss sayes, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it was not thought fit to be mentioned, in the repurgation of the Law: And that constitution was very well reprobat by <hi>Leo's</hi> 65. Novel. And by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, <hi>tit. de sorti-legiis</hi>: And the general Sanction of the former Act of Parliament leaves no place for this distinction. Suitable to all which, <hi>Iohn Brough</hi> was convict for Witch-craft, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1643. for curing Beasts, by casting white stones in water, and sprinkling them therewith; and for curing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by washing their feet with South-running Water, and putting odd money in the Water. Several other instances are to be seen in the Processes led in <hi>Anno</hi> 1661. And the instance of <hi>Drummond</hi> is very remarkable, who was burnt for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many miraculous Cures, albeit no malefice was ever proved.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Consulting with Witches is a relevant Ditty with us, as was found against <hi>Alison Iollie, per. Octob.</hi> 1596. and this is founded upon the express words of the Act. The professing likewise skill in Necromancy, or any such Craft, is by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Act of Parliament a relevant Article. For the full clearing of which Act, it is fit to know that Divination was either <hi>per daemono-mantiam,</hi> the invocation of Pagan Gods, or <hi>Nangani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> which was the Prophecying for invocation of some Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thing. <hi>Mangania</hi> is divided in <hi>Necromantiam,</hi> which was a Prophecying by departed Spirits, <hi>Udromantiam,</hi> which was a Divination by Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which species and kinds of Divinations by any thing, is comprehended under the general prohibition of Necromancy, and such like Acts: So that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and Responses by the Sieve, and the Shear, and by the Book, and all such cheats and species of Sorcery are punishable by death in this Act: Yet these forbidden practices may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be excused by ignorance, or if it can be cleared by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that the user designed nothing but an innocent jest or recreation, <hi>Delrio lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>quaest</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:55274:56"/>XII. The last Article in Criminal Libels useth ordinarily to be the being delated by other Witches, which the Doctors calls <hi>diffamatio,</hi> and we <hi>common bruit and open fame,</hi> which are never sustained as relevant, <hi>per se,</hi> but only joyned with other relevant Articles, as is to be seen in the foresaid Process of <hi>Margaret Hutchison,</hi> though I think that Interloquutor very severe, since if any of the former Articles be <hi>per se</hi> relevant, they need not the assistance of fame and delation. Sometimes likewise, but with much more reason, Articles that are of themselves irrelevant are sustained relevant, being joyned with fame and delation; an example whereof is to be seen in the 9th Article of the Inditement against <hi>Ianet Cock, Septemb.</hi> 7. 1661. In which Article she was accused for having recovered a Child by Charms, with the help of another Witch; which other Witch had confessed the same when she was confronted with the said <hi>Ianet</hi>: Likeas both of them were found lying above the Child, whispering one to another, and the blood of a Dog was found standing in a Plate beside them; which Article was not sustained relevant <hi>per se,</hi> but was found relevant, being joyned with same and delation.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. The relevancy of this Crime being thus discussed, the ordinary probation of it is, by Confession or Witnesses; but the probation here should be very clear, and it should be certain that the person who emitted it is not weary of life, or opprest with melancholly. 2. Albeit <hi>non requiritur hic ut constet de corpore delicti,</hi> this being a Crime which consists oft-times <hi>in animo</hi>; yet it ought to be such as contains nothing in it that is impossible or improbable. And thus albeit <hi>Isobel Ramsay</hi> did upon the 20. of <hi>August</hi> 1661. confess that the Devil gave her six pence, and said that GOD desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed him to give it her: and at another time a Dollor, which turn'd thereafter in a <hi>Slait</hi>-stone; the Justices did not find this confession, though judicial, rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. And to know what things are of themselves impossible for the Devil to do, or at least what is believed to be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, may be seen very fully treated of in <hi>Delrio</hi>'s second Book,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55274:57"/>
where it is condescended that <hi>succubi &amp; incubi sunt possibiles, id est,</hi> that the Devil may ly in the shape of a man with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or in the shape of a woman with a man, having first form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to himself a body of condensed Air; and upon such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession as this, <hi>Margaret Lawder</hi> and others were convict. It is likewise possible for the Devil to transport Witches to their publick Conventions, from one place to another, which he may really do, by carrying them: and sundry Witches were in <hi>Anno</hi> 1665. burnt in <hi>Culross</hi> upon such a confession as this.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. It may be, I confess, argued, that Spirits and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial substances cannot touch things material, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can neither raise nor transport them: but if we consider how the Adamant raises and transports the Iron, and how the soul of man, which is a Spirit, can raise or transport the body; and that a mans voice, or a Musical sound is able to occasion great and extraordinary motions in other men, we may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Devils, who are Spirits of far more Energy, may produce effects surpassing very far our understanding. And yet I do not deny but that the Devil does sometimes perswade the Witches that they are carried to places where they never were, making those impressions upon their spirits, and acquainting them what was done there, which is done by impressing Images upon their Brain, and which Images are carried to the exterior senses by the animal Spirits, even as we see the Air carries the species of colours upon it, though in a very insensible way: and thus we see likewise, that the sumes of Wine or Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly will represent strange apparitions, and make us think them real. Nor ought it to be concluded that because those Witches are only transported in Spirit, or in Dreams, that therefore they ought not to be punish'd, since none can be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for dreaming; and that because those Witches desire to have these Dreams, and glory in them when they are awake: nor have any these Dreams but such as have entered into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding paction. I know that the Canon <hi>Episcopi</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55274:57"/>
of <hi>Anacir,</hi> (or the <hi>Aquilean</hi> Council, as others call it) does condemn these transportations, as false and meer delusions, which are imprest upon the fancy of poor Creatures by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>&amp; cum solus spiritus haec patitur, nec non in animo sed in corpore inveniri opinantur,</hi> but that Act of that Council does not assert all transportations to be imaginary, and Dreams, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares those who thought they follow'd <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> to these publick meetings, to be altogether seduced, for these indeed were seduced; for <hi>Herodias</hi> being dead long since, could not be at their meetings. But from that it is unjustly concluded, that there are no real transportations, there being so many instances of these transportations given, both in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and prophane Story; and persons having been found wounded, and having really committed Murders and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies, during these transportations.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Whether it be possible for a Witch to cause any person be possest, by putting Devils into their body, may be debated; and that it is possible, appears from the History of <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and many others, and is testified to be true by St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> in the life of St. <hi>Hilarion.</hi> And since Witches have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that there are Devils who obey one another, and that there are different degrees amongst them; why may not those of an inferiour degree be forced, by vertue of a paction with those of a superior order, to possess men and women at the desire of Witches? Witches themselves have confest that this hath been done. And I find by a decision of the Parliament of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodus,</hi> that Devils have been heard to complain in those that were possest, that they were put there by the inchantment of such and such women: But upon the other hand, it is not to be imagined that Devils would obey mortal creatures, or that GOD would leave so great a power to any of them to torment poor mortals: And the Devil, who is a liar from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is not to be believed, in saying that he is put there by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments; and though he make such promises to Witches, yet he does in these but cheat them: and if the Devil could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55274:58"/>
at pleasure, we would see many more possest then truly there are.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. The Devil cannot make one solid body to penetrat another, <hi>Quest.</hi> 17. and therefore I think that Article libel'd against <hi>Margaret Hutchison,</hi> of coming to <hi>Iohn Clark</hi>'s house, when doors and windows were shut, should not have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to probation, since it is very probable they would have searched the house after the second or third nights fear; and she could not penetrat doors nor walls.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. The Devil cannot transform one species into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a woman into a cat, for else he behoved to annihilat some of the substance of the woman, or creat some more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to the cat, the one being much more then the other; and the Devil can neither annihilat or creat, nor could he make the shapes return, <hi>nam non datur regressus à privatione ad habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi> But if we consider the strange tricks of Juglers, and the strange apparitions that <hi>Kercher</hi> and others relate from natural causes, we may believe that the Devil may make a woman ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a beast, <hi>&amp; è contra,</hi> by either abusing the sense of the beholders, or altering the Medium, by inclosing them in the skin of the beast represented, or by inclosing them in a body of air, shap'd like that which he would have them represent, and the ordinary relation of the witnesses, being wounded when the Beast was wounded, in which they were changed, may be likewise true, either by their being really wounded within the body of air in which they were inclosed, or by the Devils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting that wound really himself, which is <hi>Delrio</hi>'s opinion. But it would seem hard to condemn any person upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of what seems almost impossible in it self: And I cannot allow instances in the Journal Books, where poor creatures have been burnt upon such confessions, without other strong adminicles.</p>

               <p n="19">XIX. The Devil may inflict diseases, which is an effect he may occasion <hi>applicando act va passivis,</hi> and by the same means he may likewise cure: A clear instance whereof appears in the Marriage-knot. And not only may he cure diseases laid on by himself, as <hi>Wierus</hi> observes, but even natural diseases, since he knows the natural causes and the origin of even these natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diseases, better then Physicians can, who are not present when diseases are contracted, and who being younger then he, must h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is as untrue that <hi>Divus Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> observes, who asserts that cures performed by the Devil cannot continue, since his Cures are not natural. And since he both may make sick, and may make whole, it follows that he may transferr a disease from one person to another. And I find that it being libell'd against <hi>Margaret Hutchison,</hi> that she took a disease off a Woman to put it on a Cat: It was alledged that this Article was not relevant; because, 1. <hi>Una saga non potest esse ligans &amp; solvens in eodem morbo.</hi> 2. That in such transactions as these, the Devil never used to interpose his skill, except where he was a gainer; and therefore though he would transfer a disease from a bruit beast to a rational creature, yet he would never transfer a disease from a rational c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eature to a bruit beast; both these defences were repelled. Many Witches like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise confess that they cannot cure diseases, because they are laid on by Witches of a superior order, who depend upon Spirits of a higher degree.</p>
               <p>Some think that they may innocently imploy a Witch to take off the disease imposed by another, and lay it upon the Witch who imposed it, even as men may innocently borrow
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55274:59"/>
money from an Usurer, to be imployed for pious uses, or may cause an Infidel swear by his false Gods, for eliciting truth: and that in this manner Devils are rather punish'd then serv'd. But since all commerce with Devils is unlawful, this practice is just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprobated by D, <hi>Autun, p.</hi> 2. <hi>discourse</hi> 48. But yet it is thought lawful to all who are bewitched, to desire the bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to take off the disease, if it can be removed without a new application to the Devil, but only by taking away the old charm; or it is lawful to any to remove the charm or sign of it, if it be in their power, <hi>D, Autun. pag.</hi> 825.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. Witches may kill by their looks, which looks being full of venomous spirits, may infect the person upon whom they look, and this is called <hi>fascinatio physica, sed fascinatio vulgaris, quae dicitur fieri per oculos tenerorum puerorum vel parvorum porcorum vana est &amp; ridicula, Del. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Q.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>I know there are who think all kinds of fascination by the eyes, either an effect of fancy in the person affected, or else think it a meer illusion of the Devil, who perswades Witches that he can bestow upon them the power of killing by looks, or else the Devil really kills, and ascribes it falsly to their looks: whereas others contend that by the received opinion of all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, men have been found to be injured by the looks of Witches: and why may not Witches poyson this way, as well as the Basilisk doth? Or why may not the spirits in the eye affect as well as the breath? Or why may not looks kill as well as raise passions in the person lookt upon? Nor can it be denyed but that blear'dness is begot by blear'dness; and that menstruous women will spoyl a Mirrour by looking upon it. Likeas there seems even some ground for it in Scripture; for, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.54. it is said, <hi>that a mans eyes shall be evil towards his brother.</hi> And some likewise endeavour by consequence from <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Is thine eye evil:</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying in Scripture both to bewitch and to envy. Some like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise think that St. <hi>Paul Gal.</hi> 3.1. alludes to this received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but conjecture doth so much over-rule all this affair, that it
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55274:59"/>
were hard to fix crimes upon so slender grounds: And therefore though where Witches confess that they did kill by their looks, their confession and belief may, if they be otherwise of a sound judgement, make a very considerable part of a crime, where it is joyned with other probabilities, yet <hi>per se</hi> it is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relevant.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. It may be also doubted whether Witches can by amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous potions inchant men or women to love: and though it may seem that these being acts of the soul, cannot be raised by any corporeal means, yet <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c. de Malef. &amp; Mathemat.</hi> makes this possible, and punishable, <hi>eorum scientia punienda, &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verissimis merito legibus vindicanda, qui magicis accincti arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus pudicos ad libidinem de fixisse animos deteguntur</hi>: But this Law speaks only of lust, and not of love, as I conceive. Nor can it be denyed, but that not only Witches, but even Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists may give Potions that may incline men or women to lust. And therefore the question still remains, whether Witches may incline men or women by Potions to a fancy and kindness for any particular person; and though Potions may incline men to madness, yet it doth not follow that therefore they may incline them to love. And though <hi>D, Autun</hi> doth bring many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from History, and pretends that the Devil may raise and excite the old species of love which ly hidden in the body, and may thereby form a passion, yet these are too conjectural grounds to be the foundation of a criminal sentence. The <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silicks</hi> make the punishment of this to be deportation, and so supplies the former Law.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. Witches do likewise torment mankind, by making Images of Clay or Wax, and when the Witches prick or punse these Images, the persons whom these Images represent, do find extream torment, which doth not proceed from any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence these Images have upon the body tormented, but the Devil doth by natural means raise these torments in the person tormented at the same very time that the Witches do prick or punse, or hold to the fire these Images of Clay or Wax; which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55274:60"/>
manner of torment was lately confess'd by some Witches in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness,</hi> who likewise produced the Images, and it was well known they hated the person who was tormented, and upon a confession so adminiculat, Witches may very judiciously be be found guilty, since <hi>constat de corpore delicti de modo de lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendi &amp; inimicitiis praeviis.</hi>

               <p n="23">XXIII. It is ordinarily doubted whether confessions emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the Kirk Sessions in this case be sufficient: But this I have treated more fully in the Title of Probation by Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Only here I shall observe, that <hi>Christian Stewart</hi> was found Art and Part of the bewitching <hi>Patrick Ruthven,</hi> by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him a heavy sickness with a black Clout, which she her self had confest before several Ministers, Nottars, and others, at diverse times; all which confessions were proved: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these repeated confessions she was burnt, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1596. <hi>Margaret Lawder</hi> was convict upon confession emitted before the Magistrats and Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> albeit past from in Judgement, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 9. 1643. see that Book of Adjournal, <hi>pag.</hi> 349. And if the confession be not fully adminiculat, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers advise that confessors should be subjec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>d to the torture, which is not usual in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And it is very observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that the Justices would not put <hi>Iames Welch</hi> to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an Inquest, though he had confest himself a Witch before the Presbytery of <hi>Kirkcudbright,</hi> because he was Minor when he confest the Crime, and the confession was only extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, and that he now retracted the same; but because he had so grossely prevaricat, and had delated so many honest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, they ordained him to be scourged and put in the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction house, <hi>April</hi> 17. 1662. It was proved against <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet Wallace, March</hi> 20. 1622. that she said that if it could be proved that she was in <hi>Gregs</hi> House, she should be guilty of all the Ditty; and therefore it being proved that she was in <hi>Gregs</hi> House, that probation was alledged by the Advocat to be equivalent to a confession, as was found against <hi>Patrick Cheyn:</hi> To which it was replyed, that this could amount to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55274:60"/>
no more then a lie; and in my opinion, it could not have even the strength of an extrajudicial confession, but rather imported a denyal of the Crime.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. The probation by Witness in this Crime is very difficult, and therefore <hi>socii criminis,</hi> or other confessing Witches are adduced; but though many of them concur, their depositions solely are not esteemed as sufficient, <hi>ne vel ad poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam extraordinariam imponendam,</hi> though some think the same sufficient to that end, because of that general Brocard, <hi>ex multiplicatis indiciis debilibus resultare indicia indubitata:</hi> But <hi>Delrio</hi> asserts, that the conjection of such testimonies is not sufficient, <hi>Nanquam enim,</hi> saith he, <hi>quae sua natura dubia sunt possunt facere rem indubitatam ut nec multa aegraunumsanum nec multa non alba unus album nec multa tepida anum callidum.</hi> And that the testimony of one confessing Witch was found not sufficient to file the Pannel, is clear by the Process of <hi>Alison Iollie,</hi> who was assoilzied <hi>pen. Octob.</hi> 1596. Albeit <hi>Ianet Hepburn</hi> another Witch confest that the said <hi>Alison</hi> had caused her bewitch <hi>Isobel Hepburn,</hi> whereof she died; but though VVitch-craft cannot be proved <hi>per socios criminis,</hi> though dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and penitent VVitches, yet it may be doubted if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting VVitches may not be proved by two VVitches who were consulted: for if this be not a sufficient probation, it would be impossible to prove consulting any other manner of way.</p>
               <p>The persons to whom the injuries are done by the VVitches are admitted to be VVitnesses: thus <hi>Katherine Wardlaw</hi> was admitted against <hi>Margaret Hutchison</hi>; but sometimes they are only admitted <hi>cum nota,</hi> if the probation be not otherwise weak, and thus <hi>William Young</hi> and <hi>Agnes Hutchison</hi> were only admitted <hi>cum nota</hi> against <hi>Beatrix Leslie, August</hi> 1661. And in that Process likewise they received only <hi>Agnes Ross cum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> because she was the Mistriss of the two VVomen who were maleficiat. <hi>Neilson</hi> was admitted to be an Assizer against <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet Wallace,</hi> though he was Brother in Law to <hi>Iohn Nicol,</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:55274:61"/>
who had given information for raising the Ditty, because the Ditty was not at <hi>Nicols</hi> instance; and yet <hi>Starling</hi> was set from being an Assizer, because <hi>Moor</hi> who was alledged to be one of the persons maleficiat was his Brother in Law. <hi>March</hi> 2. 1622. <hi>Dickson</hi> was there likewise admitted to be an Assizer, though he assisted the Bailie in taking her, which was found the office of a good Citizen, and though he had deadly fead against her Husband, since it was not proved he had any against her self.</p>
               <p>Women are received Witnesses in this Crime, as is clear by the Process against <hi>Margaret Wallace,</hi> and all the Processes in <hi>August</hi> 1661. The not shedding of tears hath been used as a mark and presumption of Witch-craft, <hi>Sprenger. mal. malef. p.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 15. because it is a mark of impenitence; And because several Witches have confest they could not weep: But the being accused of so horrid a Crime may occasion a deep melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly; and melancholy being cold and dry, hinders the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tears: and great griefs do rather astonish then make one weep.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. The punishment of this Crime is with us death by the foresaid Act of Parliament, to be execute as well against the user as the seeker of any response or consultation, <hi>&amp; de pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctica,</hi> the Doom bears, to be worried at the Stake, and burnt.</p>

               <p n="1">I. <hi>Murder</hi> comes from the Dutch word <hi>Moorde,</hi> which signifies, <hi>caedem ex jusidiis vel proditorie factam. Math. h. t.</hi> And Murder is properly different from Slaughter, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committed <hi>per seloniam,</hi> the other <hi>per infortunium, Leg. Malc. c.</hi> 2. And therefore when our Law forbids killing under trust, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Pa.</hi> 11. <hi>ch.</hi> 81. It calls it murder under trust. But when it speaks of killing by accident, or in self-defence, it calls it Slaughter, or Homicide. <hi>c.</hi> 22. <hi>Par.</hi> 1. <hi>K. Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>Ses.</hi> 2. And by this it seems that this crime is better writ murder then murther, though murther be the ordinar way of writing it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in our old Law.</p>
               <p>The Civilians define Murder to be the killing man by man unlawfully. And they divide it into that which is committed casually, in defence, culpable, or wilfully.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Necessarium Homicidium,</hi> or homicid committed in self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence is when a man being pursued or reduced to inevitable necessity, has no way left him to evit his own death, but by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

the Aggressor: This is in law called <hi>inculpata tutela,</hi> or <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramen in culpatae tutelae</hi> within which moderation, if the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der contain himself, he is no way punishable, but if he exceed the same, yet so favourable is self-defence, that the exceeder is not lyable to the ordinar punishment, but is ordinarly punishable according to the excess, at the discretion of the Judge. With us likewise self-defence is only punishable at the arbitrement or discretion of the Judge by the 22. <hi>act. Sess.</hi> 1. <hi>Pa.</hi> 2. <hi>K. Ch.</hi> 2. But seeing that act ordains it to be punisht at his discretion, it may be doubted if in all cases self-defence be not some way pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable. And I remember that Captain <hi>Barclay</hi> being assoylzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1668. Because the Assyse found that the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Sinclar</hi> was in his own defence, the pursuers were to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the Council (which is the ordinar way of taxing arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry punishment in this case) that he might be fined. And very learned Lawyers, were of opinion, that self-defence was in all cases punishable, though attended with the most favourable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of innocency; from whom I differed upon these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, 1. By the Civil Law and the opinion of the Doctors, if the defender contain himself exactly within that moderation, he is no way punishable, as is clear by <hi>Farin. part.</hi> 74. <hi>quest.</hi> 25. <hi>part.</hi> 6.2. Self-defence is a duty, and so not punishable; for it were against reason that the Law should punish what it doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>command. 3. The Law sayes that <hi>omni culpa caret qui se de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sendit,</hi> and in our Law it is called <hi>murthrum justum. leg. Malcol. c.</hi> 11. and so to punish him who necessarily defends himself, were to inflict a punishment where the Law acknowledged there were no guilt. 4. It should be in the power of every malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rascal to wrong the most innocent, for either he behov'd to suffer himself to be killed, or to be punished by defending his own life: And by the said act, it is only declard leisum to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, but not necessary. And yet by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers <hi>se defendendo</hi> for fault their movables, and both in that and in murder, upon misadventure (for so they call casual ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide)

the murtherer must have a pardon, <hi>Statute</hi> 6. <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. So great a regard, sayes <hi>Bolton,</hi> the Law hath to the life of a man, <hi>cap.</hi> 15. <hi>num.</hi> 16. And by the Law of <hi>Savoy</hi> he who kills, though in self-defence, needs a pardon, but the Prince in that case cannot refuse to grant a pardon. And therefore their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers call that pardon <hi>gratia justitiae, Cod. fabr. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>tit.</hi> 10. but with us, no pardon is requisite, albeit it is most ordinar to take remissions in such cases, bearing self-defence in their narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>

The defender is said to exceed in time, if he strike the aggressor, <hi>ante quam sit in actu proximo occidendi,</hi> for else it should be lawful to every man, upon the first apprehension of fear, to kill the aggressor, which were very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: and here it may be doubted, if when any aggressor threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to kill, if the defender who knows not when the threat may be put in execution, may immediatly kill. There are probable reasons to be urged for either opinion: And albeit the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should in this case depend upon the arbitrement of the Judge, yet if the aggressor be known to have any designe to Murder, or be a person who uses to execute what he threatens, and if he have a Sword, though not drawn, or a Pistol, though not cockt: (For if he have either of these, there is no doubt but he may be lawfully killed, because he is <hi>in actu proximo offendendi,</hi> and no man should wait till he be killed) I think that though the aggressor be killed, yet the defender hath the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of self-defence; and albeit he may be arbitrarily punisht, yet
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55274:64"/>
he cannot be punisht with death: and many Lawyers are of opinion, that he who threatens to kill, may be killed, which opinion they found upon these reasons, 1. Because the Law looks upon that which is unlawful, as done, if it was intended to be done, and that <hi>in odium</hi> of him who designes what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. There is greater fear from some threats, then from wounds; and therefore, seeing it is lawful to kill these who assault us with wounding, why not, and him who threatens? 3<hi>d. per. l.</hi> 1. <hi>C. quando licet cuique,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mortem inquit impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator quam minabatur accipiet &amp; id quod intendebat incurrat,</hi> nor can the friends of the threatner complain, seing the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor was in effect author of his own death, And it is clear that the defender had no design to kill. Yet the Justices would not sustain, <hi>minae per se,</hi> to be a sufficient qualification of self-defence, but sustain'd it joyntly with the aggressors fyring a Pistol, though it mis-gave, and though the defender might have fled, <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1668. <hi>Sinclar contra Barclay.</hi> And albeit by the Canon Law, <hi>insultatus debet fugere.</hi> And that by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> he who is invaded, is oblieged to flee as far as he can, as to a Wall or Ditch, <hi>Bolt. cap.</hi> 15. <hi>num.</hi> 17. Yet by the opinion of the Civilians, a person invaded is not oblieged to flee far, <hi>Farin. quest.</hi> 125. <hi>P.</hi> 2. It may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that if the defender was alone in a House, or place with the aggressor, and could expect no help, that upon threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or other probable designes laid against his life, he may kill the aggressor; and from which may be deduced, that the <hi>actus proximus</hi> which Lawyers speak of, must not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret, only the having a Sword drawn; for if a stronger man have a weaker in a lockt house, and threaten, he may kill him, though asleep, if he cannot otherwayes escape.</p>
               <p>The defender is said to exceed in the measure; also if he killed him for wounding, whom he might have shun'd: or if he followed the aggressor, which though it be not fully law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet <hi>fugientem persequens dumodo in ipso actu non punitur paena ordinaria licet occiderit, Boer. decis.</hi> 168. <hi>Novemb</hi> 7.

And albeit much be left to the arbitration of the Judge, as to all the three, <hi>arma tempus &amp; modus</hi>: yet the general rule is, that if the defender exceed only in either of the three, as, <hi>v. g.</hi> in the armes, or time, the excess is said to be <hi>culpa levissima,</hi> and no way punishable: if in two of these, as in time and arms, then it is accounted <hi>culpa levis,</hi> and is somewhat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I likewise think that the fear of imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the defender, may excuse from capital punishment, seing Liberty is as dear as Life; and no man can be secure of his Life, if he be unjustly imprisoned, <hi>&amp; sibi imputet aggres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor

qui occasionem praebuit.</hi> It is likewise lawful to kill such as would murder our Friend, or fellow-traveller, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted lawful, though not self-defence, which is extended also to the defence of all others, because we should love our Neighbour as our selves. And it is lawful to kill a Thief, who in the night offers to break our Houses, or steal our Goods, even though he defend not himself, because we know not but he designs against our Life: and Murder may be easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon us in the night: but it is not lawful to kill a Thief who steals in the day time, except he resist us when we offer to take him, and present him to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>

This exception of self-defence, must be propon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the revelancy, and must be condescended upon, thus the Pannal no ways acknowledging the killing; yet if he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it was done in his own defence, in swa far as the Defunct drew a Sword, and thrust, or offer'd a Pistol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Justices will not allow that it should be propon'd to the Assize, as I have oft heard this press'd, but very unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably; for this concerns the relevancy, to which the Justices, and not the Assizers are only Judges competent: And it were very dangerous to refer to ignorant Assizers, Matters of such importance, and which are oft so intricat <hi>in Iure.</hi> And whereas it may be urg'd, that Art and Part is referred to the Assize, and is not condescended upon, and made rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. It is answered, that the accuser cannot know the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Pannel, till the Witnesses first condescend upon it: but the Pannel cannot but know all the circumstances of his own self-defence, and is not to learn that from others: But yet though the proponer of a defence, do's <hi>in civilibus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>eo ipso</hi> the Lybel: yet <hi>in criminalibus,</hi> though the defender, or Pannel prove not his exception of self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, he will not be condemned, except the pursuer prove the Lybel.</p>

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:55274:66"/>V. The way of proving this self-defence, was by raising a precept of exculpation, but is now only by a summonds, which expresses not so particularly the defence in all its circumstances, but that it may be hereafter help'd, which it seems is unjust, for the Pannel should know what himself did: nor should a Judge grant a precept for exculpation, till he see that there be some ground for craving it.</p>
               <p>This exception of self-defence is so favourable, that it may be prov'd by presumtions, by Witnesses, otherways decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as Cousens, Servants, and Witnesses who depone on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon credulity; and the Defence it self being once prov'd, it is presumed that it was done necessarily, and lawfully, <hi>&amp; potius ad defensionem quam ad vindictam Far. quest</hi> 115. <hi>part</hi> 7. §. 1. And yet our Law allows no Witnesses to be receiv'd in defence, but such as it allows pursuits and witnesses led in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, are more to be suspected; for men are naturally encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to go all lengths in bringing off the Pannel; and for this cause it is, that we have Assizes of Error against such as absolve a Pannel: but none against those who condemn him.</p>
               <p>Before this Act of Parliament, self-defence was still su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd by the Justices, to elide the Lybel of Murder, but it was oft ineffectual, seing there were no precepts of Exculpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then us'd; and consequently, except either the Pannel could have prov'd the <hi>inculpata tutela</hi> by the accusers own witnesses, who were led to prove the Murder (which was not secure, seing these who saw the beginning of the scuffle, and first aggression, might have been absent when the aggressor was killed) or that the witnesses would have voluntarly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared (which was a probable reason to set them, they being <hi>eo casu testes ultronii</hi>) the defence could not have been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

head should fall off, and kill a by stander: or a Rider should kill with his Horses feet: In which case our Law appoints, that if the prejudice be done by the Horses formest feet, then the Ryder shall be forc'd to satisfy for the prejudice done: and these satisfactions are called <hi>Croo</hi> or <hi>Galnes</hi>; but where it is there said, that he shall give <hi>Croo</hi> or <hi>Galnes,</hi> as if he had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him himself; it is to be interpret, not as if the Rider should be punishable in that case, as if he had killed him with his own hand: but that the Assythment shall be the same. But the Rider is not lyable at all for what preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice is done by the Horses hinder feet, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Reg. Maj. C.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>Casual Slaughter, or homicide, then is that which is occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by mistake and just ignorance, for if it proceed from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ignorance; as for instance, if a man will not know what he may know, his ignorance in that case will not make the Murder following upon it, to be constructed casual homicide; but if it proceed from gross and <hi>supina ignorantia:</hi> it may be punishable by an extraordinary, or arbitrary punishment, but not by death. And since such ignorance is a fault, the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der occasioned by it becomes <hi>culposum,</hi> or faulty homicide; as seems to me clear by <hi>C. continebatur &amp;c. lator de homicid.</hi> It is then necessary, that the committer us'd all exact diligence to evite the Crime, else he is not in the case of casual homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide. Further instances whereof, are, if a Mason before he throw down Stones, advertise all below, though in throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he kill, he is to be cleared as innocent. Or if a Hunter shoot at a Beast, but a man come in the way and be killed: and yet if either the Mason cry not, or if the Hunter did shoot in a place where people use to be, he is guilty of faulty Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in these cases which shews clearly the difference betwixt these two kinds of Murder.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. If the killer be imployed about a thing unlawful, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in it self, or unlawful to the actor, the murder ensuing is thought still casual Murder, since Murder was not design'd,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55274:67"/>
if the committer did exact dilligence to shun all Murder; as for instance, to cary Guns is unlawful with us: and to hunt is unlawful to Priests by the Canon Law. If then a man having a Gun illegally, should lay it up securely: or a Church-man should kill a man, whilst he did shoot at a Beast in a remote place; these Acts would not infer Murder, because there was no Act done there, with relation to Murder, <hi>Covar. ad cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. si furiosus,</hi> and yet the committer, <hi>versatur in actu illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cito.</hi> But yet others are of opinion, that if the committer be doing what is unlawful for him, he commits murder, <hi>Tho. Aquix</hi> 22. <hi>quest.</hi> 69. <hi>Act</hi>: because he do's not at all that he ought to do in that case, to evite Murder, since what he do's is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: But I think they may be thus reconciled, <hi>viz.</hi> if the committer do what is against the Law of Nature: or what is criminal, he should be lyable: or if what he do's, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably produce ill consequences, and Murder, though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd not the same: in all which cases he ought to be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And it seems to me reasonable, that he who Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when he was doing what was unlawful, may be arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarly punished, though he did exact diligence to shun Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII When <hi>homicide</hi> is casually committed, some think that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no design to kill, therefore the killer ought no way to be punisht.

A third Sect of Lawyers distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish so, that if there proceeded no fault in the committer, then he is lyable in no fine, or to no punishment: but that he is, if any fault of his preceeded. But it seems that if any fault preceeded, the Murder is not casual, but is <hi>culposum</hi>; and so the distinction meets not the state of the question: and it seems to me. that by <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>S.</hi> 3. <hi>ff. ad l. Cor. de Sicar.</hi> all casual <hi>homicide</hi> deserves some punishment. And since some Lawyers think, that Murder in self-defence excuses not from all punishment: much less ought casual Murder, since self-defence
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55274:67"/>
wants not only a design to Kill, but is a duty in it self.</p>

               <p>For clearing this difficulty, the Doctors say, that either the Killer is guilty only of <hi>culpa levis, aut levissima,</hi> and in that case he is no way punishable; nor is there any difference, <hi>inter homicidium casuale &amp; homicidium per culpam levem aut levissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam commissum,</hi> and this was found in the case of <hi>Nicolson,</hi> who being pursued for Murder, it was alledged that it was but <hi>homicidium casuale,</hi> or <hi>culposum,</hi> for in strugling, his Gun being a half-bend, went off; nor knew he ever the Defunct, and so could have no malice against him.

               <p n="12">XII. By the late 22. <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>Sess.</hi> 1. It is Statute, that casual Homicide, Homicide committed in self-defence, and Homicide committed upon Thieves, shall not be punished by death.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55274:70"/>
guilty of Murder: that premeditation is requisit to make Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Capital, being only such as <hi>antecedit actum licet non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Civilians in the case of <hi>Homicidium per plures commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,</hi> state three questions; The first is, where the Murder was committed upon fore-thought fellony, and then indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly, all the assisters are punishable by death. The second is, when it is not certain, but it is only suspected, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeable that it was deliberatly committed, and then all may be tortured; but if they deny the design, they are all only punishable by an arbitrary punishment, because of the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. The third is, when the Murder was certainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, <hi>in rixa,</hi> or tuilzie; and then either the author of the Pley is certainly known, and he is punishable by death, in the rigour of the Law, Albeit many Lawyers are positive, that no Countrey uses this rigour; I remember that in <hi>William Dowglas</hi>'s case, this was urged: for there several Gentle-men having made a quarrel, which was only proved by one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, they went to the Fields of <hi>Lieth,</hi> and <hi>Hoom</hi> of <hi>Eccles,</hi> was killed, but it was not proved who was the killer: and the quarrel was only proved by one witness; who likewise proved, that <hi>Spot</hi> had the quarrel with <hi>Eccles,</hi> and that <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Dowglas</hi> had none; and yet the Assise found <hi>William</hi> guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he thereupon died because present.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Homicide likewise committed upon Thieves, and Robbers, breaking houses in the night, or committed in time of masterful depradations, are free from punishment, by the foresaid Act 22. And albeit it be declared lawful to the Justices, to fine such as are assoilzied from Murder, upon the defences of casual Homicid, and Homicide in defence: yet such as kill Robbers, or night Thieves, are free from all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary punishment. By this Act likewise, it is lawful to kill such as assist, or defend the depredators, or oppose their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit by force; and by the 6. Act of the second Session of that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55274:70"/>
Parliament, it is Statuted, that the Parties whose goods are robbed, shall acquaint the Sheriff, or Justices of Peace, of the Paroch, who shall require all Parties to concurr; and if any of the concurrers, kill any of the Robbers, they are declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed free; upon which it may be doubted, if such as kill Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers without acquainting the Sheriff, or Justices of Peace, are punishable: and it seems they are, seing this Act explains the other, and modifies somewhat the indefinite power given to private persons, who upon pretence of such invasions, which might prove very dangerous: and therefore the last did wisely require the concourse of the Magistrate; and upon this consideration, I know that it was consulted, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of this, such as had not acquainted the Sheriff, or Justices, could not be exculpat. And yet it may be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this Act narrates not the other, nor bears expresly a rectification of it; but, without lessening the priviledge therein granted, adds a new one, and so being introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in favours of possessors, should not be interpret to their disadvantage. By the Civil Law, <hi>licebat nocturnum furum occidere.</hi> And by the 227. <hi>Act</hi> 14. <hi>Par.

But by the Civil Law, and Doctors, it was not lawful, <hi>furem vel predatorem diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num occidere,</hi> except the thing stoln was of great value, and could not be otherwayes recovered; or that he defended himself, and resisted his being apprehended: all which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences may be proved, by the assertion of the killer, <hi>Farin.</hi> 125. <hi>part.</hi> 4. And if any other Probation were requisite, the benefit of these Acts were a snare, rather then an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: and necessity legittimats many things, which are otherwayes hard.</p>

                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:55274:71"/>XIV. By the Civil Law, it was lawful for the Father to kill his own Daughter, if he found her committing adultery, and to kill also her adulterer. <hi>l. part.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. de Adult:</hi> which was allowed, rather in hatred to adultery, then because the Law considered it was too hard for a Father to restrain his passion in that case; for if it had been allowed to the father only upon this last accompt, it had been allowed much more to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to kill his wife, if he found her committing adultery; for his relation beeing nearer, and his honour more concerned then the Fathers, his passion behov'd to be also more violent; and yet the Law being jealous of the Husbands violence, does on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow the Husband to kill the adulterer, if he be a mean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but if the adulterer be a person of quality, or if the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer be found elsewhere then in the Husbands own house, it it not lawful to kill them, for the injury is hightned by polluting the Husbands own house, and becomes a kind of adulterous Hamsuckin: And yet if the Husband kill in either of these cases, that Law ordained the husband only to be punished by some arbitrary punishment, but not by death. <hi>l. Marito. ff. de Adulter.</hi> But this last determination doth not satisfie justice, for it seems reasonable that it should be rather lawful to kill a person of quality, committing adultery, then a mean person, both because adultery is more ordinar amongst them, as having more ease, and being more luxoriously fed, and because the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band cannot be so easily presumed to have had former quarrels with a person above his rank, and so should be believed to have killed him meerly to satisfie his just revenge. As also since they can sooner prevail, they ought to be more rigidly punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Law has deny'd this priviledge to women, who may not kill their Daughters or Husbands, the reason whereof I conceive to have been, that the Law considered, that Husbands were more prejudged then the Wives, by adultery, since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, not only was their bed defiled, but their estate carryed away to another mans children, or else it thought women too passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onat
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55274:71"/>
to be intrusted with such a licence, or that it was undecent to allow women the use of Armes: And yet I believe their just grief would secure them against the ordinar punishment; and though some prerogative be due to the man over his wife, but not <hi>è contra,</hi> yet women may complain that men being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Legislators, have taken too great a measure of favour to themselves in this Law. I have not observed any decision of this in our Law, and since our statutes have secuted murderers in other cases, as in self-defence, killing of thieves, &amp;c. And yet have not priviledged this case, it may seem that the husband nor rather cannot kill by our Law, and the most that they could expect, were, that after they were found guilty by the Law, the Council might either change the doom of death into an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary punishment, or might recomend the party to his Majesties clemency for a remission: But it were hard to punish with death amongst us, what almost all Nations allow as lawful, and what may be yet a further check to that growing vice. And this seems juster then to allow with the Civil Law, that the Husband or Father, who are persons interessed, should be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in their own concern, and should be judges when they are in passion, and because they are in passion; Nor can I see why the Law should punish even him who possesses by his own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity what is truly his own, and yet should allow here the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties interessed to punish with death by their own authority: or that passion which only infers mitigation of the pain elsewhere, should here infer absolute impunity, for this were to make one irregular Act legittimat another, since passion is a transgression against reason, as Adultry is against Law: But since this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is personal, and only granted to the Father and Husband, because of their just passion and near relation, it is not reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that it should be extended to such as k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll by the Fathers or Husbands Command, which command none ought to obey, being contrair to Law: Nor ought this indulgence to extend to the Father or Husband when they kill <hi>ex intervallo,</hi> and not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55274:72"/>
when they find the Committers in the very transgression, for the Law allows no passion to continue; &amp; therefore what ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is allowed to it, is only allowed if it be executed immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>&amp; ex in continenti.</hi> And though in civil cases that is said to be done <hi>ex in continenti,</hi> or immediatly, which is done before the doer go about any thing else: Yet I conceive that interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be too lax in this case, and that the killer could not plead this priviledge, except he killed them in the very Act, or rising from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homicidium deliberatum,</hi> or upon fore-thought Fellony, is still punishable by death, and confiscation of the movables of the Defunct for His <hi>Majesties</hi> use, <hi>Stat. Rob.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 43. And albeit Lawyers say, that it is still rather presumable to be casual, then deliberat, and that by our Law and custome, designe is still libelled, yet because it is impossible to prove design, which is a secret act of the mind. All killing is alwayes punishable by death, except some of the qualities of chance, self-defence, &amp;c. be alledged upon by the <hi>Pannel.</hi> It may be here asked, if by our Law, he who strikes with his fist, or a batton (which are of themselves no mortal weapons) be punishable by death, though the party struct there by him dye: And it would seem hard that he should, seing no designe to kill can be here presumed, <hi>&amp; maleficia voluntas &amp; affectus distinguunt,</hi> and by the 5. <hi>cap.

               <p>Murder premeditated, may be divided into that species which is simply such, Assasination, Murder under trust, and self Murder.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. Murder under trust, is with us, when a party who put himself under the assurance and trust of another, is murdered by him: and this is by a special statute punisht as trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Act. 51. <hi>P.</hi> 11. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6.

Assurance signifies, that when two persons were at fead, and the one hath found borrows to one another, Act 97. <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 6.3. Where persons at varience are under capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. 4 This Act has been stretcht to the conjugal trust betwixt man and wife, <hi>anno.</hi> 1627. <hi>Andrew Row,</hi> And yet in the Process intented against <hi>Swintoun,</hi> for killing his wife, <hi>anno.</hi> 1666. It being objected that this act extended not to such trusts as this, the pusurer restricted his Libel to Murder. And the Lords of Session, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1665. found that a sons killing his own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was not a murder under trust, punishable by this act: and yet it would appear, that both killing of wives and Children falls under that branch of the act, where the party is under the power of the slayer. This species of Murder was by the <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> called <hi>proditio,</hi> which is designed to be <hi>homicidium sub praetextu amicitiae, v. g. dum sederem tecum in mensa vel amici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam fingerem,</hi> which is punishable by a more severe death then ordinar Murders. And in <hi>Spain,</hi> the betrayer or proditor (for even in propriety of speech, Murder under trust is treachery, or Treason) <hi>trahitur ad caudam equi &amp; postea furca suspenditur,</hi> Gomez.</p>
               <p>By that act likewise, tryal should be taken by an assize; And therefore the Lords found, that though Mr. <hi>Iames Oliphant</hi> had been guilty of killing his Mother, and that it had been Treason, yet his forefaulter could not fall to the King, upon a simple Denunciation for not appearing to underly the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a tryal is requisite in this case.

brought from <hi>Ireland</hi> to be seiz'd upon, and the boats where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was brought, to be sunk, in prosecution whereof <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> Meal being Seiz'd, he broke the Seizure, and being follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Boate, by the said Mr. <hi>Archibald,</hi> and others, he was commanded to stay his Boat, but was so fare from obeying, though commanded in His <hi>Majestie</hi>'s name, that he had run almost down the Pannels little Boat, who was thereupon forced to shoot at them, and though this Act, <hi>ex post facto,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat into an act of killing, yet no killing was at first inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and the rise of all such Actions is to be first considered.</p>
               <p>To which it was replyed, that this act was to be understood <hi>civiliter,</hi> and did only impower the Leidges to Seize, but not to kill, and all mandats are to be so interpreted, as not to be extended, <hi>ad ea quae mandans in specie non mandasset,</hi> or <hi>quae soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est mandare si aliquando mandat non mandat nisi certa forma servata,</hi> but it cannot be subsumed that the Council would have allowed the importer of such victual, to be killed, nor do they use to intrust the execution of such Laws to Ministers; and if they had designed that the execution of this prohibition, should reach death, they would have expresly allow'd the Seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to kill, as they use to do in such cases. To which it was duply'd, that though the Minister was not obliedged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr because of his function, yet concurring as a Subject, he is not punishable therefore capitally; and if a Minister should concur when the hue and cry were raised after a night Thief, or if a Minister did assist such as pursued Rebels, and should kill in the pursuite, it were absurd to conclude that he should be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht as a Murderer, because he was not obliedged to kil: and it is not imaginable, but if it had been proposed to the Council what seizers should do, in case of resistance, but they would have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized them to kil; nor could their act receive compleat obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in case of resistance, for else such as resolve to contraveen, might secure themselves by their resistance, and the Council by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55274:74"/>
empowering to sink the Boat where the Victual is, does very clearly impower the killing of such as resist, for they might have been sunk in the Boat, and he who is allowed to sink a Boat, is allowed to sink all who are in it. Notwithstanding of which defences, the said Mr. <hi>Archibald</hi> was put to the knowledge of an inquest, and after the verdict was ordain'd to lose his head, but the Parliament having thereafter that same moneth allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their act, such as resisted to be killed, the said Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chibald</hi> was thereupon remitted as to the Crime, but was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver readmitted to his Church.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Militia</hi> Souldiers also being pursued for Murder, 3. <hi>Febr.</hi> 1674. alledged that they could not go to the knowledge of an inquest as Murderers, since if they killed, it was in prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Officers orders, for they being sent to Poynd, were resisted; and though it was reply'd, that opposition to the poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding could not warrand killing, but they might have pursued a ryot: This was alledged not to be relevant, because, <hi>sibi im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putent,</hi> who opposed, and Souldiers must do effectually what is commanded: and their Officers may shoot them if they return without effectuating what was commanded, and military com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands must not be delayed, nor opposed, like other commands. Notwithstanding of which debate they were found guilty.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. It is much controverted amongst the Doctors, whether it be lawful, <hi>occidere hannitum,</hi> a Person at the Horn, and by the Civil Law, <hi>non licet Bart. in l. ut vim. N.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. de inst. &amp; jure,</hi> but by the Statutes of particular places, they all conclude, it may be lawful, <hi>ob quietem publicam</hi>: and by our old Decisions, that the killing of such as are at the Horn for Slaughter, or other Crimes, is not Criminal, <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1600. <hi>Guthrie</hi> contra <hi>Iarden:</hi> but by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said 22. <hi>Act Par.</hi> 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. It is declared, that the killing such as are denounced, or declared Rebels, for Capital Crimes, or such as defend these Rebels, may be lawfully killed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is implyed, that such as are at the Horn for other Crimes,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55274:74"/>
may not be killed; and such could not be lawfully killed, who are only at the Horn for Pecunial Causes, and any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute allowing to kill such, would be null, <hi>Clar. hoc. tit num.</hi> 53. But it may be here doubted, what are these Criminal Causes, for which one at the Horn may be killed? for clearing whereof, it is fit to remember, that the Doctors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low only such to be killed, who are <hi>banniti ob grave delictum, Clar. num.</hi> 53. and in reason, it should be such a Crime, for which the Rebel hath deserved death, if he had appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for it seems rigid and unjust, that wherever the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the Summonds was Criminal, the Party being De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, may be killed; or that when ever the Rebel was Denounced for absence from a Justice-Court, he may be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, seing the common-good, which is the reason inductive of this Law, do's not require, nor in effect is not consistent with thir interpretations. 2. It may be doubted, if he who kills a Rebel for private revenge, and not <hi>ob vindictam publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,</hi> will have the benefite of this Defence: of this we have an instance, <hi>anno</hi> 1600. where <hi>Robert Auchmoutic</hi> being pursued for the Slaughter of <hi>Iames Wanchop,</hi> it was alledged that the Defunct was at the Horn, for receipting a Traitor: to which it was replyed, that the Pannel killed him upon a private quarrel, for having conversed with the Defunct long after he was at the Horn, for that cause: but that he killed him in a Duel, upon a privat quarrel: in respect whereof, the Pannels defence was repelled, and he put to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an Inquest, and thereafter beheaded. And yet I find the Doctors of opinion, that <hi>bannito occiso per inimicum oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens non reputatur homicida,</hi> and which is more, he will not have right to the reward promised for killing the Rebel, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravet in Prag.</hi> 1. <hi>de exul num.</hi> 134. and enemies are these who most probably will execute this publick Justice, which the Law designes. And seing our late Act makes no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt such as kill upon publick and private revenge;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55274:75"/>
I believe that the case now hath no difficulty, and that now the killer in both cases would be free from Punishment. Yet I think, that he who would kill a Rebel in a Combat, might yet be Pannelled, for contraveening that Act anent Duels; for though he might lawfully kill a Rebel, yet he could not lawfully fight a Duel. 3. It may be doubted, if he who was Denounced Rebel, was not lawfully Denounced, <hi>v. g.</hi> if he was out of the Countrey the time of the Charge, or that the Execution was not stamped, or wanted some Solemnity, if <hi>eo casu,</hi> the killer would be guilty of Murder: which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I find likewise propon'd in the former case, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, and very justly, for a privat Person is not oblieged to know these nullities. If any man resist the execution of his Majesties Laws, by Messengers, or other publick Servants, in that case, the Messenger cannot proceed to kill, as was found in <hi>Iohn Mackintoshes</hi> case, <hi>May</hi> 11. 1673. but if the resister do also proceed, to offer violence, by drawing upon the Messenger, in that case the Messenger may kill him law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, without necessity of proving that he would have been in danger of his life, if he had not killed; though privat persons cannot kill when they are invaded, except they be by that invasion put in danger of their life.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. Albeit ordinarily death, and the confiscation of Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, is the punishment of Murder; and that the life-rent of the Murderer doth not thereby fall; yet in some cases, the life-rent falls, as by the 118 <hi>Act</hi> 12. <hi>Par. Ia.</hi> 6. These who are denounced Rebels, for slaying men in the Church, or Church-yard, in the time of Prayer, Preaching, or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments, their Life-rents presently falls to the King (though <hi>regulariter</hi> Life-rent Escheits fall to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Superior, and the receipters do likewise loose their Life-rent Escheats; declarator being first past upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt. It may be here doubted, if these words, <hi>the time of Divine Service,</hi> may extend to slaughters, committed the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55274:75"/>
time of Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Albeit there be no Preaching, or Prayer for the time there: the reason of the doubt is, seing the 39. <hi>Act</hi> of the 6. <hi>Par. Q. M.</hi> anent removing, is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret: for by that Act, warning of Tennents should be used at the Paroch Church, the time of Preaching or Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: which words are thus interpret, the time that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uses to be, though there be none at the time.</p>
               <p>By the 219. <hi>Act Par.</hi> 14. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. If either the pursuer or defender in civil pursuits, kill one another, during the dependence, <hi>eo casu;</hi> the killer being put to the Horn, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for not compearance at the Dyet, or for not finding Caution, he loses his Life-rent Escheat immediatly upon the Denounciation.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. Murder is one of the four Plea's of the Crown, <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 11. and therefore the cognition thereof belongs to the Justices; and Commissions cannot be granted for tryal thereof, <hi>Act</hi> 74. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Par.</hi> 11. albeit it be now most ordinar, to grant such Commissions: and yet this Act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alleadged against one of those Commissioners, before the Council, they did recall the same: but if the Murderer be taken <hi>red hand,</hi> he may be judged by a Barron (having pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Pit and Gallows) by a Sheriff, or any other Judge ordinar; betwixt which, there is likewise this difference, that Murder is Bailable, <hi>Ia.</hi> 3. <hi>Par.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 42. But Slaughter taken red hand, is not Bailable; but the committer thereof should be judged within that Sun, <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. <hi>Par.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 89.95. And if the Barron or Sheriff proceed not within that time, the Cognition belongs only to the Justices, for they are Judges to Murder upon citation.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. By several old Acts, I find that the Sheriff, when a Murder is committed, may raise the Kings Horn (<hi>id est,</hi> the hue and cry, <hi>hoesium,</hi> as the Latine translation calls it) upon the Murder, and follow him out of his Sheriffdom, and send Letters to the next, and he to a third, and so till he
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55274:76"/>
be taken, and that when he is taken, Justice should be done upon him, within fourty dayes, and that he should be sent from Sheriff to Sheriff, to the place where the Crime was committed, which is now absolet; for if he be not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken red hand, the Sheriff cannot proceed against him; albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it it would appear that he may, if he be taken within fourty dayes, <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. <hi>Par.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 89. which I find no where abrogated, nor any thing to the contrair, except only <hi>Hops</hi> assertion, in his lesser Practiques, and that may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret also of Cognitions, after the fourty dayes are expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>By the 50. <hi>Act</hi> of the 6. <hi>Par. Ia.</hi> 1. It is Statuted, that Sheriffs in the former case, may proclaim the Murderer fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive, and forbid all the Lieges to receipt him, under the pain of losing Life and Goods; but this power is also abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. And the receipting Murderers seems not any accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except other presumptions be adduced, as if the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was committed upon the receipters account: in which case, receipting, may be arbitrarlily punisht, but of this, I find no formal Decision, only the Registers mention, that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Brice,</hi> being accused for receipting his own Son, who had Murdered <hi>Fairhop:</hi> it was alledged, that the receipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Son could be no Crime, <hi>nam proximitas sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis tollit praesumptionem criminis hoc casu Clar. quest.</hi> 110. <hi>num.</hi> 54. <hi>&amp; l.</hi> 2. <hi>ff. de recept.</hi> And receipt could only be interpret to be a Crime. In our Law, after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters are Denounced, and Letters of intercommuning ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained against them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Defence was thought so rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that the Justices demur'd upon it, but this received no Decision.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. When a man is killed by fore-thought fellony, the King can by our Law grant no Remission for the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Ia.</hi> 4. <hi>Par.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 63. and <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 169. But yet Remissions are daily granted, for such Murderers,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55274:76"/>
and are admitted in the Justice Court, notwithstanding of this objection, as in the Earl of <hi>Caithnes</hi> case, in <hi>anno</hi> 1668. And it is alledged, that these Acts are by the Stile, but temporary Acts. But all such Remissions are null, except the offender offer to Assith the Party: which Assithment is modified by the Council, and the Party cannot propon upon his Remission, till he find present Caution, to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what shall be modified, within fourty dayes, or else he must, during these fourty dayes, go to Prison, and if payment be not made within fourty dayes, his Remission is null, <hi>Ia.</hi> 2. <hi>Par.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 75.</p>

                  <hi>Assassinii crimen,</hi> or to kill a man by Assassination, is to Murder a man for Money; and this Species was introduced, first, by the Canon Law, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>de homicid. cap.</hi> 6. and had its name from the <hi>Assassini,</hi> who were a Tribe of the Phoenicians; and who fain'd themselves to be Christians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly Mahumetans, that they might kill Christians; and therefore, and because the foresaid Canon speaks only of Christians, it is still concluded, that only such as kill Christians, are to be repute Assassinats; and the killer of a Jew was found no Assassinate, <hi>Cavall. h. t. num.</hi> 475. And yet <hi>Matheus</hi> thinks, that all killing for Money, is Assassination; for this Crime being founded upon Nature, to kill a Jew is as far against Nature, as to kill a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. And it is a greater scandal upon our Religion, to kill a Jew, because it reproaches us amongst Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</p>
               <p>The Specialities introduced in this Crime, are, that the endeavour to kill for Money, is a Crime, though death follow not: and that Assassination may be proved, by presumptions; and that they cannot enjoy the benefite of a Sanctuary, or Girth, <hi>Cabal. num.</hi> 501.515.526. And though the foresaid Canon run only against such, as

               <p>DUels are but illustrious and honourable Murders. And there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore I have subjoyned this Title to the Title of Homicide: This is that imperious Crime, which triumphs over both publick revenge, and privat vertue, and tramples proudly upon both the Law of the Nation, and the life of our enemy. Courage thinks Law here to be but pedantrie, and honour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades men, that obedience here is cowardliness.</p>
               <p n="1">I. We find no such Crime as this among the <hi>Romans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that wise Nation employed their lives against their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and not against their fellow-Citizens: And the true tryal
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55274:78"/>
of courage among them, was fighting against the enemies of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Duels are either Judicial or Extrajudicial: Judicial Duels were these which were allowed by Law, for trying the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of such as wanted other legal probations.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Longabards</hi> first did allow this way of Duelling, by pulick authority, who did regulat it by twenty several deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations: And thereafter it was renewed by <hi>Philip,</hi> the fair King of <hi>France, Anno.</hi> 1360. but was bounded with these four conditions, 1. That it should only be allowed in Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and capital cases. 2. That it should only be allowed in Crimes treacherously committed, where the Truth could not be otherwayes found out. 3. Where there did lye strong presumptions against the persons provocked. 4. Where it was certain there was such a Crime committed against the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocker.</p>
               <p n="2">II. With us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Duels were allowed not only for clearing of innocence, as to Crimes, but likewise in civil cases, as when an Heir denyed that his predecessor granted a Conjunct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. <hi>R.M. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 47. And when any thing was deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be lawfully bought by the owner, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 4. But thereafter I find that by the 16. <hi>cap. Stat. Rob.</hi> 3. All duels are discharged, except in the four former cases allowed by <hi>Phillip</hi> the <hi>fair.</hi> The solemnity of Cartels used in such cases, was the casting of <hi>Gloves</hi> to one another, as is clear by <hi>Skeen, ad cap.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>R.

Duelliones in hoc regno hinc inde chiro thecas offerunt,</hi> which custome had its origine from the <hi>Longo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard</hi> Law above cited, as is clear by <hi>Long. de duel</hi>: and <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haud. tit. cod.</hi> The place appointed by our Law for such Duels, was the Bridge of <hi>Stirling. cap.</hi> 28. <hi>Stat. David.</hi> 2. And if the appealer in ordinar Crimes was foil'd and worsted his pledges payed the King nine Cowes and a Colpindach, and satisfied for the calumny, <hi>Stat. Alex. cap.</hi> 11. But in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the appealer worsted became in the Kings will, and the party appeased, being worsted, was disherished. <hi>R. M.</hi> L. 4.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55274:78"/>
                  <hi>c.</hi> 1. But these Duels are Discharged by the Canon Law. <hi>cap. monomachia.</hi> 2. <hi>quest.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp; cap. ultim Ext. de purg. vulg.</hi> though with us such judicial Combats, by authority, are not absolutly discharged, for, by the 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>Parl. I.</hi> 6. Wherein singular Combats are discharged, there is an exception made of such as are fought with His Higness licence.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Duels undertaken without publick authority, are thought by many Lawyers, to be lawful, when undertaken by a person who is injured in his honour, if the party injured cannot be otherwayes repaird; either because there is not a judge in the place, or else the injurer will not appear before him, or though he compear, the Judges refuses to do Justice, <hi>ubi enim deficit jus ibi suplet ensis &amp; propria ultio. Bart. in L. hostes num.</hi> 9. <hi>ff. de cap, &amp; postlin. revers.</hi> And many are of opinion that these privat Combats are lawful, for defence of our honour, and as we may defend our life by taking that of our neighbours, so we may defend our honour by the hazard of his life.</p>
               <p>But that Duels are in themselves unlawful by all Law, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very clearly from these reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Law has justly thought fit that the Magistrat only should do justice to all, and that no private man should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himself; for in so far he commits treason, in assuming the power of the Civil Magistrate. 2. The power of taking and using Arms, belongs only to the Common-wealth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently no private man should run to Armes, upon an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination that he is wronged in his honour. 3. There is no proportion betwixt the injury and reparation, in such cases a verbal injury being too severely punished, when punished by death, there being no proportion betwixt what may be helped, and what may not. 4. Revenge belonging to God, it is an usurping of his power. It is the destroying that body which is the Temple of God, the defaceing of his image (whereas to deface even a Princes, Image, designedly is Treason) and it is a spilling of that blood for which Christ shed his. 5. It is
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55274:79"/>
a crime against a mans self, and is in effect self-murder: Nor need those who resolve to kill themselves, take a base way, since this honourable way is easy and patent, for he may soon make quarrels, and so kill constantly till he be killed.</p>
               <p>It is a Crime against the common wealth, because it destroys its subjects, and makes the hateful sin of Murder a desireable effect of Glory. It is likewise a great offence against our friends, since it drawes them, though innocent, into the same snare, as seconds, assisters, and revengers: and it is dishonourable, because it wrongs a mans wife, by making her miserable, and notwithstanding of his many obligations to her. 6. It is an unjust decision of controversies, since strength, skill, or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, prevail oftentimes against honour and innocence, so that this tryal should neither be allowed, by justice, nor honour: and therefore <hi>Augustus</hi> being provoked by <hi>Anthony,</hi> did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly answer, that if <hi>Anthony was weary of his life, he might take any other way to dispatch himself.</hi> And <hi>Sertorius</hi> being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocked by <hi>Metellus,</hi> answered, <hi>it was below a General to dye like a common Souldier:</hi> And therefore it may be answered to the contrary arguments, that it is to be presumed the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate will do justice in repairing the fame of him who is wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor can a Duel restore the fame that is lost; for a Duel shews only a man to be resolute, or desperat, without being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, or generous: and it is more presumable, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocke was justly defamed, and finding himself unable to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the shame, resolves to dispatch himself by this plausible way of self-murder, nor can a man take a more easy way of publishing that wherein he was defamed, then by killing the defamer, whereby he will both bring himself and the occasion of that accident into the mouths of the world. Though that act discharge only singular Combats: And that the word <hi>singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Combat</hi> is properly only applicable to the fighting of two single persons, which is only properly called <hi>singulare certa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> yet this <hi>singulare certamen,</hi> or <hi>singular Combat</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:55274:79"/>
enough extended where moe fight on a side. <hi>Cagnol. in l. Favorabiliores</hi> 86. <hi>ff. de reg. jur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. Since fighting of singular combats is only declared puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shable, therefore the giving or receiving challenges is not puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shable by death, though even that be likewise punishable by the Council <hi>Arbitrarie,</hi> as ending to disturb the peace; but since the very fighting is declared punishable by death, it follows necessarily, that such as fight Combats, are punishable by death, though neither party be killed: And if only killing had been punishable by death, this act had been unnecessary, since that was punishable as Murder before this act.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. If any person be killed, the libel is founded both upon the Acts against murder, and this act against Duels. But the difference betwixt the way of libelling is this; that if the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel be only founded upon the acts against Murder, then self-defence is receiveable by way of exculpation to eleid this libel, because self-defence there, is not contrair to any quality of the libel, which must be expresly proved, for the quality of fore-thought fellony must necessarily be libelled in Murder. Yet it needs not be proved, and so the probation of the defence and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, are not contrary. Whereas in Duels an express provocation must be lybel'd and proved, and so the probation of the libel and defence would be contrary, as was found in the case of <hi>Mackie,</hi> in <hi>Iune,</hi> 1670. where it was likewise found that a challenge given and accepted, did infer a Duel and it was not sufficient, that the party provocked, coming thereafter to the field, was set upon, and put in hazard of his life by the provocker; for though <hi>primus insultus,</hi> be sufficient to defend against fore-thought fellony in other cases, yet where there preceeded a provocation, it is not sufficient, because he who was provocked by going to the place, <hi>versabatur in illicito,</hi> and so should not have the benefite of self-defence. And if this were allowed, the party provocked might easily elude this statute, because he might accept the challenge: And yet when he is upon the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55274:80"/>
place, refuse to fight, untill he were set upon by the other, and put even in hazard of his life by him, which method being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by one <hi>Robertson,</hi> a Souldier in <hi>Linlithgow</hi>'s Regement, he was notwitstanding found guilty of Murder, in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1673.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. From this it appears likewise that such as in answer to challenges, do declare, that they will be in such a place at such a time, and if the provocker attaque, they will defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they fall within the compasse of this act, since by decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a formal answer, they designe to cheat the Law, for by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing place and time, they in effect accept of the challenge; &amp; this can neither be called a meer rancounter, nor self defence, as is most justly debated by <hi>Voet. de duel. cap.</hi> 33. <hi>quest.</hi> 1. but if any man getting a challenge, shall answer, that he will not transgress the Law, but if the challenger shall attaque him, he will defend himself, if this person thereafter in defence kill, he will not be punishable by this act, for self defence does not leave off to be a legal defence, because the person attaqued promises he will defend himself.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Both the provocker and provocked, killing, are by this act not only punishable with death, but by confiscation of their moveables; and the provocker is declared lyable to such ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary punishments as his <hi>Majesty</hi> shall think fit, because his guilt is greatest, for the party provocked hath still his guilt les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened with a shadow of self-defence.</p>
               <p>Not only are Seconds art and part, but even those who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the challenge, though they were no Seconds: and yet it may be alledged, that these cannot be punished with death, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they were present, since the carrying a challenge is but an incompleat act, <hi>&amp; nudus conatus.</hi> But yet it may be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that if death follow upon a Combat, wherein they carried the challenge, they are punishable as murderers, since the crime was compleated by their complices. In <hi>Iune.</hi> 1676. <hi>David Hamiltoun</hi> was found guilty, though it was alledged that albeit he had come to seek the length of his gear who was to fight
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55274:80"/>
with his Son, yet that was done but upon designe to terrifie the other to fight, as appears, not only by the strangeness of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, but because he did tear the challenge, how soon ever he got it in his hands: and albeit it was proved that he did trip up the mans heels who was fighting with his son, yet that was done meerly to end the Combat, he having taken his own Son in his armes immediatly thereafter.</p>
               <p>In this case it was likewise alledged, that those who were adduced witnesses could not be received, because they had come out of the house with the other party to the field; and being very many in number, they might have stopt the Combat, if they had pleased: notwithstanding of which objection, they were received. But I conceive, that since all men are oblieged, as farr as in them lyes, to keep the peace, and hinder crimes, it seems very reasonable, that if many who might hinder, do tamly look on, without offering to redd or separat the parties, they should be punished; and this should hold not only in any of the Kings officers who are present, or in any who are commanded by them whom <hi>Cook</hi> observes to be fineable, <hi>pag.</hi> 158. but even in all who are present, though the punishment, as to them, sholud be lesse, then as to the others, <hi>idem est facere, &amp; nolle prohibere cum possis: &amp; qui non prohibet cum prohibere possit in culpa est.</hi>

               <p n="2">II. Yet furiosity and madness, ought to defend against all Punishment in this case, since a furious Person has no will in the construction of Law; and the will is that which makes the Crime: nor should they be more punished then Infants are, to whom the Law compares them. Fury also defends against Treason, Blasphemy, and Heresie, which are more atrocious Crimes, then Self-murder, <hi>&amp; facti infelicitas furiosum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendere dicitur, l. infans ad l. Corn. de sic:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot well understand, wherefore in <hi>Dobbies</hi> case (as <hi>Craig</hi> relates it) the Lords repelled the Defence of Furiosity, and found that even furious Persons ought to lose their Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, if they killed themselves; but I think, the fury there has not been strongly qualified, and that it has been but a Species of Melancholy: for the reason given for that Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is, because the Lords thought no man would kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if he were not distracted: and so it distraction could defend such as killed themselves, against confiscation of their Moveables, it would defend all who kill'd themselves, and so the Law should have no effect; but this must be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, of some degrees of madness, for sure no man kills himself, except he who is somewhat mad. Nor does Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondrick fits, or the first degrees of madness, defend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Confiscation, but a total aberration from reason,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55274:82"/>
cannot but defend; which is also clear from the Law of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, Bolton. Cap.</hi> 11. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. and the difference betwixt these two must be inferred from the various circumstances, which attends such diseases, and from the declarations of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, who waited upon them.</p>
               <p>Whether one who is mad, but has lucid intervals, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to have killed himself in his madness, or lucid intervals, is not so clear, and depends much upon Circumstances: but since none use to kill themselves, except under some distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; so therefore, it is more humane to refer this killing, to have been in the hours of madness, except it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the killer used even in his lucid intervals, to wish he were dead, or to commend Self-Murder, <hi>vid. Cabal. cas.</hi> 289.</p>
               <p n="3">III. An endeavour to kill ones self is punishable, as Self-Murder, if the killer did all that in him was, to effectuat it; as if he hang'd himself, but was immediatly cut down. And by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> if a man wound himself mortally, though he live year and day thereafter, his Goods falls to the King, <hi>Bolton, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Self-Murder may be committed by omission, as well as commission, thus if a man would starve himself to death, he might be punisht by confiscation of his Moveables; but the design must be clearly proved, since as many inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent people might be alledged, to have killed themselves, whilst they have fasted, either through pain or necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="5">V. When a man kills himself, his Majesty gifts his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat, and the Donator pursues a general Declarator thereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, wherein he calls the nearest of kin, and he must prove there, that the Person, whose Escheat he has got, killed himself; which must be proved, by clear and convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, such as the depositions of Witnesses, or a Paper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the Defuncts hand, wherein he declares the reasons of his discontent, and why he killed himself, which is very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in these cases, wherein they design thereby to justifie to the world, this horrid Act: But I think, presumptions are not sufficient here, since this is a Crime except they be very strong and violent; but if they be such, it appears, they are sufficient to infer Confiscation: for though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions be not sufficient to prove a Crime, to infer Capital punishment, yet they are oftimes sustained, to infer Confiscation of Moveables, or other civil ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. And if presumptions were not sufficient in this case, Self-Murder could never be proved, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters choose retired places, and quiet times, for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their wicked designe: and who could say, but that if a man were known, to have exprest much dispair, and thereupon to have entered into a Room, and were found with the Door closed, and hanging in his own Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but that these presumptions would infer Confiscation of his Moveables.</p>
               <p>By our practice, thir Declarators have been sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Lords, upon probation of the Self-Murder, led before themselves, without any previous tryal before the Justices: and some think such a previous tryal not necessar; for all tryals before them, are by Assizers, and dead men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be tryed by an Assize: but it might be alledged upon the other hand, that such a previous tryal before the Justices, is more suitable to the analogy of all other Crimes, which are all tryed before the Justices; and though it may be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Lords jurisdiction is here founded, <hi>ratione inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiae,</hi> and that many Crimes are tryed before them, as fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling incidently in other civil cases; yet even in falshood, though the Lords of Session are Judges competent to the deed it self: Yet no mans Escheat falls upon their Decreet, though he be found a falsary by them, till he be also tryed by the Justices, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55274:83"/>
the Escheat falls, as an effect of their sentence only. Nor has this exception been yet repelled, as to Self-Murder, so that <hi>res est ad huc integrae,</hi> especially if the persons whose Escheat is craved, to be declared, be yet alive; so that he may be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before an Assize, for having endeavoured to kill himself: for some endeavours to kill ones self, are punishable by death, though prevented, as has been said formerly. And in that case, I conceive that a previous tryal before the Justices, is necessar.</p>

               <p n="1">I. PAricide is a Crime, which is committed by killing our Parents, against which, <hi>Solon</hi> refused to make any Law, lest he should by forbidding it, teach the people it was possible. By the Civil Law, Paricide was committed by killing Ascendents, or Descendents, in any degree: or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterals to the fourth degree. The killing likewise of Wife, Husband, or Patron, was Paricide by that Law, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. h. t.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. With us, Paricide is by the <hi>Statute</hi> 220. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6 <hi>Par.</hi> 14. punished only in him who kills his Father, Mother,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55274:84"/>
Good-sir, or Good-dame; and these are by that Act, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be disherished, and their posterity, <hi>in linea recta,</hi> are incapable of succeeding to the person killed: but the succession is devolved upon the next Collateral, or near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of Blood; the person guilty being convict by an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>size.</p>
               <p>From which Act, it is observable, that the Statute is not exclusive of other punishments: but supposes that Paricide is capitally punishable, according to the Common Law; for it were absurd to think, the punishment here related, should be the only punishment, by which Paricide could be reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And Women for murdering their Children, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently either hanged, or headed, as other Murderers. 2. This Act reaches only such, as are convict by an Assize; and therefore <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1664. it was found, that Sir <hi>Iames Oliphant</hi> being declared Fugitive, for killing his Mother, but not convict by an Assize, his Estate could not be gifted by the King: and in effect, though he had been found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by an Assize, he could not have been forefaulted, for the nearest Collateral would seclude the Fisk. It was likewise found in that case, that the Son could not be forefaulted, as having murdered his Mother, under Trust, for they found that, not to be the Murder, which is declared Treason by the 11. <hi>Par. cap.</hi> 51. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. For the trust there mentioned is, when such as came under the trust of others, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who would not have come within their reach, without special assurance of indemnity, and protection; and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated as a received tradition amongst us, that this Act were first made upon <hi>Mack-donald,</hi> his killing the Laird of <hi>Mack-clane,</hi> who came to lodge with him, upon such assurance; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the feids which were amongst them. It were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise improper to say, that the Mother was under the power and assurance of the Son; and if the power, and assurance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Parents and Children, could fall under that Act, <hi>Par.</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:55274:85"/>
11. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. this Act had been unnecessar, and there could have been no place for the pain therein contained; for the Estate of the Traitor belongs to the Fisk, and not to the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Collateral.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It may be doubted, if this Act should be extended to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents killing their Children; and albeit the Statute does not, <hi>in terminis,</hi> expresse Descendants: yet it is probable they may fall under its Sanction: Even as the foresaid Text, in the Civil Law is extended to equal degrees, with these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, <hi>ob paritatem rationis.</hi> And by that Law, the killing of Ascendents, or Descendents, is Paricide, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. And the Rubrick of this Act, runns generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Paricide: nor can it be denyed, but Paricide is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Mothers against their Children, and Women day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are convict thereof.</p>
               <p>Whether the foresaid Statute against Paricide can be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to degrees of Affinity, as well as degrees of Consanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; so that to kill a father-in-law, may be punished as Paricide, as well as the killing a father may be doubted: but I conceive it extends not to degrees of Affinity; because 1. Laws against Crimes should not be extended. 2. The statute dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging, Fathers, Brothers, or Sons, to judge in the causes of these relations, is not extended to brothers-in-law &amp;<hi>c.</hi> though that extension would be more favourable. 3. Some of these relations in this statute, cannot in propriety of speech, be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to degrees of Affinity, for we say not good-sir, or good-dame in Law, and albeit. §. 6. <hi>just. de publ. judic.</hi> uses the word <hi>adfinitatis</hi> in this crime, yet <hi>Theoph.</hi> in his Greek <hi>instit. eod</hi> §. expresses the same, by the words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and this shews advantages by the Greek Lawyers.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Whether it doth extend to Bastards, may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55274:85"/>
for though it be certain, that since they know their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it may be therefore extended against them, if they kill her, or she them. Yet since their Father is uncertain, <hi>nam sunt vulgo quaesiti, &amp; patrem demonstrare nequeunt</hi>; and since they have no advantage by their Father in law, it were hard the Law should punish them, as Paricides. But yet Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers conclude they may be punisht, for <hi>paricid. Allex. ad lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de injur. voc.</hi> and since this is a Crime against the Law of Nature, it may be punisht in Bastards, who are natural Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p n="5">V. This Crime extends not to Moveables by the Act, but by our Law; wherever the Law punishes by death, it implyes confiscation, for Moveables followeth still the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And by the Law of <hi>France,</hi> (from which we have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed this, and many other things) <hi>qui confisque le corps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fisque les biens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is probable that upon this Act, even absents may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict of this Crime; as the Lords then thought, if the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Letters, had born the Penalty here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest. For albeit probation cannot be led, in absence of the Party, to fix a Crime upon him, yet this seems to be a civil effect, which strikes not against the person of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>By the Civil Law also, all Murderers were debarred from succeeding to such whom they murdered. <hi>l. cum ratio. §. sin. ff. de bonis damnat,</hi> which is yet observed in <hi>France,</hi> but though with us there be no contrary decision; yet with us they are not debarred; and seeing this pain is only statuted in the case of Paricide, we may by a natural consequence conclude, that it should not be extended to ordinary Murders.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. By the Act 20. <hi>Parliament.</hi> 1. <hi>Ses.</hi> 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. Beating or Cursing of Parents, is declared to have been punishable by the Law of God, with death: And therefore ordains, that whatsoever Son, or Daughter, above the age of Sixteen, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55274:86"/>
not distracted, shall beat or curse his Father or Mother, he shall die without mercy, but if they be within the age of Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and past pupilarity, they are to be punisht arbitrarily: From which it is to be observed, 1. That this Crime is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly statutory, and therefore should not extend beyond the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the act to grand-fathers, or grand-children, albeit <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellatione filii &amp; nepos comprehenditur in favorabilibus.</hi> 2. That arbitrary punishment is opposed to death, and so never can be extended in other acts to death. 3. That those who are not above the age of Pupilarity, are not capable to commit crimes, nor should be punished, for they are here accompted as distracted persons, and if they were punishable for any Crimes, it behoved to be for such as are against the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. It is very easy, and too ordinary for women who bear Bastards, to murder them; And therefore to obviat this, the Law presumes so far, a woman who has born a bastard, and has conceal'd her being with child, to be guilty of Paricide, if the child be found dead, that it punishes her by some extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry punishment, (but not by death) except she can prove that the child was born dead: Thus it was decided in <hi>Savoy.</hi> 1595 <hi>vid. Cod. fab. de his qui parent occid. Def.</hi> 11. And with us <hi>Lawson,</hi> and <hi>Ramsey,</hi> were both Scourged, <hi>annis</hi> 1661. and 1662. even though they were assoylzied from the Murder: But I think that this were severe, if the woman openly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that she was with child, though none was present when she brought it forth. And in all such cases women are admitted to be witnesses.</p>
               <p>The taking potions also, to make one part with child, <hi>abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum procurans,</hi> should be a species of Paricide, in my opinion, since she thus endeavours to kill her own child: and by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law, it was punisht with death. <hi>L. Cicero. ff. de paenis.</hi> And though the Doctors distinguish here, betwixt the using such means after the child is quick, or before it, making it capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall in the one case, but not in the other; yet they presume
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55274:86"/>
that the child was quick, <hi>quod fetus erat animatus,</hi> and that <hi>in odium delinquentis,</hi> and burden the delinquent to prove the contrair, <hi>Gomes: de delict cap.</hi> 3. <hi>num.</hi> 32. asserts that this is presumed not to inferr death, but Ecclesiastick punishment; and since to prove the contrair, seems to me, impossible, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to <hi>Gomesius,</hi> his opinion: but yet the using such means, even before the birth be quick, is arbitrarily punishable, as is even the using means to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55274:87"/>
though not in the very act, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Lawyers think, that he should be only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht by banishment, but not by death, and that generally for whatever crime, or fault, a father may exheredat a son, that the same fault will excuse the father from death if he kill his son. <hi>l. divus ff. de paricid &amp; Cabal. cas.</hi> 15. Some also think that a woman killing her husband who is banished, and upon whose head a Fyne is put, is not punishable by death, because her husband is, <hi>nullus injure,</hi> and Laws allow all to kill such a person, without any distinction betwixt wives or others: yet other Lawyers have concluded, that she should be punished by death, since such sentences, loose not the wifes natural obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, but he is still her husband, and the Law owns so far the relations, as not to punish her for omitting to kill him, or for cohabiting with him, <hi>Cub. consil.</hi> 278.

               <p>INcest is defined by the <hi>Civilians,</hi> to be, <hi>faeda &amp; nefaria ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris &amp; f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Incest is divided into two branches, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against the Law of Nature; and into that which is committed against the Municipal Law of the Countrey. All copulation betwixt ascendants and descendants, such as Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Father, Mother, Son, Daughter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is by all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be Incest against the Law of Nature. But it is controverted, whether the Brothers lying with the sister, be incest against the Law of Nature: And the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> alledge it is not, Because it was allowed at the beginning; and therefore they conclude that the Pope may dispense therewith; And this is the first difference betwixt that Incest which is committed against the Law of Nature, and that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against the Municipal Law.</p>
               <p>The second difference betwixt them is, that the pain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest when it is committed against the Law of Nature, is death: but when against the Municipal Law, it is only deportation, <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>ff. de quest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:55274:88"/>The third difference is, that Incest committed only against the Municipal Law, is excused (in a woman, <hi>in figura matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monii</hi>) but ignorance of the Law of Nature is not; But the man is inexcusable in either, <hi>Matheus hoc tit. Num.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>The fourth difference is, that if a Marriage contracted, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinded, as incestuous, all the committers goods are confiscat, if the Incest be committed against the Law of Nature: but the Tocher and Joynter are only confiscat, if the Incest be only committed against the Municipal Law, <hi>Matheus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Our Law does not observe the above-written distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it is universally, <hi>Statut. act</hi> 14. <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>I.</hi> 6. That whosoever pollutes his body with such persons in degree, as Gods word doeth contain in the 18. of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> shall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with death; Albeit by these words of the act whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abuses his body, it would seem that such as actually copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, are only punishable by this act: Yet I think <hi>nudus conatus,</hi> or endeavour, is punishable by death, as it is in Sodomy; in which, endeavour is punishable, by the opinion of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, though by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> Sodomy requires <hi>habu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse rem veneream, &amp; puerum carnaliter cognovisse, Cook. p.</hi> 59. albeit the manner of death is not exprest in this act, yet practick hath determined the same, to be hanging; as in the case of <hi>Barnoch,</hi> who was hanged for committing Incest with his own Sister, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 8. 1641. And of <hi>Ioan Knox,</hi> who was hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for committing Incest with her husbands brother <hi>May</hi> 1646. Sometimes it is likewise punished with heading, as in the case of <hi>Iames Strang,</hi> who was beheaded for committing Incest with his brothers daughter, the 4. of <hi>April.</hi> 1649.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Sodomy,</hi> is when a man lyes with a man, for which both are punishable by death, <hi>l. cum vir nubit. C. de adult.</hi> they are burnt in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> as <hi>Gothofred</hi> observes. By the 25. act: <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. Sodomy is declared Fellony, and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fellony by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> is in all cases to be
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55274:88"/>
hanged by the neck till death.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Carpzovius,</hi> and the other Doctors, are of opinion, that confession alone is not a sufficient probation in this Crime, except other presumptions concur for clearing that the Crime was truly committed, yet with us the confession it self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other adminicles, is sufficient to inferr the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death except the confessor be known, or at least suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be distempered.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. Bestiality is, when a man lyes with a beast, which the <hi>Romans</hi> also punished with death, and in which some Lawyers affirm the endeavour is as highly punishable, as the crime it self, <hi>effectus sine affectu, Papon. lib.</hi> 22. <hi>tit.</hi> 7. <hi>art.</hi> 1. <hi>Damhaud. cap.</hi> 96. <hi>n.</hi> 16.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But yet other Lawyers conclude, that even in this crime the endeavour is punishable by a less severe punishment then death: which seems clear by <hi>l.</hi> 1. §. <hi>fin. ff. de extraord. crim. qui puero stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prum abducto ab eo vel corrupto comite, persuaserit, aut mulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem puellamve interpellaverit, quidve impudicitiae gratia fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, perfecto flagitio punitur capite, imperfecto in insulam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portatur.</hi> And though in hotter Countreys. where Custome, and Climat, lessens this Crime, the Crime is by their Lawyers thought punishable less severely; yet with us death ought to punish it, if the delinquent was only letted by others.</p>
               <p>And in both thir crimes of Sodomy and Bestiality, witnesses who are lyable to exceptions will be received, because of the attrocity of the crime. <hi>Bos. de judiciis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have no particular statute for punishing either Sodomy,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55274:89"/>
or Bestiality, for they are crimes extraordinar, and rarely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in this Kingdom: but our Libels bear, That albeit by the Law of the Omnipotent God, as it is declared in the 20. <hi>c.</hi> of <hi>Leviticus. As well the man who lieth with mankind, as the man who lieth with a beast, be punishable by death.</hi> Yet <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ordinar punishment in both these, is burning, and the beast is also burnt, with which the Bestiality is committed: as in the case of <hi>Iames Fiddes,</hi> who being convict of Bestiality, was ordained to be burnt in the last of <hi>May,</hi> 1650. And Major <hi>Weir, April,</hi> 1670. Yet sometimes it is only punished by hanging, and thus <hi>Iohn Logie</hi> was only hanged in <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1642. and <hi>Iames Wilson</hi> was only hanged for the same crime, 15. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1649. which last Sentence bore, that the execution should be very early in the morning, and ordained the Mare with which the Buggery was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to be drowned in any Mosse or Loach.</p>

Which act insinuats that the Crime is otherwayes Capital, else that act had been unnecessar.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The definition given of a Rapt, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>R.M.</hi> is, that it is the unjust oppressing of a woman, by a man, against the Kings peace, in which it differs from the Civil Law; at least from some Doctors, who alledge, that lying with a woman, or abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing her body violently, is not a Rapt, except she be carryed from one place to another: Albeit they do confesse, that this violence is punishable by deportation, or banishment, and is, as some affirm, <hi>non Raptus, sed Stuprum, l.</hi> 3. <hi>C. de ad leg. Iu l. de vi.</hi> But yet other Lawyers, and chiefly <hi>Mathaeus,</hi> doe conclude, that albeit the away taking, and the forcing, or violent abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a womans body, be differently punished; yet they are degrees of the same crime, and both are Rapts: But according to our Law, both are Rapts, and both punishable by death. Neither does our Law make any distinction, <hi>inter Raptores, &amp; deforciatores mulierum,</hi> betwixt Ravishers, and Deforcers of women; and it were most unreasonable, that he who defloures a woman violently, should not be as severely punished, as he who only caries her from one place to another: for as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ravished looses more by that abuse, then by her transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; so it were absurd, that <hi>apparatus ad crimen,</hi> should be more severely punished, then <hi>effectus criminis</hi>; that the accomplishment of the crime should be a lesse guilt then the preparations to it: amongst which this transportation is but one.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If the woman be taken away upon any other accompt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55274:90"/>
then that of lust, it is not a Rapt, and so if she be very old, or if the away-taker had a quarrel against her, it is not a Rapt, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius concil.</hi> 234.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Quae.</hi> What if the Ravisher did not carnally know the person Ravished, whether in that case, the away-taker be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable as a Ravisher capitally? and albeit the ordinar di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction be, that if he did not, because he could not, then he is punishable: but if it was in his power to have defloured her, but abstained, then he is not to be punished capitally, but only arbitrarily <hi>Clar. §. raptus num.</hi> 4. Yet I think, that in our Law he is in no case to be punished capitally, except he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured her: For 1. In the foresaid 1. <hi>cap. l.</hi> 1. <hi>R. M.</hi> it is said, that <hi>affectus sine effectu,</hi> is punishable in Treason, because of the great wrong done to the whole Kingdom: but this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ceaseth in Rapts, and when Rapts are spoken of, in the immediat next Verse, this is not repeated. 2. The glosse upon the word, oppressed by a man, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 8. interprets oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to be suppression, or corruption, and in the 9. Verse of that Chapter, it is rendered corruption, and it is spoken of there, as <hi>faedatio mulier is &amp; pollutio.</hi> 3. By the <hi>Norman</hi> Law, with which our old customs have much contingency, Rapt is called <hi>depucellement des femmes a force, l.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 1. Yet I think that any such wrong done to a woman, is punishable, <hi>tanquam crimen in suo genere,</hi> and after the crime of Rapts, or Ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is spok of in that chapter, it is said <hi>v.</hi> 8. That if a woman accuse a man of any other wrong done to her body, she will be heard.</p>
               <p>In that Chapter also, it is appointed the woman Ravished go whilst the crime is recent to the next Town, and there show to honest men the blood, or other wrong done her, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after go to the Mair of the Lordship, or to the Toscheoderoch, which <hi>Skeen, ad. R. M. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. interprets to be <hi>Serjandus curiae,</hi> but <hi>Boeth.</hi> in his History calls them <hi>latrunculatores,</hi> or the maker of thieves: And thereafter to the Sheriff, and last of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55274:91"/>
all to the Justice: But the form now is only to raise Letters, as in other crimes, before the Justice. And albeit of old, she was obliedged to insist within 24. hours, <hi>intra unam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctem,</hi> else not to be heard, <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>R. M.</hi> Yet that is now antiquated by custome; Albeit it was a strong presumption in the opinion of the Doctors, and is so in our practick, that the pursuit is malicious, when it is delayed; for it is most presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that a woman would not conceal any time such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is doubted much among the Doctors, if women who ravish men are punishable as ravishers; And albeit our Law speaks still of ravishing women, yet I think that as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are guilty of man-slaughter, so women may be guilty of this crime: and by the 9. <hi>v. c.</hi> 8. <hi>R. M.</hi> It will appear that this was designed for both Sexes: Albeit I think it be not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable by death, seing it cannot take effect, except the man pleases, <hi>&amp; affectus sine effectu non punitur capitaliter, in hoc crimine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. By the opinion of Lawyers, the subsequent consent of the women ravished, did not absolve the committers, <hi>Cin. in l. un. h. t.</hi> And albeit by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> Marriage may be contracted lawfully betwixt them, yet the committer is still punishable; and by the foresaid Law <hi>C. de raptu,</hi> the words are, <hi>nec sit facultas raptae raptorem suum sibi maritum exposcere.</hi> But by the foresaid Act. <hi>I.</hi> 6. <hi>P.</hi> 21. this question is determined with us, for that consent only saves from capital punishment, for the committer may be put to the knowledge of an inquest, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the instance of his <hi>Majestie</hi>'s Advocat, or the Parents or nearest kin, from which Act it may be observed. 1. That the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat or nearest of kin may insist, without one anothers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curse. 2. That if the nearest of kin do not insist, they who are in remoter degrees cannot insist in this case, and crave that the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visher may be put to the knowledge of an Assize, although the woman declare that she was not ravished. Albeit I think that before any such consent be declared, any of her friends may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55274:91"/>
                  <hi>l. un. C. de rapt, &amp; si pater injuriam remiserit extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us reum postulare poterat.</hi> 3. Except it be proved that the rapt was committed at first, without consent of the woman, and nearest of kin, it is most punishable. It may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, that if either the nearest of kin, or she, consented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rapt, it is not punishable: and it is probable, that if the nearest of kin consented, though the woman did not, the away-taking is not capitally punishable; for where the nearest of kin, and parents consent, the ravisher deserves not so severe a punishment as death. 4. Because the womans consent is so hard to be known, for she might have at first consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, albeit she cryed or resisted upon designe: Therefore I think her Oath should be first required, and if she be content to swear that she went willingly alongst, that should, in my judgement, preclude the pursuers from any further pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit; or if they can prove that there was any designe of marriage amongst them, previous to the away-taking, <hi>Marsil: consil. ibi &amp; Boss. de rapt. N.</hi> 17.5. Since by the foresaid Act, it is said, that if any be pursued as art and part of rapt, the womans consent in that case shall free them from capital punishment: it may be doubted if the womans consent will free from capital punishment, him who is pursued as principal actor, since the act is not express as to him, and since he deserves not so much favour as the complices do: But yet I conceive the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour should be extended to him, both because our Law equals principals and complices, and because the Doctors, and the Laws of other Nations extend this: Before this act by the 8. <hi>cap. R. M. l.</hi> 4. And yet it is declared there, that it shall be Lawfull to the pairties to marry with His <hi>Majesties</hi> consent. The Arbitrary punishment allowed his <hi>Majesty</hi> by the foresaid Act of Parliament, <hi>I.</hi> 6. is not interpret so, that his <hi>Majesty</hi> should be personally consulted, but His Majesties council sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that in his absence; as was found in the Baxters case, 1666.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:55274:92"/>Albeit this crime be capital, and that <hi>William Bannatine</hi> was hanged for taking away the Laird of <hi>Achingters,</hi> daughter, 5. <hi>Iuly</hi> 1596. yet I find that <hi>Iohn Kincaid</hi> having come in the Kings will, <hi>Feb.</hi> 1601. for ravishing <hi>Isobel Hutchison,</hi> a widow, the King only fined him in 2500 Merks. <hi>Hary Speed</hi> was hang'd 20. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1639. <hi>quia laceravit pudenda pueri,</hi> which crime, <hi>Iul. Clar. Gothofred,</hi> and others, affirms to be also capital in their Countries.</p>
               <p>I find one Leivtenent <hi>Ker,</hi> pursued for ravishing and away-taking <hi>Robert Cuninghame,</hi> 6. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1640. but this is rather a species of <hi>Plagium</hi> then of Rapt.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Since minors are punishable by death for adultery, much more ought they to be punishable by death for a rapt, since the injury is there both more attorcious, and more unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; and <hi>Carp. part</hi> 2. <hi>Quest.</hi> 75. gives us several instances where this Crime was capitally punished in minors, where he likewise tells us, that to force even a common Whore is capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally punishable, though it may seem that they are <hi>infralegum observantiam,</hi> and they ought not to have the protection of the Law, who offend against it.</p>

               <p>ADultery is a Sin, whereby men not only violat the second Table, in wronging their neighbour, by stealing from him his quiet, his good name, the affection and person of his wife, endeavouring also ofttimes to steal his estate for the adulterous
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55274:93"/>
children; But is likewise a breach of the first, in breaking of that vow which was made to God in marriage, and contemning that holy and mighty Majesty, who was then called upon, as Judge and witnesse.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Adulterium est vitiatio alterius thori,</hi> the violation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bed, and is committed by a married persons lying with an unmarried, or an unmarried person lying with one who is married. For albeit by the Civil Law when a man who was married, did lye with a woman who was free, that was judged to be no adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; And albeit the lying with a Whore, by the Civil Law, was judged no Adultery, <hi>l.</hi> 22. <hi>Cod. hoc tit. Si ea quae stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pro tibi cognita est &amp; passim venalem formam exhibuit ac prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutam meritricio more vulgo se praebuit adulterii crimen in ea ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sat.</hi> Upon which Law the Doctors conclude, that though he who first debaushed a woman with adultery, be punishable as an adulterer yet these who did thereafter debaush her, cannot <hi>Farr. Quest.</hi> 141. <hi>num.</hi> 85. Yet this is against both the Law of God and our Law, for the Lying with another mans wife is still A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, but so it is, that though she be a whore, yet she is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Wife. Nor is the marriage disolved by the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; And yet I think, that if the woman with whom the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery is committed, was at the time when the same was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, living as a common whore, and the committer was a single man, who knew not of her being married, his punishment should be somewhat moderat upon that accompt; But if the committer was married, the crime is the same, whether the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was a Whore or not, since it is still a violation upon the mans part. To lye likewise with a mans bethrothed, or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spouse, or as we say, his affidat Spouse, is Adultery, <hi>nam. nec violare licet matrimonium, nec spem matrimonii l.</hi> 13. §. <hi>diu.</hi> 6. <hi>ff. h. t.</hi> which agrees, as I conceive, with <hi>Deu.</hi> 22.23. Where he who lies with a betrothed Virgin, should be stoned as an adulterer, because sayes <hi>verse</hi> 24. he lies with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors wife. And he who lies with a betrothed Virgin, who is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55274:93"/>
to be shortly married, renders the succession as doubtful as he who lyes with a married wife.</p>
               <p>The punishment of Adultery by the Civil Law, was death, as some think, by the Julian Law, <hi>relegatio,</hi> or banishment, as others think; but certainly the pain of death was the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be inflicted, by that excellent constitution, <hi>leg. quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis Cod. hoc. tit.</hi> Albeit thereafter <hi>Iustinian</hi> did by the 134. N. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. remit to the woman the pains of death, and ordain her only to be imprisoned in a Monastry:</p>
               <p>By the Law likewise of most Nations, adultery is only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable by pecuniary mulcts: Albeit by the Law of God it was punishable by stoning both man and woman to death, 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. Which punishment some think likewise to have been abrogated by our Saviour, because when the woman accused for adultery was brought before him, he did dismisse her without any punishment; but this is very groundless, for our Saviour came not to be a Judge in such causes, as himself declares: and though he had been a Judge, yet she wanted an Accuser.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Our Law divides Adultery, in that which is notour Adultery, and single Adultery. Notour Adultery is by the 74. <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 9 <hi>Q. Mary,</hi> declared to be punishable by death, after premonition is made to abstain from the said manifest and notour Crime; which premonition had its origin from <hi>Auth. si quis C. ad l.</hi> 1. <hi>de adult.</hi> by which it was lawful for the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to kill him who was thrice premonish'd not to converse with his Wife. And in effect, the design of that Act was only to punish a horrid abuse, which was then ordinar, <hi>viz.</hi> the taking away other mens wives, and keeping them openly as their own, to the great contempt of Law. Yet by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Act, which is given by the 105. <hi>Act,</hi> 7. <hi>Parl. I.</hi> 6. That is only declared to be notour Adultery, where, 1. There are Bairns one or moe procreated betwixt the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers. 2. When they keep company, or bed together no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously known. 3. When they are suspected of Adultery,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55274:94"/>
and thereby gives slander to the Kirk, whereupon being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished to satisfie the Kirk, they contemptuously refuse, and for their refusal they are excommunicat: If either of which three degrees be proved before the Justices, the committers are punishable by death. From which Act it is to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1. That though by the first Act premonition to abstain was still to be made in all cases, yet in neither of the two first cases here related it is declared necessary. But since it was not lawful to kill him who was premonished, and thereafter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed, except they conversed in suspect places, <hi>Gribald. de homicid. num.</hi> 11. It seems that in neither of these Statutes conversation should be criminal, even after prohibition, except it be in suspect places. 2. The Justices are only declared to be Judges to the notoriety of Adultery, and therefore it may be controverted, if Lords of Regality be Judges competent to the cognition of it. 3. This Act does not exclude capital punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in other cases of Adultery, but only ordains that these three degrees shall be punished by death. And since there are other cases more grievous to the party injured, and more scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous to the Common-wealth; it may be argued, that the punishment of death should likewise be extended to them; as for instance, to commit frequent Adulteries: And it appears it is upon this account that the sentence of death was pronounced against Sir <hi>Iohn Stewart,</hi> for three Adulteries, 15. <hi>August,</hi> 1628. As also, <hi>Isabel Hamiltoun</hi> being pursued in <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1647. for Adultery, and having enacted her self never to return, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pain of death; she having thereafter returned, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, without any other Process, by an order from the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, execute in <hi>Anno</hi> 1649.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And albeit there be no express Law for inflicting death in other cases, upon ordinary Adulterers, yet I see no reason why the Justices may not as well, for the good of the Common-wealth, inflict death, without any express Law here, as they do in Theft, and other less Crimes: And in effect, Adultery
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55274:94"/>
includes Theft, as I said formerly; And albeit <hi>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius,</hi> and that it may be argued, that by the former Act, appointing death in the cases above-cited, the punishment of death is thereby excluded in other cases: yet to this it may be answered, that the foresaid rule is only a Brocard, and hath only the strength of a presumption and therefore take only place in favourable cases, but should not be extended in prejudice of the Law of God, which expresly ordains Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to die. And in the foresaid 74. <hi>Act,</hi> 9. <hi>Parl. Q. Mary,</hi> It is declared that this Act shall be but prejudice of all other Acts and Laws already made, with all rigour; but I can find no other Act made prior to that anent Adultery, whereby the punishment is limited; and therefore I believe that that Act relates to the punishment related to by the Law of God: At the least I think that the Magistrate is left to his own freedome to consider circumstances. And whereas it may be alledged that if single Adultery were punishable by death, these Acts had been needless. To this it may be answered, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the former Acts was to necessitat the Magistrate alwayes in the cases exprest in that Act to inflict death, and not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power them only to do so: And seing single Adultery is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Magistrate, sometimes by banishment, as in the case of an English woman, in <hi>December</hi> 1668. sometimes with scourging, as in the case of <hi>Ridpath, December</hi> 1642. And sometime with fining, as in the case of that woman who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Adultery with <hi>George Swintoun,</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1666. though there be no express Law warranting them to inflict these pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, and whereupon the Pursuer is forced to found his Summonds upon the Law of God, and Law of Nature, upon which Law they are sustained, without citing any Municipal Law, as in the case of that English woman: I see no reason why they may not by the same Laws inflict likewise the punishment of death. Albeit the foresaid punishment of death be appointed in cases of notour Adultery; yet the Council does use to mitigate
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55274:95"/>
the punishment, and so they ordained only <hi>Ridpath</hi> a Tinker, though he was found guilty of double Adultery, in keeping another Tinkers Wife two years, to be only scourged, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and burnt on the cheek, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 4. 1662. But the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son here was, because Tinkers are in effect vile persons, who are seldome ever lawfully married: And in such I find of old, Adultery was not punished by death, as <hi>l.</hi> 29. <hi>C. h. t.</hi> where Adultery committed with a Taverner is not punished se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, <hi>quas vitae vilitas dignas legum observatione non credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, &amp; erant infra legum curam.</hi> And some respect was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise had here to that absurd custome amongst Tinkers, of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promiscuously, and using one anothers Wives as Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines. The Council sometimes do likewise banish persons for Adultery, without suffering them to come before a Justice Court, even where notour Adultery might be proved against them, as in the case of <hi>Ieals Thyre</hi> an English man, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Adultery with <hi>Margaret Hamiltoun,</hi> who at her death confessed that the said <hi>Thyre</hi> had lyen several years with her, and that he had alienat her affection from her Husband, which induced her, though without his accession, to kill her Husband, and that she had several Children by him; all which in effect were great aggravations of the Crime, and he deserved well to have dyed. From this it appears that the punishment of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Adultery is arbitrary, and useth to be inflicted, either by banishment, whiping, fyning, or imprisonment. If a person be only banished for Adultery, and return again without leave here, she may be execute; and thus the Justices found by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Council, in the case of <hi>Grissel Hamiltoun, Decemb.</hi> 1649. Or if Adultery be complicated with any other Crime, the guilt is thereby aggraged, and the Crime may be capitally punished; Thus <hi>Margaret Thomson</hi> was execute for commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Adultery with a Minister, and for falsifying a Testimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, to the end she might get her Child Baptized, <hi>May</hi> 28. 1646.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:55274:95"/>V. Since Adultery is only committed betwixt married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, it is therefore requisite that the Libel in Adultery bear, that such persons were married; and one of the ordinary faults committed by the Pursuer in this Crime is, they seldome ever lead Witnesses for proving the marriage, without which be proved, or be notour to the Assize, they should not fyle the Pannel, though Copulation be proved. But though the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be not just, but only a supposed marriage, or <hi>matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um putativum</hi> (as Lawyers call it) yet the violation even of that marriage, will infer Adultery. As for instance, if a man not knowing the relation, should marry within the degrees <hi>de fendant</hi>; though there be in that case no lawful marriage, yet if either of these parties who are married, should ly with any other, they will be guilty of Adultery, <hi>Cravet. Consilio</hi> 205. <hi>num.</hi> 36. The reason whereof is, because the committer did all that lay in his power to commit Adultery, which is the main thing to be looked to in Crimes, <hi>nam proposita maleficia distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guant.</hi> And from this I am much inclined to think, that <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi> or an endeavour to commit Adultery, if the Adulterer did all that in him lay to accomplish the said design, makes the committer guilty of Adultery, if that design was brought the length of being <hi>in actu proximo,</hi> as Lawyers call it: though in that case I think the rigour of the ordinary punishment should be somewhat remitted: <hi>&amp; haec attentatio est punienda paena ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinaria judicis arbitrio. Tira-quell. de panis, Cas.</hi> 39. <hi>&amp;</hi> 40. He who allow'd his house to the Adulterers for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating their Crime, is punishable as an Adulterer, and he who gave them the use of his house for consulting about the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of it, though it was not committed, is punishable as an Adulterer, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55274:96"/>
well determine, that he who remits the injury for money, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is punishable as an Adulterer, but not he who remits it freely.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. He who gives warrand, and order, or hires others to commit Adultery, is guilty, and deserves the same punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Adulterer, according to the opinion of all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers. And in effect, he is more guilty, seing he wants the natural tentation of the Adulterer, and commits the Crime in effect out of meer malice, and in contempt of the Law: And therefore Lawyers conclude, that the Husband hounding out, or hyring others to commit Adultery, cannot pursue his Wife for that Adultery which he occasioned: and yet it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged against <hi>Rocheid</hi> that he could not pursue <hi>Elizabeth Muir</hi> his Wife, because in effect he had hired others to lye with her, and so was <hi>Leno.</hi> It was answered, 1. <hi>Lenocinium</hi> was only in the case, <hi>ubi maritus quaestum facit de corpore uxoris,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or keeps a Bordel, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes her for money. 2. This exception could only exclude the Husband from pursuing a Civil suit of Divorce, but not from pursuing a Criminal suit for Adultery. 3. Though it excludes the Husband from a Criminal pursuit, it could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exclude him from such a Criminal pursuit, as was intented upon these acts of Adultery to which she was tempted, or which she committed with her Husbands consent, but not from pursuing her upon such Acts as she had committed formerly, without her Husbands knowledge. 4. The Advocat concurred in this case, who, nor the publick interest could not be prejudged by any connivance or crime of the husband: In respect of which reply the defence was repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But to examine this <hi>Interloquutor,</hi> It is certain that the fourth reply was <hi>per se</hi> relevant, for certainly the Advocat might have concurred without the Husband, the Lybel being conceived in the Advocats name, as well as the Husbands, but not other wayes: But as to the other replyes, I think they
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55274:96"/>
were not relevant <hi>per se,</hi> for it were most unjust that the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band should have liberty to pursue that as an injury, which he himself had occasioned, nor should he be allowed to call that an injury done to his wife, the like whereof he himself had soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited with money; And seeing in Law, that Husband who consents to his wifes adultery, is called <hi>Leno,</hi> or <hi>Pimp,</hi> much more should he be repute guilty of being a Pimp or Baud, who invites and hires others to lye with his wife; and certainly as it is a greater crime to hire others to lye with a woman, then to lye with her himself, because there is not so great temptation in the one as in the other, so certainly there is more of crime and malice in giving money, then in taking money in this case, since money may be taken out of poverty, whereas it never can be given without malice.</p>
               <p>Lawyers relate, the case of a French Man, who to prove A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery against his wife, did geld himself, and did let witnesses see he was gelded, whereupon his wife being with child 15. Moneths thereafter was pursued by him for adultery: but since this was an unlawful mean of probation, I would not have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, if the pursuit had been at the Husbands instance, and though it had been at the Fisks instance, yet since the woman was so much tempted, I would only have punished her mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Adultery is ordinarily committed so privatly, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movedly from all witnesses, that the Law allowes it to be proved by strong and violent presumptions, as the being in bed together alone, and being naked, <hi>Farin. quest.</hi> 136. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. And the ordinary presumptions probative in this case are, the being oft alone together, gifts, love-letters, closs doors, the Wifes being abroad all night, <hi>nudus cum nuda, &amp; solus cum sola,</hi> the intertaining persons that are known to be Pimps, cohabitation, all which are presumptions, which according to the opinion of the Civilians, may inferr torture, though it be not used with us, yet it is most ordinary for Assizes to fyle
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55274:97"/>
Pannels upon those presumptions, with the assistance of any other probation; and in <hi>George Swintouns</hi> case, a woman was there filed of adultery, though nothing was proved but that the pairties were alone, and that the witnesses heard them in bed together, and the bed shake: And in the case likewise of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Muir,</hi> it may be seen that she was condemned upon pregnant presumptions, without a formal probation.</p>
               <p>Albeit women cannot be admitted witnesses, yet they are received in adultery, as in the foresaid Process against <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Muir,</hi> anno, 1668. and the Lords of Session after solemne debate, found that two witnesses seeing successively the crime committed, though they did not see it at one time, yet they were sufficient witnesses to infer the crime; albeit it was alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged they could not be called <hi>contestes, Feb.</hi> 1666. Lady <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi> against the Laird.</p>
               <p>Adultery may be pursued either Civilly to obtain a Divorce, or Criminally, and when it is pursued Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally the Pursuit tends either to a capital punishment, or an extraordinar and arbitrary punishment, and according to the different nature of these conclusions, require different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, for in Civil pursuite Lawyers do allow: and the Commissaries have found in the foresaid case of the Lady <hi>Miltouns,</hi> that Witnesses deponing that they saw the persons lying together naked in a bed, and that one Witness deponing upon an Act at one time, and another upon another Act com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at another time, did prove sufficiently, which (as some think) would hardly have been sufficient in a Criminal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit, seing in effect these Witnesses were but single Witnesses, and their senses did not here agree in one and the same object, which is the reason why Witnesses are believed.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. It may be doubted here whether a Decreet of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce before the Commissaries be sufficient to prove Adultery in a criminal pursuite, as a Decreet of improbation before the Lords, is sufficient to inferr falshood: And for clearing of this question, It is answered, that 1. Seeing the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55274:97"/>
of Single adultery is sufficient to inferr a divorce, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes necessarily that the production of that Decreet cannot prove notour Adultery. And this was likewise found last <hi>Iuly,</hi> anno. 1598. in an Action pursued by the Kings Advocat against <hi>Alexander Hay</hi> of <hi>Dalgety</hi>: And certainly there was great reason for that verdict, seeing as is very well urged there, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny probations will inferr single Adultery, or a Divorce, which will not inferr notour <hi>Adultery</hi> and capital punishment: but yet I see no reason why a Decreet of the Commissaries should not inferr the punishment of ordinar adultery, and an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry punishment, seing no probation is sufficient in the one case which cannot be allowed in the other, It beeing a rule amongst the Doctors, that <hi>causa civilis &amp; criminalis quo ad paenam ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrariam aequiparantur quo ad probationem</hi>; And whereas it may be objected, that probation in Criminals, should be led in presence of the Pannel, and the Assize. To this it is answered, 1. The Decreet of Divorce is approbation 2. This may be likewayes objected in the crime of falshood, and yet the Lords Decreet is there admitted; but betwixt these two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creets there is this difference, that the Lords may punish fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood themselves, and so their Decreet should be a full Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because they are Judges competent, even to the Criminal part: But it is not so with the Commissaries, who can inflict no Criminal punishment at all for Adultery.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The Civil Law did excuse a man from Adultery, who apprehending upon just reasons that his Wife was dead, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried another, or the Wife who married a second Husband, <hi>l.</hi> 11. §. 12. <hi>ff. h. t. mulier cum audisset absentem virum defun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum esse alii se junxit, &amp; fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55274:98"/>
as an Adulterer, because he had married this <hi>Helen</hi> lawfully, after he had got Testificats upon oath to prove that his first Wife was dead in <hi>Virginia,</hi> whereupon he got a warrand from the Presbytery of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to marry, and was accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and married: and if a false rumour was sufficient to clear from Adultery, and that there could be no Adultery with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Dole,</hi> and a fraudulent design, as is clear by the former Laws, and by <hi>Farin. de delict. car. quest.</hi> 140. he could not be guilty of Adultery who had married, <hi>Authore Ecclesia,</hi> who is Judge competent, and who was induced thereto, not only by report, but by Testificats. To which it was replyed, that he is an Adulterer who lyes with another Woman whilst his Wife lives; and as rumours cannot dissolve marriage, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they defend against Adultery, and if this were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it were easie for every man who were weary of his wife, to raise rumours concerning her death, and thereby authorize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in marying another. 2. Though rumours were sufficient, they behoved to be rumors constantly and commonly reported, but here was only one Testificar, and this Testificat could be no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, since it was but a single testimony, nor did it bear that the said <hi>Margarat Haitly,</hi> who died there, was known to him to be spouse to <hi>Iohn Frazer,</hi> but only in general, that one <hi>Margaret Haitly</hi> died there, and there might have been moe of that name. 3. Though rumours might excuse, yet that could only be after a long absence, <hi>&amp; longo tempore transacto</hi> as is clear by the Law cited by the Pannel, whereas here she was only absent three years; and the ignorance behoved to be invincible, whereas here it was only <hi>ignorantia affectata,</hi> for it is offered to be proved that she stayed within twelve Miles of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels fathers house, and was known by all the Countrey to live there, and though her mother, and relations lived at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in one Town with the Pannel, yet he never asked at her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if she was dead. 4. <hi>A</hi> man whose wife diverts from him, ought to summond her to adher, and so procure a divorce by
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55274:98"/>
the Commissaries; and though rumours and praesumptions could inferr a full probation, yet that must be only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of what is led and proved before the judge ordinary, and the warrand of the Presbytery is not sufficient, since they are not Judges competent to the dissolution of mariages, and this was procured <hi>periculo petentis,</hi> no person being cited. Upon which debate, the Justices repelled the defence, and the said <hi>Iohn Frazer,</hi> being remitted to the knowledge of an inquest, was found guilty, but did thereafter procure a remission; and thus it is clear that <hi>Bigamie</hi> may be also pursued as notour adultery. But the woman who knew not the first marriage was not puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p n="10">X. It may be here doubted likewise, whether a pursuite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intented for notour adultery, and not for single adultery, &amp; the probation which is led, be sufficient to inferr single adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though not notour adultery, if the assize should fyle or not. For the Negative, it may be alledged, that single and notour adultery are different crimes, and the Libels are different, and the lybell in this case is not proved, and therefore the assize should not file, and if they do, their sentence is null; even as in the case of <hi>George Grahame,</hi> where the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of the Assize was reduced, because Theft was lybelled and recept of Theft only proved. As also in that case the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender is precluded of his defences, because he would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded defences against single adultery if it had been lybel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which would either not have been relevant against notour Adultery, or else he thought himself, <hi>in tuto,</hi> not to propone them, because he thought himself secure, knowing that the notour Adultery libelled could never be proved: and it is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar conclusion amongst the Doctors, that <hi>si in libello qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to omnes qualitates non sunt proba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55274:99"/>
he taking instruments upon the Libel as it is Libelled, except the qualities be expresly proved; though it be most ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to the Justices to allow the parties to declare that they insist alternatively as said is.</p>
               <p>By our Law, such as are Divorced for the Crime of Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry committed by themselves, cannot thereafter marry the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with whom they are declared by the sentence of a Judge to have committed Adultery, and all such marriages are declared null, by the <hi>Act.</hi> 22. <hi>P.</hi> 16. <hi>I.</hi> 6. which hath been introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by our Law, not only as a punishment of the Adultery al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready committed, by lessening and narrowing their choice: But likewise as a mean to hinder any from committing Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, in expectation (as is too ordinary) of enjoying in a future marriage the persons with whom they have committed it. And upon which expectation, the adulterers may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably tempted to kill the Lawful husband or wife of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with whom they have committed the same. In which our Law agrees with the Cannon Law, by which <hi>non licebat ducere eam in uxorem, quam quis polluit adulterio.</hi> But it must be observed, that this only holds where there was an actual Divorce upon the adultery, prior to the marriage. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a present marriage could not be dissolved, by offering to prove, that the contracters had committed Adultery during their former marriage.</p>
               <p>This act of Parliament having declared such marriages un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, it did very consequentially declare, the succession to be begotten by such unlawful conjunctions, to be unhabile to succeed as Heirs to these Parents. And I have heard it it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether they were capable to receive dispositions from their adulterous parents. But I conceive as to this there is no difficulty: For though the Law make them uncapable to succeed as Heirs, yet it does not make them uncapable to receive a disposition: and though it may seem, that this
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55274:99"/>
be a farther check upon the Adulterers; whose children could no way be gratified by those with whom they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the crime. Yet since <hi>quilibet est arbiter rei suae,</hi> it were hard to deprive a man of the use of his property, because he has committed Adultery.</p>
               <p>I find that by the Civil Law such Bastards as were born in Adultery, or Incest (whom in the Civil Law calls <hi>nati ex dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato coitu</hi>) could neither succed to their vitious Parents, nor were they capable of any thing by their Parents Testament, <hi>cum ita facilius paterna libido coercere posses censeatur l. Fin. C. de nat. lib. Bald. ad l.</hi> 1. <hi>C. de jur. Aur.</hi> Nor could they be adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Parents, <hi>l. legem C. de na. lib.</hi> Upon which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple our Parliament has been induced to make the 117. <hi>Act. Par.</hi> 12. <hi>I.</hi> 6. but has streatched it a little further, then the Civil Law did. For by that statute, a woman divorced for her Adultery, marrying thereafter the person with whom she committed the Adultery for which she was divorced: or dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and resorting in company with him at Bed, and Buird, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dispone her lands, or set tacks thereof, in prejudice of the Heirs, who would otherwayes have succeded to her.</p>
               <p>From which statute it is observeable, that since the woman is only incapacitat to dispone in this case; that therefore a man though Divorced for Adultery, may lawfully dispone his Land, in favours of the Children Procreat in that Adultery, this prohibition being restricted to the woman because of the Imbecility of her sex, who may be tempted, or seduced, more easily then men can be: and yet since the presumption did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runn against the Adulterous Children, procreat in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond marriage, whom it was probable the mother would have preferred to the children of the first, and slighted husband. It seems strange, why any deed done by her, in prejudice of not only those children, but even of any of her Heirs: would be null, though done in favours, of neither the Adulterous Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, nor his Children; but even in favours of meer stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55274:100"/>
whom the Law needed not have suspected. But this was certainly done to prevent the mothers fraudulent convy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, who might have transmitted the estate to the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Husband, or his posterity or friends under borrowed names, the discovering of such contryvance being very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and the hazard of not discovering being very great. I conceive likewayes for the same reason, that the granting of a personal Bond upon which the estate was thereafter comprised from the mother may be quarrelled upon this statute. For else the Law might be easily cheated: and the statute it self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares all deeds done to the prejudice of the saids Heirs direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or indirectly to be null, and yet since the mother remains still fiar, notwhithstanding of this prohibition; I see not why a Bond, and comprysing led thereon for debts truly owing by the Mother, could be quarrelled, where nothing was fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently designed against this act. And though this act be only conceived in favours of the Heirs of the prior Marriage, or the womans Heirs whatsoever: yet I see no reason, why this act would not militat in favours of the King, to reduce deeds done to his prejudice as <hi>ultimus haeres,</hi> since a last Heire in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Law is a true Heire.</p>

               <p>THat a man might marry two wives, was allowed by many Nations, and <hi>Tacitus</hi> observed, that only the <hi>Germans</hi> amongst all the Nations were content with one; but no Nation allowed, that a wife should marry two husbands, which was done, either because men were the only Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and so were kind to themselves, in allowing themselves that liberty they denyed to poor women, or else this was not allowed, because a womans marrying two men prejudged the peopling the common-wealth; Whereas a mans marrying moe wives, was advantagious for it. And the Law sayes, that more chastity is required in women then in men, and men being by nature hotter then they, <hi>Bigamie</hi> is therefore more unnatural in women.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:55274:101"/>I. Yet in our Law, either a man marrying two wives, or a woman marrying two husbands, commits Bigamy; and this is accounted by the 19. <hi>Act</hi> 5. <hi>Par. Q.

               <p n="2">II. It may be here doubted, why Bigamie was not punisht as Adultery, seing it may be notour Adultery, and is ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so: to which difficulty, I think the answers are, that it was contraverted amongst Lawyers, whether Bigamie was punishable as Adultery, or as <hi>Stuprum,</hi> or <hi>Fornicatio</hi>; that it was not Adultery, they contended, because God allowed Bigamie, but he never allowed Adultery. 2.

When Bigamie was by this Act declared punishable, only as Perju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I do think, that if the marriage be contracted, upon design to palliate the Adultery, it should be punisht more severely then Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; and though the offender cannot be punisht with death, as a bigamist, yet he may be punisht with death as a notour

adulterer. The same may be likewise said, if the persons marry against express Prohibition of the Church, or it may be of friends, for thereby they are put <hi>in pessima fide,</hi> and want the advantages arising, <hi>figura matrimonii:</hi> and this Statute punisheth only simple Bigamie, which was, possibly contracted, when the wife belived the husband to be dead, or <hi>è contra,</hi> or when there was some other pretext for it, but excludes not a further punishment due from other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or complext Crimes. And it were absurd to think, that incestuous persons, being forbidden to marry, because of their contingency in blood, or affinity, should not be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Incest.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It may be doubted, if Quakers can be punisht as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers, seing they give no Oath at marriage, and certainly they should; seing marriage implyes a Vow, though no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Oath be given.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The husbands long absence may be a cause why the punishment may be mitigated, but takes not away the Crime, seing death and not time dissolves marriage. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Minister, who was deposed for marrying a mans wife, after he was sixteen years absent, and albeit the first husband came home, yet the second husband still retained the wife, which certainly was Adultery in him, after that knowledge, that she was another mans wife; seing he wanted that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, for which Bigamie is not punishable as Adultery. From which likewise, that general conclusion may be drawn, that when the Bigamist knows that the other person is married, if he continues, he commits Adultery, and if he know that it is incestuous, he commits Incest.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It may be doubted also, if two persons marrying, be guilty of Adultery, <hi>eo ipso,</hi> that they marry, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of any interveening accident, as death, they bed not, and seing by the second marriage, they give contrary Oaths; certainly they are guilty of Perjury; for Perjury being the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55274:102"/>
                  <hi>medium peccati</hi> in this crime, and not <hi>copulatio,</hi> or <hi>coitus,</hi> as in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, <hi>reatus contrahitur per contraria vota,</hi> and he who lyes with another mans wife immediatly after they come from Church, though before she hath bedded with her husband, does in our Law commit adultery, which shews that mariage is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with us <hi>per</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>benedictionem ecclesiae &amp; ante coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> And if after coming from Church the persons are marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, certainly they are by that also guilty of Bigamie, and from this principle also it may be inferred, that though the first mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was null <hi>per frigiditatem,</hi> or <hi>maleficiationem,</hi> yet the other person who might have declared that marriage to have been null, marying another, before the first marriage was declared to have been null, though it was null <hi>ab initio,</hi> will be guilty of Bigamie, because there are <hi>contraria vota</hi> in that case, and Because he was not lawfully Divorced; for as a person who might have got a first marriage declared null <hi>ex capite adulterii,</hi> marrying again would be punishable, so it should be here; And if it be urged that marriages are declared <hi>in frigidis &amp; malefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atis</hi> to have been null <hi>ab initio,</hi> and therefore there having been no marriage at first, the second was no Bigamie, and the first Oath not binding <hi>ab initio,</hi> for it was given upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position that the other person was <hi>habilis</hi> to contract a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that vow was null, and therefore there were no contrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vowes in this case. It may be answered, that the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders that first marriage as a sufficient marriage till it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red null, and the other person who might have got the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age declared null, would have been punished as an Adulterer if she had lyen with another, <hi>ergo,</hi> she may be likewise punished as a Bigamist.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Act adds, <hi>except the person were lawfully divorced,</hi> From which two questions may arise, 1. Seing the party guilty cannot mary. <hi>v. g.</hi> If a woman be divorced for Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery she cannot marry. <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> then if she marrying again, may be pursued as guilty of Bigamie, and it may be alledged that it

is not Bigamie, seing the act sayes, that if persons not lawfully Divorced marry, they commit Bigamie, <hi>ergo à contraria,</hi> where the persons are lawfully Divorced, they commit not Bigamie, nor doth the Law speak any thing of the difference betwixt the nocent and innocent parties. 2. If a person be divorced, and thereafter he marry, albeit thereafter that Decreet of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce be reduced, certainly the other party who married the person divorced, are not punishable, except the Decreet were reduced upon his fault, but the first Decreet of Divorce being reduced upon his fault who obtained it, as if he had bribed the Witnesses or Judges, <hi>&amp;c. eo casu,</hi> it may be alledged, that he knew that the first marriage was not lawfully disolved, and so the second marriage was Bigamie, <hi>quo ad him,</hi> albeit upon the other hand it may be debated, that the first marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disolved <hi>authore praetore,</hi> it was no marriage at the time the second marriage was contracted, and so not Bigamie, albeit the briber or forger may be punished for the crimes so committed.</p>

                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:55274:103"/>ALbeit at first, every thing was made common, so that then there could be no Theft; yet since by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent of all Nations, property is introduced, Theft was forbidden as an enemy to this property, and as destructive to that order and method, whereby God resolved to govern the World: and therefore the Basilicks observe, that this Crime is against the Law of Nature, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Theft is defin'd by Lawyers, to be <hi>fraudulosa contracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio lucri faciendi gratia vel ipsius rei, vel etiam usus ejus posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionis ve, quod lege naturali prohibitumest,</hi> §. 1. <hi>Inst de obl. ex del.</hi> By the word Contrectatio, they understand, not only the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way taking of a thing, for Theft is committed, by concealing what was taken from another; but likeways the using a thing depositat, or impignorat to other ends and uses, then was agreed upon: therefore Theft may be described, to be a fraudulent away-taking, or using what belongs to another man, without the owners consent.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Theft is only committed in Moveables, and thence it is, that by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> the stealing Writs, which concern Lands, or Lead from a house, or Fruit with the Trees whereon they grow, is not punishable as Theft, seing these things belong to Heretage. Nor is the taking away Dogs, Birds, or such things as serve for pleasure, accounted Theft, seing it is not committed <hi>oblucrum,</hi> Bolton. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. and Theft is never committed without fraud. And albeit by the Civil Law, the keeping of a thing lent, longer then the time allowed, or imploying it for another use then that which it was first lent be Theft by the Civil Law, <hi>just. de furt. autem,</hi> yet in our Law it is not, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>Reg. Maj. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>num.</hi> 5. and the reason there given is, because the intromis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and possession there, flowed originally from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. And albeit it be a rule in the Civil Law, that <hi>initium unius cujus<expan>

reason is not valid, because when a master gives Money to his own servant, if he imploy it to any other use, then is appointed by his master, as if he should drink that which was given him to pay his masters Merchands, or if he should sell his masters horse, with which he was sent to a friend; these misimployments would certainly infer punishment, though the possession flow'd originally from the Master. And I think that Theft, in the case of a misimployed lend; and the other cases above exprest, is more heinous then ordinary Thefts, seing it is agradged by the breach of Trust, or Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and it can likewise be less guarded against: For which two reasons; Domestick Theft is still more heinously punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then ordinary Theft; and servants committing Theft in the cases foresaid, are hanged in these Countreys, where or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar Theft is not Capital. But I believe, the reason of our Law above cited, is, because we thought that this <hi>furtum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretativum,</hi> deserved not to be accounted such with us, where death is the punishment of Theft. Whereas, because in the Roman Law, Theft was less severely punisht: it was therefore allowable, that it might be more extended; and so I think that our Law is more just then the Civil Law. And even according to the Civil Law, it were unjust that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to whom the thing was lent, should be guilty of Theft, for using it longer then was prescribed by the lender, except the lender had expresly required it; for else by not requiring it, it seems that he hath tacitly consented to the farther use, <hi>sicut inta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55274:104"/>
I remember to have read of a Banquier of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was flea'd, and then quartered, for having borrowed vast sums, upon design to break with it (which instance I have set down, for the Merchants of our times) and seing the lender is as much wronged, and the seeker of the loane shews as great fraud by this pretence, as in other theft: I see not why the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should not be the same. I find it observed by <hi>Bolton, cap.</hi> 31. that though in <hi>Glanvels</hi> time (who is repute to be author of <hi>Regiam Maj.) à furto omni modo excusabatur qui initium habuerit suae detentionis per dominum illius rei,</hi> yet it is not so now, for if a Carrier take out a parcel of the things delivered to him, and fell it, he is guilty of Theft; but it is not Theft in the Carrier to give away, or embezle the whole as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them, because it was delivered him in the same kind, <hi>Stomf.</hi> 25. But this last part seems absurd, for the offender designs equally to offend, and the propriator is equally inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in both cases. It is doubted by Lawyers, whether Theft can be committed by one of these who are in a society, or who have right to a commonty of these things, which is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of the commonty. It is answered, that it can, if fraud be proved in either of these cases, <hi>l. si socius ff. de furto,</hi> and the reason is, because the using that which is common, or that as in which the Society is constitute; otherways then according to the rules, is in effect to imploy for ons own use, what belongs to another, which is Theft; and who doubts, if one of these who is in a Society, as in Beer brewing, would steal away in the night, considerable quantities of Beer, out of the Society, but he might be punished for Theft, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">III. According to the Law of <hi>Burden-sack,</hi> or <hi>Ibur anase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> no man can be accused for The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

said Theft was committed, to satisfie his necessity, <hi>l. ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ff. de furtis,</hi> which is the meaning of that expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, necessity has no law. And 2. if he could not intertain himself another way. And whereas <hi>Skeen</hi> observes, upon the Word <hi>Burden-sack,</hi> the Thief should in this case, pay a Cow, or Sheep to him, in whose Land he was taken. I think that also unreasonable, seing that presupposes, that the thief is not in that absolute necessity, which should get him this priviledge: and whereas he observes, that he should be scourged, I th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t most unreasonable, because his necessity, makes it in effect, to be no Theft: and it is contrair like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, to the foresaid 16. <hi>cap. l.</hi> 4. <hi>Reg. Maj.</hi> that no Court shall be holden upon <hi>Burden-sack.</hi> By the Civil Law like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>fraudantes filcum,</hi> or <hi>gabellum,</hi> the stealers of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes were punishable as thieves, <hi>Far. quest.</hi> 173. but of this I shall treat hereafter.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. By the Civil Law it was accounted no Theft to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met with, or abstract things that belonged to a succession, to which none had entered; because, before the entering of an Heir, these things could be called no mans, <hi>l. Hereditarie ff. de furto.</hi> And for the same reason, the taking away Rings, and other Goods from off a dead person, out of a Grave, is not counted Theft by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> as it was found in <hi>Notinghames</hi> case, <hi>anno</hi> 1617 where this was only found a misdemeanour, and the defender whipt: but this holds not now in our Practique, which is most reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble, for this is in effect greater then ordinary Theft, because these things have none to guard them. And in our Law likewise, he who finds a waise Beast, which hath strayed from the owner, should cause cry it either in the Court of his Over-Lord, or in the Church, or else he may be pursued for Theft; and Theft is likewise punishable, albeit the person be not known, from whom the thing was stolen, <hi>Alex.

               <p n="5">V. Theft was divided by the Civil Law, <hi>in manifestum &amp; non manifestum</hi>; Manifest Theft, was when the Thief himself was deprehended, in the very act, or if he was seen with it before he did arive, at the place, to which he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinat to carry it. Theft not manifest, was, when either the Thief was not taken, or seen with it: and this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction hath in my opinion, given occasion to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in our Law, betwixt in-fang-Thief, and out-fang-Thief, which concerns only the Jurisdiction where the Thief is punished, but not the punishment it self, as shall be said hereafter; but there are several other vestiges of it in our Law, as <hi>cap.</hi> 21. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>Reg. Maj.</hi> It is said, that he who is taken with nothing in his hand, may purge himself by 27 men, and three Thanes. and a Burgess be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accused of manifest Theft, may purge himself by the Oath of twelve; the meaning whereof, is, that he shall give his own Oath he is innocent, and shall get so many men to swear, that they believe his innocence, and this manifest Theft, is called Theft with red hand, <hi>Stat. Orcar.</hi> by a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor borrowed from Murder. But with us, Theft may be divided into common Theft (which is Theft so proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, or Stouth-rife, which is violent Theft) and is a complex of Theft and Robbery.

               <p n="6">VI. As to the punishment of Theft, it is much contravert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst Lawyers, if the Law-givers can justly pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh Theft with death, and though I will not dispute the power of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States, yet I incline to think, that for simple Theft, a Thief should not dye. For f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rst, we find by the Law of God, to which as the Scripture sayes, nothing should be added, or paired, Theft is not punishable by death, nor can this Law be
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55274:106"/>
called only a judicial Law fitted for the Common-wealth of the Jews: for that it is a Moral Law, according to its statutory part, forbidding Theft, appears from its being insert amongst the commands, and why it should not be so, as to its Sanction, and punishment like Murder, Incest, and these other crimes, I cannot see a reason. 2. We see that some Thefts are capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally punished, as are the stealing things Sacred, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 7. And Theft committed in the night; <hi>Exod.</hi> 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. and stealers of men, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.7. by which it appears, that God Almighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not that single Theft should be punished by death. 3. There is no proportion betwixt the life of a man, and any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for all that a man hath will he give for his life. 4. The life of the Malefactor is ordinarily taken, where the Crime cannot be repaired, as in Murder, Incest, &amp;c. But in Theft it may, and the parties wronged, would in all probability, be far easier secured this way, seing many will rather want their goods, nor have a mans life taken. Many Thieves would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store, if they thought restoration might be made with safty of their life; and the Law would easilier sustain the pusuers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, if the event were only to reach goods, and not life. 5. It seems absurd, that single Adultery, which is the worst of Thefts (seeing the Husband thereby is robbed of his Estate, quiet, good name, and Succession) should not be punishable by death, and yet Theft should be made capital, and that Theft and Murder which are not equal crimes, should have equal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, And albeit it be objected, that <hi>Laban, Gen.</hi> 24.9. did vow that these who had stollen his goods, should be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by death: Yet the reason in that case will appear to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the Theft there mentioned, was Sacriledge. And whereas <hi>Davids</hi> Oath to <hi>Nathan,</hi> is, that he who had stolne his Neighbours Lamb, should die, is objected. It is answered, either that was spoken in passion, which the Text bears; or otherwayes that was suggested by a special providence to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:55274:106"/>
to the end he might be his own accuser. Nor do I deny but there was a kind of Communion of goods amongst the Jews, more then in other Nations, as appears by their Jublee, by their not taking Pledges, nor anual rent, so that there was less reason to make Theft capital amongst them, then amongst us; and that according as crimes grow more frequent, the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be augmented, but I deny that they should be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augmented, that suitable proportion should not be keeped. And it is known from experience, that many men fear hanging, lesse then being constantly keeped in Correction-houses, or in the places where they may be kept working, as they do in <hi>Holland,</hi> for the good of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. To descend then to our Law, the custom is, that the justices do sometimes hang even for very small faults, as <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Neilson</hi> for stealing a horse, 10 <hi>December</hi> 1661. <hi>Watson</hi> hanged for stealing 40.

But this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not well observed, for the Sheriffs do proceed to judge Thefts even by Citation, &amp; though the Thief be not taken with with the Fang, which is certainly an error, for all processes upon citation against a Thief, should belong to the justices,</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. In the procedor before these inferiour Courts, they do not condemn to death, except upon three Thefts, or that the person be taken with Fang, and he be likewise <hi>famosus fur.</hi> As to the three Thefts, I find no expresse Law for it only, <hi>stat.

Assize upon Oath. Yet this is now absolet, for fame is in no case sufficient to inferr death.</p>
               <p>As to the three Thefts, I find the Civilians relate, that the third The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, by the statutory Law of most places, is capital, and it seems to be grounded upon very good reasons, for he who is oft found committing the same crime, is presumed by the Law to designe to make it a trade, <hi>Ang. ad l.</hi> 8. <hi>devi publica,</hi> where the committing of Theft twice, inferrs this presumption. The Law of <hi>Holland</hi> provides, that a Thief shall be hanged for the third Theft, except it seem otherwayes just to the Judge because of his age, or any other pregnant reason: and ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three small Thefts, are by <hi>Matheus</hi> said not to be construed such, according to the Law of <hi>Holland,</hi> as deserves death: the Civilians do upon supposition that the third Theft is Capital, conclude, that these three thefts should be distinct, even as to to the time, and that he is to be punished with death for the third theft, though he had been formerly punished for both the other two, or though the former two had been remitted to him by the Prince: and albeit they use many distinctions for clearing whether a Thief should be hanged for the third theft, where the first two were not committed within his Territory or Jurisdiction, and so could not be punished by him, yet since Capital punishment is not inferred by a statute against the third Theft, but that the third Theft is only punishable with death, because the committer is presumed to be irreclaimable: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think, that where ever the Theft was committed, yet for the third Theft, the thief should be hanged; for albeit there be no express statute for that with us, yet, seing <hi>Gomesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Chasaneus,</hi> and other famous Lawyers, attested this to be the general custome of the world; I think it should be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by our Sheriffs and inferiour Judges, who being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by that number, have some certain rule whereby they may be both limited, and warranded, which is much safer
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55274:108"/>
then that they should be allowed scop, to break out into the extreams of either cruelty, or cowardliness.</p>
               <p>The Law of <hi>England</hi> divides Theft or Larcenry, into petty Larcenry, when the thing stoln, exceeds not twelve pence, and its punishment extends not to death, and grand Larcenry, when it exceeds twelve pence, wherein the thief is punishable by death, except he be saved by the book: and if one steal to the value of six pence, at one time, and six pence at another time, then he is guilty of death, but if two steal to the value of eighten pence joyntly, each is guilty.</p>
               <p>Common bruit, and open fame, of being an ordinary thief, is likewise a good ground of making theft puishable by death, the thief being taken with the fang, <hi>&amp; hi fures famosi sive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famati de pluribus furtis,</hi> are ordinarily hanged likewise, as is clear by <hi>Clarus. Num.</hi> 8. <hi>hoc tit. Menoch. arbitrariis Casu.</hi> 295. And it is sufficient that witnesses depon of their credulity, and that they are informed by others, our Law calls such <hi>de famiati de latrocinio</hi>; and if he cannot find caution, the old Law appoints, that he should be proceeded against as if he were a proven thief; for <hi>latro defamatus &amp; latro probatus,</hi> are still <hi>aequipollent</hi> in our Law; But I think these Laws too severe, and they are not in use.</p>

As to the procedor of the Justices; it is because their power is more eminent, that they are allowed to be more arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but I think the distinction allowed by Civilians, will be very reasonable, which is that, <hi>in furto simplici,</hi> in simple theft, the pain of death should never be imposed, but in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified theft, if the quality be such as agredges the crime very much; Which aggravations are either taken from the thing it self, that is stoln, as in our statutes, the stealers of Pleugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graith, cutters and destroyers of Pleugh, and Pleugh-graith, in the time of telling; and cutters and destroyers of growing trees, or breakers of Milnes, or of leading co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit it would appear, that that act is only to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to labouring cattel. <hi>Nota,</hi> this is a case wherein Theft may be committed, without carrying any thing away; for the doing of these wrongs, without carrying away the thing wronged, is constantly declared to be Theft, <hi>&amp; per constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem Frederici Secundi de stat. §. agricultores,</hi> the stealing Pleugh graith, is punished, as a particular crime.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Herdships, likewise, which is, the driving away a great many Cattle, called by the Civilians, <hi>crimen abigeatus,</hi> is likewise by the Law of all Nations, and particularly by ours, punished with death; but though <hi>lex prima dig. de abigeat</hi>: say that <hi>abigei ad gladium dentur.</hi> Yet <hi>Matheus</hi> doth interpret, that not to be meant, <hi>de ultimo supplicio,</hi> but only <hi>de ludo gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorio,</hi> and with this agrees. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="11">XI. The stealing likewise of a thing consecrated to God, aggrages so the Theft, as to make it punishable by death, and this was called Sacriledge by the Civil, and Cannon Laws,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55274:109"/>
and was distinguished into several degrees, as 1. If a thing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred was stoln out of a sacred place. 2. If a thing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred was stoln out of any place. 3. If a thing not Sacred was stoln out of a Sacred place: But thir two last are not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacriledge. With us there are no formal Consecrations used of Churches, Vestments, Cupps, &amp;c. and so we have no such formal crime, as Sacriledge; nor have we any act against it. Yet I think, to steal any thing destinat to Gods service, and even to steal any thing out of a Church, deserves to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with death. And this Theft is aggraged with us, not only from the nature of the thing stoln, but more from the place; and thus also Murder, or mutilation, committed within the Church or Church-yaird, is more severely punished then other Murders; and with us these who steal out of Churches, are still hanged, or who steal what is dedicated to, or serves the Church, as Basons. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The next aggravation of Theft is from the person who commits it, and thus Theft, when committed by landed men, is punished with us as Treason, <hi>Act.</hi> 50. <hi>p.</hi> 11. <hi>I.</hi> 6. the words are, that if it shall happen any landed man to be lawfully and orderly convict of common Theft, recept of theft, or Stouthreif he shall incur the crime and the pain of Treason: The reason inductive of this act was, because it was easier for landed men to commit theft, then for any others, and so it should be more severely punished, and these also wanted all pretext of necessity, or rusticity, and must be presumed to be extreamly mean and malicious persons, whom the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth might well want, and whom they should not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: but it may be here doubted who are these, who are by this act to be accompted landed men; And it would appear, 1. That only such as have themselves, or their Predecessors, been Infest, are only such, for, <hi>nulla sasina nulla terra,</hi> and so a disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or charter or a resignation <hi>in favorem,</hi> makes not a thief to fall under the compasse of this Act. Yet some think an Heir served and retoured, doth fall within this signification, though
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55274:109"/>
he be not Infest, because his lying out is his own fault, and so should not defend him. 2. I think that a person who was once a Barron, if he be thereafter denuded, falls not under it, for albeit <hi>semel baro</hi> is <hi>semper baro</hi> in our Law. Yet that max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime holds only presumptive; and if it be proved that he was actually denuded, that will liberat him from vitious intromissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much more a crime that deserves forfaulter and statutory crimes, are not to be extended. By ordinary theft in this act is meant, theft without any aggravation of violence, herships, &amp;c. by stouthreif is meant violent and masterful theft. And as this kind of theft hath the disadvantage of being treason, so it is just that it should participat of all the advantages which are allowed to those who are pursued, as traitors, (<hi>&amp; quem se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur incommoda eum debent sequi commoda</hi>) and therefore no inferiour Judge is Judge competent to a process founded upon this species of theft, as was found in <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1668. where a process intented against a landed man, before the Sheriff of <hi>Wigtown,</hi> was Advocat to the Justices upon this reason; albeit it was alledged that this act being conceived <hi>in odium,</hi> and for repressing of theft, it was unreasonable that it should not be quarrellable before every Judge, for thereby many would be deterred from pursuits against landed men. And albeit the punishment was in this theft, greater then in others; yet the relevancy and probation was no more intricat here then in other cases. 2. It was alledged that the pursuer restricted his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel to ordinary theft, which the Justices found he could not do, because the relevance, and probation would be, <hi>eadem utrobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi>; and albeit the pairty would restrict as said is, yet the Kings Advocat might, at any time thereafter, found a Process of forefaulter, and needed no more probation: as in the case of <hi>Iohn Wauch,</hi> though the Sheriff of <hi>Selkirk</hi> had only fyned the thief, yet the Lords sustained a declarator of escheat upon that same verdict, whereby the thief was found by them guilty of theft; for the Lords thought that privat parties could by no
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55274:110"/>
declaration nor deed of theirs, prejudge His <hi>Majestie</hi>'s interest, so that from this ground, it may be debared, that when a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man is pursued for theft, the pursuer cannot restrict his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite to a pursuite of common theft. As also, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer failzieing to prove, in this case commits Treason, because he who pursues any man for treason, if he be found calumnious, commits treason. It may be doubted also if the Council can mitigat the punishment here, seing they cannot remit Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Yet in thir Statutory Treasons the Council ordinarily mitigats or converts the punishment. Nor see I any reason, why it may not be alledged that theft in landed men, is not made treason by this Act, but is only declared punishable as treason, and Theft, that is not to be judged as treason, though it should be punished as such, for these two are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. This crime of Theft becomes sometimes atrocious, and so should be punishable by death, because of the irreclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse of the offender, and triple theft is capital in inferiour Courts, though the things stoln be very inconsiderable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this shews a habit or double these, if the thing stoln be of great moment. And by the first Statute, <hi>Da</hi> 2. §. 4. A thief ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, being taken again in these Territories, from which he was banished, may be proceeded against with all severity; and the breaking of pink Dove coats, &amp;c. is punishable by death at the third rime, <hi>Act.</hi> 84. <hi>I.</hi> 6. <hi>P.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>The way likewise whereby the Theft is committed, makes it oft deserve to be capital, as the stealing by false keys, or breaking houses, and inchantments, and if it be committed masterfully, (as we use to speak) which is called Stouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reif with us, and <hi>Roboria,</hi> by the Doctors then it dese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ves to be capitally punished; but of this afterwards.</p>
               <p>Theft is likewise aggraged from the time, as stealing in the night is punishable by death, if the theif defend himself, and be armed. <hi>l. furem. ff. ad l. Corn. de sicar,</hi> but with us gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55274:110"/>
a thief breaking houses in the night may be killed by the person invaded, <hi>Act</hi> 22. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2 <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>loss.</hi> 1. which may be extended also to such thieves as are preparing to break the house, of who have done it already, and to steal any thing in the time a house is burning, or when a Ship is wrackt, or in time of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, or general desolation, were highly punishable by the Civil Law, either <hi>paena fustium cum relegatione vel in metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi> And with us I think such thieves should dye, for both they add affliction to the afflicted, and so shew very much malice. As also the committing Theft is then very easy, and to these cases I may adde theft committed in time of Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. As theft is aggraged by these, so it is extenuat by other circumstances, as 1. In case of necessity, as said is, 2. A wife stealing from her own husband, is not so severely to be punished as in other cases, for in effect she hath some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and therefore by the Common Law this was not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suable as theft, <hi>sed actione renum amotarum. l. qui servo. §. item placuit. ff. de furt.</hi> but with us, the Kings Advocat may pursue either wife or husband stealing from one another, though the parties cannot. For it is to be presumed that there is too much malice in such pursuites, and that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer designs in that case rather to be free from the marriage, then to have the Crime punisht. 3. He who steals from his debitor, who will not pay him, or steals what was robbed from him, is punishable, but not by death, <hi>Clar. num.</hi> 20. <hi>de furt.</hi> 4.

If the party from whom the thing was stoln, declare that it was not away-taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his consent; some Lawyers think the crime is thereby purged: Which opinion others allow not except it be also proven, that there were presumptions of a prior consent, as the stealers good fame, his friendship to the party accused, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation by affinity, or consanguinity, &amp;c. but with us if the

84. <hi>Act,</hi> 6. <hi>P.I.</hi> 6. the destroyers of Planting, haining-broom, pollicie, are for the first appointed to pay to the owner the avail, and ten pound for the second, the avail and twenty pound for the third, the avail and fourty pound, and if they be not responsal, to be put in Prison, and in the Irons for eight dayes, for the second, fifteen dayes, for the third a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and to be scourged at the end of the Moneth. By which Act likewise, the breakers of Dove-coats, Conyingairs, and Parks, are to be punished the same way, if they be not responsal, they are to hanged for the third fault. It is observable, that though these persons abovenamed were hanged for breaking of Yards, yet there is no warrant, therefore by that Act, though there be for breaking of Dove-coats and Parks, and so we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the former act is not abrogated by this Act: And this Act declares, that the punishment here prescribed shall be without prejudice to call the defenders at Justice Courts, and all the innovation introduced by this act, is that the offender may be tryed in thir cases, by the Barron, or Lands-lord, within whose Lands the wrong was committed, if the offender be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken reid hand, (whereas Land-lords are not Judges compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) and by the Sheriff if they be not taken reid hand. 2. There is allowed by this Act, a power to Land-lords, to Judge in the case of wrongs done to their own Tennants, which <hi>regulariter</hi> was not lawful. It is likewise observable, that this and the 12 <hi>Act, I.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 4. adds still without the good-will of the owner. So that I think, that albeit the owners declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not sufficient to absolve the thief in other cases, yet I think it is in this case, and that for these two reasons, because this statutory theft, is only introduced in favours of the owners, and this Clause had else been uncnecessar. 2. It is presumable that the owner would not refuse his consent to kill a Deer or Coney, and this we may observe, that the words <hi>invito domino,</hi> in the definition of theft, are not absolutly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ecessary, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lawyers carpingly observe, and that in some cases, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55274:112"/>
of the owner may defend the Party. 8. It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from this Act, that theft should be proved by confession or witnesses, and though other crimes may be proved by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions, yet this should not, seing death is so exorbitant a punishment. 4. It is observable, that the Sheriff-depute, or other Deputs, may sit in cases belonging to the Sheriff himself, and that the Declinatur which is sufficient against the one, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not the other. To take Doves also, which belongs to their Dove-coats, or to kill them, is repute theft, <hi>l. Pomponius. §. Pomponius ff. fam. erisc.</hi> and by the Doctors, <hi>Chass. fol.</hi> 1484. for seing these creatures are ordinarly tame now, and that by the custome especially of the low Countries there are few or no wild Doves, it follows that it should be unlawful to kill or shoot them, as it is to shoot or hunt other wild beasts: The stealing likewise of Bees, which are kept in hives, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted theft, <hi>l. Pomponius. §. Pomponius. ff. fam. erisc.</hi> and by the Law of <hi>Germanie, Berlich. conclus.</hi> 50. For which though an arbitrary punishment should be regularly inflicted, yet if the Bees stoln be of great value, or if the committer has been frequently deprehended in the like guilt, then the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors are of opinion, that even stealing of Bees may be punished by death, <hi>Iac. de Bellovis. pract. crim. Cap.</hi> 20. <hi>num.</hi> 32. but I think our Law juster, which considers more the habit of the offender, then the greatnesse of the offence. Stealers likewise of Pyks out of stanks, was forbidden, but not punished by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law, but by the custom of all Nations, it is now punished arbitrarly according to the differing circumstances. <hi>Berlich. conclus.</hi> 51.</p>

by the Civil Law, <hi>conatus,</hi> or a designe and essay to steal, if no theft was committed, was not punishable as Theft, <hi>l. vulgaris ff. de furt.</hi> where it is said, that he who entred another mans Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set upon designe to steal, if he touched nothing, is only punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>actione injuriarum si sine vi, vel de visi, vi intravit.</hi> And with us, I think that essaying to steal, should not be punished with death, seing the essayer might have repented, and seing <hi>furtum est contrectatio rei alienae,</hi> so before he touch any thing, I think he cannot be called, nor conscionably punished as a Thief. He who shews the way to a Thief is not a Thief, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. But with us this might be esteemed art and part by that Law likewise, if one broke the gate upon revenge, and another entered and stole, the breaker of the gate would not be lyable for Theft, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And I conceive that there is in Law and reason, a great difference to be put betwixt these crimes, which are only committed against our fortunes, and in cases which may be repaired; wherein actual loss should be more considered then attempts, and these which are irrepairable, when committed, and are attrocious, and concern the safety of our persons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in attempts should be highly punished.</p>

               <p>THeft-boot is committed by securing a Thief against the punishment due by Law, and properly it is when She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs and other Judges who sell a Thief, or fyne with him in Theftdome, committed, or to be committed. <hi>P.</hi> 13. <hi>I.</hi> 6. <hi>Act</hi> 137. and the Lord of regality, committing this crime, losses his Regalities and Barronies, <hi>id est,</hi> his Offices and Jurisdictions, as Lord of Regality, and as Barron, and the Justices and the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs loss life and goods. Theft-boot is also committed by any other person who takes a ransome from a Thief, when he finds him with the fang. 3. When a party who was leas'd, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts with the Thief, and passing from the pursuite which is punishable, because the publick being by the crime wronged as

well as he, and his <hi>Majesty</hi> having <hi>jus quaesitum</hi> to the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables of the offender; it is unjust, that any private Party should have it in his power to indemnify the transgressor: and albeit thir two last species of Theft be not expresly contained in the Act, yet seeing the act bears, that Lords of regalities, Sherriffs, nor others, shall not sell, &amp;c. under the word: others generally all transgressors are comprehended, and by the 2. <hi>Act</hi> 1. <hi>P. I.</hi> 5. it is declared, that he who transacts with a Thief, for Theft committed against himself, shall be guilty of Theft-boot, and shall be punishable as the principal Thief, from which it appears, that the punishment of Theft-boot in private persons, is the same with the punishment of the thief, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the first <hi>Act. P.</hi> 13. <hi>I.</hi> 6. there is no punishment statuted against private persons who are guilty of Theft-boot, only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Judges transacting or ransoming, and <hi>Skeen, verb.

And yet I remember that in <hi>Ian.</hi> 1665. <hi>Angus Mackintosh,</hi> being pursued by the Sheriffe Depute of <hi>Inverness,</hi> for Theft-boot, as he who had componed with a Thief who had stoln some meal from him; the Lords of Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion did Advocat this pursuite to themselves, because they thought this crime of Theft-boot in desuetude, and therefore they resolved to hear it themselves, that they might clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what Theft-boot was, and how far it was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Civil Law knew not such distinct crime as recept of Theft, but it was comprehended under the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Theft, for recept is defined to be <hi>occultatio latronum vel malt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>oorum ab eo qui latronem apprehendere poterat pecunia vel surreptorum parte accepta, l.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. de recept</hi>: it is the wilful concealing or protecting a Thief by him who might have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and apprehended him, and that either for money, or a part of the stoln goods, from which definition it may be inferred, 1. That such as lodge Thieves in Inns, are not lyable for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55274:114"/>
except it be likewise proved that they knew the person lodged to have stoln goods, which ignorance will not excuse, if it be affected and designed ignorance, as if all the neighbours knew, or if it was intimat to them, or if any person offered to inform, and the Inn-keeper would not know, or if the guest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered an extraordinary reward, or offered to bribe servants, or kept a very jealous watch, which presumptions may infer an arbitrary punishment, but not death. 2. It may be inferred that the lodging a kinsman, a wife or husbands entertaining one another, will not inferr recept, because that is presumed to be done rather, out of love, then <hi>avarice</hi> or <hi>dole, l.</hi> 2 <hi>ff. de recept,</hi> which was extended as <hi>Chassan.</hi> observes, <hi>rubr.</hi> 1. §. 5. <hi>N.</hi> 13. to a Mistris concealing her sweet-heart: In all which cases the receptors are only to be excused, if they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat not in the Theft, for else they are to be punished as Thieves, for that is not the effect of love, but of fraud.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Recept of theft with us, is punishable as the principal thief, <hi>Stat.</hi> 21. <hi>Alex.</hi> 2. Where it is said, that whosoever shall recept the thing stoln willingly and knowingly, he shall be punished as the principal Thief; and from this it may be concluded, that recept with us, is properly, when the thing stoln is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and not when the stealer without the Theft is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipted; for to as the recepting of the Thief, it appears only to be punishable, when Letters of Intercommuning are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, prohibiting all the Leidges to recept or fortifie a malefactor, else Letters of Intercommuning were unnecessary; nor see I why the receptor of a Thief should be in a worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then the receptor of a Murderer; and our practice speaks still of recept of Theft, not of Thieves, at least recept of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture falls not under this special crime, but only under the Thief general crime of recepting malefactors, but if the receptor of a take money, or good deed, for the recepting even his person, <hi>eo casu,</hi> he is guilty of Theft-boot, but by the 21. <hi>Act P.</hi> 1. <hi>I.</hi> 6.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55274:115"/>
It is declared, that whosoever intercommuns with Thieves, or assists them in their theftous stealings, or deeds, either in going, or coming, or gives them meat, harbour, or assistance, or trysts with them any manner of way, they shall be pursued, either Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy, or Criminally; but this act strikes not against such as have entertained the Thief any considerable time, after the committing of the Theft, and before Letters of Intercommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were execute.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The receptor with us cannot be punished, or thole an Assize, till the principal thief be first convict; for if he be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soilzied, the receptor cannot be punished, <hi>Stat. David</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 29. but by the 83. <hi>cap. quon. attach.</hi> it was only declared that the receptor should not be punished till the principal was either convict or attained, <hi>i. e.</hi> accused with us. Now it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably observed, that the principal thief should be first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed, as was found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> and in <hi>Anno</hi> 1663. a verdict against <hi>George Grahame,</hi> before the Justices, finding him guilty of fraudulent using of a Bond, was rescin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, because the principal thief was not first discussed: the case was this, <hi>Achmuty,</hi> granted a Bond to the Lady <hi>Bairfoot,</hi> for eight hundreth Merks, she assigned it to <hi>George,</hi> but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after payed him another way, and retired the Assignation, and after this she put both Bond and Assignation in a Bonnet case; and <hi>George</hi> having come by the bond (as he pretended from Mistris <hi>Billing,</hi> Daughter to the Lady, who alledged she had got it from her Mother for debt) he sends it to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and recovers payment, whereupon he was pursued for fraudulent using, and recept, and his discharge of the former assignation was produced, and the Bond was proven to have been in the Ladies custody. Whereupon he was convict by the Assize, but this verdict was rescinded with the Justices Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quutor, because the Libel was not relevant, till Master and Mistris <hi>Billings,</hi> had been first discust, and the verdict was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, because it was not proved that they saw <hi>George Grhame</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:55274:115"/>
deliver back the Bond, and the general discharge might have been given, <hi>spenumerandae pecuniae:</hi> and if such using as this might be termed Theft, all actions of exhibitions would be turned in pursuits for theft.</p>
               <p>But it may be doubted, whether if the Principal Thief dye, the receptor may be punished, seeing after death the Principal theft cannot be enquired into, for though that priviledge be granted, <hi>quo ad</hi> the discussion, yet it inferrs no indemnity to the receptor; and we see, that where the benefite of discussion is granted to Heirs or Cautioners, he who hath the benefite may be pursued, if the party who would have been first discust, be, <hi>in solvendo,</hi> and the reason of this maxim should hold, when the Principal Thief is alive, and not when he is dead, is, because it is presumable that the pursuer is malicious against the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for else he would doubtlesse pursue the Malefactor who did the most immediat wrong to him, which it is probable the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor knew not. It may be also doubted, if the Thief dwell in <hi>England,</hi> or in <hi>France,</hi> whether the pursuer must first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse him.</p>
               <p n="5">V. If the thing stoln by the wife, be found with the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he is not to be punished, except he expresly promise to defend his wife, or warrand her; but if the thing stoln by the husband be found under the wifes keys, or under her care, she is punishable as a thief, <hi>Stat. Wil. c.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp; quon. attach. c.</hi> 12. but these Chapters are confused, and <hi>de practica</hi> both man and wife are lyable, if they were accessory to any other Thefts, but no otherwise.</p>
               <p>Albeit the concealing of Theft be Criminal in others, yet it is not so in a wife, <hi>ibid.</hi> And yet the husbands authority is said not to be sufficient, to defend her in atrocious crimes, though she be obliedged, generally to obey him, <hi>ibid.</hi> From which it may be observed, first, That theft is accompted an atrocious crime, for that Chapter treats of Theft, albeit this
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55274:116"/>
be much controverted amongst the Doctors, who after a long debate, whether Statutes ordering the procedor in atrocious crimes, generally should be extended to Theft, which they refer to the arbitration of the Judge, who is to Judge according to circumstances. And certainly, picking, or petty Theft, is not an atrocious crime, except where the Thief made a trade of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amongst other instances of this, I shall only cite <hi>Robert Lauder,</hi> who was only banished for theft and pickry, <hi>anno</hi> 1638. but theft joyned with violence and rapin, stouth-reif is atrocious. 2. It is observable from that text, that in crimes that are not atrocious, <hi>per argumentum à contrario,</hi> obedience to the husband, excuses the wife.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. It is statuted, v. 9. that servants are obliedged to reveal their masters theft, else they are guilty. From which it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, that a servant who left his masters service immediatly, though he was in company with him at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting of theft, is not punishable for his being in company, since he might have been brought upon the place without knowing his Masters design, and being there, durst not to have refused concurse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such accompt. I saw some servants Assoilzied by the Council from death, they having left their Masters service, as said is, though they revealed not the Theft, which they might have omitted, either through fear, or want of probation.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Recept then is punished as Theft, which must be meant only of immediat recept, for the mediat sellers of goods belonging to thieves or inobedient persons, who dare not come to Mercat themselves, are only punishable by banishment, and confiscation of their moveables, the half whereof is to belong to the King, and the other half to the Suiter. And from this act may be raised these two doubts, 1. If this act should strike against the receptors of any other goods, then these of <hi>Highland</hi> Thieves, seing the act speaks of thieves who cannot come themselves to <hi>Lowland</hi> Mercats, whereby the acts made against Sornars of Clans, cannot be put to execution, yet sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55274:116"/>
this Act strikes against all sellers of goods belonging to any thieves, seing the reason is the same, Theft being thereby promoved, and the statuto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y words run disjunctively against the Sellers of goods belonging to Thieves in general, <hi>&amp; ubi lex non distinguit nec nos,</hi> or inobedient persons and Clanns. 2. It may be doubted, if this act should reach the sellers of goods belonging to any other Malefactors, seing the Rubrick speaks generally of sellers of goods belonging to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors: And some think, that if any Malefactor be at the Horn, the sellers of his goods may be punished by this act.</p>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55274:117"/>
I believe the reason of this Law was, because <hi>vocatio in jus,</hi> was at that time used, not by a simple citation, as now, but <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terto collo,</hi> and by dragging the defender to the Court. For else it is not imaginable how the citing a person at his house could infer violence, or ryot against the citer: but though this Law is now so farr antiquated by custom, that any person whatsoever, may be cited in his own house, and may be violently drawn forth thereof by Captions in Civil cases, and warands in Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal: Yet so pungent is the reason insert in that Law, that <hi>domus cuique tutissimum refugium atque receptaculum est,</hi> which is likewise repeated, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>C. de pretor &amp; honor, pretor:</hi> That it being joyned with the former reasons above expressed, hath introduced that by the statutes of the greatest part of the world, <hi>gravior estimatur injuria alicui facta in domo sua quam alibi &amp; ideo ut plurimum duplicatur paena malificii commissi in domo offensi, Cabal. consil. criminal. casu</hi> 13. Which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise consonant to the Civil Law, whereby of old, the entering another mans house, <hi>invito domino,</hi> was punishable as a crime, <hi>l. Corn. de injuriis,</hi> and thereafter was punishable, <hi>actione inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riarum, l.</hi> 23. <hi>ff. de injur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The invading a person in his own house, with us is called Hame-sucken, and is defined to be, when any person vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently enters into another mans house without licence, or contrary to the Kings peace, or seeks him, or assaults him there, and comes from a <hi>Dutch</hi> word <hi>Haime,</hi> which signifies a house, and <hi>Sucken,</hi> which signifies to seek or pursue: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which crime it is observable, That 1. It either may be pursued as a seperat crime, or as the aggravation of another crime; when it is pursued as a formal crime, the pursuer must Libel that he was invaded violently, or sought after in his own house: for if the offender did come in upon invitation, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally, and thereafter upon an emergent offended or inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Master of the house, this is not properly Hame-sucken, seing the offender did not invade or sease. 2. The wrong
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55274:118"/>
must be done to a person in his own house, that is to say, where the pursuer was staying, lying or rising night and day, <hi>Reg. Maj. l.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 1. Upon which place <hi>Skeen</hi> observes, <hi>&amp; qui insultum fecitjuxta domum hac lege punitur Bartol, in authent. de appell. §. ad haec.</hi> And I find that <hi>Clar. quest.</hi> 82. determins that a Statute which doubles the pain of invasion, when the invasion is made in the house of a Judge, or Magistrat, takes place not only against invasions made in the house it self, but likewise made in the confines thereof; And <hi>Albericus de statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, l.</hi> 2. <hi>quest.</hi> 35. extends to crimes forbidden in places, to crimes committed within the confines thereof, which though it be contradicted by <hi>Vincen. de fran. decisione.</hi> 402. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause rigid and special Laws are strictly to be interpret; yet I think, that if the invasion was made in any place that proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonged to the house, such as the Porch, Court, Inner Court, or Office-houses, that invasion should be punished as Hame-sucken, because a man is said to be at home there, and expects as much security there (which is the reason inductive of the Law) as any other else. And thus the ordinary form of Libels with us bears, that the pursuer was invaded within his dwelling house, or precinct thereof. <hi>Thomas Crumbie,</hi> was hanged, and his movables escheat, for offering to strike my Lady <hi>Traquair</hi> with a drawn Sword in her Garden, 23. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1638. but if the place wherein the invasion was made, was no inclosure, and so adjoyned to the house, I think that though it was at the very doore of the house, that <hi>Bart.</hi> his oppinion of <hi>juxta dominum,</hi> does not hold: And thus a Gentle-man being pursued upon the 24. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1663. for Hame-sucken, in swa far as he came to <hi>Alexander Provests</hi> dwelling house, and there called him out, and forced him to yoak his Carts, and scourged him; The Justices would not sustain the Libel as Hame-sucken, because it was not committed in the pursuers house, though it was done at the house door, but sustained it as oppression: And yet I think that if it had been
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55274:118"/>
alledged in this case, that this invasion was Hamesucken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the person injured was called out of his own house by the offender, and so <hi>quo ad him</hi> must be repute as if he had been in it; The Justices would have sustained this to have been Hame-sucken, if it could have been proved that the wrong was done immediatly without any preveining provocation; for the Law would have presumed that the person was called out of designe to evite the quality of that crime, <hi>nec debet fraus sua quem libet adjuvare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is doubted if a mans Shop is to be accompted his house, to inferre this crime, and though it may be alledged, that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity is to be expected, as well in the one, as in the other; And that it is as much the publicks interest, that Shops be not entered, and persons disturbed therein, as houses, for thereby publick commerce is leised, as well as privat safety; yet upon the other hand it may be alledged, that by the foresaid <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 1. That is only called a mans house, where he uses to rise and lye: And amongst the different opinion of Lawyers, I find this reconcealing distinction used, that if the Shop be adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the house, and be not repute a different house, that <hi>eo casu,</hi> invasions in the Shop inferr Hame-sucken, otherwayes not, <hi>Cabal. ibid.</hi> where he likewise cites <hi>Saliset, Albericus,</hi> and others, determining, that if a man have two houses, in one whereof he dwells not with his family, that his being invaded in that house makes it not Hame-sucken, which is most conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to our own Law above-cited, which requires lying and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; And thus I remember that in <hi>Iune</hi> 1669. <hi>Thomas Syd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serf,</hi> having pursued <hi>Mungo Murray,</hi> &amp;c. for invading him in his Play-house, that invasion was not punished as Hame-suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but with imprisonment. <hi>Nota,</hi> the former Law against Hame-sucken takes place as well when the invasion is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in a mans hyred house, as his own, if he and his family live there, <hi>Skeen ibid. &amp; Bartol le. ad legem jul. de adulteriis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be likewayes doubted, whether the beating a man in his own Ship, can be punished as Hame-sucken, since a man
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55274:119"/>
has not his Family there, and so it cannot be called properly his <hi>name.</hi> But yet, I belive it should be punished as such, since it is the ordinary place of a Sea-mans residence: And thus it hath been found with us, that a Skipper may prove an injury done to him in his own Ship, by his own Servants; though Servants cannot prove <hi>regulariter</hi> for their Master, except in the case of Hame-sucken.</p>
               <p>It hath been likewise doubted, whether an injury done to an Inn-keeper, can be punished as Hame-sucken, when done to him by such as lodged in his own Inn? And though it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alledged, that this was a greater Crime, then if it had been done by a person who lodged not there, because that was a Hame-sucken against Hospitality: yet because an Inn is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick House, and belongs as well to the Lodgers as to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. The Justices did only sustain this as a great Ryot, but not as Hame-sucken, in the case of <hi>Meor</hi> of <hi>Penniglen, Anno</hi> 1675.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The punishment of this crime is the same with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing of women, <hi>R. M. L.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 9 and 10. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Laws made against ravishing of women, are ordinarily libelled upon, there being no special punishment exprest in the Laws against Hame-sucken, should be pursued within a night after it is committed, which time is allowed for getting the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of friends, <hi>ibid.</hi> And yet in the former case of the Lady <hi>Traquairs,</hi> it was sustained after two moneths time, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that short prescription is now absolet, and the reason of it has been, because it being punishable as ravishing of women, it hath borrowed from that crime, the necessity of being recent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursued. And I think, that though the foresaid short pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription be not allowed by present custome, yet the Judge should consider whether any considerable time hath intervein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for else, <hi>per intervallum tempóris videtur dissimulari sicut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria dissimulatur.</hi> Nor is it probable that the person offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded would have sitten long with such a wrong, and since that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55274:119"/>
crime which was not Capital of its own nature, does become such by the circumstance of the place, it is reasonable that the person accused should not lye long under the hazard, <hi>&amp; grava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in uno levandus in alio:</hi> This crime hath likewise this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, that it may be proved by the pursuers own servants, friends, or other witnesses, who are otherwise lyable to excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is introduced not only upon the accompt of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, but likewise <hi>in odium</hi> of the offender: Not were it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to prove crimes of that nature by others then are in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. When Hame-sucken is pursued only as an aggravation, it is libelled that such a thing was done by way of Hame-suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the punishment thereof is arbitrary, <hi>eo casu,</hi> and this is so old an aggravation of a crime, that <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam. chap.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 11. aggravats the death of <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> because they had slain him in his own house, and upon his own bed. The Libel in Hame-sucken runs thus, that albeit by the Municipal Law of this Kingdom, the committers of the crime of Hame-sucken, that is to say, who ever invades any of our peaceable Subjects and Liedges violently with weapons, within their own dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houses, or precinct thereof, contrair to our peace, shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur and underly the pain and punishment of death, as our saids Laws and Acts of Parliament in themselves proports; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding whereof, it is of verity, that upon last by-past the forenamed persons above-complained upon, being bodden in fear of war, with Sword, and other weapons inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, came under silence and cloud of night, about ten hours at even, to the said <hi>A.

               <p>PRisons are ordained to keep prisoners till they be tryed, and therefore he who breaks them, does more then tacite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge the guilt, since it is to be presumed that if he were innocent, he would think himself oblidged in honour, as well as interest, to wait till he were absolved judicially: and since Prisons are the greatest securities of the publick peace, therefore to break them is a kind of sacriledge: And as the Walls of our Cities are sacred, because they defend us against our enemies, so should Prisons, because they defend us against our wicked Countrey-men, who are the greatest enemies of the Common-wealth. His Majesties Advocat did also in the case of <hi>Hiltoun,</hi> well call breaking of Prison a publick Hame-sucken.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The breakier of Prison (whom the Civil Law, calls <hi>effra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55274:120"/>
carceris</hi>) was punished <hi>paena capitali, l.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. de effractor</hi>: But by that punishment was meant not death, for that were too severe, but <hi>capitis diminutio est mors civilis</hi>; and in effect he was arbitrarly punishable, except he were a Souldier, for Souldiers breaking Prison were punished by death, <hi>l.</hi> 13. <hi>ff. de re milit.</hi> because Souldiers having ordinarily more courage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that they should be over-awed by greater punishments. And yet I know, the learned <hi>Matheus</hi> thinks, that <hi>quilibet effractor carceris,</hi> is punishable by death: But I think not his Arguments concluding, for though <hi>Ulp. l.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. de effract.</hi> says that <hi>suplicium est sumendum,</hi> yet it follows not, that by <hi>suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium</hi> is meant death, since all the glossators make <hi>supplicium</hi> a <hi>genus</hi>; and when Lawyers mean death by it, they say, <hi>ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum simplicium.</hi> And though <hi>Cicero</hi> sayes, that <hi>exilium non est supplicium sed perfugium &amp; portus supplicii,</hi> he speaks there as an Orator; and indeed as to these who deserv'd to die, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is a harbour and happiness. Nor does his other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument brought from the above-written Law, concerning Souldiers, conclude, for Souldiers, as I observ'd, are more severely punishable then others, because of the hazard of the event, and strictness of Discipline, and because, as I observ'd, they fearless, and so ought to be more threatned then others; but what need was there to have made a special Law for Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, if all breakers of Prison were punishable by death? And it is against the nature of Arbitrary Crimes (such as this is confessed to be) to be punishable by death: and the word <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite punire,</hi> should alwayes be interpret in the meekest sense it can bear: Nor see I why the Law would have spoke so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, if it had design'd that severity. By our Law breakers of Prison are punish'd by banishment, or fyning, according to the nature of the offence, but there is no express Statute deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the punishment.</p>
               <p n="2">II. He who fled out of Prison, when it was broke by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, should in the judgement of <hi>Iulius Clarus,</hi> be punished
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55274:121"/>
in the same way, as if he had been found guilty of the Crime it self, because he confesses the Crime, and flight is a presum'd acknowledgment, <hi>Far. quest.</hi> 21. <hi>num.</hi> 25. but this seems to me too severe, for flight is a presumption; and it is unjust to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn upon presumptions, and were it not absurd to condemn a man to die for a Crime of which he is found by the tryal of others to be innocent: And men may flee out of prison, rather because of the inconveniencies of restraint, then out from the conscience of guilt, <hi>vid. Pegner. quest.</hi> 1. <hi>crim</hi> But if there had been no violence used, a person imprisoned for a Criminal Cause, may escape lawfully, <hi>Perez. ad tit. C. de custod. reor.</hi> because he may redeem lawfully his own blood from hazard. If the person incarcerat was incarcerat only for a civil debt, he going out of prison, was even in that case found punishable only by an arbitrary punishment, <hi>Iuly</hi> 3. 1673. In the case of <hi>Francis Irving</hi> of <hi>Hiltoun,</hi> who was pursued for breaking the Prison of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> where the Libel was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the common Law, and the Laws of Nations, and upon our Municipal Law and custome, without citing any particular Law: And subsuming that he being incarcerat for a civil debt, he and others brake the Prison, at least escap'd, the Prison being broken, and therefore concluded an arbitrary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and payment of the dammage done to the Tolbuith. Against which Libel it was alledg'd, 1. That it was not rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, since it condescended upon no Statute; nor had we any Statute or Practick making the going out of Prison, when it was broke by another, punishable, and when the imprisonment was only for a civil debt: Nor was this a Crime by the Civil Law, which punisht only <hi>effractores carcerum,</hi> but not <hi>eos qui evaserunt</hi>: For <hi>nigrum nunquam excedere debet rubram,</hi> that is to say, nothing in the Title should exceed the Rubrick, and therefore the Inscription or Rubrick being <hi>de effractoribus,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such were criminal by that Title, as were <hi>effractores.</hi> And as <hi>Perez.</hi> observes, <hi>num.</hi> 16. <hi>Si absit violentia potest reus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugere
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55274:121"/>
à carcere quem apertum vidit</hi>: And the reason of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>effractores carcerum</hi> does not militat here, since there is no prejudice done to the Prison, nor violence committed against Authority. And it is lawful, because natural to every man to recover his natural liberty; nor was it ever heard that a man running away from a Messenger, was punish'd as <hi>effractor carceris,</hi> and yet that is the same guilt with what is here pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued. 2. The Libel concluding art and part of the breaking of Prison, because he escap'd out of Prison, when broken, is most irrelevant, since the one may exist without the other; for one may escape and not break, and therefore the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be necessarily illative of the other. 3. The paying dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage cannot be concluded against one who only went out, since he who goes only out of Prison occasions no dammage, and consequently ought to pay none. To which it was reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that as to the first, it hath been the constant opinion of Lawyers, that going out of Prison that is broken is a crime, since the Prisoner ought to have taken no advantage of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans crime, but ought rather to have hindered the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prison, and to have cryed and advertised the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereas here the Prison was broke by a long and daily work, and yet no notice was given; likeas, <hi>Skeen</hi> in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations upon the 1. <hi>Chap. Stat. David</hi> 2. observes, that <hi>qui effracto carcere aufugerit capite punitur,</hi> which is consonant to 13. <hi>ff de re milit. &amp; l.</hi> 36. <hi>ff. de paen.</hi> To the 2. it was reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Prison being broke in the night time, the pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er could not distinguish who broke it: And if it were necessary to prove breaking, it should be impossible to prove the crime; and since the Pannel might have stayed and have cleared his own innocence, it was just that the Law should conclude him guilty; and except the Pannel could by way of exculpation alledge that it was broke by another, and offer to prove by whom it was broke, he who goes out should be concluded to be art and part. Upon which debate the Justices sustain'd the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:55274:122"/>
Libel to infer an arbitrary punishment: But yet the Assize as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soilzied the Pannel, though it was proved that he was in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and that the Prison was broke, and that he came down upon a Rope, for they thought that since his breaking of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was not proved, he ought not to be concluded guilty, but here the verdict was contrair to the Interloquutor.</p>
               <p>If the Prisoner was unjustly detained in Prison, <hi>Clarus</hi> thinks that he is not to be punish'd, though he break Prison, <hi>ques<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 21. <hi>num.</hi> 26. But this opinion is most absurd, for he ought not to be Judge to the lawfulness of his own imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ought to apply to the lawful Authority for redress. And <hi>l.</hi> 13. <hi>ff. de custod. reor.</hi> doth expresly determine, <hi>eos puniendis esse quamvis innocentes inveniantur ex eo crimine propter quod in carcerem impacti sunt.</hi> As also, it is very clear, that <hi>l. nihil interest, C. de captiv.</hi> Upon which the Doctors found their opinion, is only to be understood of such as broke the enemies Prison.</p>
               <p n="3">III. He who fled, having broke Prison, is not thought pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable as a breaker of Prison, if he return, <hi>Boer. decis.</hi> 215. <hi>Clar. num.</hi> 28. But this also seems debateable, since no man can give himself a remission: And there being <hi>jus quaesitum fis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> by the guilt once committed, it cannot be taken off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some deed of the power offended; and we see that Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers and others as punishable by death, though they put themselves in Prison, <hi>liminuit non tollit crimen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. These who broke not Prison, but essayed to break, are to be more meekly punished then these who broke Prison, <hi>Clar. num.</hi> 27. which is also observed in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Not only these who break Prison, but these who assisted them, and the Keepers, by whose contrivance or negligence they escaped, are punishable, <hi>l.</hi> 8.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. <hi>ff. de cust. reor.</hi>

To which, though it was answered, that Servants, getting a Fee, are lyable, <hi>ad exactissimam diligentiam,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, privat diligence, and publick revenge, might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be disappointed: Yet the Lords, upon tryal of the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers innocence and diligence, did assoilzie him.

               <p>MEn having gathered themselves into Societies, they did for their own conveniency and provision grant many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges to Mercats and to such as frequented them, and that all persons might be the more equally provided, they did lay such restrictions both upon buyers and sellers, as they thought fit for that design. For albeit it be lawfull for every man to use his own as he thinks fit, and to sell his commodities where
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55274:123"/>
and to whom he pleases, yet seeing common justice is to be preferred to private advantage, it was the interest of the Common-wealth, as upon that accompt, they will not suffer any man to abuse his own, to the detriment of the Common-wealth, (as is to be seen in these Laws which concerns inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions) so much lesse will they allow men to wrong the Common-wealth for their own private gain. The great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance whereof is seen in this crime of Fore-stalling, or regrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Fore-stallers were by the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Dardanarii à Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dano,</hi> (a Merchant who was famous for that crime) And by the Civil Law these were accompted <hi>dardanarii</hi> properly, who huirded up their own Corns or bought up the Corns of others, of design to keep them to a dearth, but improperly these were likewise called <hi>Dardanarii,</hi> who did buy up any other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity unlawfully upon that design, which kind of Merchants were more properly called <hi>panto poli,</hi> by the novel of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> which crime as it was punished <hi>per legem juliam de anona,</hi> so the punishment of it <hi>per L. sextam, ff. de extra. crim. est</hi> 20. <hi>aurei &amp; puniri extra ordinem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third sort of <hi>Dardanarii,</hi> numbered amongst the Doctors, are these who properly are called <hi>revenditores &amp; qui emunt ut carius vendant ex raritate raritatis raritatem affectantis Tholosanus cap.</hi> 135. <hi>num.</hi> 10. <hi>Matheus</hi> also makes monopolist a fourth branch of these, and surely they are equally guilty of prejudging the Common-wealth with these above relait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Though Fore-stallers and Regraters be ordinarily taken for one and the same, yet there is this difference betwixt them, that Regraters are only those who buy goods, that they may sell them again at a dearer rate: But Fore-stallers are such as buy goods before they come to an open Mercat; but seeing custom uses these words promiscuously, we shall divide Fore-stallers or Regraters into these several species or branches,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:55274:124"/>III. The first species or kind of Fore-stallers, is of such, who either privatly, or by entering into Societies, buy up all goods upon designe, that by making themselves Master of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, they may exact such rates for them as they think fit. And this is very fitly made a crime, because it is absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to the conveniency of the people. But because this (as all designs are) a latent act of the mind, and so is hard to be proved, where the Fore-stallers have not entered into a Society, therefore this guilt is <hi>quo ad</hi> this qualification and design in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from presumptions, as if a person should offer to buy all the Salmond in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and deal with all persons who have any to sell, that they should not sell to any other. 2. If any of these universal buyers should give extraordinary prices, which is presumed he would not do but upon some design. 3. If he should boast that none else had that Commodity to sell, or such other words as might be ground for a Judge to infer the design; yet it may be doubted here, if the universal buying of any of these Commodities, in order to a forraign transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and where none of them are vended at home within the Countrey, can inferr the Crime of Fore-stalling, seing stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are only prejudged by hightening the prices in that case: But seing the Countrey would be likewise thereby prejudged by being absolutely deprived of that Commodity, certainly the guilt will be extended even in that case, which will hold likewise in strangers, who buy up the Commodities of the Countrey upon that design, who may be likewise therefore punished within the Countrey where they commit the guilt, being lyable to that Jurisdiction, <hi>ratione loci delicti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. The second kind of Fore-stallers is of these who buy any Goods coming to Mercats, before they come to the publick stall or place where they should be vended, and this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the denomination: And the reason why this is made a Crime, is, because Mercats being institute for the good of the Common-wealth, every thing by consequence behoved
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55274:124"/>
to be discharged, which is absolutely destructive to it; and the buying any thing before it come to the Mercat, is such. But it may be doubted here, whether Commodities may not be bought by Merchands in publick Burgh, though they be going to the Mercat of another publick Burgh? As for instance, if a Merchand in <hi>Burntisland</hi> may not buy Skins there from one who sayes he is carrying them to the Mercat of <hi>Kinghorn:</hi> And if this were not allowed, it would occasion much trouble both to sellers and buyers. 2. It may be upon the same ground doubted, if one may sell, finding that he is not able to stay to a Mercat day, which it may be, will be but once in a week in some places. As to which difficulty, my opinion is, that these can only be accounted Fore-stallers, against whom something of design against the common good can be proved: As if the Burgesses of one Town should be proved to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a Contract to buy up the Commodities which were going to another adjacent Town, or should stand in the way every Mercat day upon deesign to buy up the Commodities that were going to the next adjacent Town. And I know this to have been the opinion of some learned Lawyers, in a case betwixt the New and Old Towns of <hi>Aberdene</hi>; but to make, that the buying of things generally before they come to a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, should infer a Crime, were most hard and inconvenient. And because the design is the great thing to be look'd to, <hi>non effectus sed affectus,</hi> therefore both the Act of Parliament and Criminal dittay in this case, speak only of Fore-stalling and Regrating; for by the doing any thing of this nature common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and frequently, <hi>animus delinquendi,</hi> is most probably infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And by the same reason, I conclude it probable alwayes for the defenders in this case to alledge by way of exculpation, that what they did, was done either ignorantly, or necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or generally, <hi>alio animo quam delinquendi, v. g.</hi> If one in <hi>Burntisland</hi> were pannel'd for buying Skins that were coming to the Mercat of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he might alledge, that being
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55274:125"/>
oblieged under a failzie to deliver such a number of Skins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt and such a day, that therefore he was necessitate to buy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hefe: Or if any were alledged to have bought Stockings that were coming for a Mercat, he might alledge that he bought them for his own use, or that he knew not there was a Mercat upon the place. And I conclude generally, that the buying any thing for our own privat use, makes not the buyer in no case culpable of this Crime, since he does that <hi>tanquam qui li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet &amp; non tanquam Mercator,</hi> and Fore-stalling is a Crime in Merchandizing.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The third degree of it is, the advising these who are to sell, to hight the price, or the disswading the sellers to come to any particular Mercat.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The fourth is, the buying Commodities in a Mercat, of design to sell the same again in the same Mercat, or in any other Mercat within four Miles thereof.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. All which species are expresly enumerat, <hi>Cap.</hi> 20. <hi>Parl.</hi> 4. K. <hi>Ia.</hi> 5. By which the punishment is appointed to be imprisoning of their persons, and the Escheating of their goods bought and sold, the two part thereof belongs to the King, and the third to the Sherriffs, or other Judge by whom they are condemned. From which Act it may be concluded, that any Judges are competent to punish Fore-stalling albeit of old, the Chamberlain was, in his chamberlain air, the proper Judge of Fore-stallers, as is clear by the Chap. 35. <hi>st. K. Wil. vid.</hi> &amp;. <hi>cap.</hi> 78. <hi>leg. burg.</hi> And in the 143. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 12. <hi>K. I.</hi> 6. where the punishment is ordained to be 40. Pound for the first fault, 100. Pound for the 2, And Escheat of all his moveables for the third.</p>
               <p>I find several persons convict of this crime, as <hi>Cairncrosse</hi> and others, 9. <hi>Iune</hi> 1596. <hi>Anderson</hi> 12. <hi>Iune, Young</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, 11. of <hi>Iune,</hi> that Year; And <hi>Halyday,</hi> 6. <hi>August,</hi> 1596. But I find no punishment to have followed in this, or any other case: Though this crime cannot be said to be in desuetude,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:55274:125"/>
seing thre are some instances of it. Yet <hi>mitius puniri debent,</hi> Because these cases are so few, and no punishment has follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them.</p>
               <p>I find it was alledged for <hi>Young,</hi> 11 <hi>Iune,</hi> And <hi>Halyday,</hi> 11. <hi>August,</hi> foresaid, that the Lybel was not relevant, not condescending upon the persons to whom the goods Fore-stalled were sold, nor the place, nor time, which was repelled, because Fore stalling was unlawful in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all times. But certainly this reply was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant, for else neither time, place, nor person needed be condescended on, seing these are still unlawful at all times. But I think the true reason why it should have been repelled, was, seing common Fore-stalling and Regrating was libelled, which is <hi>nomen habitus,</hi> and not founded upon any particular Act, and therefore the particular Acts needed not be libelled, though even in this case they must be expresly proved. But certainly, sometimes the time, and place is necessary, as where it is Libelled, that goods were bought, and presently sold, or within four Miles of the place where they were bought: for the crime in this case is inferred from the specia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of time and place.</p>
               <p>It was alledged, that confiscation of Moveables could not be inferred, though for the third and fourth fault, except the Pannel had been convict for the first two: Which was spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led likewise, because the King could not be prejudged in his interest, <hi>quo ad,</hi> the confiscation by the negligence of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat, or any privat informer, by not pursuing: Nor could that negligence purge their guilt, or procure them an impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And it were absurd, (seing crimes and punishments are to be commensurat) that these who had continued in that guilt for many years, should be no more punished, then these who had but once incurred the same.</p>

               <p>USury is that Crime, which is committed by taking more annualrent for any sum lent, then what is allowed by the Law of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="1">I. This Crime is committed properly in Money, <hi>&amp; in mutuo</hi>: but yet it is both by our Law, and the Civil, and Canon Laws, extended to other Contracts: for with us, it is committed in bargains of Victual, or Tacks, as shall be cleared by the subsequent Acts; and therefore Lawyers divide Usury, into that which they call <hi>direct Usury, quae
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:55274:126"/>
obtinet tantum in mutuo</hi>; and <hi>indirect Usury,</hi> which takes place in other Contracts.</p>
               <p>Usury is also divided, <hi>in usuram manifestam &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latam</hi>; which co-incides almost with the former distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>By our old Law, Usury could not have been pursued in the Usurers own life, but he might have repented him of it, at any time before his death; so that it was not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the Crime, but the continuance in it, which was punishable: but if he repented not, his Heirs might be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulted, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>Reg. Maj. cap.</hi> 24. And this, <hi>Skeen</hi> observes, to be consonant to the Law of <hi>England,</hi> whereby the penalty of a living Usurer, belongs to the King, but of a dead Usurer, to the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The true method in this Title, is, to clear the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of Usury, determined by our Statutes. The first Species thereof is,</p>
               <p>Whoever receives more annualrent, then ten for each hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, shall be punished as Ockerers, or Usurers, conform to the Laws of the Realm, already made, <hi>Par.</hi> 11. <hi>K. Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 52. And yet I find no prior Law to this, expressing the punishment of Usury; only it is said, <hi>Par.</hi> 6. <hi>Ia.</hi> 2. <hi>Act</hi> 23. that keepers of Victual to a dearth, shall be punished as Ockerers, and this is properly Usury.</p>
               <p>By Act of Parliament, 1649. it is appointed, that the annualrent of Money, should be at six <hi>per cent,</hi> conform to which Act, all annualrents were payed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> till 1661. At which time the Parliament, 1649. was rescind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whereupon it was debated, in <hi>Hugh Roxburghs</hi> case, <hi>March</hi> 23. 1668. whether the taking of more annualrent, then six <hi>per cent,</hi> after the year 1649. could infer Usury; and that it could not, was urged from these reasons, 1. That where there was no Law, there could be no contempt: but so it was, that the Acts of Parliament 1649. were no Laws,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55274:127"/>
that Parliament being rescinded, <hi>ob defectum authoritatis,</hi> and without any <hi>salvo,</hi> as to what was past. 2. The Liedges might as well be punisht now for transgressing the penal Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, made by the usurpers, seing these were binding, the time of the transgression, and both want authority equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 3. By the Act betwixt Debitor and Creditor, 1. <hi>Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 1. <hi>Parl. K. Ch.</hi> 2. Such pactions are only declared usuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>quo ad futura &amp; inclusio unius est exclusio altetius.</hi> To this it was answered, that the Parliament 1649. was in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor till the year 1661. <hi>Ergo,</hi> before that time it was Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to take more then the annualrent therein prohibited; and albeit the defect of Authority might be pleaded, where the Crime committed, depended meerly upon the Authority con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverted. Yet in this case it could not; seing Usury was a Crime, which was prohibited by all Laws. And as to the <hi>quota,</hi> which was all that was determined by the Parliament, 1649. It was no such thing as concerned the Rebellion, for which that Parliament was rescinded; but was a reasonable, and universal good for the Kingdom, and approved by the present Parliament. And those who took annualrent during that time, at more then six <hi>per cent,</hi> did in so far oppresse their Debitors beyond others, and so should be punished. 2. By the Act anent penal Statutes, 1661. Usury is excepted from the penal Statutes therein abridged, which needed not, if the taking more then six <hi>per cent,</hi> for the years immediatly preceeding, had not been Usury. 3. The Lords of Session did still restrict the annualrents, even during these years, to six <hi>per cent,</hi> which they could not have done, if that Law had not warranted them; as in the case betwixt <hi>Wauchop</hi> and <hi>Lawder,</hi> 1665. for if that Act was in force then, it was a Crime to take more then was therein commanded, if it was not abrogated; then the former Act, 1648. appointing eight <hi>per cent,</hi> was in vigour, and so the Lords could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strict the annualrent to six, against an expresse Law. This
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55274:127"/>
case was not decided, but the Justices inclined to think, that though the Act 1649. was abrogated; yet it was a sufficient warrand, to regulat the Decision of civil cases, because all bargains were then made, with respect to the <hi>quota,</hi> thereby determined, <hi>&amp; erat lex habita &amp; reputata:</hi> but that being abrogated, it could not found sufficiently a criminal Action, to infer so severe a punishment, as that of Usury; for a Crime is mainly such, because Authority is contemned, and contempt is the essence of a Crime; but so it is, there could be no contempt where there was no Authority. But it may be doubted, if a Merchant who was to imploy his stock upon Merchandize, whereby he might have got far more then the annualrent of his stock, should at the desire of his friend, then in great straits, lend him his Money, for more then the ordinar profit; if in that case he could be punishable as an Usurer? And albeit our Law be general, yet here <hi>ab est animus faeneran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi>: and there was no advantage taken of the Debitors necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for which, Usury is mainly punishable. And I find, that <hi>Abbas c. Naviganti de usur. num.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp; Socin. tract de usur. num.</hi> 75. do conclude this to be no Usury. Yet I know, that some judicious Lawyers with us, did at a consultation upon this same case, conclude, that the Justices could not receive this exception, seeing they were tyed to strict Law; but they thought that the Council might allow some mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Another <hi>Species</hi> of Usury by our Law, is, to take annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alrent before hand; that is to say, before the term of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was ordinarly done, by retaining a years annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, when the Money was first lent, and this is determined to be Usury, by the 222. <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 14. <hi>K. Ia.</hi> 6. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after by the 28. <hi>Act. Parl.</hi> 23. <hi>K. Ia.</hi> 6. by which last, it was likewise Statute, that whosoever shall detain the time of the lending, or shall exict, crave, or receive from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitors, annualrent at the time of the lending, or add the same
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55274:128"/>
to their principal summes, or whosoever shall exact, or crave annualrent, shall commit Usury. And this seems to be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that principal of the Civil Law, whereby <hi>punieban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur qui plus petebant &amp; plus tempore petere dicebatur qui petebas ante tempus debito constitutum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon these last words of the Act of Parliament, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the exacting, or craving annualrents before the term of payment, there was a dittay founded against <hi>Purdie,</hi> in the year 1666. for taking ten pounds Scots, as the annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of fifty merks, upon the 18. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> whereas no annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents was due, till <hi>Martimas</hi> that year. Against which dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tay, it was alledged, 1. That this Species of the dittay was meerly Statuto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, and so was not to be extended, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the interest of the Leidges, to salve which, it was infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or beyond the expresse words of the Act; but so it is, that it was only the interest of the Leidges, that they should not be forced to pay interest before hand; but that they might voluntarly pay their annualrents, without any danger to the receiver, which may sometimes be for the advantage of the payer; as for instance, if a person who were lyable for annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents at <hi>Martimas,</hi> might be for his own advantage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous that his Creditor might receive his annualrents in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> because he would not have the conveniency of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at <hi>Martimas,</hi> and might be either at expences, or in hazard to send them. And therefore, seeing the receiver here had raised no charge of Horning, nor used no other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence for compelling the Debitors to pay the annualrents, his voluntar offer of them should not prejudge the receiver, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seeing by the narrative of the Act, it will appear that the eviting of oppression, in exacting Money before the term, was that against which the Act of Parliament intended only to guard. 2. Though by the first part of the Act, exacting, craving, or receiving annualrents at the time of the lending, be expresly forbidden: Yet when the craving annualrents before
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55274:128"/>
the term of payment (which is the clause founded upon, in this dittay) the Act speaks only thereof, craving, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting, but doth not forbid simply receiving. 3. <hi>Consuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do etiam mala &amp; injusta excusat usurarium à pena Bar. in lege siquis fugitivus, ff. edil. edict. Socinus consilio</hi> 170. And it was very notour, that in this caise there was nothing more ordinar, then for honest and just men in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to take annualrent before the term, from willing Debitors, either to supplie their own necessity, or to gratify their Debitor upon occasions. And it were very unjust, that the Pannel who was a poor Merchant should ensnare himself, <hi>in apicibus juris,</hi> thinking himself warranted in what he did, by the practice of the countrey, and of the most intelligent persons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. 4. <hi>De minimis non curat praetor,</hi> nor should severe and statutory punishment be inflicted for errours, where no person is any way considerably prejudged. And in which, it cannot be presumed there was any guilt, seeing the advantage was so small, for the only share the Pannel reapt of this, was the annualrent of ten pound, from <hi>Iuly</hi> to <hi>Martimas,</hi> which could not exceed three shilling scots; so that to conclude, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest sincere Merchant, who was otherwise <hi>intigerrimae famae,</hi> guilty of Usury; and to infer confiscation of all his Moveables, and Infamy, which is the punishment of Usury, is against all sense and reason, who are not (as the justices) tied to strict Law.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding of all which, the Justices did find the dittay relevant, as founded upon the above-written clause of the foresaid Act; but the grounds above related, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to the Council, they rescinded the Justices Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquutor; and yet the Justice did again condemn <hi>Hugh Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> 28. of <hi>November,</hi> 1668. upon the same Act, and like dittay; but that Interloquutor was likewise stopt by the Council.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The third Species of Statutory Usury with us, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by these, who to cheat the Law, colour their fraud
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55274:129"/>
by taking, not more anualrent directly, then that is prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lew, but taking wodsets of Land from the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for more then their annualrent can extend to, and set back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks to them for payment of what is agreed upon. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which, and all such Usury (which is called by the Law, <hi>usura velata)</hi> it is statute by the 247. <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 15. <hi>K. Ia.</hi> 6. that whoever receives such wodsets, or enters into any such bargains, for which more is taken, either in Money, or by any other transactions, whereby any thing that is taken, may be reduced in Money, to more then the ordinar annualrent, upon whatsoever colour or pretext, shall be guilty of Usury. And by the 62. <hi>Act Par.</hi> 1. <hi>K. Ch.</hi> 2. It is declared, that for the future, it shall be Usury to receive proper wodsets of Lands, and others, exceeding the annualrents of the sums, and bearing by expresse provision, that the lender shall not be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any hazards of the Fruits, Tennents, Warr, or Trouble; for clearing of which Act, it is necessar to know, that wodsets with us, are either proper, or improper; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are these, wherein the wodsetter runs all hazard of the Lands wodset to him, and is to expect no more annualrent for his Money, then what Fruits of the Lands remains after all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards. Improper wodsets are these, wherein the wodsetter is only countable for what rent he receives from the lender; nor is he lyable to the hazard of Bankrupt-tennents, Warr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and Pestilence, which distinction, founded upon these ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, is very agreable to reason, and the common Law; for Usury being a certain gain, he who gets for his Money but a hazard of gain, commits not Usury, for that is <hi>emptio ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus retis,</hi> as if I should lend Money, and get for my security the hazard of what rent could be collected from a loading of Timber coming from <hi>Norway,</hi> &amp;c. And upon this ground, the Law allowed <hi>fenus nauticus,</hi> to be much greater then all others, seeing the lender run the risk therein of all Sea ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards. But if the hazard be not so great as may compense the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55274:129"/>
excess of the annualrent taken beyond what the Law allows, <hi>eo casu,</hi> it excuses not from Usury, as if a wodset be granted of a Miln, or Salmond fishing, if the said rents do ordinarly exceed the annualrents, by any considerable excess, then the receivers of the wodset commit Usury, notwithstanding of the hazard. And this brings to my memory, a case debated upon the 22. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1672. wherein a Gentleman being pursued as an Usurer, in so far as he had taken his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitor obliedged to pay him a Boll, for the annualrent of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hundred Merk, which according to the feir of the year did, for the two years of his wodset, extended to five Pound the Boll, and so exceeded the annualrent, by twenty Shilling eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Boll; yet this was found no Usury, because he in that case, took his hazard of the feir of the year, which might have been much lower: and because that the price of Victual va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries much, according to the several Shires, and Years. And lest the people should be at an uncertainty in criminal cases, which were dangerous; therefore by the 122. <hi>Act Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Par.</hi> 14. it is appointed, that no man shall take more profite, then according to ten Pound, for the hundred Pound, or five Bolls of Victual, which the annualrent being then, at ten of the hundred, and now at six, doth allow according to that probation, two Bolls for the hundred Merks, whereas there was but only one Boll taken here, for the annualrent for the hundred Merk; nor was this Act abrogat by the <hi>Act</hi> 247. <hi>Par.</hi> 15. because, though that be posterior, yet it doth not expresly abrogat this Act, nor ought it to have been abrogat for avoiding of uncertainty, as said is. And for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the undertaking of hazard hinders the taking of advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Tacks, to infer Usury, as was decided <hi>September</hi> 1668. wherein <hi>Robert Lawder</hi> was pursued as an Usurer, because he had taken a tack of two Buts of Land, and a Dovecoat for four years, which payed fifty Merks yearly, <hi>communibus annis,</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:55274:130"/>
and that for satisfaction of the annuulrents of an hundred Merks, which Tack did bear this clause, that if the first year <hi>Robert</hi> were payed, he should defalck so much of the annualrent proportionally; notwithstanding of which clause, he refused to compt: It was alledged for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, that the Tacks-man had run a hazard, because he might have been disappointed of all duty, <hi>quo casu,</hi> he would have got no releif. To which it was duplyed, that the same hazard was in wodsets; and yet the taking a wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set for more then the ordinary annualrent, made the wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setter incur the Crime of Usury. Nor could this hazard defend, because it was not great, and there was scarce any hazard in it; not could the danger be here objected, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after expiring of the years, the receiver offered to compt with the lender, and to allow him both principal sum, and annualrents; to which it was triplyed, that the Act of Parliament, discharging Usurary, wodsets doth not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge Tacks; and there is a great difference, as to Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry betwixt tacks and wodsets: for wodsetters have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to require their Money from the debitor, so that they lose not the sum, though they lose their rents; but Tacks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men lose all, if their tack duty be not payed: and as to their offer of compting, that being only competent after the first year, it could not be objected thereafter, and the danger was past before the offer.</p>
               <p>The fourth degree of usury with us, is to take budd or bribe for the loan of money, or for continuing it, when it is lent, whereupon many debates do arise. The cause why the debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor gives a gratuity to his Creditor, being oft, <hi>actus animi,</hi> is hard to be proven. But generally it is sustained that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Treatie must be proved, or else it must be proved, that the receiver is <hi>manifestus,</hi> that is an ordinar Usurer, for else to receive a gratuity is no crime; And it were against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55274:130"/>
that by lending money to my friend, I should become uncapable of a donation from him.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The common Law also sustains it to be Usury, if a man Wodset his Lands, and in the Wodset provide that it shall not be lawful to Redeem betwixt and a definit time, for in that case it presumes that the wodset granter adjects this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of some known advantage, and this is to take more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for money then the Annualrent. <hi>Molm. de Censu.</hi> But this the Lords would not sustain to be Usury. Nor did they find it an unlawful paction, in the Action betwixt, Sir <hi>Iohn Drummond,</hi> and <hi>Achtertyr.</hi> And in effect these pactions are allowed by Act 62. <hi>P.</hi> 1. <hi>K. C.</hi> 1. <hi>S.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>By the Civil Law, it was Usury to take Annualrent for Annualrent; at least it was declared unlawful, <hi>l. ult. C. de usur</hi> And I conceive that to swell up Annualrents thus, beyond what the Law allows, would infer Usury with us: for else the Law might be thus cheated. But though by the Civil Law it was unlawful, and Usury, to accumulat Annualrents with the principal sums; and to make both bear Annualrent; which was called <hi>Anatocismus,</hi> and is discharged, <hi>l.</hi> 28. <hi>C. de usur.</hi> yet with us, such pactions are most lawful: for since, if the Annuals had been payed, they had born Annuals, why may they not be lent out to the debitor, as well as to others.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The probation of Usury is, either by writ, witnesses, or Oath, as to writ it may be doubted, how the pursuer may recover it for instructing his Libel, the writs being ordinarily in the Usurers own hand, and <hi>nemo tenetur edere instrumenta contra se.</hi> And yet I find Lawyers very clear, that <hi>hoc casu te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netur edere contra se Bartol. &amp; doctores ad l. praetor §. Is etiam ff. de edendo Arelat. de heretic. notabil.</hi> 21. and seing with us, Usurers are obliedged to swear against the common Criminal rules, because of the obscurity of the crime, why should they not be oblieged to produce ther writs, for the same reason? and as to the former maxime, that <hi>nemo tenetur edere,</hi> &amp;c. It may
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55274:131"/>
be answered, that it holds not <hi>in criminalibus,</hi> for we see that in improbations, the Pursuer will force the Defender upon an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeance of falshood to produce all his writs, and why not in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury? Yet I know that it is ordinarily advised in such cases to raise an exhibition.</p>
               <p>As to the probation by witnesses, It is doubted if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitor who lent the money may be received as witnesse? se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is <hi>socius criminis,</hi> it being unlawful to take as well as to give upon Usury, but with us these are received, as <hi>Hissleside</hi> in <hi>Somervel</hi>'s case, 18. <hi>Ian.</hi> 1667. But thereafter the Justices declared that they would not sustain the Debitor to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse 11. <hi>November,</hi> 1667. His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat <hi>contra Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> And that because by the 7. <hi>Act, P.</hi> 16. <hi>K. I.</hi> 6. It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that usury shall be proved by the Oath of the party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of the unlawful Annualrent, and witnesses insert, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving the Oath of the giver of the unlawful Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, for eviting perjury. Nor will the Justices sustain as a reply, that the giver of the unlawful. Annualrent in this case had payed the sum, and so was no more debitor, and could expect no advantage, and so the fear of perjury ceased. And as to the foresaid seventh Act, It was answered, that it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made not to exclude the debitor absolutely, but to correct the 257. <hi>Act,</hi> 15. <hi>P. K. I.</hi> 6. whereby the Oath of Party was declared to be receivable as decisive of the cause. As to other witnesses, our ordinary distinction is, that pactions in Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are either extrinsick to the Bond, or writ, as are the taking Bud or Bribe for continuing a Sum, and these may be proved by any witnesses; albeit by the foresaid 7. <hi>Act.</hi> It is said that Usury shall be proved by the Oath of the Party, and witnesses insert. But pactions which concern the writ it self, as that whereby more is promised then is contained in the bond, these cannnot be proven, but by the Witnesses insert, for else writ might be taken away by Witnesses. As to oath of Party, it
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55274:131"/>
is ordained to be taken by the former acts against the common rules of Law, by which, <hi>nemo tenetur jurare in suam turpitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>: And the Justices accordingly do force the Pannels to swear, as in the case of <hi>Wilson</hi> above cited. But it may be doubted if this act should not extend only to Civil, and not Criminal cases; For that act sayes, that <hi>litis-contestation</hi> being made, it shall be lawful to receive: But so it is that there is no <hi>litis-contestation</hi> in Criminals. <hi>go.</hi> This Act can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be extended to these cases.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Usury was allowed by the Civil Law, as the proper product, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>pecuniae,</hi> but by the Canon Law it was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and most Lawyers think it may be punished criminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Decius Consil.</hi> 130. And it is called <hi>crimen utriusque fori,</hi> because it is punishable Civilly and Ecclesiastically.</p>
               <p>The pain of Usury with us, is, That the debitor shall be free from his obligation, or have back his pledge, or if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitor conceal, then the revealer shall have right to the sums, <hi>Act,</hi> 222. <hi>K. I.</hi> 6. <hi>Par.</hi> 14. And by the 248 <hi>Act, P.</hi> 15. <hi>K. I.</hi> 6. It is appointed that the Usurary Bond or Contract shall be reduced, and being reduced, the sums shall belong to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> or his Donator; and the Party to have repetition of the unlawful Annualrent payed by him, in case only he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the Donator in the reduction.</p>

               <p>IT is to no purpose to make good Laws, if the execution of them be not committed to just and diligent persons, as it is to no purpose to have an exact ballance, if that ballance be not put in a good hand: and therefore, as the Law hath been very liberal of its priviledges, to just Judges, and severe in punishing such as offended them; so it hath punish'd with the same rigour, such Judges as transgress either by bribing, negligence, or partiality, which are three distinct species for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the common Law and ours.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Bribing is the taking of money, or other good deed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for doing of justice, or committing of unjustice.</p>
               <p>There are indeed some Lawyers who think, that a Judge taking money in a Civil Cause, to do justice, doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by commit a Crime, but is only lyable to restitution, <hi>Menoch.</hi> 2. <hi>Arb.</hi> 342. <hi>n.</hi> 6. but this is expresly contrary to sound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, since if taking upon any terms be allowed, the Law may
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55274:132"/>
be eluded, and Judges will be thereby tempted, not only to take bribes, but to take pains to justifie what they have done: but yet I think that this opinion is neither proved, <hi>per l.</hi> 4. <hi>ff. de l. jul. repetund.</hi> For there it is not only said, <hi>non excipiet quo magis aut minus quid ex officio suo fecerit,</hi> which prohibits only an excess in justice, and not the doing justice for money, nor <hi>perl.</hi> 3. <hi>c. eod.</hi> since that Law doth only in the general forbid the taking of money, but this is expresly forbidden, <hi>l.</hi> 2. §. 2 <hi>ff. de condict. obturp. caus.</hi> where it is declared a Crime, but the punishment there seems only to be <hi>litem suam facere,</hi> and <hi>Skeen ad Stat.</hi> 25. <hi>Wil.</hi> says, that <hi>non licet judici vendere ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium justum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. By our Law, the Kings Judges were to those an Assize upon what they had done as Judges; and if they were convict, they were to be punished by the King and his Council, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the measure of their fault, <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Stat. Rob.</hi> 2. and the Judges of inferior Courts, such as Regalities, were to those an Assize before the Justices, and if they were found ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther culpable or remiss, they were to escheat their moveables, and their life to be in the Kings will, or in the will of the Lords of the Regality, <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <hi>ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by the 26. <hi>Act, Ia.</hi> 3. <hi>Parl.</hi> 5. a Sheriff, or any other Officer of Fee, that is to say, any Heritable Officer, is to be put from his Office for three years, if he be found partial, and an ordinary Judge, if he be found partial, loseth his Office for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And though his person's being punished at the King's will, and the paying of the expence of the party injured, be only added to the pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shment, expressed against a Judge who is not Heritable yet I conceive, that being added in the last place, it is applicable, both to the Heritable Judges, and others. Likeas, it is observable, that though by all these Acts, the King and His Council are only exprest to be the Judges competent; yet <hi>de practica,</hi> the Justices are Judges competent, if partiality be committed in any criminal cause,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:55274:133"/>
as for instance, if a Sheriff should execute any Pannel, upon a Crime proved only against him, by the pursuers brothers, or other inhabile witnesses, or upon a Libel, which were palpably irrelevant; in these and in such other criminal cases, the Justices and not the Council, would be only Judges compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; nor is partiality in civil cases, a Crime by our Law, though it be punishable by this Act, <hi>paena arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>: and by resounding of the dammage sustained by the pursuer.</p>
               <p>The foresaid Laws strike only against partiality, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but bribing is expresly discharged, by the 25. <hi>Chap. Stat. K. William,</hi> but there is no punishment there exprest; and therefore <hi>Skeen</hi> adds in his observations, the punishment of <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>cum aut hent. c. de paen. judic.</hi> And thereafter, by the 22. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Stat. Rob.</hi> 1. all Judges are forbidden to take Land, or any thing else, to Champart, either for giving, deferring, or prolonging of justice: and the offenders are to be in the Kings will, and to lose their office for all their life, Champart is a <hi>French word,</hi> signifying <hi>part. du champs,</hi> a part of any Land; so that by a Metaphor, the taking any part of the advantage, arising by any plea, is forbidden by this Statute, which the Civilians call <hi>pactum de quota litis,</hi> by the 104. <hi>Act</hi> 7. <hi>Parl. I.</hi> 5. consulting, or giving partial judgement, is declared bribing in a Judge, and such as diffame them as bribers, are punisht, <hi>legetalionis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But because these Acts were not clear against bribing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the 93. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl. I.</hi> 6. the taking of bribes, is discharged to the Lords of Session, their Wives, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, under the pain of infamy, deprivation, and confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all their Moveables; to all which, an arbitrary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is adjected.</p>
               <p>It is very observable, that by this Act, not only the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bribes is discharged, but even the taking any goods or gear, during the depending of a Plea; or from such, as shall
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55274:133"/>
have causes depending for the future: and though it seem'd very reasonable, that men should not be discharged of the effects of their friends liberality, and should not be, by being elected Lords of Session, put in a worse condition, then the other subjects; yet so jealous is the Law of bribing, that it is afraid, that if Judges be allowed, to take at any rate, or upon pretext of their friends liberality, they might abuse this pretext, to meer bribing, <hi>l. ult. c. h. t. l.</hi> 4. <hi>ff. eod.</hi> And yet the Glosse, <hi>ad l.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. h. t.</hi> allows a Judge to take from his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, within the sixth degree; nor is it lawful to take any thing, even by way of remuneration, though remuneration be rather a paying then a gilting, <hi>Matheus P.</hi> 619. But I conceive, that this must be understood, of a remuneration made for services, done during a Plea, or upon the accompt of a Plea, or upon any publict accompt. But it seems against reason to think, that if a brother, or brother in Law, should entertain his brothers family, whilst he is a Judge, that he may not receive a remuneration for that, or the like kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>The second observation from this Act, is, that it is not lawful for their wives, or servants, to take bribes, or good deeds, which is consonant to <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>C. h. t.</hi> by which the Judge is lyable to pay the quadruple of what his servants take; but it would appear, that none is lyable by this Statute, for what his servants take, except he know that his servants take by command, or ratihabition; for this Statute discharges Judges to take by themselves, or their wives, or their servants, which implyes some Act of the masters; for <hi>qui facit per alium facit per se,</hi> but he who is absolutely ignorant of what his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants doth, cannot be punished for anothers fault, against the common rules of Law, else the master should be made a slave to his servants, who might at his pleasure force him to what he decided, or else by taking bribes, might ruine both his masters estate and reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:55274:134"/>Since this Statute discharges only the Lords of Session, it may be doubted, if it should extend to bribes, taken by other Judges. For Laws in criminal cases, use not to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and since the Lords of Session may by bribing, do mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e unjustice, and prejudge the Leidges more then others, it may be alledged, that other Judges ought not to be so severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished as they; and yet since the Crime of bribing is punished by the Civil Law, and Law of Nations, in all Judges, it seems just to extend this Act to all Judges; and the other, because though, <hi>lex julia</hi> was made <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra principales magistratus,</hi> yet it was by the Roman customes, extended, <hi>ad magistratus urbanos, Math.

               <p>LAws are only the <hi>idea</hi> or picture of Justice, but execution is its life; and though those who have the execution of Laws and Sentences committed to them, be ranked but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the lowest servants of Justice; yet they have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse to be these who compleat that great work, and amongst whose hands it becomes perfect; and therefore the Laws ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving committed its most excellent part to them; it should be, and is, in a most eminent way careful of them, and in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for their safty, it secures its own honour.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The execution of sentences was committed amongst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to the apparitors mention'd of the Codex, in three several Titles, and these were erected in a Colledge, which was sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>collegium,</hi> or <hi>familia apparitorum,</hi> as our Heraulds are in a
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55274:136"/>
fraternity, by the 125. <hi>Act. Parliament,</hi> 12. <hi>K. I.</hi> 6. The <hi>Italian</hi> Doctors call them now, <hi>Beroarii,</hi> so that these who would know what the doctors hold in cases of deforcement, must look to the Indexes, at these words. According to the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, it was a species of <hi>laesae-majestie,</hi> to resist the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of sentences, <hi>l, quisquis ad l. Iub. majest. l. Iulianus. ff. de officio ejus cui mandata est jurisdictio</hi> and <hi>Guid. Pap. quest.</hi> 557. observes, that from these Laws does rise the practique of <hi>France, qua puniuntur capitaliter verberantes apparitores, in exe cutione officii nam qui mandata principum exaequuntur videntur vivae principium imagines ac adeo graviter puniri debent ac inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riantes Statuas principum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With us the execution of sentences, is committed to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds, Pursevants, Messengers, Macers, and the execution of sentences of inferiour Courts, to the respective officers of these Courts; and the resisting, beating, or wounding, of these, in the execution of their office, is in our Law that Crime which we call Deforcement, <hi>Leg. Burgal. cap.</hi> 135.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Deforcement then is defined to be that Crime which is committed in opposing Macers, Messengers, or any others, who use to execute sentences, whilst they are executing their office; And upon that accompt, so that if either the Officer was not in execution of his office, or if the Officer be beat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any other accompt, as if a scuffle should arise, occasioned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly by himself, this would not infer a deforcement, as shall be said hereafter.</p>
               <p>Though this crime be amongst the most attrocious, because the King and Soveraign power is in their person despised, and therefore this crime is called <hi>Dispectus Regis stat. Williel. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>verse</hi> 5. And Justice is after much pains taken by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and expences layed out by the Parties disappointed; yet it is only punished by confiscation of moveables, and an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imprisonment, and the one half of the Moveables so eschea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, falls to the King, and the other half to the Party at whose
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55274:136"/>
instance the Letters were execute, <hi>I.</hi> 6. <hi>P.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 150. The words whereof are, If an Officer of Armes, or Sheriffs in that part, or other person whatsoever be deforced, molested, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or pursued, to the effusion of their blood, by any person or persons, whom they shall Summond, or others of his causing and command, the time he is executing of any Summonds, Letters, or Precept direct by His Highnesse, or other Judges that he shall loss, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which Act it is to be observed, 1. That Deforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is committed by troubling of any Officer belonging to any Court. 2. That those words, (to effusion of their blood) seem to be a quality put in a sentence by it self, and so may be thought to relate to all the former words, <hi>molested, invaded, or pursued,</hi> yet the words of the Act are only wrong pointed, and these words, <hi>or pursued to the effusion of their blood,</hi> should all be put in one sentence, for, <hi>de practica,</hi> simple oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, or molesting the Messenger, though without blood, will infer a Deforcement. 2. Though by the Act it would seem only these against whom Letters, and Charges are raised, or such as they hound out, can be guilty of Deforcement, yet if any others do deforce a Messenger, though they be neither the parties interested themselves, or hounded out by them, yet they are likewise guilty of Deforcement: As is clear by the 4. <hi>cap. stat. Williell. vers.</hi> 1. And by the 84. Act, 11. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament K. I.</hi> 6. And seeing the crime lies in the opposition to the Messenger, whoever is guilty of that act commits this Crime. 3. Though this act make only causing or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a crime, yet certainly if any person interested does ratiha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the Deforcement committed by any other person, by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giving him good deed, or by receiving his Letters, or Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son taken from him, he is <hi>eo ipso</hi> guilty of Deforcement: As the Council found in the case of the Earl of <hi>Seafort,</hi> against the Lord <hi>Mackdonald, anno.</hi> 1669. upon full debate: In which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

lords in the <hi>Highlands</hi> should be lyable for deforcement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon the grounds, if they did not deliver up the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. 4. Though the execution be disappointed and stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, yet is declared by the Parliament to be as sufficient as perfected: and it were unjust, that the party having done all that in him say, that the disappointment, <hi>eo casu,</hi> should be prejudicial to him. 5. Seing the punishment of this act, is only confiscation of Moveables, and imprisonment; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by the Act 84.11. <hi>Parl. K. I.</hi> 6. The lives and goods of the offenders were to be in the Kings will; It may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether the Judge may punish by either of the Acts, seing the last does not expresly abrogat the first; or whether both should stand in vigour and force. Concerning which question, the general Lawyers have very many learned debates, but the most solid and approven conclusions are, that when a crime is punished by several pains, in several Laws, or Acts, which Acts do not derogat one from another expresly, that it is in the election of the Judge, to punish the delinquent, by either of the pains, <hi>l. quoties ff. de actionibus &amp; obligationibus.</hi> But the Judge making election of one of the pains, cannot thereafter make use of the other: <hi>l. ff. senatus de acusationibus, vid. Cabal. resol. criminal. cap.</hi> 3. where this general question is fully handled; and to the considerations there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by him, I would adde this, that where there are several punishments appinted by Laws, whereof the one derogats not from the other, that the Judge should follow that of the two which is most in use: And therefore seing Confiscation of moveables and imprisonment, is alwayes used in this case, that punishment should be certainly followed by the Juge: for since custom may antiquat Laws, and is a warrand for a Judge, to proceed criminally where there is no Law; it should much more determine betwixt two Laws, which of them should be followed: But there is the less difficulty in this case, that none of the acts makes deforcement to be capital. And these words,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55274:137"/>
                  <hi>that their lives shall be in the Kings will,</hi> do not infer, <hi>de jure,</hi> the pain of death, as is elsewhere fully debated: but it may be doubted, if their persons may not likewise be punishable, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only by the former act are their lives to be in the Kings will, but likewise by the seventh Act, 17. <hi>Parliament, I.</hi> 6. It is declared, that deforcement of Officers shall be punished by the escheat of their moveable goods, and punishment of their person according to the Laws of before: So that there is <hi>geminatio legum,</hi> which makes the Law much stronger: And I remember that some Sea men in <hi>Bruntisland,</hi> having rowed off their Boat when the Customers Officers were about to poynd some unfree goods, bought out of Captain <hi>Dewars</hi> Ship, by rowing off, of which Boat the Messenger who was to Poynd, fell in the Sea: The Commissioners of the Thesaury did sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marly in <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1669. ordain the Sea-men to be whipt, which was accordingly done.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Messengers have as the Badge of their Office, a Blason bearing the Kings Armes, and a Wand of Peace if they bear not the Blason, it is believed (and that is the first objection against the conception and relevancy of the Lybel) they may be deforced, because by that act only people are obleidged to know that they are Messengers, and the Wand of Peace is that whereby they touch a Rebel, and declares him to be their Prisoner, and when they are deforced, they use to break the Wand of Peace; but though their Libel bear alwayes that the Wand of peace is broken, yet if the troubling of the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be proven, though this quality be not proven, the assize will still find guilty, as was found in the case betwixt <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> 13. <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1669. where it was likewise found that albeit ordinarily the Messenger who was deforced, doth give in with his Libel, an exemption of deforcement, wherein after the ordinary form, he relates how he execute the Letters, and how and by whom he was deforced, yet that execution is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55274:138"/>
necessary for proving the deforcement, but that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement may be proven by witnesses; for else there could be no deforcement, if the Messenger were killed, so that he could make no execution: or if he were bribed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcer, and so would give none, but that an execution of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement was only necessary to the effect the Letters might be repute as validly execute, as if they had been really exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.</p>
               <p>It uses sometimes to be alledged against the relevancy of the Libel in this crime, that the Libel is not relevant, because it bears not that the Messenger had the letters of Caption in his hand, and shew them to the Party whom he apprehended be vertue of that Caption, for without seeing of the Letters, the Party is not obliedged to obey, and if it were otherwayes, any man might take a free Liedge, and keep him till he should get a Caption, though he had none at the time of the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But upon the 19. of <hi>February,</hi> 1672. <hi>Gordoun</hi> of <hi>Braco</hi> was found guilty of deforcement, though the Messenger his having a Caption, was neither libelled nor proved, and that because the Rebel did not crave to see a warrand, and the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger was answerable if he did execute without a warrand: Neither did the Lords think that the Messenger was bound to put the warrand in the Rebels hands, left he should destroy it: But he was bound to shew it to any disinteressed person who was present. In the same Process it was likewise found, that a Messenger might execute a Caption under silence of night, though it was pretended that this might give a colour to Robbers to enter in to honest mens houses under night, upon pretext of executing of Captions; though Poyndings indeed cannot be execute after the Sun is set, because a Poynding is a sentence, and requires <hi>formam judicii</hi>; and no Court can be kept under silence of night. Some Judges ordain Officers to take Raes from a Mast, and arrest Ships, without a written order, the haste of the execut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on so requiring; and therefore I think
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:55274:138"/>
that though such have not a written warrand, they cannot lawfully be opposed: for it is the duty of all good Subjects to enquire first if he who pretends to have authority, have it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, though he see no written warrand, but not rashly to oppose what may be lawful.</p>
               <p>Another ordinary objection against the Libel is, that the Messenger and his assisters did transgress their power and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, and so it was lawful to resist them: and thus upon the 18. of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1667. Mr. <hi>Archibald Borthwick</hi> being pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for deforcement, it was alledged, that he compeared as Procurator for the Lord <hi>Borthwick,</hi> who had arrested <hi>Sandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> and the Tennents Corns, as Master of the Ground, and so alledg'd the Messenger could not poynd the Corns till the Master was payed, wherein the Messenger did unjustly, and so he had good reason to stop the poynding: This alledgiance was found relevant, but if justly, it may be doubted. And Lawyers are very positive, that no man can stop any executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon such pretence of unjustice, where the unjustice can be no otherwise redressed, by appellation, or otherwise: which they call <hi>resistentia licita per subsidium, Menoch. de recup. pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess. remed.</hi> 8. <hi>num.</hi> 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 31. <hi>Cabal. resol. crim. cas.</hi> 132. And their opinion seems most just; for it were dangerous, to make private persons, and such also as are interessed, Judges to the justice of what is done against themselves. 2. <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam recurrendum est ad remedium extraordinarium, quamdiu locus est ordinario</hi>; but so it is, that if a Messenger do any wrong in the execution of his Office, he is lyable therefore, <hi>ad damnum &amp; interesse,</hi> and finds caution for that effect to the Lyon at his entry. 3. Messengers are Judges in poyndings, and it is not lawful to resist Judges upon pretence that they judge unjustly: And this suggests to me another distinction, which is, that either a Messenger or Executer doth wrong the party interessed, <hi>via juris,</hi> as in omitting formalities, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling just allegiances, <hi>&amp; eo casu</hi> he cannot be resisted: or
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55274:139"/>
else he does wrong, <hi>via facti,</hi> by beating the party he cites, or giving him opprobrious speeches, by apprehending him without a Caption, or after a Suspension is produced by him, or otherwise giving rise to the violence used against him, <hi>&amp; eo casu</hi> he may be resisted, as was found, <hi>Mart.</hi> 166<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And is clear from the Doctors, <hi>Cabal. ibid.</hi> It hath been alledged that there could be no deforcement at the Messengers instance against the Pannel, for stopping him to poynd goods, because the Messenger was the person at whose instance the Letters of Poynding was raised, and therefore he could not execute them himself, seing no man can be Judge in his own cause, and the Messenger is Judge in all Poyndings; but this was repelled, because the Letters of Poynding are alwayes blank in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons name to whom they are direct, and so the Messenger might fill up his own name, and no Messenger was excluded, and if the Executer did any wrong, he was lyable to a spoilzie, and his sentence was reduceable; but this wants not its own scruple, seing Messengers are Judges when they poynd, and no man can judge in his own cause. 2. It was here alledged, that the Letters upon which Execution were used, were suspended, and so could not be put to execution, which alledgiance was repelled, because the Suspension was not intimate, and so the Messenger nor Party was not thereby put in <hi>mala fide, Mart.</hi> 1662.</p>
               <p>Though this be the punishment of deforce, when it is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such, and is not aggraged with other hainous circumstances, yet if a Messenger were executing Letters of Caption against a Traitor for Treason, any who would deforce him would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Treason, and that were to be art and part of Treason: and so in other Crimes; but whether deforcement may be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Law, as breaking of Prison, I doubt very much, though it be a rule amongst the Doctors, that <hi>eximens aliquem ex manu familiae, &amp; ex carcere à pari procedunt, &amp; carceratus
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55274:139"/>

               <p n="5">V. Deforcement then is proven as other crimes, by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and who ever may be witnesses for proving other crimes, are admitted here, but it hath been oft doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the witnesses who were carryed along with the Messenger for verifying his executions, may be sustained as witnesses to prove the Deforcement: and the reason of the doubt was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ordinarily they are injured themselves in such cases, yet at last it was decided in <hi>March,</hi> 1662. that they were very receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able witnesses, because without these, deforcements could not be proved: And since the execution could be proved by them, why not deforcement. But it is a necessary caution in that case, that no injury be pursued as done to the witnesses, for if that be once libelled, they become parties, and will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be received as witnesses, though they should offer to pass from the injuries, as done to themselves. And these witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are so receivable, that in the case betwixt <hi>Murray</hi> &amp; <hi>French,</hi> 13 <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1669. It was found that though they were within the degrees defendant to the pursuer, yet they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, because in effect they were <hi>testes instrumentarii,</hi> beeing witnesses contained in the execution of the deforcement; but I think, this is debateable, because <hi>testes instrumentarii</hi> are only allowed in obligations, though within degrees, <hi>quo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su,</hi> they are to be presumed to be chosen with mutual consent, which cannot be alledged here, seing the Messenger only choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses such witnesses as he pleases.</p>
               <p>Whether the execution of deforcement, will prove that the Messenger was deforced, without leading any other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, may it be doubted; and that it should, appears from these grounds, 1. That it is a principle in Law, that <hi>creditur nunciis, in his quae spectant ad ipsorum officium.</hi> 2. <hi>In civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus,</hi> The execution of a Messenger is alwayes believed till it

Lawyers are very clear, that <hi>creditur nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, si referat se fuisse percussum vel verberatum in ipsa executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,</hi> which <hi>Guido papae decis.</hi> 628. declares to be the custom of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Dauphmie:</hi> And this is enacted by a statute of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> 13. <hi>Iune,</hi> 1559. Yet by our Law the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cution of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, will not prove that the Messenger was deforced, and <hi>Caballus</hi> declares this likewise of most other nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these abovecited, <hi>Casu</hi> 127. According to our Law, the Messengers who were deforced, cannot be led even as single witnesses, though the pursuite be not at their own instance, but at the instance of the party injured, or his <hi>Majesties</hi> Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat; In which case it seems that all their interest ceases; but the reason of this is, because it is presumable that the parties who were wronged will still retain a resentment against the injurers, and so wil stil be prejudicat witnesses in that case. But yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doctors, this is doubted, and many of them conclude, that <hi>creditur nuncio se verberatum fuisse, nam creditur ei secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum omnes in iis quae pertinent ad suum officium &amp; hoc est con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexum relationi executionis sibi demandata.</hi> Menoch. <hi>de Arb. cas.</hi> 112. <hi>alii vero credunt casum hunc esse arbitrarium.</hi> And according to our Law, such as were witnesses, chosen by the Messenger to go alongst with him in useing the execution, will still be received witnesses, though they were themselves beat in the deforcement, and so are lyable to the former suspition equally with the Messenger: and the only reason of difference that can be assigned, is, that the Messenger is himself said in our Law to be deforced, and so is the person formally interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but witnesses are not in our Law said to be deforced, and though they be received ordinarily, yet it is given as a caution that they shall not depon upon any wrong done to themselves, for if they do, it will make them though otherwayes habit, to be rejected from being witnesses, and the Law will <hi>eo casu</hi> look upon them as persons that remember too much the injury <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:55274:140"/>
though the witnesses taken along by the Messenger to the execution, cannot be rejected upon that accompt, after they have purged themselves of partial counsel and malice, if they may not be rejected, if before they be sworn they confesse they continue to have a resentment of the injury done them. And in my opinion, if this beating and injury suffered by them, be confest by themselves, before they be purged of partial counsel, they should be rejected, though the parties interested, and at whose instance the Letters were execute, cannot be received witnesses to prove a deforcement, even though they should declare that they would never pursue the deforcement, <hi>ad proprium interesse &amp; vindictam</hi>: yet such as were within degrees defendant to the party, were received witnesses, even where the pursuit was pursued by their own friend, 13. <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1669. <hi>Murray</hi> against <hi>French.</hi> Upon a new pretext, that brothers and servants, &amp;c. are habil witnesses, where they are <hi>testes instrumentarii,</hi> and witnesses in executions are <hi>testes instrumentarii:</hi> but in my opinion there is a great difference betwixt these two, for the reason why <hi>testes instrumentarii,</hi> are received, though they be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>in habiles,</hi> is because they are chosen of common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of both parties who are present at the subscription; but that cannot be alledged in such as are witnesses in executions, who are only chosen by the Messenger himself.</p>
               <p>After this crime is proven, the ordinary verdict is, The Assize finds the Pannel guilty of Deforcing such a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger. But yet where the Assize find only the Pannel guilty of troubling the Messenger in his office, and would not find him guilty of deforceing: The justices finds these termes to be equivalent, and punished the Pannel as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcer, in the case of <hi>Robert Herris, Iuly,</hi> 1667.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The party deforced, has beside this Criminal action, a Civil action for deforcement, against such as have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory

to the deforcement, for payment of the debt: which debt is ordained by the 117. <hi>Act,</hi> 7. <hi>Parl. Ia.</hi> 6. to be pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, together with the modification of his expences out of the first and readiest of the deforcers escheat: And it is declared, that he shall be preferred to the King. From which Act these two doubts may arise, 1. Since by the Act it is declared that the persons convict of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, shall be lyable for payment of the debt, by this Civil Action, that therefore this Civil Action is not competent, until the Parties pursued be first found guilty of deforcement: But yet it was found, the 25. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1663. in the case of <hi>David Mitchel,</hi> that the party injured might pursue, either Civilly, or Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally; and that this priviledge was introduced by that Act, as a further advantage to the party deforced; but because this Action was founded upon a Criminal ground, therefore they ordained the deforcement to be proved by most unsuspect Witnesses. The second doubt is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by this Act, the deforcers other Estate be lyable to this Action, as well as his Moveables? And though it may be urged, that that Act appoints only the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor to be preferred to the King, and to be payed out of the first end of the deforcers Moveables. Yet it was found, the 13. of <hi>December,</hi> 1672. in this case, <hi>Murray</hi> against <hi>French,</hi> that this Act did allow Action for payment, <hi>simpliciter.</hi> For the Lords thought, that the Act did in the first place ordain payment of the debt, and expence; that the preferrence was a new superadded priviledge: And it were against all reason, that the Creditor should be frustrat of his Action, because the Deforcer had no moveables, though he had an opulent he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Estate.</p>
               <p>In this case it was likewise found, that the Party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:55274:141"/>
might pursue, either <hi>ad vindictam publicam,</hi> Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally, or might pursue Civilly this Action for dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and interest; and that the one Action did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume or exhaust the other: And therefore though the Pursuer here had prevailed in a Criminal pursuit against this Defender, <hi>quo ad vindictam publicam,</hi> that yet he might pursue this Civil Action for dammage.</p>

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55274:142"/>
practice, I shall divide Falshood in these four Branches, 1. That Falshood, which is committed in writ. 2. That which is committed by witnesses. 3. The forging and falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Money. 4. The using of false weights, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
               <p n="1">I. As to the first Branch, he commits Falshood, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expresseth in writ, that which was not done, or omits to expresse that which was done. So that Falshood in writ may be committed, either in commission, or omission. Falshood is committed by commission, either by fabricating a false writ, or by signing it, or causing another sign it, <hi>qui in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentum falsum dolo malo scripserit, signaverit, vel signare cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raverit, recitaverit, mutaverit, subjecerit, amoveritcelaverit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leverit, interleverit, resignaverit,</hi> all which <hi>species</hi> of Falshood, are enumerat by <hi>Ulpian. leg.</hi> 2. <hi>ad leg.

               <p n="2">II. Falshood in writ, is committed by producing a false writ, if they know it to be false, which some Doctors think punishable only, if the writ produced by them was suspect; and it is said to be suspect, if either it appear vitiat by occular inspection, or if the writer or producer used to produce false writs, or if it contain things that are improbable.</p>
               <p>The user of false writs is said to commit Falshood, <hi>l. majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem Cod. de fals.</hi> which only holds, if he knew the writs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by them to be false; and therefore <hi>Clarus</hi> relates a caution used by the practitioners, which is, that the user of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55274:143"/>
the writ gets a dyet affixed to him, to deliver at, if he will abide thereby, and at the day affixt, he must either simply abide thereat, without any qualification, <hi>quo casu,</hi> if it be improven the user is punished as a forger. Albeit the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors commonly are of opinion, that even in that case, the user is to be more meekly punished then the fabricator, <hi>Paena foilicet relegationis,</hi> which caution is likewise in use with us, but in this we differ, that by our practique, the user will be allowed to abide by the writ, though not simply as a writ true, yet as a writ really made over to him; and in the forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, he had no interest, as in the Earl <hi>Levins</hi> case, 1665. but though this qualified abiding at the writ, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in an Heir, or singular Successor, yet that it is only allowed where there is some person extant, who abides sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply at the writ, as true as <hi>Kennedy</hi> did in this case, for else the user, though a singular successor, must abide at the writ, as a true writ simply; without which, any false writ might be vented securely.</p>

               <p n="3">III. Falshood in writs is committed by omission in not set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down what the Nottar was desired to set down in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, or omitting to express the day and place when the omitting thereof might have been disadvantagious. In our Law he of old who falsifyed the King, or his Superiors Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, committed Treason; but he who falsified only the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a private man, was only to be punished by loss or muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a member, <hi>Reg.

Q. M.</hi> It is extended to all evidents, but it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that it is not extended to all persons, but only to Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, both by the rubrick and body of the Act; from which it may be inferred, that <hi>in criminalibus non est argumentandum à pari ultra casum à lege definilum.</hi> And that criminal Laws are to be most strictly interpret, for else the former Law against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, might well enough have been extended against other false writs, which are oftimes of greater consequence, then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments are. 2. The reason why Nottars are more severely punished then others, was, because they were more trusted then others, for of old they were Church-men, and hence springs that custom, that they yet design themselves, <hi>Ego, A.

The punishment is declared to be prescription (which is an error of the Printer, put for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription) banishment, and dismembering of Hand or Tongue; but because it is received amongst the Doctors, that a Statute punishing Falshood in a Nottar, cannot be extended to any other person who is a forger, <hi>fulgos consil.</hi> 123. therefore by the <hi>Act</hi> 22. <hi>Parl.</hi> 23. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. It is statuted, that whosoever maketh or useth a false writ, or is accessory to the making thereof, shall be punished as a committer of Falshood.</p>
               <p>And that these and all forgers of writs may be punisht, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they declare in Judgement, that they passe from, or will not use the writ quarrelled. From which it may be inferred, that seing the forger is only not allowed by this Act to passe from the writ, after it is used and produced in Judgement, that before it be used in Judgement, it may be past from, and as the using in Judgement is a further prejudice, and degree of impudence, then a simple forgery which may be repented of; So in all tryals of Falshood, and particularly in <hi>Barclay</hi>'s case, the Lords took great pains to enquire, if the writs quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled were produced in Judgement, or made use of before any Court, which had been unnecessar, if simple forging had been sufficient, to infer Falshood: but although this may be alledged, for mitigating the punishment, yet <hi>Dempster</hi> was condemned for counterfeiting a subscription, in a reversion, though he never used the same, to the hurt of any person whatsoever, nor would abide thereby; and a sentence was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this <hi>Act,</hi> 20. <hi>April.</hi> 1620.</p>

               <p>Though <hi>England</hi> and some other Nations, punish Theft with death, and Falshood only by the pillary, and confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moveables: Yet our own Law seems much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, which punisheth Falshood with death. Since Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is a theft, and a degree of that crime, which deserves a much severer punishment, then ordinary Theft, because I can secure my goods against a Thief; but no man can against a Forger. And a thief can but at most steal our Moveables. whereas a forger can by a false writ, take away the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Lands, and things of the greatest consequence.</p>

                  </gap>, or capital; the reason whereof seems to be, because capital punishment included necessarly publication, or escheat of goods, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>ff. de Bon. Dam.</hi> and albeit the former pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment exprest, <hi>l.</hi> 1. holds generally in Falshood; yet there are some kinds of Falshood otherwise punished, because in effect, they fall in to be branches of other Crimes. Thus the assuming of false Arms, <hi>aut qui militiam confinxit concuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endi causa</hi> is capital, in <hi>Matheus</hi> judgment, <hi>per l.</hi> 27. <hi>h. t.</hi> because it is a kind of <hi>Laese-majestie.</hi> But I find by the Law it self, that the pain of death is not exprest in that case, <hi>sed pro admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si qualitate gravissime puniendus est.</hi> And by the Basilicks, there is no punishment exprest, to that special kind of Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and so it is left only punishable, <hi>tanquam falsum.</hi> And though <hi>Matheus</hi> doth infer this to be capitally punished, from <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>l. jul.

               <p n="4">IV. Because the Crime of Falshood, doth oftimes arise upon Papers produced before the Lords of Session, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the tryal thereof, requires an exact, and long, and a much more tedious search, then the forms of the Justice Court can allow (whose dyet is peremptor) therefore by the Acts foresaid, it is declared, that the Lords of Session are Judges competent, to the tryal of Falshood. And albeit that Act doth not expresse their jurisdiction to be exclusive of the Justices, yet I remember, that in an accumulat accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Theft and Falshood, pursued by the Lord <hi>Blantire,</hi> against <hi>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>culloch,</hi> his servant, it was found by the justices, that they would not proceed to judge the Falshood, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the same to be tryed before the Lords, in an improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and I believe, that the tryal of Falshood, <hi>in prima in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia,</hi> doth only belong to the Lords, as that of divorce doth to the Commissaries, for else most of all Falshoods would be only pursued before the Justices, seing the tryal there is much shorter, and lesse expensive, than before the Lords; whereas I find not any action of Falshood, <hi>in prima instantia,</hi> recorded in all the Books of Adjournal.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Lords do sometimes proceed to the tryal of Falshood, <hi>summarie per modum simplicis quaerelae,</hi> upon a Bill, without any formal Summonds; and thus they found <hi>Binnie,</hi> a falsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for counterfeiting the Signet, <hi>Iun</hi> 1666. But this they do only in two cases, 1. When the Falshood is committed, by a Member of the Colledge of Justice. 2. When the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net or any part of a Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>esse is <hi>ex recenti,</hi> falsified.</p>
               <p>The way of procedor in this Crime before the Lords, is this; a Summonds of Improbation is raised, and continued, and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55274:145"/>
three terms of old, but now two only are by the regulations given to the defender, to produce the writ called for, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. If the Papers called for be not produced, certificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is granted against them, whereby they are declared such as can never be made use of, as true Papers, in any time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but upon this presumptive Improbation, whereby the Writs are only <hi>perfictionem juris,</hi> declared null, the party who is called to produce them, is not repute a forger, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished as such, for <hi>non constat eo casu de corpore de licti,</hi> or that ever there were any such Paper, as is called for: nor was there ever certification granted, or any further inquiry made, into the Falshood it self, till <hi>November</hi> 1669. at which time, certification having been granted against some Papers, made by the Tutor of <hi>Towie,</hi> to Captain <hi>Barclay,</hi> the Lords found they might proceed a little further, by examining the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, albeit it was alledged, that this had never been done. 2. That <hi>non constabat de corpore de licti.</hi> 3. That by the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, <hi>res erat judicata,</hi> and so the Lords, <hi>functierant officio.</hi> 4. That the Writs being improved, were no longer dangerous, <hi>non erat amplius nociva &amp; nullus potest puniri de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falso ubi falsum non erat nocivum</hi>; and albeit, it was alledged that it would be very prejudicial to the Common-wealth, if a person who falsified Writs, might destroy them, when he found they could not be advantagious, and so escape; it was answered, that there was no hazard in this, because, if the forger used them not, the Common-wealth, nor no Person could be prejudged; but if he did, the party injured might force him to leave it in the Clerks hands, and intent and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
               <p>By the 62. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. <hi>Parl. Q. M.</hi> the Judge is allow'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act caution from such as propon Improbation, and though some doubt whether this caution may be exacted, as well when Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, is proponed by way of exception, as when it, is pursued by way of action: yet since the danger is the same it
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55274:146"/>
both, and that by the Act, this is declared to extend as well, at the raising of the Summonds, as at the proponing of the objection, and that <hi>lex non distinguit,</hi> I see no reason for this doubt: and this, it was decided the 25. of <hi>Iun,</hi> 1675. The Sums for which caution is to be found in this case, is left to the arbitrement of the Judge, and though this Statute appoints only caution to be found, yet the Lords doth ordain the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney oftimes to be consigned.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. There are two ways of improving a Writ, <hi>viz.</hi> the direct and indirect manner, the direct manner of improbation, is by the Writer and Witnesses insert, the indirect manner is by Witnesses not insert but by presumptions and other extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick arguments. But it is a rule in our Law, that whilst the direct manner of improbation is extant, that is to say, whilst Writer and Witnesses insert are alive, no tryal can be taken by the indirect manner.</p>
               <p>As to the direct manner, we have this general Maxime, <hi>viz.</hi> that such Witnesses as are dead, are proving Witnesses, But this holds only presumptive, for if of five Witnesses insert, two should improve, the other three being dead, the writ will be declared false; whereas, if these three were alive, and did formally approve, the writ would subsist, though improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by two.</p>
               <p>To prevent Falshood in all manner of Evidents, our Law in place of Seals (which were used of old, and which might have been easily counterfeited) did by the 117. <hi>Act</hi> 7. <hi>Parl. I.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. require that all Evidents should be subscribed by the Party, and Witnesses, and by the 80. <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 6. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. all writs of Importance, are ordained to be subscribed by the principal Parties, if they can subscribe, or by two famous Notars, before four famous Witnesses, denominat by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> special dwellings, or by some evident token, by which the Witnesses may be known, and though usually men take writs of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reatest importance, subscribed before any Witnesses,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:55274:146"/>
yet there is nothing more imprudent for if I take a Gentlemans two Servants, or a Fathers two Sons (when the master or father are disponers) witnesses to their Disposition, or Bond of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test importance, and one of these should deny his subscription, the writ would be null, as was found in Commissar <hi>Fleemings</hi> case; and if both denyed their subscriptions, the writ ought in strict Law to be declared false; but yet if there were pregnant circumstances, and adminicles to astruct the truth of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions I conceive the writ could not be improven, even though these interested witnesses should deny their subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. From the foresaid Acts of Parliament it is clear, that the witnesses should be specially designed, to the end they may be known and examined; and therefore the Lords 21. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1672. <hi>Littlegil contra Somervel</hi>; found it not sufficient that a witness in a bond craved to be improven, was designed indweller in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but ordained even the assigney to condescend more particularly though the assignay contended that he being a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular successor, who had got a right to the bond, he could not know who were the witnesses made use of, nor was he oblied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to consider any more when he got his assignation, but that the bond had witnesses, without requiring who these were; and so though the cedent who had gotten the bond might be oblieged to condescend, yet he could not; and yet improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being pursued against a bond granted by Sir <hi>Lewis Stewart</hi> to his son <hi>Kettlestone,</hi> in which bond one of the witnesses was designed <hi>Iohn Carnagy</hi> servitor to the Earle of <hi>Southesk,</hi> though there were many moe <hi>Iohn Carnagies</hi> who then served the Earle. The Lords found that <hi>Kettlestone</hi> was not oblied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to designe more particularly which of the <hi>Iohn Carnagies</hi> wrot the bond, and that it was relevant for the improver to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to prove that at the date of that bond the Earle of <hi>Southesk</hi> had no servant who could write such a bond, 7. <hi>February,</hi> 1672.</p>
               <p>Another great errour committed by such as take men to be
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55274:147"/>
witnesses to the Writs and Evidents delivered to them, is, that they imploy witnesses who has not seen the party sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, nor has not so much as inquired at him whether that was his subscription, whereas if that paper were challenged as false or null, it would be declared null, if not false, though the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse should depone that he was in the next room, and it was brought to him immediatly whilst the ink was not yet dry, and that he knew his masters subscription, if he could not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively depone, that either he saw his master subscribe, or that his master had declared to him that that was his subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this remembers me of this pretty case wherein I my self was consulted: A Gentlewoman being to subscribe her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of marriage desired that because she was ashamed to writ before so many friends, she might have the Paper delivered to her to be subscribed in another room, and the same having been sent with her to the other room, she caused her sister-in-Law who went alongst with her, subscribe the same, for her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that she could not write well, and returning thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, she told the witnesses that that was her subscription; which Contract being thereafter quarrelled upon the nullity of not being truly subscribed before witnesses, the Lords sustained the Contract, the matter of fact above specified, being offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be proved, though it was alledged that this was in effect to make up an obligation of great importance by witnesses.</p>
               <p>In the indirect manner, the Lords use to consider the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions adduced for the improver in his indirect Articles of approbation, and for the party accused, in his articles of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, amongst which indirect articles, the chief are, <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi,</hi> a false date, and <hi>comparatio Literarum.</hi> If the party who has been said to have subscribed the writ, be proved to be else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; as for instance, to have been at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> whereas the writ is alledged to have been subscribed that same day by him in <hi>Cathnes</hi> this is a very concluding presumption of Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, since a man could not by the swiftest journey be at both
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:55274:147"/>
these places in one day, and therefore this is a most concluding presumption to annul the Bond, but I think it is no convincing argument which can inferr that the Bond is false, since people by errour or mistake, may, and do oftentimes insert a wrong date, neglecting the date, as a matter of no importance; and therefore the Lords did very justly assoilzie from an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of a writ, which was proved to be false in the date, since the witnesses insert were alive, and did depone upon the verity of the subscription, 23. <hi>May,</hi> 1667. Lord <hi>May, contra Rosse,</hi> and upon the 10. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1669. <hi>Gardner contra Colvil,</hi> a writ was not improven, though it was proved not to have been subscribed of the date that was insert, In respect there was a writ of that same tenour, truly subscribed that day, which being a-missing, the granter a long time thereafter subscribed another of the same tenour and date, and the first being thereafter found, and both produced, the user abode by the first simply, and by the last as to the verity of the subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not of the date, which was so insert for the reason foresaid; so that though the date be amongst the substantial so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities requisite to a writ, as is clear by the foresaid Acts of Parliament, and by the 13. <hi>Act,</hi> 9. <hi>Parliament, Iam.</hi> 1. so that the improver may force the user of a writ, to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend upon a particular date, if the date be blank, and that the falsenesse of the date will inferr the writ to be false, except this presumption can be taken off by a strong contrary probation, yet that it may be so taken of, is clear from the cases foresaid, and in this sense <hi>Craig</hi> is to be understood, who sayes, <hi>pag.</hi> 156. <hi>Si falsa data apposita sit, totum instrumentum vitiatur, nam quod in ea data quae exprimitur non est verum, etiamsi aliam datam substituere velit, is, qui eo utitur, non est audiendus, &amp; quod in data falsa non fuit factum, nunquam factum praesumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the writ craved to be improven be unlike in its subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the other subscriptions used by the subscriber at the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:55274:148"/>
time when the Paper quarelled is said to be subscribed, then it is most suspect, and if both the subscriptions of the witnesses and granter, be found to be one hand writ, but all of them are unlike the true subscriptions, then the writ will be improven by occular inspection: as was found in the Earle of <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ymes</hi> case, <hi>contra Gall, Iuly</hi> 1675. But yet it were hard to infer the corporal punishment of falshood from this probation, which is but at best presumptive, for the granter of a Bond or other writ, might upon designe subscribe to strangers his name, far otherwayes then he uses to do, meerly that he or his Heirs, may thereafter quarrel the same, and therefore <hi>Cravet. Consil.</hi> 386. concludes, that <hi>comparatio sola non relevat in criminalibus,</hi> and all Lawyers conclude, that <hi>recognitio scripturae privatae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert plenam probationem si jungatur cum uno teste vel alia somi plena probatione, Alex. Consil</hi> 239.</p>
               <p>In the indirect manner, the Lords uses to receive witnesses <hi>ad futuram rei memoriam,</hi> and to receive witnesses sometimes by commission, as in Captain <hi>Barclayes</hi> case. Albeit it was there alledged, that witnesses in the indirect manner of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, are only received <hi>ex nobili officio,</hi> which could not be committed or delegat, and which seems stranger, the Lords uses to take the oath of the defender himself, albeit regularly in crimes the defender is not obliedged to swear.</p>
               <p>Before any debate upon the indirect manner, the Lords use to ordain the pursuer to give in his articles of improbation, and to ordain the defender to give in his articles of approbation. And albeit there be not <hi>publicatio testimoniorum</hi> in our Law in Civil Cases, yet because improbations have a criminal effect, and tend to take away the life of the defender, therefore the Lords use in this case to ordain the depositions of the witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to be seen by both parties, and both parties being fully heard to debate <hi>in praesentia,</hi> the Lords do either improve or Assoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie.</p>
               <p>If the Lords improve, they have by the foresaid acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55274:148"/>
power to impose an arbitrary punishment suitable to the crime. And therefore they do sometimes ordain the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, to be taken to the Crosse with a paper Hat, if the cheat was but small, or the person in great necessity. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they only ordain the forger to be imprisoned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke him without discovering the falshood, as they did lately to a Gentleman, who being otherwayes very discreet, was by his poverty driven to counterfit the subscription of his friend, to a bond of Suspension. Sometimes likewise they refer the forgers to the Council, who upon that reference, use either to condemn the forger to perpetual imprisonment, as they did Captain <hi>Barclay,</hi> or else they use to send them to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat Crosse with a paper hat, as they did <hi>Tulloch</hi> a Nottar for forging a charter, 4. <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1638. but this mitigation is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowed, when the forger hath been induced to commit that crime by the perswasion of others, or by his own simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hath ingeniously confest.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The ordinary way of procedor taken by the Lords, when they have improven the papers, and found them to be false, is to remit the forger to the Justices, against whom an indictment being drawn up, and the Assize sworn, the Lords Decreet is read, without repeating any further probation, and the Assize must condemn thereupon, else they will be pursued for errour. And therfore the verdict <hi>eo casu</hi> bears, finds the Pannel guilty in respect of the Decreet of the Lords of Session. Upon this verdict the Justices are tyed expresly to condemn the defender to be hanged, as <hi>Halyday</hi> for counterfeiting a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, 8. <hi>February,</hi> 1597. <hi>Iames Tarbet</hi> for being art and part of counterfeiting a false Charter, 16. <hi>February,</hi> 1600. And if the falshood be atrocious, they sometimes before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution ordain the right hand to be cut off.</p>
               <p>If the Lords remit not the case to the Justices, when they find the Papers to be false, they ordain the Papers impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be cancelled in their own presence, but if they remit
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:55274:149"/>
the forgers to the Justices then the Papers are carried to the Justice court, and when the sentence is pronounced there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pannel, the papers are likewise cancelled at the command of the Justices.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The second species of Falshood, is that which is committed by witnesses in their depositions, which may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By deponing things expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, but in this case the contradiction must be palpable, and not consequential, <hi>nam omnis interpretatio praeferendo est ut dicta testium reconcilientur.</hi> Witnesses either are such as were sworn, and if they swear falsly, <hi>eo casu,</hi> they are guilty of perjury (<hi>vid. tit.</hi> perjury) or else they are such as are false witnesses, without an oath, as witnesses in papers, and these are punishable, <hi>tanquam falsarii, Bart. ad l. si quis ff. ad l. Corn. Clar. hoc tit. num.</hi> 11. and of these I design to treat only at least principally in this Title.</p>
               <p>He who depones falsly in one point, is repute false in all his deposition, whether the points be coherent or not; But he who depones falsly only in extrinsick circumstances, is not to be equally punish'd, as if he had depon'd falsly upon the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials of what is interrogat; and yet in both cases he is <hi>falsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi> And thus the Lords ordained one of <hi>Barclays</hi> Servants to be sent to the Cross with a Paper Hat, because he prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat only in his deposition about the carrying of a Letter, though that was extrinsick to the debate, and was mainly used to try the Witnesses honesty. Oblivion or forgetfulness excuseth sometimes, <hi>à paena ordinaria falsi,</hi> if it be invincibly or strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded, but not otherwise.</p>
               <p>Witnesses deponing falsly, and such as induced Witnesses, were by our Law punished according to the disposition of the

M. Parl.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 48. By the Lords in this Act, are meant the Lords of Session, who may punish Witnesses <hi>ex incontinenti,</hi> during the dependence of the Process before themselves, wherein the Witnesses depone falsly; but if either the fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was committed by deponing in another Court, or if the Lords be <hi>functi officio,</hi> as to the Process wherein the falshood was committed, <hi>eo casu</hi> the Lords cannot judge the falshood, or punish the false Witnesses. Sometimes the Lords ordain the Witnesses to be remitted to the Council; thus the Lords ordain'd the Witnesses, who had confest that they subscribed Witnesses to a Disposition granted by the Tutor of <hi>Towie</hi> to his Nephew, to be remitted to the Council, who ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sh'd them: And sometimes they themselves ordain them to be banish'd, or to have their tongues pierc'd, or to be set upon the Cock-stool, with a Paper Hat; yet they cannot ordain them to die, because the arbitrary power granted by this Act, cannot in Law be extended <hi>ad infligendam paenam mortis,</hi> as is fully cleared else-where; and therefore the Lords use to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the falsarie to the Justices, if the Crime deserve death. But it may be questioned, if the Justices can inflict the pain of death in any case upon false Witnesses, since that Crime is not declared capital by any Act? But to this the answer is, that they may, and do infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And by the foresaid Act <hi>Ia.</hi> 5. it is declared punishable, according to the disposition of the Common Law, by which is meant the Civil Law, <hi>&amp; de practica,</hi> Wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At which time also <hi>Dunlop</hi> and some others were hang'd for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering themselves to be false Witnesses, albeit they did not actually depon, because they were not received, the offer having before their examination come to light.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The third kind of falshood is committed by falsifying money, <hi>falsum nummartum,</hi> which is accounted so great a Crime, that it is commonly excepted out of Remissions, as may be seen in <hi>Crightouns</hi> Remission, <hi>March</hi> 15. 1661. This Crime is committed, 1. By forging true money without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. 2.

               <p>THe heart of man is deceitful above all things, and such as have been conversant in businesse and Courts of Justice, have found that cheats do amongst men multiply, and vary themselves into so many formes, that Legislators were forced to invent this general name of Stellionat; under which they might range all cheats, and thence sprung that maxime, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>ff. hoc. tit. ubicunque titulus criminis deficit illic stellionatum ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jiciemus:</hi> Which must be interpret and restricted in its genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by the preceeding words, <hi>Stellionatum objici posse his qui dolo quid fecerunt</hi>; So that to infer this crime, it is requisite that there be a cheat or fraud used, and that the cheat want an other name, for there are frauds which cannot be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under this Title, as falsifying W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

upon it. <hi>Bartol. ibid.</hi> And so far is <hi>receiving</hi> Criminal, that the receiving payment of a debt formerly payed, is Stellionar, though simple craving without receiving will not infer it; but it is most observeable, that fraud is still requisite to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of this crime, and its essence.</p>
               <p n="2">II. By our Law we have no expresse statute against Stellio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, except only act 140. <hi>P.</hi> 20. <hi>I.</hi> 6. Which bears, that no duty shall be disponed to two sundry persons which is <hi>crimen Stellionatus</hi> of the Law; from which Act it is to be observed, that our Law presupposes the Civil Law to be our Law, as to that crime; For it does not determine what is to be accompted Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionat, or appoint a particular punishment for Stellionat, but only clears declaratorly, that the disponing duties or rents of Lands to several persons, shall be accompted <hi>Stellionatus</hi>; And therefore what ever was punished as Stellionat by the Civil Law, may be punished as such by ours; not only <hi>à pari,</hi> or by extension, but by approbation; the <hi>Roman</hi> Law having by the allowance of that Act become ours; and therefore the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of double assignations or dispositions of Lands, or of any thing else besides Rents mentioned expresly in that Act, is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished as Stellionat in our practique, which is warranted like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by the 105. <hi>Act, P.</hi> 7. <hi>I.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>By which Act, though Stellionat be not mentioned, yet it is thereby punished, for it is there declared, that whosoever makes double Dispositions of Lands, he shall be called at the Kings instance, and punisht at the Kings will. But it may be doubted, why double alienations should be punished as Stellio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, seing <hi>qui rem unam duobus vendit falsi est reus, l. qui duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, ff. ad l. Corn. de falso</hi>; In answer to which, I conceive, we must distinguish betwixt these who whilst they are selling, being desired to clear, if the thing offered to be sold, hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly sold, or not: say that it was not, In which case he is guilty of a manifest lye, and so of Falshood; But if he only sell one thing twice, without denying that it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:55274:153"/>
sold, or was not his own, then he is only guilty of Stellio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, seing though there be a cheat in this case, yet there is no lye: An instance whereof fell out into my own experience, for there being two Writers to the Signet of one name, and money being directed to one of the two, the bearer delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to the other, as due by his Master to him, which case was thought by those who consulted it, to be Stellionat, seing though the receiver had not said to the bearer that his Master was his debitor, yet he should not have received the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for he was obliedged to know that the same was not due to him; And yet according to <hi>Farinacius</hi> opinion (who thinks that <hi>dolus in committendo tantum insert stellionatum, sed non do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus in ommittendo</hi>) It might be debated that this case was not Stellionat, seing the receiver of the money was only guilty of omission, in not clearing the bearers mistake: But I differ in this from <hi>Farinacius,</hi> For seing <hi>Dolus in ommittendo,</hi> may be a great cheat in it self, and that the party wronged is as much lesed thereby, I know no reason why the one may not infer stellio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat as well as the other: And albeit <hi>dolus in ommittendo,</hi> were not Stellionat, yet this case was, seing the recept of money sent to another is more then omission.</p>
               <p>By that Act <hi>Iames</hi> 5. It is likewise declared, that Superiors receiving double Resignations, shall be punished as these who grant double Dispositions: And certainly that part of the Act was most just, seing if the Superior was conscious to the design of making these double Resignations, he cannot but be art and part of the cheat of making the double Dispositions, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Resignation flowed; and so should be equally punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and in effect, a Superior granting new Infestments, upon divers resignations, to divers persons, does grant double Rights: for to grant a new Right upon the old Vassals Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is to dispon. And seing the buyer is prejudged more by these Resignations, then by these Dispositions, upon which they slowed, (that being a more compleat act then the other)
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:55274:153"/>
it were unreasonable that the Superior should not be punished as well as the Seller; and yet because it is not presumed, that any would cheat where there is no gain, and that the Superior in receiving resignations, <hi>in favorem,</hi> gains little, therefore this part of the Act is now <hi>in desuctude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find likewise, that other species of Stellionat are punished by our Law, as in <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. <hi>Iames Clerk</hi> was pursued, because a Sword being sent by <hi>Cuthbertson</hi> to <hi>Moubray</hi> a Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slipper, <hi>Clerk</hi> did say to the bearer that he was <hi>Moubray,</hi> and so took the Sword, which Libel the Justices would not sustain, to infer falshood, but <hi>tanquam crimen in suo genere</hi>; and yet, <hi>L.</hi> 13. <hi>ff. ad L. Cor. de falso assumptio falsi cognominis est cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men falsi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The punishment then of this crime could not be certain and determinat, seing the crime is various in its own nature, but it is arbitrary and punishable at the discretion of the Judge, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the circumstances and measures of the fraud committed. And it is called Stellionat, from a Serpent called <hi>Stellio,</hi> which is beautified by Starry spots, <hi>stellatis guttis distinctum,</hi> and is the most subtile of all Serpents, <hi>plin. lib.</hi> 30. <hi>nat. histor. cap.</hi> 10.</p>

               </list>
               <p>Since Witnesses can by their depositions, take away the Lives, or ruine the Estates, of such as are the greatest men, or have the greatest Fortunes; the Law which repos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that trust in them, doth very justly over-awe them, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning by the reverend fear of an Oath, and by threatning them with the severe punishment of Perjury, if they swear falsly.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Perjury is defined by Lawyers, to be a lie, affirmed ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially upon Oath; but because it is not presumeable, that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:55274:154"/>
any person would both be so mean as to lie, and so wicked as to call God to be a Witness thereto: Therefore Lawyers have very justly delivered us a Brocard, that Perjury is not committed without fraud, <hi>interpretatio facienda est ut evitetur perjurium</hi>; and from this Principle they have deduced, that 1. he who swears that which is false, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be true, is not to be punished as a Perjurer; for in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect he doth not then lie, add <hi>ad Clar. num.</hi> 13.2. If the Perjury could have prejudged no man, <hi>Clar. num.</hi> 11. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not be presumed, that a person would perjure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, while he could have no design: And from this may be likewise inferred, as a consequence that Perjury should be hardly fastned upon any person, for matters of very small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, seing as <hi>de minimis non curat praetor,</hi> so it is not presumeable that a man, especially of any integrity or honour, would incurr that guilt, and this was alledged, for Mr. <hi>Iames Row</hi> a Minister, when he was pursued for Perjuring himself, by Sir <hi>Thomas Stewart,</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1667. for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of five Pound Scots; but this point was not decided. And albeit I think where this is joyned with other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which may render the decision dubious, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil may either mitigat or remit the punishment; yet if the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury be clearly proved, I think it should be punished: and in no case should the Justices refuse to put the Pannel to the knowledge of an Assize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because the matter wherein the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury is alledged to have been committed, is very small: but it is punishable, if at first it might, though thereafter, <hi>ex eventu,</hi> it proved not prejudicial, as if the writ was improven by a certification; yet the false Witnesses are thereafter pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable, though at the time of the inquiry, that Paper could prejudge no man, because of the certification. It was found in <hi>Barclay</hi>'s case, <hi>February</hi> 1670. 3. Where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is difficult, it is presumed that the swearer did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand then that he did perjure himself, <hi>Clar. num.</hi> 10.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:55274:155"/>
but if the swearer did not take pains to understand the matter upon which he was deponing, I think the difficulty should hardly excuse him.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is controverted among the Doctors, if he who swears <hi>per verbum credo, I believe,</hi> can be punished for Perjury. And in Mr. <hi>Iames Row's</hi> case, it was alledged, that it should, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in effect all Oaths are but oaths of Credulity, where the matter falls not under sense; and in this case where it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to his own Oath, if he was payed of his Stipend, and he deponed upon Oath, he believed he was not payed, <hi>hoc casu,</hi> the word, <hi>believe,</hi> should have inferred Perjury, because he should not have believed except he had certainly known, and belief presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses a certainty, for faith and belief are all one, so that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to depon, he believed it was payed, was to depon, it was certainly payed, or that in faith it was payed, either of which would have inferred Perjury. But 2. <hi>Perjurium est affirmare quod dubit as arg. L. vinc. ff. nihil nov. apel. &amp; indiscrete jurare est instar perjurii. Gregor. Tholosan. h. t.</hi> And if the adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting such a dubious word as this, were sufficient to evite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; that crime should never be incurred, and certainly it is in it self a great undervaluing of the Diety, (<hi>quod est medium in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductivum hujus criminis)</hi> to depon without information, where information may be had; and it is very presumable, he would litle value perjury, who did value litle to get such informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as was requisite for satisfying the Judge, in clearing what was just: And seeing the Law designs by punishing Perjury, to come to the exact knowledge of all privat cases, wherein Judgement is to be given, to the end <hi>judex</hi> may <hi>ubicunque su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um tribuere,</hi> it follows necessarily, that it should very severely punish such as depon without previous information, especially where the matter of the deposition is <hi>in facto proprio,</hi> as in this case, for by this rash, or affectate omission, both the Law and the Judge are equally disappointed of their ends, as much as if
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55274:155"/>
the Deponer had willingly perjured himself. 2. A witnesse deponing falsly, <hi>per verbum credo,</hi> is in Law punished with the punishment of falshood. <hi>Bald. Salicet in l. de tut. C. de in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrum restitut. Alexander Concis.</hi> 28. <hi>vel</hi> 6. <hi>Angel. consil.</hi> 3. The deponing <hi>per verbum credo,</hi> would have gained the deponer the cause; and assoilzied him from the pursuite; and therefore it should infer Perjury against him, because the reason why Perjury is punished, is that there may be something to over-aw such to whom the verity of any cause is referred. 5. It is doubted amongst the Doctors, if he who promises upon Oath in a Bond, to pay a Sum, or perform a deed betwixt and a day, be guilty of Perjury if he failzie, and <hi>Math. de a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictis,</hi> relates a <hi>Neopolitan</hi> decision, wherein it was found, that Perjury could not be inferred upon the breach of such an Oath as this, the words of the obligation being to pay, <hi>sub fide dal Gentilhomo,</hi> because sayes he, this is <hi>fides</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently cannot be punished, but only <hi>paena extraordinaria,</hi> though <hi>Bertrand</hi> be of another opinion, <hi>Consil.</hi> 126.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But the question remains yet intire notwithstanding of that decision, whether they who promise under an express, formal, and religious oath, as that by God himself, or Holy Trinity, they shall pay a sum, or do such a deed, betwixt and a perfixed day, may not be pursued for Perjury: and that they should not, may be argued from this, that these being extrajudicial oaths, the Law should not incourage the giving, or exacting of them, so as to punish the not implement of them with Perjury; for this would make every man exact an oath of his debitor when he lent him money, or upon every slight occasion, which were most inconvenient. 2. The Laws do not punish extrajudicial oaths, given in depositions of Witnesses, <hi>&amp; sic testes deponens in judicio contrarium ejus quid dixit extrajudicium non punitur de falso. Alexander lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Consil.</hi> 74. <hi>Covar. in repit cap. quantis de puit vid. Monoch de

Much lesse should it such extrajudicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises: Yet some think even such contravertions as these, should, <hi>ob despectum numen,</hi> be punished arbitrary, but if this promise be given judicially, as <hi>in cautione juratoria,</hi> in removings, whereby the party obliedges himself to remove, and pay the violent profits, or whereby he binds himself to report the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Letters to the Justice-Clerk, in these &amp; such other cases.</p>
               <p>I think the not implement of the promise, unless a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cause can be assigned, should infer Perjury, both because this is a judicial oath, and because in contemplation thereof, the Law remits the necessity of finding another Cautioner, and the Party concerned has no other security nor what is founded upon this juratory caution.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. 6. It is doubted among the Doctors, whether these can be accompted perjured, <hi>qui non impleverunt vota paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum juramento confirmata,</hi> who perform and fulfil not their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents oaths. In which cases <hi>Grotius</hi> distinguishes betwixt those oaths, whereby the Father bound himself only to God, and in these the Son for not implement, is not guilty of Perjury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in effect, <hi>illud non est onus haereditatis,</hi> but is personal, and so the Son represents not the Father in it, but if the vow were made to a particular person, then that vow being <hi>in unus haereditatis,</hi> the not implement of the Fathers vow, will infer Perjury, for <hi>quo ad</hi> the estate <hi>haeres &amp; defunctus sunt una &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem persona. Matheus</hi> distinguishes in this case, <hi>si juramentum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentis sit in rem conceptum &amp; eo casu tenetur sed si non fit in rem conceptum sed in persona tenetur, arg. l.</hi> 7.8. <hi>part. ff. de part.</hi> It may be likewise doubted upon the same ground, whether the oath of any people in publick affairs, relating to the State, doth tye their children, &amp; the example of <hi>Saul</hi>'s being punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for not observing the oath whereby the people of <hi>Israel</hi> were tyed to the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. Seems to evince, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travention of these national oaths given by Parents, is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon children, <hi>in foro divino,</hi> but whether the Civil pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:55274:156"/>
can be inflicted for contravention of National Oaths, such as the Covenant and Declaration, either in the case where the Oath is given, either by the predecessor, or the giver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, is not decided. And I should incline to think, that the contravention of these National Oaths, cannot infer the Civil punishment of perjury, both because the design of perjury is only to punish such as do prejudge the privat interest of these, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whom they swear, and such a contravention cannot be properly called <hi>mendacium,</hi> the Swearer having designed at that time to fulfil what he Swore, though he thereafter alter his judgement: Nor can <hi>dolus</hi> be alledged in this case, nor that the interest of a third party is thereby prejudged, all which are requisite for inferring Perjury.</p>
               <p n="5">V. 7. When witnesses depon with us in any privat case, it was of old doubted, whether the depositions might be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and themselves punished for Perjury, by the depositions of other witnesses, and of late these conclusions seem to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly allowed. 1. That a witness deponing <hi>verba initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alia</hi> falsly, such, as of what age he is, whether he be married, or where he dwels, <hi>eo casu,</hi> he may be punished for perjury, if if he depon falsly, for these questions are proponed, not only to the end it may be known what age the witnesses are of, but likewise to the end it may be known whether the Deponer be a person of such veracity, as may be trusted, and that by these, his veracity may be traced and examined. 2. That a witness may be convinced of Perjury by writ. But 3. whether a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness may be convinced of Falshood and Perjury, by the deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other witnesses, was contraverted in the case of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canquel</hi> against <hi>Rig</hi> a Minister, and that he could not, it was urged, because if this were allowed, <hi>daretur progressus in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,</hi> for else if two witnesses deponing that such a thing were done, might be convinced of Perjury, by other two or moe witnesses, these witnesses might again be convict by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and those by other, <hi>in infinitum,</hi> for the other part, it was
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:55274:157"/>
alledged, that 1. There being nothing to overaw witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the fear and hazard of Perjury to free wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses from this tryal, was in effect to render them <hi>Libertines,</hi> and to incourage them to depon falsly. 2. It was absurd to think, that if two witnesses should depon that which were notourly false, as that such a man was killed, who thereafter was seen by a whole Judicatory, and all the members of Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Parliament, to have been alive, that <hi>eo casu,</hi> witnesses should not be found guilty of Perjury. 3. Assizers who are in effect Witnesses, as well as Judges, and may proceed to a Sentence upon their own privat knowledge, may be tryed by an Assize of error consisting of twice as many; Whereas, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of witnesses could not be reprobated by other witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, no Assize could be convict by an assize of errour, as <hi>temere jurantes super assiza.</hi> To the foresaid argument it is answered, that 1. The same did only evince the probation, should be more exact in that then in other cases, but did not at all conclude, that such witnesses could no wise be convinced of Perjury; and the ordinary rule given by Lawyers, is, that twice as many are requisite to reprobat, as to prove: Which conclusion could not take place, if the reprobation of witnesses by witnesses were not sustained. 2. This argument would evince, if it had any weight, that even, <hi>circa initialia,</hi> witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses perjuring themselves, could not be pursued for perjury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these might be convinced by other witnesses, and these by others, <hi>&amp; sic daretur progressus in infinitum,</hi> so that either witnesses cannot be convict of Perjury in no case, or else they may be in every case, where they swear falsly: Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all which the Justices by Interloquutor found, that witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses could not be pursued for Perjury, upon the deposition of other witnesses, upon the day of 1677. but yet it remains doubtful, whether one witness may not be pursued for Perjury, upon the deposition of others, though two can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, because the joynt depositions only make a full probation.

8. <hi>Clarus, num.</hi> 12. §. <hi>perjurium,</hi> is of opinion, that when any thing is referred to Oath judicially, that <hi>eo casu,</hi> the party who swears, can never be challenged for Perjury, <hi>sed Iohan, deum habet ultorem</hi>; which <hi>Boerius</hi> doth also assert to be the common opinion, <hi>decis.</hi> 305. And the reason which moves them to this, seems to be, that a party having made his Antagonist absolutely Judge of his own cause, he has, as it were, submitted to him, <hi>&amp; juramentum debet esse ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum refugium,</hi> and this seems to be the case decided, <hi>per. l.</hi> 2. <hi>C. de rebus credit: religionem contemptam ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramenti satis deum habet ultorem sed majestatis crimen vel pericu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum corporis &amp; si per principis venerationem quodam calore fuerit perjeratum, inferri non placet,</hi> for in the immediatly preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law, it is said, that <hi>causa jure jurando ex consensu utrius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que partis delato decisa, nec perjurii praetextu retractari potest,</hi> so that adding both Laws together, the sense is, that when the cause is referred to any Parties Oath, it being decided conform thereto, that Decision can neither be retracted upon pretext of Perjury, nor can the Perjurer be corporally punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And this seems a much more reasonable answer, than those many given by the Doctors; but yet I cannot assent to the conclusion it self: nor is it at all conform to our Law, nor perhaps to reason; for interest and avarice are sufficient baits to Perjury, though impunity be not thereto added, and when the Party defers an Oath, he intends thereby to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit finally to him, to whom the famine is deferred; but not so, but that if thereafter the swea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er shall be found Perjured, he may be still challenged: Nor perhaps would he have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Oath, if he had not concluded himself secure, as to what should be deponed, not only out of respect to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but likewise because of the hazard of Perjury; and seing in this case, there is <hi>mendacium juramento affirmatum,</hi> I do not see how it should not be Perjury: Is there any ground why at least His Majestie's Advocat should not be allowed to pursue it,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:55274:158"/>
for the reason which is urged for the speciality in it, ceaseth in him. And as there is no Decision in favours of <hi>Clarus</hi> his opinion in our Law, so in Mr. <hi>Iames Row</hi>'s, and other cases, where this might have been proponed, this defence was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proponed; yet in some cases, the deponer, <hi>in juramento delato,</hi> craves that the Lords may declare, that he shall not be liable for Perjury, when any Oath is necessarily so defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him, which the Lords in some cases use to grant, as <hi>in facto antiquo</hi>: And by so doing, they show that Perjury is punishable, <hi>regulariter,</hi> even in him to whom an Oath is deferred: but I believe, that the Doctors have more justly concluded, that where an Oath is deferred in Criminals, though the Pannel needs not swear, yet if he do swear, he is not punishable as a perjured person, though he swear fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>quia licet cui<expan>

And yet it may be debated, that this holds not with us in Usury, and other cases, because there the Law obliedged him to give his Oath; and <hi>Matheus</hi> doth think, that it should in no case, but rather that the Perjurer should there be punished with a double punishment, both for concealing the Crime, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Perjuring himself. And it may be alledged that this is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther punishable then ordinary Perjury, because the Defender needed not swear, and was in no hazard by not swearing, and the less the temptation be, the sin is alwayes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: nor needed the Defender redeem his own Blood by swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as is pretended, or at least, <hi>licet hoc liceat, licere tam debet per modum licitum, sed non perjurio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. It may likewise be doubted in some cases, whether the violation of an Oath doth infer Perjury, as when a Judge gives his Oath that he shall administrat Justice impartially, or an Advocat that he shall be honest in his imployment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out discovering his Clients secret, or betraying his business; if that Judge, taking Money as a bribe, or that Advocat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after prevaricating, may be upon these accompts pursued for
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:55274:158"/>
Perjury. And this was, I remember, controverted in the case of one of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Officers of State, who was pursued upon the foresaid <hi>Act</hi> of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> for Perjury; because he was alledged to have taken Money from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, in cases wherein they were pursued at His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties instance; and that this could not infer Perjury, was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from this, that our Law having made some particular Statutes, as to Perjury, it designed thereby, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Nation, should not in this Crime be left to the common Law; and seing it had only punished Perjury in the case of Witnesses, Assizers, and Bigamy; it did clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that Perjury <hi>deum tantum habet ultorem,</hi> in all other cases. 2. If Perjury were punishable in this case, Tutors and Executors who find caution, might be always punished for Perjury, where they are pursuable for Mal-administration, which were absurd, and was never practized in any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 3. When such Oaths as these are given, these words, <hi>As ye shall answer to God,</hi> are ordinarly adjected, rather to impresse a fear of the Deity upon the swearer, than to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him by the Oath to the hazard of Perjury: and the fear of Perjury is neither thought upon considered by the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strator, nor the swearer, so that <hi>non de hoc agitur,</hi> at that time, which is one of the many things, that is always looked to in punishing of Crimes. 4. If consequential Perjury had been punishable as formal Perjury, there needed no Act to have been made, declaring that Bigamy should be repute, and punished as Perjury, seing it was such by consequence before that Act. For the better clearing of this case, it will be fit to divide Perjury in Formal and Consequential Perjury: and to conclude that formal Perjury, which is in these cases declared Perjury by an expresse Act, should be punishable as a Crime; But that consequential Perjury, as may be instanced in the cases above-written, should not be punished as a Crime, but as an Aggravation: for seing in these the Perjurer did not
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:55274:159"/>
formally design to commit Perjury, is were not very rational to think, that he should be punished by the formal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Crime: which distinction, I find likewise al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Civilians; for albeit formal Perjury was only punishable by Banishment, and Infamy: Yet if any man died by that Perjury, as in false-witnessing in capital Crimes, the Perjury was <hi>eo casu,</hi> punishable by death; and if it was mixt with Treason, it was punishable as Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margaret Wood</hi> was in <hi>February</hi> 1631. pursued, for having perjured her self as a false Witness, in so far, as she having been cited before the Privy Council, and examined by them, she had deponed many false things against the Laird of <hi>Pitcaple,</hi> and <hi>Richard Mowat:</hi> Against which pursuit, it was alledged for her, 1. That she could not be pursued as a false Witness, because a Woman in our Law cannot be a Witness, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently she cannot be a false Witness. 2. She did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon upon oath before the Council, and consequently she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be guilty of Perjury, since, <hi>nemo sine juramento est perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii reus</hi>; Nor is a person deponing for the information of the Council, oblieged before an oath be administrat, to consider what she is deponing, as lyable to the certification of Perjury, and if it were otherwayes, there needed no oath be administrat; so that before the administration of an oath, the deponer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither a witness, nor sworn, can neither be guilty of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, nor false witnessing: much less can she be guilty of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, in having deponed falsly, which is a complicated crime, made up of perjury and falshood. 3. She is but one single witness, and so could not have prejudged by her testimony, the persons against whom she deponed, <hi>&amp; semper perpendendum est damnum, quod ex perjurio resultat, Carpz. quaest.</hi> 46. <hi>n.</hi> 47. Likeas, here she retracted her own deposition her self, before any pursuit was, or could be intented against those Gentlemen: and that she deponed was the result of the confusion she was
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:55274:159"/>
put in, by her appearance before the Council, being a young Girle, not exceeding 18. so that her age and sex should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse her, <hi>si quis calore iracundiae, aut forte lingua lapsus, aut praecipitatus, perjurium commisit, ei eo casu ignosci debet, Rens. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>decis.</hi> 2. And there is nothing more natural, or less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, then that a guilt arising from a deposition, and meer words should be taken off in the same way, especially, before any person be thereby prejudg'd, as in this case. 4. This Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel could not be warrantably founded upon the Act of <hi>Q. M.</hi> which punish'd only perjury committed in marrying two wives, but no other species of perjury. To which it was answered, that as to the first defence, it was not relevant, since she being cited before the Council, ought to have depon'd truly, even for informing the Supreme Judicatory of the Nation, who use, and must examine women for the good of the Common-wealth: especially in such atrocious and occult crimes, as in the burning of the House of <hi>Frendraught.</hi> And though the defender may in some cases cast a woman from being witness, yet that excuses her not if she be examined. To the 2. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers are clear, that a witness may depon without being sworn, for the swearing them is not essential, since the pursuer may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it: And yet the witness who depones falsly, even though not sworn, is a false witness, <hi>Bart. in l. si quis ff. ad l. Cornel. de fals. Clar. h. t. num.</hi> 11. To the 3. it was not relevant, since she inform'd against these Gentlemen in a treasonable point, and might have prejudg'd them: nor did her retraction proceed from repentance, but confrontation; nor did she ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally only, or by confusion lapse into this error, she hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spread these misreports before she was cited, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated her confession after citation. To the 4. the practice of the Kingdom was oppon'd, which is the best interpreter of Laws. And in <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. <hi>Grahame</hi> of <hi>Long-boddom,</hi> and in <hi>Anno</hi> 1622. <hi>Turnbul</hi> of <hi>Belshes,</hi> and lately <hi>Dempster</hi> of <hi>Muresk,</hi> were punish'd with death for deponing falsly, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:55274:160"/>
others to depon. But these points were not decided.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The punishment of Perjury by the Civil Law, was Banishment, <hi>l. ult. ff. de crimine Stellionatus &amp; fustigatio,</hi> or Scourging, <hi>l. si duo §. si quis perjuraverit.</hi> By our Law, <hi>Act</hi> 19. <hi>Parl.</hi> 5. <hi>Q.

As to which Act, it is observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, 1. That Perjury is not formally punishable with us, but only declaratorly Perjury being in it self so heinous a Crime; but the reason of this seems to be, that Perjury was before this Act punishable, after this manner, for by the 4. <hi>cap. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Reg. Maj.</hi> it was appointed, that <hi>temere jurantes super assisa spoliabuntur mobilibus &amp; in carcerem detrudentur per annum &amp; diem adminus &amp; infamiae notam incurrent &amp; amittent legem terrae,</hi> which <hi>Skeen</hi> interprets to be, <hi>non habère personam standi in judicio,</hi> and not to be receivable as witnesses, either in <hi>judicio,</hi> or <hi>extrajudicium,</hi> which Act is likewise ratified, by the 47. <hi>Act, Parl.</hi> 6. <hi>K.

               <p>I Have oftimes thought that men should walk legally, not only in obedience, but gratitude to Law, since the Law takes so much pains to secure not only our lives and estates, but even our honour and reputation, and will humour us so far, as that because we will think railery a misfortune, it will therefore punish even these who offend our imagination.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Injury then, in its more comprehensive sense, may give a name to all crimes; for all crimes are injuries, but injury as it is the Subject of this Title, is the same thing with contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely or reproach: It is divided by Lawyers, into such as are committed by thoughts, deeds, words, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures; but the more received division is, that injuries are either verbal, or real.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Verbal injuries are these which are committed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:55274:161"/>
expressions, as to call a man a cheat, or a woman a whore; but because expressions vary according to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the speaker, therefore except the words can allow of no good sense, as Whore, or Thief, or that there ly strong presumptions against the speaker, the <hi>injuriandi animus,</hi> the designe of injuring, as well as the injuring words, must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the speaker will be allowed to purge his guilt, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his intention, <hi>l.</hi> 5. §. <hi>octavo, ff. de injur.</hi> and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration will, without an oath, be sufficient, except the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender be burdened with contrary presumptions, <hi>Berlich. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus.</hi> 60. <hi>num.</hi> 18. Lawyers therefore require in Libelling injuries, 1. That the particular expressions be distinctly condescended upon; nor is the general, you called me a Cheat, or said some such thing sufficient, seing not only words but even the pointing of them does alter the estimat of Injuries. 2. The pusuer should Libel the design of injuring, except the words infer so clearly an Injury, that there is no necessity to Libel the design. 3. That the pursuer who was injured, did presently resent the injury, and took what was spoke for an Injury, which the Lawyers call <hi>revocatio injuriae ad animum.</hi> And it is sufficient, that this dissatisfaction be signified either openly and expresly, or by some other Acts which testified discontent, <hi>ex incontinenti quis injuriam debet ad animum revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care alias ex intervallo nihil facit sed injuria remissa censetur. § ult. just. de injur.</hi> And the reason of this seems to be, because the essence of a verbal injury consists in dissatisfying the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to whom the words were spoken, and words are only Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if they be so taken, and therefore if they were taken at first to be no injury, they were then no injury: And if they were not then an injury, they could not afterwards become such.</p>
               <p>Since then Injuries are estimat according to the design of the offender, it follows naturally, that men who are Fools, Idiots, very young, or very drunk, are not punishable for verbal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, except the offender did become drunk upon design to

offend, <hi>si non ex proposito sed ex impetu deliquit.</hi> And great pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which break off all designing, <hi>justa &amp; non affectata ira</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses also in this case. As also for the same reason, the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting true Crimes are no injury, if the objecter designed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally not to offend the person guilty, but to inform the Common-wealth, or to defend the speakers own honour. And upon the first accompt, it was found, that the detecting what the Common-wealth was not much concerned in, was an injury, <hi>Cravet. consil.</hi> 145. And upon the last accompt, it is thought, that to give a man the lye, is an injury, but that it is no injury to say you speak not truth; for in the one we defend our own honour, but in the other we offend the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the speaker: and custom has made the expression passe for an expression to be used when we design to offend. The relating likewise what we heard from good Authors, who designed no prejudice, is sufficient also to defend against the punishment due to Injurers, as was found in the Court of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy Cod. fab. de injur. def.</hi> 5. Yet sometimes injuries are infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not only from expresse words, but even from the presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive meaning of the speakers; as to look in a mans face, and to say, I am not a lyar as others are, <hi>Afflict. §. injuria. tit. de parjur. firm.</hi> or to say, flauntingly, you are a fine Church-man, <hi>Iacob. de bello visu lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>num.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Real Injuries are committed, by hindring a man to use what is his own, by removing his Seat out of its place in the Church, by giving a man medicaments which may affront him, by Arresting his stoods unjustly, by wearing in contempt what belongs to another man, as a mark of honour, by Razing shamfully a mans hair, or beard, by offering to strike him in publick, or by striking him, or riving or abusing his cloaths, or his house, and many other wayes related by <hi>Berlich. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus.</hi> 69.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. According to our Law, verbal injuries, are punished only by the Commissars, who are <hi>judices christianitatis</hi>: Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:55274:162"/>
being a Church censure, And the Commissars do inflict pecuniary mulcts, and make the offender do pennance at Church doors, or otherwayes: nor, do ordinarily the Lords of Session either Advocat such Actions, or modify their penalties.</p>
               <p>The Council do use to remit to the Commissars such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, and refuse to try verbal injuries done to privat persons, as in the case of <hi>Strauchan</hi> and <hi>Straiton</hi>; but if the verbal inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was done to a Magistrat, as if any man should call him a knave, or a fool, then the Council use to fyne and to punish even verbal injuries, as in the case of <hi>George Campbel,</hi> and the Bailiffs of <hi>Inverary,</hi> 1666. Or to a Privy Counsellour, as in the case of Mr. <hi>Alexander Spotswood</hi> and the Justice Clerk. And though verbal injuries are extinguished by the Civil Law, if they be not pursued within a Year, or by posterior friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; for the Law is most desirous to pass by such imaginary Crimes, yet in <hi>George Campbels</hi> case, a subsequent reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not sustained as a relevant exception, because it was not very expresse, they punish also <hi>scandalum magnatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Criminal Courts likewise punishes verbal injuries, if against Magistrats, but will not sustain a pursuite against privat persons, for though II. of <hi>November,</hi> 1672. <hi>Aikman</hi> against <hi>Carnagy</hi>; nor would they sustain a Criminal pursuit, for calling a Minister perjured, <hi>vid Stock. decis.</hi> 108. where he tells us that it is the present custom of <hi>Brabant</hi> not to sustain Criminal Actions for words, except they be spoken against Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Real Injuries may be pursued before the Council, or Justice Court, and the punishment is arbitrary.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Infamous Libels, <hi>libelli famosi,</hi> are the most permanent of all Injuries, and therefore are most severely punished; and in it the offender, shews more design, and therefore is more guilty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:55274:162"/>He who writes, dictats, or affixes infamous Libels, or causes writ, dictat, or affix them, is punishable.</p>
               <p>He who finds an infamous Libel, and shews it, though to one only, is punishable, if malice or design can be proved, else not; for there is nothing more ordinary, nor more innocently done for the most part, then to shew such Libels: whether <hi>dolus malus &amp; animus iniuriandi,</hi> (a design to offend,) be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed in this delict, or must be proved, is much contraverted, <hi>Bertaz. consil.</hi> 237. affirms that it is presumed. <hi>Farin. quest.</hi> 295. affirms it is not presumed, but must be proved. And I incline to this last opinion, seing infamous Libels are not now so much resented as formerly, custom having much allayed the picque which used to ensue thereupon, and that custom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends from all guilt in this case, is most learnedly maintained by <hi>Coler. decis.</hi> 154. where it was found that Stationers were absolved, though they sold infamous Libels, because all Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners use to sell such.</p>
               <p>Many things do likewise in this case lessen the punishment, as that the Pannel is a minor, was provoked, did tear it before it was fully written, or after it was affixt, or confest his fault, and said he did it only out of passion, or curiosity, or if what was said was true, <hi>Berlich. conclus.</hi> 67.</p>
               <p>The punishment of this delict was of old arbitrary, <hi>Paul. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>sent. tit.</hi> 14. but was made capital by the edict, <hi>valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niani &amp; valentis l. unic.

was 13. <hi>March,</hi> 1612. for abusing Constables and bidding the King, the Council, and them, kiss his arse, and swearing he cared not a fart for them, which words appeared both by the speaker, and the contexture of the words, to have rather flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from folly, then design.

               </p>
               <p n="3">III. By the foresaid Act of Parliament, the Poinding of such Goods is forbid, in the time of labouring, but it is not declared to be a Crime; and the Lord <hi>Renton</hi> haveing, in <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1666. pursued the Officer of the Court of <hi>Coldin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghame,</hi> for poinding one of his Plough Oxen, when they were labouring, before the Criminal Court, is was alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that no criminal pursuit, could be founded upon this Act, seing nothing could be criminally pursued, but that which was made a Crime, by a special Statute, and to which a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial sanction was annex'd. Likeas by the constant custome, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny actions of Spoilzie were founded upon this Act; but no criminal pursuit was ever thereupon intented: To which it was replyed, that the contempt of a Law, was in it self a Crime; seing disobedience to Authority, was in effect the <hi>basis</hi> of all Crimes. 2. Illegal intrometring with another mans Goods, was a Crime, especially <hi>ubi lex non solum non as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistebat, sed &amp; restistebat,</hi> for theft is nothing else but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable intromission, and as the taking of His <hi>Majestie</hi>'s free Liedges is a Crime, where the same is not warranted by Law; so the poinding of these Goods should infer a Crime, that being another <hi>species</hi> of unlawful execution. 3. This Act discharges such executions, conform to the Common Law. And by the Common or Civil Law, this is a Crime, as is clear by the Law above cited; and whereas, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that no sanction was annex'd: It was replyed, that where the Law annexes no sanction, the punishment is there
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55274:164"/>
arbitrary; and there are many Crimes, both in the Civil Law and outs, to which no sanction is annext. The Justices sustain'd the Libel, and ordained the Pannel to go to the knowledge of an Inquest: The expresse words of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquutor were, that the poinding an Oxe, in the time of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, is an injury and wrong, punishable by the Law, <hi>paena aplicanda filco.</hi> And thereafter, the three Pannels were found guilty, though it was not expresly proved, that the Oxe was labouring actually, the time of the poinding, but only that he used to labour, and was in the Plough the week before, and the Countrey was then labouring, all which are necessary qualifications of this Crime, and so are necessary interrogators after pronouncing of which doom, the Justices fined each of the three Pannels, in fourty Pound Scots. And yet in <hi>Iune</hi> 1674. a reply against lawfully poinded, being proponed in a pursuit for theft; the case was by the Justices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, to be first civily pursued. It was here also alledged, that by the 34. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. <hi>Parl. I.</hi> 5. where Crimes may be criminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and civily pursued, the civil pursuit ought first to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd, which was repelled, because, though a civil pursuit of spoilzie were intented, there could no defence, such as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully poinded, <hi>authore praetore,</hi> &amp;c. which are usual in other cases, be proponed here, seing though the executions were formal, and the Decreet whereupon they proceeded irreduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; yet to poind a labouring Oxe, in labouring time, is in all cases unlawful, <hi>&amp; itacessat hoc casu ratio legis.</hi> 2. The defender could not plead the benefite of this Act, except he first acknowledged, that the wrong here committed was a Crime, for the Act runs only in such cases, as may be civilly, or criminally pursued.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It is observable, that albeit this Act relate to the Common Law, yet they differ in many points, as 1. The persons of labourers could not be apprehended by that Law, but by ours they may. 2. By that Law no distinction is
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55274:165"/>
made, whether there were other poindable Goods or not; but by ours, these particulars may be poinded, or Lands may be apprized; and therefore such as raise Criminal Letters upon this Act, should libel, that such Goods were poinded in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring time, and that the owner, or debitor had other Goods and Lands, against which the creditor could have had execution: Albeit I think, he is not obliedged to prove this; but that this is, <hi>ex eorum numero quae allegari sed non probari debent,</hi> yet if the Messengers execution be produced, bearing, that he searched, and could find no other Moveables, I think, that <hi>eo casu,</hi> the Messengers execution should make Faith, except the pursuer offer instantly, to condescend upon these other Moveables, that were extant, and be ready to prove the same. I find, that if the Messengers executions bearing in an Apprizing, that he searched, but could find no Moveables, they are so far believed, that no contrary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation will be received, for else all Comprizngs might be reduced; yet I think, that the case is not alike here, for the Act being so expresse, it should be sufficient to defend against a crime, (though not to reduce a real diligence,) that other Moveables were extant.</p>
               <p>Under the prohibition of this Act, are comprehended, not only the Goods that are in the Plough, but these Horses which lead foggage, for without these, Land cannot be laboured; and so the reason of the Law extends to them: likeas, the Act of Parliament expresses separatly, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, Goods pertaining to the Plough, and that labours the ground: nor are these words <hi>that labours the ground,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egetick only.</p>
               <p>By these words, <hi>in time of labouring,</hi> are mean'd, not only when the beasts are actually labouring, but the season of labouring, and that from the time of strieking, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed time; and therefore Goods that had once tilled, though
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:55274:165"/>
in <hi>October,</hi> seem not poindable, for then labouring is as necessar as in the <hi>Spring</hi>; and yet the contrary was found, the 15. of <hi>November,</hi> 1627. and the 22. of <hi>November,</hi> 1628. because as is there alledged by <hi>Durie, October</hi> is not the season of labouring.</p>
               <p>It may be doubted, whether Horse leading foggage in <hi>Iune</hi> and <hi>Iuly,</hi> can be poinded, for that is the season of that kind of labouring.</p>

               <p n="1">I. BEaring of Hagbuts, Pistols, and other Fire-works, were punished of old by amputation of the right hand, but by the 6. <hi>Act, Parliament</hi> 16. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. the bearing of such wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons is forbidden, though no prejudice be done by the wearers, who may be pursued, either before the Council, or Justice Court, and the punishment by the Council is declared not to be corporal, but only confiscation of their moveables, or syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and imprisonment; but prejudice of any pursuite before the Justice Court, who it appears may inflict the former pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of cutting off the right hand.</p>
               <p>It would seem that by this act the Pannel is oblidged to give his oath before the Justices, which is not usual in any crime, except that of Usury, for the probation by oath is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitly subjoyned to pursuits before the Justices or Council. And albeit the Council does immediatly preceed, yet that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation by oath seems not to relate solely to the procedure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council. For when the procedure before the Council is repeated, the probation by witnesses is only there mentioned.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55274:166"/>
Yet I think there is an errour in the printing of this Act, for it is very unreasonable, that when this Crime is proved before the Council by witnesses, that no amputation shall be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet this priviledge should not be extended to those against whom it is proved by their own oath.</p>
               <p>It is observable from this Act, that the Council may force such as are pursued before them to give their oaths, albeit it may be alledged, that <hi>nemo tenetur crimen contra se pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Act likewise, all licences to bear thir Weapons are ordained to be past in Council, and to pay a composition to the Thesaurer, and to passe his Register and all the Seals, else to be null.</p>
               <p n="2">II. By the Civil Law, the bearing of these Weapons was a crime also. <hi>l.</hi> 11. <hi>C. ut armorum usus</hi> and by the Feudal Law, <hi>c.</hi> 1. §. <hi>si quis. de pace tenenda. &amp; tenebatur paena legis juliae de vi publica,</hi> which was arbitrary: And the Glosse observes, that the carrying of such Arms was repute publick violence, though no prejudice was done, which is consonant to the Act of Parliament. But it is strange that only Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, or ingines should be forbidden by that Act. Nor can the carrying Pikes, Swords, or any other weapons, be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that Act.</p>
               <p>By the Civil Law likewise, the prohibit Arms were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscat, and <hi>Marsil. in prac. § pro complemento, N.</hi> 12. <hi>Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius &amp; Clar.</hi> declared, that by the custom both of <hi>Spain</hi> and other places, the Arms are confiscat, albeit there be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse warrand for that confiscation by the Statute, but it may be doubted if the true owner having lent them without being conscious to the crime, will losse them, and I think, not</p>
               <p>But keeping of such Weapons at home is not punishable neither by the foresaid Act, nor common Law, by which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is lawful for such as travel to bear such Weapons, for their own preservation, <hi>&amp; generaliter licet portare arma defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siva</hi>;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:55274:167"/>
but our Law allows no such distinction. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that <hi>Iohn Macknaughton,</hi> being pursued before the Council for bearing forbidden Weapons, they repelled this defence, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was travelling (unlesse the journey could have been alledged necessary, for else the Act might stil be eluded) and that it was the custom of the <hi>Highlands</hi> to go still well attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and armed, which defence seemed to some ill repelled, for self-defence, and the custom of the Countrey, excuses still from this crime, <hi>Farinac. de diver. crim. questi.</hi> 108.</p>
               <p>By the common Law, offensive Arms, such as Swords and Pistols, were forbidden, and the bearers punished, albeit no prejudice followed; but the carrying Stones and Trees, and such other things as were not, <hi>ex sua natura offensiva,</hi> was only punishable, if violence was done by the bearers, <hi>l. armorum ff. de verb. sig.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Thir pursuits are more ordinarily before the Council, than the Justice Court, and is ordinary Libelled as an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather then a crime. Thus I find <hi>William Hamiltoun</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued for wearing of Pistols, and presenting one to the Provost of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> whereupon he came in will, and was banished the Realm during his lifetime, 1. <hi>Novem.</hi> 1597.</p>
               <p>The prosecution of this crime concerns only his <hi>Majestie's</hi> interest. And therefore the dyet was deserted, because His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat, nor none to represent him, did not concur, nor was the Libel raised at his instance, 20. <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1596.

               <p>OUr Law hath been so charitable, as to provide for Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, by special Statutes, <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. <hi>Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. <hi>Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 42. <hi>Ia.</hi> 4. <hi>P.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl. cap.</hi> 70. <hi>Ia.</hi> 5. <hi>Parl.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. But sturdy Beggars (our Law calls them <hi>Egyptians</hi> oftimes, as the <hi>French</hi> calls them <hi>Bohemians</hi>) and Vagabonds should be proceeded against by the Sheriffs, and other Judges, and they may exact caution of them, and if they find none, they should be denounced fugitives, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 97. and may be sent to publick Work-houses, or put in the Stocks, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 124.144. and 147. <hi>Item. Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Par.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 268. and if they be recept after they are denounced fugitives, their receptors are lyable for the prejudice sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the parties damnified, will have action against the Magistrates, within whose bounds or jurisdiction these Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabounds are recept wittingly, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 97. But this Act determines not, whether this <hi>wittingly</hi> relates to the receptor, or Magistrat; yet by the common Law, the adverb <hi>scienter,</hi> is still applicable to the person, against whom the penal Statute runs; so that except the Magistrat know
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:55274:168"/>
that the Vagabond was harboured within his bounds, it were severe to sustain action of damnage and interest against him, though the receptor knew the Vagabond, and did witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recept him. But I think, that if the Magistrate did either omit his duty, he will be liable, <hi>nam scire &amp; scire debere aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantar,</hi> or if he was willingly ignorant.</p>
               <p>I find that <hi>A.

It appears by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, emitted by the Council, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. these <hi>Egyptians</hi> were ordered to leave the Kingdom, upon pain of death, which is ratified by the 13. <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 20. <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. and upon that Act of Parliament, <hi>Moses shaw</hi> and other <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> Sorners and Vagabonds, were hanged the last of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 1611.</p>

To defend them against these, men did associat themselves under Government, and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:55274:169"/>
renounced their native liberty, for the protection of Law: nor can Law justifie the severity of its punishments, and the great exactions it requires, but by returning to these it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, a sweet and pleasant security, against all rapine and violence.</p>
               <p n="1">I. When Theft is aggraged by violence, it is called Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, from the <hi>Germane</hi> word <hi>Raube</hi>; and is with us called Stouthrieff, Stouth signifying Theft, and Rieff signifying violence: In which Crime, our Persons are endangered as well as our Estates, and so is ordinarily punished by death, even in these Countreys, where Theft is only punishable by pecunial mulcts, or whipping, and thus it was punished with death amongst the Jews, as is clear, by <hi>Davids</hi> answer to <hi>Nathans</hi> Parable, though Theft was only punished by resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and though <hi>Calistratus, l.</hi> 28. §. <hi>grassatores, ff. de paenis,</hi> seems to make such only punishable, if they Robb frequently, and in high wayes, and with Arms, <hi>grassatores qui praedae causa id faciunt proximi latronibus habentur; &amp; si cum ferro aggredi &amp; spoliare instituerunt capite puniuntur.

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The quality of frequent and common committing Theft and Robberies, is not only a quality that raises the Crime of Theft alone, from being punishable by restitution, to be
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:55274:169"/>
punishable by death in other nations, but by the 51. <hi>Act,</hi> 11. <hi>Parl. I.</hi> 6. It is declared, <hi>that landed men who are convict of common Theft, Recept of Theft, or Stouthreif, shall incur the crime and pain of treason</hi>; upon which Act, it was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, whether the word <hi>common,</hi> was a quality and adjunct to be added to the Recept of Theft, and Stouthreif as well as Theft, since the Act sayes but only common Theft, not common Recept of Theft, nor common Stouthreif; and it was urged, that it was reasonable, that this should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of all, seing it was that quality, which rendered them Treason. For simple Recept, would not have been declared treasonable of it self; and by the foresaid <hi>l.</hi> 28. the reiterating this crime, aggraged it from banishment, to death, and in the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dinary way of speaking, men cease not to repeat such words: Likeas it was just, that as the crimes were in Landlesse men punishable, only by restitution, or death, if repeated so in Landed men, the punishment should grow proportionally, and infer death or Treason, if commonly committed.</p>
               <p>To which it was answered, that the words of the Act of Parliament, are conceived disjunctively; Likeas it seems, that if the Parliament had designed, to add the word <hi>common,</hi> to <hi>Receipt</hi> and <hi>Stouthreif,</hi> they would have added the same to prevent this objection: and it seems indeed, that Stouthreif, which is that species of Theft, that we call Robery, deserves to be punished as Treason in landed men, though they do not commonly commit the same, because it being easier for landed men to commit Robbery, and it being more probable, that they would Rob than steal, this crime ought to be as severely punished in them, as common Theft; and accordingly the foresaid alledgiance being proponed for <hi>Iames Wood,</hi> the 21. <hi>May</hi> 1601. it was repelled.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In this process likewise, the said <hi>Iames,</hi> having been pursued for robbing the writs and evidents belonging to <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town,</hi> It was alledged, that the pursuer ought to condescend
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:55274:170"/>
upon the Lands, to which these evidents belonged, because if that were condescended on, the Pannel would prove, that the said Lands, and consequently, the evidents did belong to himself, which alledgiance was likewise repelled, nor was it found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that a Civil precognition should proceed in this case; and in <hi>Iune</hi> 1668. it was found that a Libel was relevant, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in general, that Jewels or Pearls were stolne, without condescending upon the particular number of them; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alledged for the <hi>Macgibbons, Decemb.</hi> 8. 1676. that the Libel was not relevant, not condescending upon the persons from whom the goods were rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, nor what goods were rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, but only in the general, that the Pannels did frequently rob the houses of <hi>Garntilly,</hi> and <hi>Strathurds</hi> tennents.</p>
               <p>To this it was answered, that though where privat parties pursue, <hi>ad interesse privatum</hi>; such a condescendance is nessary, because the informers may know, nor can the private damnage be repaired, except his losse be liquidly proved; yet when the pursuit is at His <hi>Majesties</hi> instance, and that an habitual, and constant trade of robbing, and sorning, is libelled, It is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to libel in general, and if the speciality be not proved, the Pannels have no prejudice, for they will not be found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor will the probation be conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uding; but it is all one to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> which of His subjects be robbed, or what be taken away, it being His <hi>Majesties</hi> interest, that no constant, and habitual Robbery be committed in his Kingdoms; nor is there any thing more ordinary, then to sustain Libels against such as are guilty of open rebellion, without condescending upon the particular persons who were killed or robbed in that Rebellion. And whereas it was urged, that if the particular goods alledged to be robbed, were condescended on, the Libel might be elided by this suitable defence, <hi>viz.</hi> that they had a right to the goods, or had the consent of the owner; It might have been answered, that they were not precluded from such defenses, by the generality of the Libel, for the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:55274:170"/>
might alledge that the taking away of such and such goods could not inferr Robbery, because they had a right to these goods, or were warranted to take them away by the consent of the owner.</p>
               <p>The Justices sustained this Libel, notwithstanding of the generality foresaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander Steil</hi> being pursued in <hi>August</hi> 1669. for stealing and Robbing, evidents, writs, and cloaths, out of Captain <hi>Barclays</hi> house, who was his Master at that time.</p>
               <p>It was found that the pursuer, behoved to prove, that the saids evidents were taken away by force, or breaking up of doors, and that the servants having of them was not sufficient to infer Theft, though he had delivered them to a third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and albeit this should be proved, yet the Justices found this alledgeance relevant, <hi>viz.</hi> that this deposition alledged to be stollen, being given to the Pannel, that he might counterfeit the subscription, and he having no freedome to comply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, he did run away to the Lord <hi>Fyvie,</hi> and delivered up the same to him without any reward, which alledgeance was found relevant, as said is, though it seems to be contrary to the Libel, and as to the wearing cloaths, the Libel was not found relevant, except it had been proved that they belonged to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Barclay,</hi> and were under his locks at the time, since it was offered to be proved, that the servant had worn these cloaths publickly in his Masters service, which purged the presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Theft. It may be doubted what a poor servant could do, if he had broken up the doors really at his Masters desire, who had sent him home to bring papers, though he could not prove the command otherwayes then by his masters oath, for his master might alwayes easily prove the breaking up of the doors.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. So odious is this crime, and so frequent was it, that by the 21. <hi>Act, Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. all such as recept, fortifie, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or give meat, harbour, or assistance to any such Robbers,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:55274:171"/>
are declared art and part, but it would appear that this Act strikes only where there are Letters of Intercommuning, and that because the Act it self bears, <hi>to the effect it should be known to what purpose they Intercommuned,</hi> and because it were too se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to punish men as thieves, except they were put <hi>in mala fide,</hi> so to do, by publick Proclamation, or Letters of Intercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning.</p>
               <p n="5">V. By the 227. <hi>Act, Parl.</hi> 14. <hi>I.</hi> 6. It is declared (for the same hatred against Robbers) lawfull to all his <hi>Majesties</hi> Leidges to concur and joyn against Clann and Border Thieves, and to take and execute them; all Magistrats and Free-holders, being made Justices for that effect, by the said <hi>Act.</hi> But this part of the Act is now in desuetude; and it appears to have been but temporary, <hi>quo ad</hi> the power of executing, but Robbers may be lawfully seized on without authority.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Oppression is ordinarly but a quality of other crimes, but yet there are sometimes special dittayes founded thereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, <hi>per se</hi>; and there are some particular Acts declaring seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral species of it to be punishable, as reif, or by other specifick punishments mentioned in the saids Acts; and thus it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression to compel the Kings proper Tennents to ride, or do ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Avarage, Carriage, Shearing, Leading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and should be punished accordingly, <hi>Act</hi> 21. <hi>P.</hi> 2. <hi>I.</hi> 4.

               <p n="7">VII. Because oftimes in thir cases, the Pannel pretends, that what he did take by force, was his own, or that he had a right thereto, therefore except the violence be very great, the Justices use to ordain the matter of right to be first discussed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Civil Judge, as was found in <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1675 in the case of <hi>Inglis</hi> of <hi>East-sheilds,</hi> and in many other cases: and by the 33. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. <hi>Parl. I.</hi> 5. It is declared, <hi>that as for depredation, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterful reiffs, and spoilzies, particular dyets shall be set therefore at the discretion of the Lords, the matter being first Civilly discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before them.</hi> Upon which Act it is oftimes alledged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Justices, that the cause must be civilly discussed before the Session, in all masterful reiffs, before they can proceed to cognosc thereupon; but notwithstanding of this the Justices do constantly sustain Criminal processes for Reiffs and Robberies, without any previous civil precognition; and they find this Act to be now in desuetude, as in the case of <hi>Monimusk</hi> 27. of <hi>November</hi> 1611. And I think, that by <hi>Lords,</hi> in that act are not meaned the Lords of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssion, for that Act is two Years prior to the institution of the Session, but that by <hi>Lords,</hi> there, are meant the Justices themselves, for there being no Session at that time, the Justices were Judges competent to many Civil cases, originally such as perambulations, &amp;c. and to all Civil cases, if they had a necessary connexion with, or dependance upon criminal cases. And therefore, where the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:55274:172"/>
person who was alledged to have committed masterful reiffs, or spuilzies, could pretend that what he did was in prosecution of his own right. The Justices had a latitude to try the matter of right, first Civilly, but this was never necessary, for it is by the Act left to the discretion of the Judge.</p>
               <p>It remains then, to be considered, how far the taking away by violence what is really a mans own, can infer a guilt against him. Which difficulty may be cleared in these few conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, 1. That the thing violently possessed, though by a common spuilzie, and much more by a masterful reiff, ought to be restored, <hi>nam spoliatus est ante omnia restituendus,</hi> and that though he who took away what was his own, could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly prove his right; and since this holds, where the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was only committed by a simple Ryot, it should by a stronger consequence hold, where the thing was taken away by such violent means as amounted to a crime, and so this should be no good defence, either against a Criminal, or Civil pursuit. 2. Not only ought the thing to be restored, but even the true Proprietar who intrometted with his own, by open force &amp; violence is punishable, for the Law will not allow that any man should be Judge to himself, but much lesse that he should use violence, &amp; force upon any accompt, and this were to invade or assume Jurisdictions, which is in it self a crime.</p>
               <p>The third conclusion is, that if any man do by force or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, extort from another, a writ, or obligation, which he could have obliedged him in Law to grant, that force is not only punishable Criminally, but the deed so extorted is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducable by a Civil pursuit: as was found in <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1675. Though it was alledged there, that such force might be Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally punished, yet the deed so granted could not be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, since such deeds were only reduceable, where something might be restored, but here nothing was to be restored; since the deposition alledged to be extorted by force, depended upon a former minut, by vertue whereof the granter could have
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:55274:172"/>
been compelled to have granted the same; and this was the same case, as if a Creditor should compel his Debitor by force, to pay him what was his own, in which, though the force be punishable, yet the Debitor could not repeat what he had justly payed, as is clear, not only by common sense and reason, but <hi>l.</hi> 12. <hi>ff. quod met. caus.

Edictum praetor is quod metus causa, &amp;c. Lex ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> which punisheth the force as a Crime, <hi>&amp; decretum divi Marci,</hi> all which three are expresly mentioned in that Title, and though by the old edict, and the <hi>Lex julia,</hi> he who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his debitor to pay what was justly due, could not be by these remedies restored, <hi>quia nihil decrat vim passo,</hi> as the Law formerly cited does prove; yet, <hi>ex decreto divi Marci,</hi> which was posterior to these remedies (as <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> was long posterior to <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>) even he who took pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own, could not defend himself by alledging upon
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55274:173"/>
his right: which excellent Law is set down, <hi>l.</hi> 13. <hi>ff. quod mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus causa. Quisquis igitur probatus mihi fuerit rem ullam debito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris vel pecuniam debitam non ab ipso sibi sponte datam sine ullo judice tempore possidere, vel accipisse, isque sibi jus in eam rem dixisse, jus crediti non habebit.</hi> And <hi>Faber</hi> upon that Law doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently conclude, that this was a just supplement of the former Law: and <hi>Cujacius</hi> allows this remedy, not only to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but even to the privat party, for <hi>qui sibi jus dicit jus cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti non habebit,</hi> which implyes an annulling of the deed, <hi>quo ad privatum interesse.</hi> And <hi>Cujacius</hi> observes well that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty forced, <hi>potest condicere,</hi> and how can it be imagined, that the Law would ordain the extorter to be punished, and yet not restore that which was extorted, the publicks interest resulting only from the privat injury done to the Party, and as the Fisk uses not to pursue without an informer, so the privat party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, would not inform, nor concur, since he could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any reparation, and thus the Crime and injury would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unpunished: But even according to the <hi>l.</hi> 12. and 14. so much founded on, it is most clear, that they were not in the case of these Lawes, but on the contrary, that even by these Lawes, the foresaid principle is just, since restitution is still to be granted, <hi>ubi actori aliquid abest &amp; ubi damnum intervenit</hi>; but so it is, that in this case the pursuer is extreamly prejudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this disposition craved to be reduced, <hi>ex capite metus,</hi> since if it were reduced, he would easily defend himself against the alledged minut, upon many grounds then represented. It was also urged, that though in the restitution of Minors, the Law restores them only when they are Leas'd, since that reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is mainly introduced for their advantage; yet in reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>ex capite metus,</hi> the Law designs mainly, that no man should have advantage by his own oppression, nor no man be obliedged without his own consent, and so it rescinds the deed, though the party be not leas'd, and the edict it self sayes, <hi>quod metus causa gestum erit ratum non habebo,</hi> without
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:55274:173"/>
considering laesion, <hi>&amp; quod ratum non est, irritandum est,</hi> that is to say, is reduceable. And whereas it was pretended, that the former brocard, <hi>Spoliatus est ante omnia restituendus,</hi> did only hold where the thing was taken away, <hi>vi ablativa,</hi> because that could be easily proved, but not in deeds extorted, <hi>vi compulsiva,</hi> which force depending upon inward Acts of the mind, could not so easily be discovered, and could be easily mistaken.</p>
               <p>To this it was answered, that though those two differ in themselves, yet either of them infer restitution, as we see all alongs the Title, <hi>quod metus causa,</hi> and in the practice of our reductions, <hi>ex capite metus.</hi> In both which, deeds extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>vi compulsiva,</hi> are reduceable, and the persons injured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored against them, and since <hi>vis compulsiva,</hi> can infer more prejudice, then <hi>vis ablativa,</hi> since <hi>vis ablativa</hi> can only robb us of moveables, whereas <hi>vis compulsiva,</hi> can robb us of our estates; it were strange that the Law should not assist the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red persons, most where they may be most injured; nor can it be denyed, but that compulsion, falls as much under sense, and so can be as easily proved as a spuilzie can. For though it may be doubted whether some degrees of force, should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes infer restitution, yet the probation of these degrees, if once admitted, is alwayes easy.</p>

               <p>NOt only these who are the actual committers of crimes, but these by whose counsel, direction, or assistance, any crime is committed, are likewise punishable, else the Law might be easily eluded, and the chief contrivers might escape.</p>
               <p n="1">I. These who are assisters by counsel, or otherwayes, are in our Law said to be <hi>Art and Part</hi> of the crime, by <hi>Art</hi> is meant
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:55274:175"/>
that the crime was contrived by their art or skill, <hi>eorum arte</hi>; by <hi>part</hi> is meant, that they were sharers in the crime commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when it was committed, <hi>&amp; quorum pars magna.</hi> The Civilians used in place of <hi>Art and part, ope &amp; consilio:</hi> and these who assisted, and are art and part, are by our Law called <hi>Complices,</hi> which word is borrowed from the Doctors, for the call <hi>Consiliarios fautores &amp; instructores complices, Carer. pract. crim. §. homicidium, num.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p n="2">II. By the 151. Act, 11. <hi>Parl. I.</hi> 6. It it ordained, that nothing can be objected against the relevancy of that part of the Summonds, which bears, that the persons complain'd upon, are <hi>art and part of the crimes</hi> Libelled; by the relevancy of the Libel, our Law means that the Libel is <hi>rite libellatus.</hi> And I find the term relevant, used by the Doctors themselves, in the same sense that it is used by us: and thus <hi>Gail. l.</hi> 1. <hi>obs.</hi> 86. <hi>judex debet tantum admittere articulos relevantes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reason of the former Act is there rendered to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause diverse exceptions were formerly propounded against the relevancy of the Summonds, whereby parties were frustrat of justice; and it appears by that Act, that the pursuer was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the making of that Act, oblieged to Libel, that the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was accessory to the committing, and so guilty of the crime, in swa far as, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so was forced to condescend upon the manner of the accession, which seemed unjust to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because (as I conjecture) the accuser could not know all the accession, before the examination of the witnesses; for it is not lawful to witnesses, <hi>prodere testimonium,</hi> to declare what they will depon: and this made it impossible for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer to condescend exactly; whereas if he erred in exact Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the Pannel or defender was assoilzied, because the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not quadrat with the Libel. As for instance, if a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was accused for accession to the murder of one, in swa far as he gave direction to <hi>A. B.</hi> to kill him, possibly the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was guilty of accession, though not by giving direction;
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:55274:175"/>
yet by counselling <hi>A. B.</hi> or by directing <hi>P.</hi> or any other, to commit murder. In these and the like cases, the Pannel was guilty, and yet could not be condemned, because the Libel was not proved. Yet, upon the other hand, it seems hard, that such a general Libel as this, should be relevant; since it were as reasonable to Libel in general, that a person is guilty of murder, which generality would not be allowed: Likeas, the defender seems by this precluded of many defences, which would be competent to him, if the Libel were more special. And by the practice of other Nations, the Libel must conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend specially upon the manner and nature of the accession: But that which seems to me most inconvenient, is, that the Assizers are Judges to the relevancy of the condescendency, which infers art &amp; part. Albeit many questions, <hi>in jure,</hi> are there started, which are very intricat, and which have troubled the greatest and most accurate Doctors; for by our practique, the pursuer, who Libels art and part, will not be oblieged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend how the defender is art and part, or accessory to the Crime committed, as was found in the pursuit at <hi>Sinclars</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, against Captain <hi>Barclay:</hi> But the Libel being rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, when art and part is Libelled, the defender must go to the knowledge of an Inquest, and probation is thereupon led; in which many impertinent and irrelevant Interrogators are propounded; whereas, if the Justices were Judges to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levancy, no impertinent Interrogator would be allowed, since nothing could be interrogated, but what were found to depend necessarily upon the accession, which was found relevant. As also, after the probation is closed, the Advocats upon both sides are forced to debate the relevancy of the probation, and how far the accession is relevant; and here Laws, decisions, and Doctors, are alledg'd to Assizers, who understand neither. As for instance, if art and part of murder be Libelled, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the pursuer will interrogat if the witnesses heard the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der say, <hi>that it were no fault though the person who is killed were
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:55274:176"/>
stab'd,</hi> or approve the murder, after it was committed; upon which much debate might arise, for the defenders Procurators would contend that the Article was not relevant: And though the Justices did allow, or the Assizers did desire, that the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses should answer to these Interrogators, as they usually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all Interrogators, reserving the relevancy to be debated after probation is concluded; then a learned debate would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue before the Assizers, after closing of the probation, upon these points: So that the Assizers are against the intention even of our Law, Judges to the relevancy, and to the points of Law; by whose ignorance also the Liedges are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times much prejudged. But when the pursuer designs to have the relevancy of his condescendency judged by the Justices, he uses to Libel, that the defenders are art and part of the Crime Libelled, in so far as they gave order, or advised the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, <hi>&amp;c. quo casu,</hi> the relevancy of art and part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing specially condescended upon, is decided by the Justices, who are Judges to all that is in the Libel.</p>
               <p>Though it be sufficient to Libel generally, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices are art and part, yet the Libel must bear expresly who are complices; for it is not sufficient to Libel who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices generally, but their names and designations must be spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, <hi>K. Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 6. <hi>Act</hi> 76.</p>
               <p>Because the Assizers are Judges to the relevancy of Art and part, and that the debates made to the Assize are not upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, being only delivered, <hi>viva voce,</hi> therefore it is that there are but few decisions here adduced for clearing the relevancy of this part of the dittay.</p>
               <p>To the end that all the Leidges who may be assizers, may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what accession is relevant to infer a guilt, they will be pleased to understand, that one may be art and part by deeds preceeding the crime, either by counsel or command, <hi>consilio aut mandato,</hi> by deeds concomitating the Crime, as by help, or by countenancing, <hi>ope &amp; assistentia,</hi> or by deeds subsequent to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:55274:176"/>
the committing of the crime, as by ratihabiting or recepting, all which I shall treat separatly.</p>
               <p n="3">III. How far the advising, and counselling a man to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a crime, is punishable as an accession, and art and part of that crime, is thus resolved by the Doctors; if (say they) the committer of the crime, would have committed it howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and though he had not been advised thereto, then the adviser is not liable, so as to suffer the same punishment with the committer, but it is to be less severely punished: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if the committer of the crime would not have committed, and perpetrate the crime, if he had not received that advice, then the adviser and committer are equally to be punished, <hi>Clar. quest.</hi> 89. But I am not satisfied with this opinion, for since the adviser did all that in him lay, to have the crime committed, and that the effect followed, he is surely as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if he had committed it; seing in crimes we look to the design, and not to the event, <hi>in maleficiis spectatur volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas non exitus &amp; maleficia propositum distingut,</hi> at least the adviser is equally guilty, whether it had been committed, with, or without his advice, even as he had been guilty, in case of assistance, though the crime would have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without his assistance; nor is guilt spared by lessening: And it is impossible to know whether the committer would have committed it, without the advice and counsel given. Other Doctors are of opinion, that in atrocious crimes, the adviser and committer are equally punishable, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holds in Treason; but that in lesser crimes, the adviser is to be lesse severely punished then the actor: and this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I like better, and is more consonant to our Practique. In our Law advice and counsel comes under art, for advice is a species of contrivance and <hi>art</hi>; and therefore advisers may appear in our Law to be punishable, as the principal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, seing art and part is punishable, as the principal Crime with us; yet the Council uses to mitigat the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:55274:177"/>
where the crime is not atrocius: And the Judge should here consider, whether the adviser gave the counsel, upon the account of former malice, conceived by himself: or if it was only given in resentment of any wrong done to the committer, and he is to be more severely punished in the first case, then in the last. 2. In the case or advice, the advis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers age is much to be considered; for though Minors, and these who are drunk, may be punished for Murder, yet it were hard to punish them for advice. 3. The words in which the advice were conceived, should still be interpret most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable for the adviser, for words are capable of several, and distinct senses, accordingly as they are understood by the speaker; and words do vary by the accent, or punctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 4. If the adviser retreated his opinion, he ought not to be punisht, if he thereafter disswaded the committer: but some require, that <hi>eo casu,</hi> he do intimat to the person, against whom the advice was given, what danger he is in, for else the advice once given, may occasion the Murder, though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after disowned.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. He who gives order to commit a Crime, is in our Law, art and part of the Crime committed, as was found in <hi>Iohn Mackintoshes</hi> case, the 11. of <hi>May</hi> 1673. And is in the Civil Law punishable, in the same way and manner, with the Principal Party, whether that Principal, or chief Committer, would have committed the Crime or not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that <hi>mandat, nam quando mandatum cadit in delictum non queritur an mandatorius perse commississet Gomes. in §. penales just. de actionibus.</hi> And seing this distinction holds not, <hi>in mandato,</hi> I see no reason why it should hold, <hi>in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not only if one give order to commit the Crime, is he liable as art and part, but if he give order to do that which which is inseparably joined to the commission of it; and even if he give order to do that, which being unlawful in it
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:55274:177"/>
self, may produce the crime; and thus, if one give order to wound a man, it is thought, that if the person die of the wounds he receives, the giver of the mandat is guilty of the Murder, except the order be restricted to wound with a Stone, Club, or some such Weapon, as is not mortal; for in that case, the committer is only punishable, <hi>paena extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinaria,</hi> and by an arbitrary punishment, not reaching death, <hi>Clar. quest.</hi> 89. <hi>num.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>What words will infer a command, cannot be determined; but it was found in <hi>Mackintoshes</hi> case, that his desire to bring <hi>Druchdarg,</hi> who was killed, dead or alive, did not infer his being art or part of the Murder; for he having a Caption against <hi>Druchdarg,</hi> he might desire the Messenger, or his sons to pursue him, if he resisted the Caption. And yet if the words can import properly no other sense, then such as would infer a crime, the speaking of them will infer art and part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus <hi>Fraze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> of <hi>Culhockie,</hi> being pursued on the 9. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1675. for deforcing a Messenger, he was found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, because it was proved, that after he was apprehended by the Messenger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he cryed to his natural Son to come up and help him, and to give these men their reward; whereupon his natural Son did invade the Messenger, and he thereupon escaped. And in general, I think words should be very clear, and spoke too by a person, who hath previous malice, else they ought not to infer death, for words are oft spoke in jest, as when one of our Kings desired those of <hi>Caithness,</hi> to go and sup their Bishop in Broth.</p>
               <p>It is determined also by the Doctors, that if the giver of the mandat refer the committing of the crime to a third person, and he to a fourth; if the crime be committed by the third or fourth, that all of them are punishable, with the same punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Bald. in l.</hi> 1. §. <hi>nec autem, C. de cad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The command of the Magistrat, acting as a Magistrat, or a publick Person, excuses or defends the committer, from the ordinary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in atrocious crimes, and from all punishment in lesser crimes, <hi>l. quanquam &amp; l. quod principis ff. de aqua pluv. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend.</hi> A mandat given by a Master to his Servant, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses him from the ordinary punishment, when the crime is atrocious, and the Master is known to be cruel.

Cor. de siccar nihil interest oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidat quis an causam mortis praebeat,</hi> but this conclusion holds, only where the assister knew not, that the assistance he gave, tended to the commission of the crime; which knowledge is not presumed, but must be proved: This conclusion also holds, only where the assistance did influence the crime im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, but not in remote assistances, such as the lending of Armes, for remote assistance is only punishable <hi>paena extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinaria Menoch. de arbitr. cas.</hi> 349.</p>
               <p>Assistance given during the Commission of the crime is also punishable in the same manner as the principal crime, except the assistance given be very remote, or that the assister was ignorant, as if one should assist a person to drive away Cattel, which the driver said to be his own Cattel.</p>
               <p>It is here resolved by the Doctors, that he who was in Arms upon the place where the crime was committed, is repute an assister, if he stood very near the place, and was a known Enemy to the person killed, or a known Friend to the Committer, and had no business else in that place, at that time; or if the invader wax'd bolder, or the person invaded weaker by their presence: But if these or such like circumstances concur not, a meer by stander is not art and part. And I remember, that it was decided in the case of <hi>Iohn Mackintosh,</hi> that naked presence was not accession, <hi>si navabat operam rei licitae,</hi> as the assisting a Messenger; and in the case of a Baxter, who was pursued for the tumult, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1666. at which time, <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da assistentia,</hi> was not found punishable. And it is so ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for people to run together, where noise or confusion is, and the assistance is ofttimes too advantagious, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the weaker, or to seperat and red, as we say, both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that if were unfit, I as well as unjust, to punish meer by-standers: but this depends upon many circumstances, <hi>&amp;

               <p>These who kept the cloaths or baggage of the committers, are guilty of assistance, <hi>Ioh. de Annan,</hi> as are these also who hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered others to rescue the persons invaded.</p>
               <p>Assistance given after the Crime is committed, scarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the name of assistance, as <hi>Bartol.</hi> observes, <hi>ad l.</hi> 3. §. 51. <hi>quisquam ff. ad Sillan.</hi> And therefore the Laws of <hi>Millan</hi> do only inflict a pecuniary mulct in this case, as <hi>Menoch</hi> observes, <hi>cas.</hi> 349. And I have seen the Council inflict only an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry punishment upon him who assisted to make the escape of a person who had recently committed a murder. But in general, I approve <hi>Bartol</hi>'s Doctrine, who thinks, that whether the help and assistance was given before the committing, at the time of the commission, or after it, yet the assister is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as the chief actor, if the commission of the Crime was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved upon by both at the beginning, and before the Crime was committed, <hi>&amp; ita spes data auxilii ad evadendum dicitur auxilium ad maleficium committendum, Bartol. ad l. furti. ff. de furto,</hi> else the Crime is not punishable in him who assisted only after it was committed, as severely as in the chief actor. But the Doctors do not distinguish here, whether the Crime would have been committed by the principal party, though the assisters had denyed their help; yet does this lessen the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisters guilt, though it does not distinguish it, <hi>Clar. quest.</hi> 90. <hi>num.</hi> 7. and so lessens the punishment in many cases.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The ratifying a Crime is not punishable, according to the Doctors, in Crimes which are chiefly committed to satisfie the lust of the offender, as if one should ratifie the Adultery committed by another, meerly to affront the Husband, <hi>quo casu,</hi> the Doctors think, that the ratifier may be punished ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarly; but the ratifying Crimes which are chiefly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:55274:180"/>
to offend others, as Murder, Theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is punishable, if the Crime was committed by the actor, in the name of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifier, and if the ratifier knew it was committed in his name, when he did ratifie it; but except these two concur, Lawyers think that the ratifier is not punishable: and yet in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the approving or owning Crimes, seems to be of ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and therefore punishable in some degree, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of that excellent Law, <hi>l. si quis, §. qui Abortionis, ff. de paenis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By our custome, ratification, or ratihabition of a Crime, as we call it, falls not properly under art and part, no more then under the general word <hi>auxilium,</hi> except the ratifier had done some deed, or been in some accession to what was done before the Crime was committed, as was found in <hi>Mackintoshes</hi> case, 11. <hi>Iune</hi> 1673. For it were hard to infer a Crime from any words approving the deed, it being most ordinar for men to say <hi>it was well bestowed, or I am glad,</hi> when they heat of the murder of him whom they would not have killed, as <hi>Bart.</hi> observes; and therefore it seems not to be punishable by our Law, which punishes only either the Crime it self, or these who are art and part. And I remember, that when the Laird of <hi>Assint</hi> was pursued as accessory to the murder of <hi>Montrose,</hi> in swa far as he had at least ratihabited the Crime, having vaunted, that he had taken him Prisoner at his own house, <hi>&amp; jactatio, &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatio,</hi> were punishable, as <hi>Menoch</hi> observes, <hi>de arbitr. casu,</hi> 331. Yet the Parliament inclined not to punish him, if nothing else could be proved. But whatever may be said of ratihabiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in general, yet certainly, ratihabition of Treason, is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable as Treason; and it may be also contended, that the excepting of a reward by one, as if the Crime had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him, is punishable, since that reaches further than a naked ratihabition; so that certainly <hi>Assint</hi> had been punisht as a Traitor for that accession, if he had not been secured by an Act of Indemnity.</p>

                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:55274:180"/>IX. There remains yet two practical questions to be resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; The first is, whether such as are accessory can be pursued, till the chief actors be first discust, and either found guilty, or assoilzied. And that the chief or principal actors ought to be first discust, seems most reasonable, 1. Because it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of what is accessory, to follow, and not to preceed that to which it is accessory. 2. The principal party might have a defence, which the assister doth not know, at least cannot prove. As for instance, if a man be pursued as art and part of driving away Cattel, possibly he was but a servant to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who did drive them, and who, if he had compeared, had proved that the goods were his own; or if he were pursued as art and part of convocating the Liedges, or of rising in Arms; possibly if the principal convocator were pursued, he would alledge he had done so by warrand from Authority, and would produce his warrand, which none else could have in keeping. 3. By the opinion of <hi>Clar. quest.</hi> 90. <hi>num.</hi> 6. and other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, <hi>quando proceditur contra aliquem tanquam quod prestiterit auxilium delicto debet primo in processu constare principalem deliquisse.</hi> 4. By the 26 <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Book, Reg. Maj.</hi> entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Of the order of accusing Malefactors for Crimes,</hi> it is said, that the principal Thief should be pleaded and discust before him who commanded the same to be done, or before the reset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And in the 4. <hi>vers.</hi> of that <hi>Chap.</hi> it is generally said, and swa it is manifest, that the commander or resetter shall not be charged, till the principal doer be first convict by an Assize. From which words, and from the general Rubrick, it is clear, that this conclusion holds, not only in Theft, but in other Crimes. Likeas, <hi>Skeen</hi> in his Annotations upon these words, observes from this Text, that <hi>complices criminis non possunt accusa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to Theft, from the 83. <hi>Chap. quon. attach.</hi> Upon which Law a verdict fyling <hi>George Grahame,</hi> as receptor of Theft, was rescinded, by warrand from the Council, because the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Thief was not first discust. And as to all Crimes, by the 29. <hi>Chap. Stat. David</hi> 2. entituled, <hi>The complices should not be punished before the principal malefactor.</hi> It is also observable from the last <hi>vers.</hi> 26. <hi>chap. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Reg. Maj.</hi> that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal malefactor should be not only accused, but convict by an Assize, before the complices can be accused; so that it is not enough the principal actor be declared fugitive, which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise conform to <hi>Clar. quest.</hi> 90. <hi>num.</hi> 6. <hi>nam non sufficit,</hi> saith he, <hi>contumacia ficta,</hi> which answers to our denouncing fugitive, as I formerly observed. I find likewise that by the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the principal ought to be attained after verdict or confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or by outlawrie, before any judgement can be given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the accessory; but the principal must be surely kept until the accessory be attainted, <hi>Bolton cap.</hi> 24. <hi>num.</hi> 38.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding of all which, <hi>Charles Robertson</hi> being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued as accessory to the casting down of a house belonging to <hi>Iollie,</hi> which house was libelled to have been cast down by his sons and servants, at his command. The Justices found that he might be put to the knowledge of an Inquest, albeit the children and servants were not first discus'd, because the Act appointing a Libel to be relevant, bearing art and part, did abrogat the foresaid, 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 26. <hi>Chap. l.</hi> 4. <hi>R. M.</hi> since such as are pursued as art and part are all principals: And the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat alledg'd, that it were absurd that the King should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd by the absence of the principal party. To which it was answered, that the Act of Parliament, and the Law cited out of <hi>R. M.</hi> were in <hi>materia diversa,</hi> and very consistent, since the one determined only the manner of procedure, and the other what Libel was relevant, &amp; since that Act it was constantly found that the Thief behov'd to be punish'd before the Resetter, which shews the foresaid Law of the Majesty is not abrogated; nor
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:55274:181"/>
was the King prejudg'd, seing if the principal party were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd and denounced fugitive, the accessory might be proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against, but on the contrary, the Liedges would be much prejudged, if this order were not observed, for probation might be led against absents, <hi>eo casu,</hi> contrair to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law of the Nation. <hi>V. g.</hi> if <hi>A. B.</hi> were pursued as hounder out of <hi>C. D.</hi> to commit a Murder, probation behov'd to be led that <hi>C. D.</hi> committed the Murder, albeit absent, else the hounder out could not be punish'd, <hi>nam primo debet constare de corpore de licti:</hi> Nor can any man be guilty of houn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out, except where the Crime is committed. And it were not only against our Law, but against reason, to suffer Witnesses to be led for proving that the person who was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent committed the Crime: For in that case his greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may be led as Witnesses, and his strongest defences may be omitted; and though the probation led against him in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence will not be concluding, yet <hi>semper gravat famam,</hi> and leaves still a disadvantagious impression.</p>
               <p>In this case it was likewise found, that ratihabition of a Crime might be inferred from the said <hi>Charles Robertson</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting the committers of the Crime, though they were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declared fugitives, nor Letters of Intercommuning against him: And his saying these words, <hi>They did too little, and I wish that they had taken a Collop out of his Cheek,</hi> was a ratifying of the Crime, since the Crime was committed by his own sons and servants.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The second Question is, whether the complices, and such as are art and part of a Crime, should be punished by the punishment due to the principal Malefactor? That they should, seems clear by the <hi>Act</hi> 151. <hi>Parl.</hi> 12. <hi>K. I.</hi> 6. where the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel bearing art and part, is ordained to be found relevant, which implyes, that art and part should inferr the punishment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Libel; for that is only relevant which can inferr the conclusion. 2. It is said, <hi>cap.</hi> 38. <hi>quon. attach.</hi> and then
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:55274:182"/>
it shall be conform to that which is said, <hi>Consenters and doers should be punished with the same pain.</hi> 3. By constant custome in all Criminal Courts, art and part is punished as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Crime. Notwithstanding of all which, I think, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said conclusion very rigorous, for <hi>paena est commensuranda de licto</hi>; and to punish the more and the less guilty equally, seems against nature and justice: And by the Laws of all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the opinion of all Doctors, accessions are punishable according to their proportional degrees of guilt; and albeit the Act above cited, sustains the Libel, yet it ordains not the punishment of art and part, to be the same with the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the principal offenders; but though the Act did bear the same expresly, yet by the opinion of the Doctors, a Statute, bearing that such as are accessory shall be pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It would therefore seem just, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Justices, or parties, should make application to the Councel, and interpose that the punishment should be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigat according to the degrees of the guilt, as the custom now is, but that the Justices should have an innate power to propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion the punishment to the guilt proved; for none can understand so well the nature of the guilt, as the justices who hear the probation: and it is hard that the poor Pannel should lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der so great hazard, as to be exposed to a capital sentence, whereas it may be the Council will not sit so soon, as that he may interpose with them.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">I. Jurisdiction may be defined to be, a publick power granted to a Magistrat to cognosc upon, and determine Causes, and to put sentences following thereupon in execution, in such way and manner as either his commission, Law, or practique do allow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:55274:185"/>Jurisdiction was by the Civil Law divided <hi>in merum impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, mixtum imperium, &amp; jurisdictionem simplicem. Merum, imperium est abere potestatem gladii ad animadvertendum in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinerofos, &amp; potestatas etiam appellatur, Mixtum imperium est potestas qua jure proprio Magistratui competit cui jurisdictio in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haeret &amp; inest, &amp; dicitur mixtum quia cum jurisdictione est con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctum. Iurisdictio simplex differt secundum Bartolum a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to imperio in hoc, quod imperium mixtum expediatur judicis nobili officio, jurisdictio judicis ordinario.</hi> With us the Justices have only a criminal Jurisdiction, the Lords of Session and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missars, a meerly civil Jurisdiction, Lords of Regality, and Sheriffs a mixt Jurisdiction, partly Civil, partly Criminal. But in all Jurisdictions, though meerly civil, there is still an innat power, to punish even criminally, such as offend and disturb even the Civil Jurisdiction. Thus the Lords may ordain such as strike any in the Parliament House whilst they sit, or falsify Papers produced before them, or abuse any of their own number, to be degraded, or banished, or to pay a Fyne, or to have their Tongue bored, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the nature and merit of the offence. For in Law, when any power is granted, every thing is also granted which is necessary for explicating or executing that power.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Jurisdiction is divided likewise, in <hi>ordinariam &amp; delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi> and here it may be doubted, whether the power of Judging crimes which is <hi>merum imperium</hi> can be delegat? according to the Civil Law it could not, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; l.</hi> 70. <hi>ff. de regulis juris,</hi> and seing crimes are of so great concernment, that <hi>industria personae in electiono judicis respicitur,</hi> there is no reason why they should be cognosced by Deputs. Ordinary commissions with us, also bear a power of delegation which were unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry if the power of delegation were inhaerent naturally in Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. And albeit I have seen Justice deputs delegat others to represent them in the Justice Court, yet this practice seems to want both warrand and reason. And it is observed by
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:55274:185"/>
                  <hi>Craig, pag.</hi> 192. that <hi>potestatem gladij qui ab alio quam a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe habet nemo potest delegare:</hi> and by <hi>Balfour, cap.</hi> 63. that a Barron cannot delegat any person to judge in the matter of blood, except the said power be specially allowed him. But the Law allows even to Deputs, though they have no power, to delegat others, a power to appoint another to judge for them in cases of necessary absence, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. de off. ejus cui mand.</hi> which Lawyers do also allow, <hi>ex paritate rationis,</hi> to such as are sick, <hi>Bart. ibid.</hi> and the reason of both is, least the Common-wealth suffer by their absence or sicknesse, for it is necessary that crimes be presently tryed.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Jurisdiction is divided by our Law, <hi>in cumulativam</hi> (for so we call that Jurisdiction which is competent to several Judges, and whereby they may preveen one another, and thus Sheriffs, and Barrons have a cumulative Jurisdiction in blood weits) <hi>&amp; privatam</hi> (for so we call that Jurisdiction which is competent peculiarly to any one Judge.) This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is used very much in our Law, and especially by <hi>Craig, pag</hi> 192. who layes it down as rule, that <hi>omnis curia delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur tantum cumulative, sed nunquam privative; non est enim quasi translatio juris ex una persona in alium sed tantum mandata juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictio quae non obstante jurisdictione sive mandato ad huc rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net in delegante nec minus dominus post juvestituram vassallo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam retinet jurisdictionem &amp; curiam quam antea.</hi> And thus albeit His <hi>Majesty</hi> grant commission to a Sheriff, yet he oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appoints other Deputs, as Mr. <hi>William Wallace</hi> in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> Sir <hi>Gilbert Stewart</hi> in the Sherifdom of <hi>Perth.</hi> And it was found, that though a prelat had appointed an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Bailiff, yet he was not thereby excluded from sitting himself, although he was thereby excluded from appointing any other heretable Bailiff; as is observed by <hi>Hadd.</hi> 1. <hi>February</hi> 1610.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Jurisdiction is said to be prorogat, when a defender does willingly submit to the judicatur before which he is cited,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:55274:186"/>
though otherwayes not altogether competent, <hi>&amp; affirmare ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium,</hi> is to submit to a Judicatory altogether incompetent.</p>

FOr understanding who is Judge competent in general, to punish crimes, and what founds his competency; or as the Civil Law and Doctors speak, <hi>quod est forum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petens</hi>; it is fit to know, that he who commits a crime, may be judged either in the place where the crime was committed, which they call, <hi>forum delicti commissi,</hi> or in the place where he was born, which is called <hi>forum originis,</hi> or in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The place where the fault was committed, is of all the three the most competent, for it is most just and fit, that crimes should be punished where they were committed, that others who have seen the crime, may by that punishment be
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:55274:187"/>
deterred from committing the like; and that the parties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured may be somewhat repair'd, by seeing the Law justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng their wrong; and in the place where the crime was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, accusers can most easily attend, and probation can be soonest and best heard, <hi>Act</hi> 6. <hi>P.</hi> 6. <hi>I.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Not only where the crime it self was fully committed, may it be tryed, but where any part of it was committed; and therefore a thief may be judged, not only where he first broke the House, but by the Judge of that place where he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the things stoln, <hi>Carleval de judiciis, pag.</hi> 156. But the Judge of the place where he was taken, can only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against the thief in that case, if he be present, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cite him if he be absent; wheras the Judge of the place where the House was broke, may cite him though he be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: And if the Judge of the place where the House was broke, or the thing was first stoln, pleases, he may require the other to remit him, or send him back to him to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But this last would not hold in our practice; for with us, wherever a thief is taken with a fang, he may be hang'd; nor is that Judge oblieged to send him back, except either in the case of prevention, or repledgiation.</p>
               <p>There are some crimes which may be comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The other case is, when the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:55274:187"/>
crime is begun in one place, and perfected in another, only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the committer, as if a man in one Territory should stand and shoot one in another; in which case, the Judges of both Territories a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tted in another place; and in that case, <hi>Clar. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</hi> and others, are of opinion, that the crime should be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only in the place where the crime was consumat, because it is not the giving of the mandat, or order to commit the crime, but it is the commission of the crime which infers the guilt: But I crave leave to differ from them, and to think that other Judge is competent, and that because oft-times the giving of a mandat, or order to commit a crime, is of it self a crime; and because he who gave the order, having offended the Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction where he lived, he ought there to be punished, and the crime committed in the other place, not being his own who gave the order, but because of the order: it must therefore be drawn back to the order, and so he ought to be punished in the place where he gave the order, which should the rather hold with us, that the giving order is art and part, and so is in our Law punishable in the same way, as the principal crime.</p>
               <p>If any man commit a crime, in the confines of two several Jurisdictions, or Territories, he may be punished in either, though some Lawyers are so subtile, as to conclude, that if a man be murdered in the confines of two Jurisdictions, the murder ought to be tryed in that Jurisdiction, within which the head of the murdered man fell; but if the committer of the crime dwell also in either of the Territories, or if the Judge of either of the Territories be founded upon any other ground of competency, then that Judge who is so founded doublely,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:55274:188"/>
ought to be preferred, <hi>quia duo vincula magis stringunt Decian tract. crim. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p n="2">II. So well founded is the Judge of the place, where the crime was committed, as to his competency, that some <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Souldiers having in <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. killed a man in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> the Justices here were found Judges competent, though it was alledged that they being Souldiers, could only be tryed by a Council of War; and being <hi>English</hi> Souldiers under <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> pay, and a part of the <hi>English</hi> Army, they could only be tryed in <hi>England,</hi> all which was repelled, because the crime was committed here; and it was strange why any of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> did think this hard, since they had execute Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> though a Queen: and the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> though an Ambassadour, for alledged Treasons committed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reason why the Judges of that place where the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent dwells, is Judge competent to the tryal of the cri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> is, because it is fit that the Judge purge his own Land, and Territory, of evil doers and malefactors, lest they affect others by their example, or fall themselves to commit the like crimes there also; and the reason why he who is Judge of the place where the malefactor was born, is Judge competent, is because the malefactor may and will probably return to the place of his Nativity, and it is most reasonable that a man may be Judged as to his life, where he first received life; and Judges ought to consider the life and conversation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, which none can do so well, as <hi>judex domicilii:</hi> And therefore these two, <hi>domicilii &amp; originis,</hi> are still equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat in the Law, and what founds the Jurisdiction of the one, founds ofttimes the Jurisdiction of the other, and their joynt competency may be understood by these conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</p>
               <p>First, the Judge of the place where a man dwells, or was born, may beyond all controversie, proceed to take tryal of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:55274:188"/>
the crime committed within their own Territory, if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be found within the Territory. 2. If he be not found, some think they can proceed if the crime was not committed in their own Territory, but others do more justly distinguish, thus, that either he is pursued by way of accusation, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a private party, and then <hi>judex domicilii,</hi> is compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but that neither of these Judges can proceed to enquire into a crime committed without their own Territory; and though the first part of this distinction be very just, because an accuser has alwayes election where to pursue, yet the last part of it may be justly controverted, for these reasons, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every Judge should endeavour to cleanse his own Land of Malefactors who dwell there, and who may either infect his people, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> commit the like crimes, as was said formerly. 2. It would incourage the committers of crimes, if they might go out of their own Territories, and commit crimes elsewhere, and could not be punished upon their return by the Magistrat where they live, whereas it is probable, that the poor party injured could not follow them to a place so far distant. 3. We see that fathers do, and are obliedged to punish their children for faults done by them, even without their own family: And a Judge is in Law instead of a father to his own people, and should endeavour that they keep themselves free of all guilt. 4. <hi>Per. l.</hi> 1. <hi>C. ubi de crim. dicitur quaestiones posse institui a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud judicem loci ubi ipsa commissa sunt, aut loci ubi reus ad est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And with us, Criminal pursuits are sustained at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Procurator Fiskal of the Territory where a man dwels, for crimes committed without the Territory, though no privat party inform.</p>
               <p>I find likewise that <hi>Calderas</hi> does distinguish thus, if (sayes he) both the place where the crime was committed, and the place where the delinquent dwells, be under the same Prince, though the Jurisdictions be under different privat Judges, and the privat Territories be different; Yet the Judge of that
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:55274:189"/>
place where the Delinquent dwells, may proceed to try a crime committed without his own territory, though the party injured do not insist.</p>
               <p>Against which distinction, though it be more plausible then the other distinction, yet the former argument do likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
               <p>The third conclusion is, that the Judges of the place where the Malefactor dwells, may proceed against him, not only if they find him present, but though he be absent, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; authen, qua in provincia C. ubi de crim.</hi> and by the customs of <hi>Castil,</hi> and <hi>Naples, Carlev. num.</hi> 747. and thus the Lords sustained an improbation against <hi>Burghtown</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1672. though the deed forged concerned an <hi>Irish</hi> Estate, and though <hi>Burgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town</hi> dwelt then in <hi>Ireland,</hi> though he was cited in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

By the Cannon Law, and in all the Romish Church, as Ecclesiastick person cannot be in the first instance juged by the secular Judge; but though this subject might afford matter of curious inquiry, yet I will not dip into it, since the Parliament did in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1662. find that Mr. <hi>Iames Guthry</hi> might be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Parliament in the first instance, for words spoken by him in Pulpit. And as a Minister, albeit he alledged that this Doctrine should have been tryed, first by a Church Judicatur, for the Parliament thought that this might give too great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to Ministers, and might encourage them by adhering no
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:55274:189"/>
one another, to enveigh against, and disturb the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at their pleasure: for if Eclesiastick persons could not be Judged by the secular power, till first the Church Judicaturs did consider the Doctrine; then if these Church Judicaturs did approve the Doctrine, it could not thereafter be found Treason, or any other crime.</p>

               <p>Prevention may be made, either by the Judge, or by the Party. And prevention is not inferred by raising of a Libel without citation, <hi>Decian: lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. but it is inferred by a citatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, or by the first citation in writ, where moe citations are requisit and by apprehending the Malefactor, because, as <hi>Carleval. de judiciis, num.</hi> 881. observes, deeds are stronger pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions then word or writ.

               </p>
               <p>It seems that the allowed and stated deeds, from which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is inferred by our Law, are only these which are enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated by the 29. <hi>Act</hi> 11. <hi>Parl.

When the one does at the same time use a real,

                  </gap>etended, that Judges would be thus incouraged to take Malefactors, which is a greater benefit, then the citing them is; Yet I think it is the duty of all Judges, to concur to take Malefactors, though ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by other Judges; and yet by the foresaid Statute, the Judge who apprehends the Malefactor, before the other cite him, does preveen the citer.</p>
               <p>It is agreed to by the Doctors, that when two competent Judges do both proceed to a tryal, and both are equally founded in their Jurisdiction and diligence, that then he who pursues for the greatest crime, ought first, to proceed in his try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, because the Common-wealth is more concerned to have a great crime punished, then a small crime, which they extend not only where the crimes are different, but even where the one is aggradged by more atrocious circumstances then the other; as if the one should pursue for wounding, and the other for wounding in the night, or in an ambush, <hi>Boss. hoc. tit. num.</hi> 102. And he who preveens by citing one of many complices, doth preveen <hi>quo ad</hi> all. As also he who once cites him who gave order to commit a crime, doth likewise preveen all Judges, <hi>quo ad</hi> the Committer.

               <p n="1">I. Since the Parliament is the Supream Judicatory, it may certainly cognosce all Causes, in the first instance. And of old, if a person accused for treason did absent himself, the Criminal Court, not no other Inferiour Court could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to take tryal by probation against him, and so all they could do, was only to denounce him fugitive for his absence, upon which denounciation his escheat did only fall, but he could not be forefeited; and therefore since it was unjust that he should by his own absence procure to hims<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lf an impunity and exemption from forefeiture, the Parliament did by their supream power cite the person guilty, to appear before them, and did lead probation in absence against him, and forefeit him in absence, though guilty. But it being found inconvenient that Parliaments behooved either to be called, or such Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents pass unpunished, therefore by the 11. <hi>Act</hi> 2. <hi>Parl. Ch.</hi> 1.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:55274:191"/>
It is Statuted, that the Justices may proceed to try Crimes by probation, even when the person cited is absent; <hi>in cases of treasonable rising in Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and open and manifest rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Majesty, or his Successours and their Authority:</hi> so that the Parliament are yet only Judges to the tryal of all Crimes by probation against absents, except only Perduellion, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> open and manifest treason. And albeit it may seem strange that the Justices should have been allowed to lead probation against absents, in this which is the greatest of Crimes, and not in Crimes of lesser importance; yet this proceeded from the just detestation which the Parliament had of this Crime, and that the punishment thereof might not be delayed, where the delay might prove so dangerous.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If the Parliament forefeit any person after cognition of the Cause, their sentence cannot be quarrelled by any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Judge, <hi>Act</hi> 39. <hi>Parl.</hi> 11. <hi>K.

But yet since Decreets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by Commissioners of Parliament, are reputed with us Decreets of Parliament, and since Decreets pronounced by Commissioners, for valuation of Teinds, are not reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, because these Decreets are repute Decreets of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being pronounced by such Commissioners of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it seems that Decreets pronounced by such Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, in Crimes, after probation, could not be quarrelled and reduced by the Session, or other Inferiour Judicatories.</p>

is regulated by His <hi>Majesties</hi> Privy Council, in which the Chancelor is President, if he be present, but in his absence, the President of the Council precedes. This Office of Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Council is a distinct imployment, and it gives him the precedency from all the Nobility. The number of this Judicator is not definit, depending upon His <hi>Majesties</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, but all the Officers of State are Members of it, <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one officii,</hi> it has its own Signet, and its Letters past by a Bill, subscribed by any one of the Council: upon which warrand, the Letters are in their several forms, extended and subscribed by the Clerk of the Council; and they bear also to be, <hi>ex deliberatione Dominorum Secreti Consilii,</hi> they must be execute, at least upon six free dayes, and a full Copy must be given, because all dyets here are peremptor, and not with continuation of dayes; the reason whereof, is, <hi>ut reus veniat instructus ad defendendum,</hi> whereas before the Session, a short Copy is sufficient, because the Summonds is given out to see, and a time allowed to answer: The dyets are here so peremptory, that if the defender be cited to a day, whereupon the Council sits not, if he appear at the day, to which he is cited, and take Instruments at the Council Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he will not be thereafter oblieged to attend, nor can he be denounced Fugitive for being absent; for seeing it is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory against him, it is reasonable that it should be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory for him.</p>
               <p>Where many parties are cited as defenders, upon a Bill to the Council, any one or two will be allowed to answer for the rest, they finding caution, and enacting themselves to be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for whatever shall be discerned against those, for whom they undertake; which priviledge is granted if no personal punishment be concluded against the defenders; but if either the complaint conclude, or that the crime will in Law infer a corporal punishment; then the offering to find caution to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, will not be allowed, <hi>nam noxa caput sequi debet,</hi> and no

               </p>
               <p>The Council by the first constitution, were only to take cognizance of what concerned the publict Peace, and were neither Judges in civil cases, nor crimes, but in so far as these impinged upon, or were violations thereof: but now that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator doth under the notion of Riots, and breaches of the publict Peace, hear to many causes Civil and Criminal. But seeing the design of this Treatise, aimes only to illustrat our criminal Law; I shall only-consider the procedor of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in so far as they can cognosce upon crimes.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The most ordinar crimes which are punished by the Council, are these, which we call Riots in our Law. A Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot is a breach of the Peace, committed by oppression, or wronging His <hi>Majesties</hi> Lieges, by force and violence; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances whereof, are the dispossessing any of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Subjects, by a convocation of the Liedges, or otherwise; the affronting of Magistrates, by raising tumults against them, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For the better understanding of which crime, it will be fit to consider, that <hi>jura maxime oderunt violentias &amp; rapinas &amp; pluribus modis succurrant vim passis &amp; spoliatis,</hi> for here the publick is wounded, in breaking its Peace, and privat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are wronged, by the prejudice done. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the Law hath furnisht more remedies against this, then any other crime; for either it may be pursued civilly, <hi>per in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdictum
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:55274:197"/>
unde vi,</hi> so call'd from the first words of the Edict, which runs thus; <hi>unde vi tu illum dejecisti terestituere cogam,</hi> which interdict, restor'd only the possession of immoveables; wheras moveables being spoilzied, were craved back, <hi>actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vibonorum. Iustinian,</hi> also introduced, that he who rest, and violently took what was his own, should lose it, <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>C. unde vi,</hi> for in this the resumer usurps the power of the Magistrat, whose ministry is requisit, in inverting the present possession. The Canon Law likewise hath introduced, <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium, cap. redintae grandae</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>quest.</hi> 1. and <hi>Menoch</hi> relates 17. remedies, and <hi>Philip. Franc.</hi> 24. for recovery of possession; and seeing the thing possest, is still presumed to belong to the possessor; and that hardly the right of move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables can be otherwise proved, then by possession: the Law did most reasonably, both for securing Property, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing Violence, establish that great rule, that <hi>Spoliatus est ante omnia restituendus,</hi> and conform thereto, the Council (who are never Judges to Property, but only to Possession, so that in effect, all their sentences, are interdicts) do still restore the possession to the person ejected; and likewise pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish arbitrarly the violence committed, for we have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Statute taxing the punishment. By the Law of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> it is accounted no Riot, or routs except three at least were present, and that something was done, <hi>ad terrorem po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli,</hi> for breaking of the Peace, <hi>Bolton. cap.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The two ordinar defences, which are propon'd against riotous ejections, are, that by a Writ it was lawful, and agreed upon betwixt parties, that the defender might have ejected the pursuer, if he removed not at the day appointed, which will defend against a Riot: and yet <hi>Craig</hi> relates a case, <hi>P.</hi> 198. where one who had granted a Tack only for a Year, having ejected the Tacks-man, after expiring of that Year, was pursued, <hi>actione unde vio,</hi> in an action of ejection, and was forced to transact, albeit he contended, that the word
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:55274:198"/>
(only) was exclusive of any future possession; but where by expresse paction, it is declared lawful for him who enters, to enter <hi>brevi manu,</hi> without processe, or hazard of ejection; it would appear, that this paction is unlawful, seeing no man can warrand violence, and this seems as unlawful, as if one should oblidge himself, never to pursue for any injury to be done him: which paction, the Law declares expresly unlawful, <hi>&amp; nemo potest renunciare juri publico,</hi> and this were to allow privat persons the power of Jurisdiction: Nor can it be thought, but this paction was extorted; and albeit the party injured, were excluded by this paction, yet His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat may certainly pursue, <hi>vindictam publicam,</hi> if oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition was made, and violence used: Notwithstanding of which, I remember that the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> having obtained a Decreet of removing against <hi>George Campbel,</hi> and it being suspended till the next Term, The Lords ordained it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert in the Bill, that the Earl might eject him, <hi>brevi manu,</hi> the next day after the Term, by his own authority; but the Earl was Sheriff here himself, and so his Jurisdiction was only prorogat, and the Law is expresse, that <hi>privatus potest ex consensu prorogare jurisdictionem ejus qui aliqualem habet, sed non potest privatus consensus tribuere jurisdictionem ei qui nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam habet vid. Hanc quaestionem, apud</hi> Bart. <hi>ad l. creditores, C. de pign. &amp; hipoth.</hi> But here also, the Lords warrand to eject, was a delegating of their own Jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>I conceive also, that where there is no violence, nor opposition made, the voluntar consent may allow the ejection, especially in a Master, towards his own Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, who hath a natural Jurisdiction in that case; and that his ejection is also allowable, if the Tennent after compt, oblidge himself to remove, and declare that it shall be lawful to his Master to enter, <hi>brevi manu,</hi> if he pay not what is declared to be due; for there the preceeding compt, is equivalant to a declarator, and the party ejected is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:55274:198"/>
otherwise then by his own not payment: And therefore the Lords, the 19. of <hi>December</hi> 1661. found not the Countesse of <hi>Murray</hi> lyable to aspoilzie, for ejecting <hi>Dewer</hi> her Tennent, because <hi>Dewer</hi> had by a compt declared that he was debitor, in such a sum, and by a bond oblidged himself to remove, betwixt and a particular day, and if he fail'd, declared it should be lawful for the Countess to enter, <hi>brevi manu,</hi> to the possession. By the Civil Law, he who violently intromitted, even with what was his own, lost thereby his property in it.</p>
               <p>The next defence is, that the pursuer had immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, possest himself violently, and it was lawful for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, to recover his possession, <hi>ex incontinenti, nam vim vi licet repellere,</hi> and the Law sustains this defence, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 9. <hi>&amp; l.</hi> 17. <hi>ff. eod.</hi> and explains that to be, <hi>ex incontinenti fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum quod factum est priusquam ad aliud negotium fuerit reces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,</hi> what time should be allowed for repelling violence, is arbitrary to the Judge; for violence committed by a great man, requires more time for reparations to redress it, then when it is committed by a privat person, for friends must be convocat, and arms prepared, as <hi>Bart.</hi> and the <hi>Glos.</hi> instances upon the former Law: But in personal injuries, <hi>id tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum diciturex incontinenti fieri quod fit in ipso flagranti cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. The violent ejection of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Liedges, out of their possession, is pursued, either by an action meerly civil, which in moveables is called spoilzie in Lands ejection (which the Civil Law terms still, <hi>dejectio &amp; non ejectio</hi>) or criminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Riot, which is a mixt action, partly civil, partly criminal. When spoilzies, or ejections are civilly pursued, the conclusion is violent profits (which is the double Rent of the Lands, and restitution of the thing craved: But when this is pursued as a Riot, the punishment is arbitrary, as is also the criminal punishment, The civil action prescribes in three Years, K. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. But the action of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:55274:199"/>
ryot or Criminal Action prescribes not; and yet it may be doubted, if these Actions prescribe not, <hi>quo ad,</hi> the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of restitution, seing that is a civil conclusion; and it may be debated, that the maxim, <hi>spoliatus ante omnia est restituen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> loses its vigor after that time, so that one pursued for a ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otous ejection, or spoilzie, may alledge that no ryot can be concluded, seing the thing or land controverted was his own. We shall speak of the Criminal pursuite in its own place.</p>
               <p>Whether the one of these actions doth exclude the pursuer from all other reparations, so that he who pursues the action of spoilzie, or ejection, cannot thereafter pursue a ryot, or a criminal pursuit, may be controverted; and the Civil Law decides it thus, that <hi>quando &amp; una &amp; altera tendunt ad vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam tunc una agitur ad vindictam altera vero ad prosecutionem rei familiaris:</hi> and thus the having obtained a Decreet of eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, impeds not the pursuer to intent an action or Criminal pursuit; but after a Decreet obtained for the ryot, a criminal pursuit cannot be intented for these, <hi>respiciunt vindictam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. The Council cognoses likewise upon Crimes, by way of precognition, which they do in two cases, 1. Where consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable persons are interested in the crimes committed, as Noble men, or Clanns, where there is a hazard of alimenting the feuds, by remitting the criminals to the ordinary course of Justice: Wherefore to prevent future resentments, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment old differences, the Council <hi>in quorum tutela est pax publica,</hi> cognosce upon the crime, and remit much of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rigor.</p>
               <p>The 2. case is, when the crime is so ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cumstantiat, that it requires <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and lessening of the ordinary punishment: The formes in precognitions are, that either the friends of the parties give in a Bill to the Council (which cannot be granted but <hi>in praesentia</hi>) deducing the case, and represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what danger is like to ensue, <hi>quo casu,</hi> Letters are direct, ordaining the other party to be cited, and both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arties to cite
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:55274:199"/>
such witnesses, and probation, as they will use, or else if no application be made, the Council ordains Letters to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, citing both parties. His Majesty having with consent of Parliament appointed that the Justice-court should be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by many of the Lords of Session, did, because of their number and ability, discharge all precognition in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; and yet because these precognitions were not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in the Commission granted to the Council, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil did sustain themselves Judges competent to precognitions, their Commission bearing to be as full, and to give them as much power as any former Council had. But really it were happy for this Nation, that we wanted all precognitions, since thereby the Delinquent has power to choose such dyets as he pleases, and so may pursue his precognition when he knows the witnesses who could prove his guilt are absent, or may prevail with them to absent themselves for some time; and this is ordinarily practized. Nor have I ever seen any who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued a precognition brought to condigne punishment; and whereas it is pretended that there are some cases wherein the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of Law ought to be remitted, upon the considerations of lessening circumstances, wherein equity may be allowed to blunt the edge of Justice. It is answered, that this may be done by the Justices, either upon a special commission for try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the merits of the Pannels pretences, or alter that the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have heard all that will be legally urged by either party, in a full tryal they may delay the execution, and make report to his Majesty of the just state of the case.</p>
               <p>The Council likewise sometimes inflict punishments without recognition, by way of citation, as in the case of <hi>Giles Thyre English-man,</hi> who being incarcerat as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory to the death of Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> in <hi>Lieth,</hi> and as guilty of Adultery with Mistris <hi>Hamiltoun,</hi> wife to the said <hi>Bedford, Thyre</hi> did upon a petition to the Council, wherein he confest the Adultery, but denyed the murther, (which
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:55274:200"/>
Mistris <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> had likewise at her death acquit him of) obtain himself banished, without being put to the knowledge of an Inquest, by whom he had certainly dyed, as guilty of notour Adultery, 1665.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Council name likewise Assessors to the Justices before the tryal, these the Grecian Lawyers call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, And sometimes they discharge or continued yets.</p>
               <p>After sentences also, the Council, upon application made to them, do either mitigat the punishment, not only where it is arbitrary, but even where it is statutory, as in the case of <hi>Brown,</hi> whom they ordained only to pay 100. Merks, though she was found guilty of nottour adultery, which is death by our Law. Sometimes they ordain no sentence to follow upon the verdict of an inquest, as in the case of <hi>Purdy,</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for Usury, in so far as he had taken Anualrent a month before the term of payment, upon his Debtors voluntar of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; And sometimes they ordain some of their own number to revise the processe and verdict; Which Assessors do ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse the whole Process, and ordain it to be torn out of the Criminal Registers, as in the case of <hi>George Grahame,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pursued for theft; it was alledged that the Assize had found him guilty of recept, and so the verdict was found dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conform to the Libel, and consequently the whole process was null. Yet when Mr. <hi>William Somervel</hi> was found guilty of Murder, upon the deposition of one witnesse, the Council re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to review the verdict, as unwarrantable; for they found that they could not quarrel an Assize, which condemned, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Assizers can only be quarrelled for error, when they assoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie. And when his Advocat cited to them the 47. <hi>Act. Par.</hi> 6. K. <hi>Ia.</hi> the 3. Whereby it is ordered, that where a party finds himself grieved by an Assize, by partial malice, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it shall be lawful to him to cite them before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and if the error be proved, the party shall be restored to
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:55274:200"/>
the condition he was in before the sentence. To this it was answered, that this Act speaks only of Civil cases, and that by the Council here, is meant the Session: To which it was replyed, the Rubrick and Act are general, and treats of all persons wronged, <hi>&amp; qui totum dicit nihil excipit:</hi> And the reason of the Law is comprehensive of both. — From all this some do conclude, that if the Justices erre in judging the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levancy, or if the Assize find that proved which was not remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, that in either of these cases the Council may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the sentence, but that they cannot quarrel the sentence, upon the accompt that the verdict is not sufficiently warranted by the probation.</p>
               <p>Sometimes also the Justices are concluded by the Decreet of the Secret Council, which is repeated to the Assize as full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; So that the Justices have only the execution of their sentence remitted to them: Thus <hi>Fleeming</hi> was convict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council, of having uttered most disdainful speeches against the King, and therefore was remitted to the Justices to be examplarly punished; and upon production of their Decreet (which Decreet is still exprest in the dittay) he was hanged, 17. <hi>May,</hi> 1615.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. If the Law cannot receive full execution and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>via ordinaria,</hi> by the Criminal sentence, then the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil upon production of Letters of Horning, following upon any Criminal sentence, and duely execute and registrat, use to grant Letters of Intercomuning, whereby all His Majesties Liedges are prohibit to intercomune with any of the Rebels so denounced; which Letters must be published at all the Mercat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crosses of the Shyrs, and Jurisdictions within which such persons reside, whose intercomuning is suspected, and registrat there: And if need be, the Council will likewise grant a commission for Fire and Sword, to such persons as they will name, against the persons who are disobedient in the Criminal Letters, as said is: And ordinarly this commissions of Fire and Sword
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:55274:201"/>
are given to the persons interested, which occasions many great abuses. And these commissions are sometimes granted against parties who were never cited, but upon a naked complaint exhibit to the Council, which is most irregular.</p>
               <p>The Council do sometimes grant commission to bring in parties dead or alive, and that upon naked Petitions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous tryal, as they did against the Laird of <hi>Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baith,</hi> upon a Petition, wherein it was represented, that he had run away with the publick money delivered to him by the Shire, for paying their Cesse and Excise; But this seems hard, and it were to execute a free Subject before he be heard, or sentence pronounced against him: for these privat petitions may be most unwarrantably founded.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. If any person keep out his House in Garrison against his Majesty, the Council first uses to issue out Letters against him, to deliver up his house, under pain of treason; and they ordain a Herauld to go and summond him for that effect, and if he refuse, they ordain him to be processed before the Justice-general, and do immediatly, before any criminal sentence, grant a commission of Fire and Sword against him, as in the case of <hi>Burgie, Iune,</hi> 1668.</p>
               <p>They used likewise of old to ordain Noble-men and others, who could not be apprehended by Captions, for civil Debts, to deliver up their persons in any of his Majesties Castles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pain of treason; which though, it be now indesuetude, yet it was most reasonable, and of excellent use, seing it is most absurd that any of his Majesties Liedges should contemn his Laws, and that such poor persons as pay his Majesties Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Impositions, and who are obliedged to venture their lives for him, should not likewise have the assistance, as well as the protection of his Laws. So that when the ordinar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> remedies of Caption, Comprysing and others fail, these and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary remedies should be allowed, untill his Majesties Laws be obeyed, and the party so injured be fully and finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired.</p>

               <p n="1">I. THE Lords of Session have regularly no jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in criminals; and yet they pass the Bills whereupon all criminal Summonds are rais'd: For all Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds in criminals must have a Bill, which must pass under the Hand of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat, and for which he gets ten Merks, and his servant one, therafter it is carried to the ordinar upon the Bills, and is subscribed by him as a common Bill.</p>
               <p>The reason, why thir Bills are past by the Lords, seems to be, because the Justice-deputs were not ordinar residen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Town (their sallaries not being sufficient for defray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that charge) or else, because the Clerk of the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lls is a Member and Servant of the Colledge of Justice; yet this was one of the grievances given in by the Justices to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. And it is very unreasonable that those whose imployment it is to understand criminal cases, should not have the passing of these Bills; and many of the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to pass these Bills, whereby the Liedges are preju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And it is most unreasonable, that the Justices should not know what they are to judge; especially this warrand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the Process, and so falls naturally under the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of these who are Judges to it. And it is probable, that if any of the Justices would pass their own Bill, it would sustain. But now the Justices use ordinarly to pass their own Bills: because the Justices are now of the Session: but still other Lords who are not Justices, may pass such Bills.</p>
               <p>But albeit these Lores cannot judge crimes, yet they may and do punish injuries committed against any of their own Members, by fining or confining.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:55274:203"/>II. They likewise Advocat Cause, from the inferiour Courts to the Justices: thus in <hi>Anno</hi> 1664. <hi>Mackintosh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pursued before the Sheriff of <hi>Inverness</hi> for theft-boot, they Advocated the cause to the Justices; albeit it was alledged, that they could not be Judges to the Cognition. To which it was answered, that the consequence was ill inferted; for the Council did Advocat, and could not cognosce; and the Lords of Session did Advocat Breivs, for serving Airs, and yet they were not Judges themselves; for both in this, and that case, an Inquest was necessar.</p>
               <p n="3">III. They are likewise Judges, <hi>in crimine falsi</hi>; and their sentence is a sufficient warrand to the Assize to condemn, without repeating the probation; and when the Inquest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses to condemn upon that warrand, they are of new inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: as was done in <hi>Binnies</hi> case; and will be liable to an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>size of error, if they assioilzie; and their Decreet bears the Lords remit him to the Justices, to be punished, <hi>tanquam falsarius,</hi> and to underly the Law criminally, and ordain'd that ordinance to be insert in their Books of <hi>Sederunt.</hi> And that order is in the Justice Court, call'd an Act of <hi>Sederunt,</hi> the 2. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1662. Albeit the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament, Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 11. requires that all probation in criminals, should be led in presence of the Assize; yet the answer is, that the Lords Decreet is only probation here, and that is read in face of the Assize.</p>
               <p>The Lords likewise determine the punishment in falshood, and remit in their Decreet, the party to the Justice, to be only banisht, or scourged, or have his Tongue boar'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quality of the guilt. And I have seen a Gentle-man, whom I will not name, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1664. only imprisoned by the Lords, for forging of a false Bond of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension, because he was ingenuous, and in necessity. And albeit this may seem irregular, yet seing the Lords are only privy to the Depositions, it is necessar they should have this
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:55274:203"/>
allowance. I find it one of the rules set down by the Doctors, that <hi>ubi cunque iudex principaliter cognoscendo reperit inciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter crimen esse comissum potest de crimine illo cognoscere, C. si adversus liber. l. pen.</hi> And the example of this rule is instanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in <hi>Charta falsa. l. pen. C. de probat.</hi> And upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving an Instrument, or Writ, they have ordained, <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes testes instrumentarios, &amp; falsi fabricatores,</hi> to be <hi>fal sari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> and remitted them to the Justices, the 16. of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 1660. <hi>Fern, Innes</hi> and <hi>Tarbat</hi> hang'd. But I remember not that they have in any other case cognosced upon crimes <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidenter</hi>; albeit the foresaid rule would give them an incident Jurisdiction in all cases.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. I find that the Lords have made Statutes to regulat the Justices Courts, for upon the 1. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1593. they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that all landed men should be esteemed <hi>pares curiae,</hi> and might sit upon Noble-mens Assizes, being pursued, <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaritemerè jurantes sup. assisa</hi>: and the Council uses to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult them in intricat cases, which are referred to them by the Justices. And thus in <hi>Anno</hi> 1667. they were consulted, whether the West Countrey Rebels, might be forefaulted in their absence</p>
               <p n="5">V. But whether they be Judges competent to reduce, or review what is done by the Justices, or in the Justice Court, in any case, is not yet decided; but I have seen a reduction of a Verdict, of an Inquest, pronounced against Mr. <hi>William Somervel,</hi> whereby he was found guilty of Usury. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of reduction was, that the Inquest had erred, <hi>in calculo,</hi> and it was contended, that the Lords were competent Judges to review errors, <hi>in calculo,</hi> for that was in effect but a civil <hi>Medium</hi>; and, where no criminal conclusion was craved, nor could follow, they were Judges, as in the case of Reductions of Retours, where the verdict may be reduce, as past upon ignorance.</p>
               <p>It was also urged, that, seeing the Lords made Statutes
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:55274:204"/>
to regulate the Justice Courts, and past their Bills, they might cognosce upon palpable errors, committed ignorantly by Assizes; and it were hard that the Liedges should not be repon'd against Errours of such ignorant persons, as Assizers ordinarly were.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Lords of Session do suspend the execution like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, of all sentences in the Justice Courts; but these Suspentions, when once raised, are discust before the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices.</p>
               <p>They likewise, sometimes discuss these Suspentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Session. And thus an Assithment modified by the Justices, being exorbitant, the Lords, by way of Suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did lessen the sum. The reason of which Decision was, because they found this case to be but of the nature of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and interest, and not to concern corporal punishment, the 16. of <hi>December</hi> 1664. <hi>Innes contra Forbes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. By <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> 1555. such as kill, or wound, to the effusion of blood, or any other way, one another, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the dependence of a criminal Process (which dependance is declared to continue, from the execution of the Summonds, till the compleat execution of the Decreet) that the pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er committing the said crime, shall for ever loss the cause, and the defender being guilty, is to be condemned in the plea. The pursuer, or defender, being convict before any competent Judge in criminals, without any probation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept summar cognition, to be taken by conviction, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the committer to the Horn, and denouncing him fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve. By this Act the committer losses his life-rent Escheat immediatly, after denounciation, without being Year and Day at the Horn; and giving of counsel, is art and part in this crime.</p>
               <p>This Act was to continue only for three Years, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogat for seven Years, by the 138. <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 8. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. and is thereafter made perpertual, by the 219. <hi>Act</hi> 14. <hi>Parl. Ia.</hi> 6.
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:55274:204"/>
I have oft seen Process intented upon this Act before the Lords. But it is necessar, albeit not observ'd, that cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be first taken by the Justices, or other criminal, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge. Yet without this, Process was sustain'd by the Lords, <hi>in prima instantià</hi>; but this defence was not there alledg'd; and Process was sustain'd, albeit no effusion of blood followed, the 29. of <hi>Iuly.</hi> 1662. <hi>Harper</hi> against <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltoun</hi>; where it was debated, whether the Lords might summarly receive probation of it themselves, or remit the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the Justices; for which doubt, I thought, there was no great ground: because, by the Act foresaid, the Justice is only Judge, <hi>in prima instantia.</hi> And yet, in <hi>Sleiches</hi> case, 1673. It was found, that no previous tryal before the Justices was necessar.</p>
               <p>The Earle of <hi>Niddisdale</hi> pursuing the Tennents of <hi>Duncow, February</hi> 1672. they alledged absolvitur, because the Earl had beat some of them, who were sent to execute a Summonds at their instance against him, at least he had given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to beat them, or ratihabited the beating of them: To which it was answered, that 1. The beating some of them, could only found an exception to such as were beat; and this the Lords found relevant, though the Summonds execu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d was for a common Cause: and so in effect, those who were beat, represented all the pursuers. 2. It was alledged, that order to beat them was only probable, <hi>scripto vel juramento</hi>: for, though a crime ordinarly, in a criminal Court, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, <hi>pro ut de jure,</hi> yet here, <hi>quo ad civilem effectum,</hi> it could not be so proved: for else a Noble-mans whole and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Heritage, might oft-times be taken away by Witnesses, since Processes depending, might extend to a Noble-mans whole Estate. 3. It was alledged, that ratihabition, or any deed, <hi>ex post facto,</hi> did not infer the contravention of this Act, which required explicit deeds, as beating, bleeding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lords, before answer to these two last alledgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:55274:205"/>
ordained Witnesses to be led, before answer, for clearing the nature of the Act, and violence committed against them; but in this case, as in all others, if the one party beat, the other being forced thereto by self-defence, the striker will not, <hi>eo casu,</hi> fall under the certification of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> as was found the last of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1673. <hi>Iohn Sliech</hi> against <hi>Swintoun.</hi> In which case, the Lords al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so found, that the certification of this Act, did reach such as wounded one another, during the dependence of a pursuit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Inferiour Court; though it was alledged, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect was only due to the Lords of the Session, and that the Act should only reach, such as pursued Actions before them, for, to lose the whole Pley, was too great a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for an incident Riot, before an Inferiour Court.</p>
               <p>I find likewise, that one <hi>Weir</hi> having been pursued for slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the 15. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1591. he alledged, he was absolved by a Rolment of Court at <hi>Aberdene.</hi> To which it was reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the King had given a warrand for a further tryal, which reply, founded upon His <hi>Majesties</hi> Warrand, was repelled, as contrary to Law, and because it was but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat Rescript, not subscribed by the Chancellour, nor past Council: And in respect, the Lords of Session had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a Warrand to proceed, notwithstanding of the Kings privat Warrand. It is also observable (though I think it irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) that <hi>Ludwharn</hi> having raised, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1596. a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit against <hi>Momat,</hi> and others, for taking him out of his House, without a lawful Warrand, gave in a Bill to the Lords, complaining that the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> as Leiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennent of the North, intended to repledge; wheras that Jurisdiction was only cumulative with the power of the Justices: and that he had a Letter from His <hi>Majesty,</hi> ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Justices to proceed; wherefore, he craved that the Justices might be commanded to proceed, which Petition was granted.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:55274:205"/>VIII. Albeit <hi>regulariter,</hi> the Parliament, or Council grant Warrands to Advocats, to appear for such as are Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell'd before the Justices: yet I find that the Lords grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Warrand in <hi>Balmerinochs</hi> case, to Advocats to compear for him. And seing Advocats are subject to the Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords, it is most reasonable, that the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be made to them: for the same reason likewise, I find, that when any of the Lords are appointed Assessors, in Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal cases by the Council, that they must have a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand also from the Lords, for sitting there, as in <hi>Toshes</hi> case, 1637.</p>

And for this same reason, I differ from that Author, who asserts, <hi>num.</hi> 12. that if the taker bring a Pirat to a Port, and the Judge refuses, or delayes Justice, so that the taker must lose, then the taker may execute Justice himself; for this were to make every man Judge, not only of the Pirat, but of the Judge to whom application was made, and a Privat person might as well pretend, that if a Judge delayed, or denied Justice against such, as we pretend did either rob or affront us, we might do Justice upon them our selves, contrary to many Laws, and particularly to <hi>l. nullus C. de judaeis.</hi> The same learned Author, <hi>Iuris Maritimi,</hi> doth tell us, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>num.</hi> 14. that if a <hi>Spaniard</hi> rob a <hi>Frenchman</hi> on the high Sea, both their Princes being in amity amongst themselves, and with <hi>England,</hi> and that the Ship is brought into the Ports of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>French-man</hi> may proceed against the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh him but if the Ship be brought, <hi>intra prasidia</hi> of that Prince by whose subject the same was taken, it may be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted if he can proceed Criminally; but the taker must resort to
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:55274:207"/>
the Pirats own Countrey, or where he carryed the Ship. But in my opinion, a Pirat may be Judged by the Judge of any Nation, for he is an enemy to all Nations, and though he be not deprehended committing a crime in the Sea of that Prince, or State, within which he is deprehended, and so seems not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Jurisdiction, <hi>nec ratione loci delicti, nec ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis, nec domicilii,</hi> yet he who is of no Nation, is of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Vagabonds are; and he who is an equal enemy to all Nations, commits a crime against every Nation.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Though the Admirals Criminal Jurisdiction extends no further then crimes committed at Sea, or within Flood-mark, yet he is some times Judge, <hi>ratione contingentiae &amp; ob continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam causae,</hi> as if a man rescue a Pirat out of Prison, though this Crime be committed without Flood-mark, yet the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral is Judge, because it hath dependance upon, and arises from the principal Crime to which he is Judge: and if the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral begin to present Pirats, or Malefactors at Sea, he may continue his pursuit, and apprehend them at Land, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his own jurisdiction, but he must in that case seek concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the Magistrat of the place, <hi>Locen. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>num.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Though the Admiral has a Criminal Jurisdiction, yet some alledge that he has not this properly as Admiral, but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Commission of Justiciary contained in his Gift; and therefore when the Admiral proceeds to thy Crimes, the Court is not called the Court of Admirality simply as in other cases, but the Court of Justiciary of the Admirality.</p>
               <p>It is likewise doubted, whether the Admiral hath the sole power of judging Crimes committed at Sea, or if the justices have a cumulative jurisdiction with them, and may preveen; and that the Justices have a cumulative jurisdiction is clear, for I find, that in <hi>Anno</hi> 1613. the Justices did hang one <hi>Iohn Davidson,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Lowes English</hi> Pirats, and in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</hi> 1610. they hanged <hi>Peter Love, Iohn Cock</hi> and others. Likewise, <hi>English</hi> Pirats, which last were hanged, upon their
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:55274:207"/>
own confessions emitted before the Privy Council, and all of them were hanged within Flood-mark. I have likewise seen the Justices Advocat Causes from the Admiral Court, but whether the Admirals sentence in Criminals can be reduced by the Criminal Court, as their sentences in Civils can be reduced before the Session, I will not determine.</p>

               <p n="2">II. The Commissars are the Bishops Officials, and so have least criminal Jurisdiction of all other Courts; but yet they are Judges competent to verbal injuries, which are by the Law accounted crimes: and the reason why they are the only Judges competent to this crime, is, because that Court, as being an Ecclesiastick Court, <hi>&amp; curia christianitatis,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders these verbal Injuries as Scandals, and so they are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only to punish the same with Pecuniary Mulcts, but with Church Censures, such as to make the offender stand at the Church Doors to expiat a Slander: though it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the inflicting of such punishments, was only proper to Kirk Sessions, the 15. of <hi>February</hi> 1669. But though they be the only Judges competent to verbal Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, where they are Scandals; yet in verbal Injuries done to persons of quality, which are called in Law, <hi>scandala magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> the Council sustains it self Judge competent; the King being as the Author, so the Protector of all the priviledges of the Peerage; and in verbal Injuries likewise done to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats, the Council are also Judges, Magistrats represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King, and being his Instruments in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>When verbal Injuries are done by Members of a Court to one another, that Court is likewise Judge competent, all Courts (how inferiour soever) having an innat Power to chastise its own Members, and to preserve the esteem due to it self; and therefore, if any stranger who has a Process, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending before any other Court, as the Session, Sheriff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do abuse contumeliously any third Party, though no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: yet these respective Courts may punish the same, if the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:55274:208"/>
injury be done in face of Judgement, and if it be done to any Inferiour Judge extrajudicially, that Judge if he be in the actual exercise of his Office, he may likewise punish the same, except the offender be a Member of the Colledge of Justice, for in that case the Judge extrajudicially injured, must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to the Lords, but cannot imprison them summarly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, if this were allowed, these Members might be abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from serving the Liedges, as an Advocat when he is to plead a Cause, or a Clerk when he is to give out a Decreet: and this last has been frequently so decided.</p>
               <p>Though verbal Injuries amounting to Scandals, are only to be punished by the Commissars, yet where they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them of Scandal, but are rather reflections upon the Honour of the party injured, as to call a Gentle-man a Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, or an Ass; it may be the Privy Council, and not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missars are Judges competent.</p>
               <p>The Commissars are also Judges competent to Adultery, in so far as concerns Divorce, <hi>vid. tit. adulterii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. How far the Commissars, and Inferiour Judges, are Judges competent to the improving of Writs, and declaring them false, has been variously decided; but they may be reduced to these conclusions, 1. No Inferiour Judge is competent, to try the falshood of Writs, by the indirect manner of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, that is to say, by presumptions, for that way of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al being in effect, <hi>nobilis officii,</hi> is only competent to the Lords of the Session. 2. Commissars, and other Inferiour Judges, are only competent to improbations, even where the direct manner is extant, if improbation be propon'd by way of exception, or reply; for then the tryal of Falshood falls in necessarily as a part of the Process, and without this were allowed to these Inferiour Judges, they could proceed in no case; for if a pursuit were intented before them, upon a Bond, they behoved to sist, if the Bond were alledged to be false; or to stop, if the defender should offer to improve the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:55274:209"/>
execution of the Summonds: but yet they are not competent by way of Action, even where the direct manner is extant: as was decided the last of <hi>November</hi> 1630. <hi>Williamson contra Cushney.</hi> 3. If the Commissar, or other Inferiour Judge, pronounce once a Decreet, he cannot thereafter reduce his own Decreet, as having proceeded upon false executions; though the executions were given by his own Officer, since they are only Judges competent to such forgeries, <hi>inciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> but after sentence, they are <hi>functi</hi>; as was found the 29. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1677. <hi>Cowan, contra</hi> the Commissar of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gows</hi> Phiscal, and according to these conclusions, the late instructions given to the Commissars, are to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted.</p>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">I. BY the Feudal Law (to which Regalities owe their origine) <hi>alia erant regalia, alia erant feuda regalem dignitatem habentia,</hi> which is the same difference in our Law, betwixt <hi>Regalia,</hi> and Regalities. <hi>Regalia,</hi> are such privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges as immediatly belong to the Crown, and do not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:55274:210"/>
belong to, nor can be communicat by any else; such as to Coin Money, to open Mines of Silver, Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Regalities are Fews, which are granted by the King to a Subject, they have as large a Jurisdiction, as the Sheriffs have in Civils, or the Justices in criminals; the <hi>habilis modus,</hi> of granting which Rights, is by Signator, wherupon a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter follows, which passes the great Seal.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Regalities are accounted inferiour Judicaturs, <hi>cap,</hi> 76. <hi>quon. attach.</hi> by which it is Statute, that no inferiour Judge shall judge the Pleys of the Crown: and Regalities are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly numbered amongst inferiour Courts, <hi>Act,</hi> 173. <hi>Parl.</hi> 13. K. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. By which it is likewise Statute, that he who strikes any person, in presence of the Justices, shall incurr the pain of death; but he who strikes any before the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, Lords of Regality, or other inferiour Judge, shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pay a hundred Pounds; but though they be accounted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Judges, when compared with the Justices, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of Justiciary, yet they have greater power in the way of their procedor, and in the proportioning of their fines, then Sheriffs, or other inferiour Judges have; for they may fine in a hundreth Pounds, though Sheriffs and others cannot, as was found the 30 of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1663. <hi>Stewart</hi> against <hi>Bogle.</hi> And generally they have the same power, and the same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance with the Justices, except when an express Law makes a difference betwixt them.</p>
               <p>The 43. <hi>Act,</hi> 11. <hi>Parl.</hi> K. <hi>Ia.</hi> 2. appoints that no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities should be granted, without deliverance of Parliament; which nullity, of old, could not have been received, <hi>opt exceptionis,</hi> if it was clad with possession, <hi>Hadd.</hi> 1610. and they were still subject to Revocation by the King, if they were otherwise granted, as may be seen by the Revocation, 1633. and all preceeding.</p>
               <p n="3">III. He in whose favours the Regality is granted, is still called the Lord of Regality, though he be otherwise but a
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:55274:210"/>
Barron; the reason of which, I take to be, because by the Feudal Law, <hi>tria erant tantum feuda regalem dignitatem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentia, &amp; quibus inerat jurisdictio regalis,</hi> viz, <hi>Ducatus, Marchionatus, &amp; Comitatus,</hi> and by the same reason it is, that no Lands can be comprehended under this jurisdiction by our Law, but such as belong to him, in whose favours that jurisdiction was granted, either in Property, or Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore it was found, that His <hi>Majesties</hi> Palaces, (though situated in Burghs of Regality,) were in Law no part of the Regality, but off the Royalty, and that such as lived in these Palaces, could not be cited at the Head Burgh of the Regality, but at the Head Burgh of the Shire, the 11. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1662. L. <hi>Carnegie</hi> against the Lord <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Whether His <hi>Majesty</hi> may erect Regalities within the bounds of Heritable Sheriff-ships, is controverted with us; and if he may, certainly he may thereby evacuat the Office of Sheriff-ships, though bought with real Money, which is hard. And yet the Exchequer past a Signator of <hi>Drumlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigs,</hi> albeit <hi>Niddisdale,</hi> within the bounds of which Sheriff-ship it is erected, be an Heritable Sheriff-ship, and the like decision is related by <hi>Hop. M. h. t.</hi> and the reason seems to be, that His <hi>Majesty</hi> by granting an Heritable Sheriff-ship, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not its nature; and the nature of a Sheriff-ship, is, that His <hi>Majesty</hi> is not thereby divested of Jurisdiction, and the Sheriff appointed, being but His <hi>Majesties</hi> Deput, his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot hinder His <hi>Majesty</hi> to erect a new Jurisdiction within its bounds, as he may erect a Burgh-royal therein, or a Justiciary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When Lands are dispon'd in Conjunct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, the Heritor retains still the Office of Regality, <hi>Hop. hoc. tit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. Albeit it be regularly true, that Lords of Regality have the same jurisdiction with His <hi>Majesties</hi> Justices: yet this rule suffers two exceptions, 1. In the case of Treason,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:55274:211"/>
to which the justices are only judges competent, and that not only where the Treason libelled, amounts to the crime of <hi>Perduellion</hi>; but even in Statutory Treasons, such as firing of Coal-heughs, theft in landed men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And some Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers are likewise of opinion, that these crimes which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the four Points of the Crown, <hi>viz.</hi> Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Murder, Fire-raising, and Ravishing of Women, should not be liable to their jurisdiction; which opinion is founded upon the 2. <hi>cap. leg. Malcolm.</hi> 2. By which it is Statute, that all Robbers, Forces of Women, Murderers of Men, and Burners of Houses, shall answer before the Kings Justici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar; and are therefore called Pleys of the Crown. And by the 14. <hi>cap. Stat. Alex.</hi> 2. it is ordained, that in all the Courts of Bishops, Abbots, and the Lords whatsomever, these four Pleys shall be reserved from their Court, to the Kings own Court, because they belong to the Crown: which is confirmed by the 76. <hi>cap. quon. Attach.</hi> Likeas <hi>Skeen de verb. signif.</hi> Upon the Word <hi>Placitum,</hi> is clear, that these four Pleys of the Crown, belong only to the Crowns jurisdiction, or Justice-general, in the same manner with Treason he there likewise observes, that they are called <hi>placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> from the French Word <hi>placitare,</hi> which signifies <hi>Liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare,</hi> as <hi>Mollineus,</hi> observes, <hi>Sup. cur. Parl. parti. Primo cap. Sexto</hi>: And yet <hi>de facto,</hi> Lords of Regality do ordinarly judge upon these crimes without any Commission. And I find that the 22. of <hi>Iuly, Brown</hi> is assoilzied from a pursuit of Fire-raising, because he had been formerly pursued before the Marquess of <hi>Hamiltoun,</hi> and assoilzied. Actions of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement also, in my opinion, being intented before the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, cannot be repledged, for the Kings Messenger being then Deforced, it is not fit that His <hi>Majesty</hi> should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged to seek justice from inferiour Judges, where His Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of State cannot attend to pursue, and <hi>cap.</hi> 27. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>Reg. Maj.</hi> it is said, that <hi>ad solam curiam Regis pertinet placitum
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:55274:211"/>
de namo vetito,</hi> and this the Justices sustain'd, the 23. of <hi>November</hi> 1675. in the case of <hi>William Crighton,</hi> though the debate was not allow'd to be booked.</p>
               <p>The 2. exception is, that no Bailie of Regality can repledge from Justice Airs, <hi>Act</hi> 29. <hi>Parl.</hi> 11. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. which was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Statute formerly, by the 26. <hi>Act, Ia.</hi> 2. <hi>Parl.</hi> 6. But in this case, the Bailie of Regality may sit with the Justice-general, yet seing the forsaid <hi>Act</hi> of the 11. <hi>Parl.</hi> King. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6 allowes only no Repledgiation to be from Justice Airs, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by the Justice-general, it may be doubted, if when Justices Airs are holden by the Justice Deputs, or others, by vertue of particular Commissions, there may not be Repledgiation allowed in that case; but I think there cannot, seing the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parl. Ia.</hi> 2. is general: and <hi>Skeen</hi> remarks this as a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Justice Air, <hi>qua talis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. Regalities are divided with us, in Ecclesiastick, and Laick; Ecclesiastick Regalities were such, as were erected in favours of Bishops, Abbots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there are but very few Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacies in <hi>Scotland</hi> which were not erected in Regalities; and when these were annexed to the Crown, by the foresaid 29. <hi>Act, Parl.</hi> 11. K. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. It is declared, that the Bailie, or Stewart of the Regality shall have the same power he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Repledge, from the Sheriff, or Justice-general, in case he have prevented the Justice-general, by apprehending, or citing the Person, before he be apprehended, or cited by the Justice; but, if the Justice have prevented, as said is, then the Bailie, or Stewart of the Regality, shall not have power to Repledge, but he may sit with the Justice-general, if he pleases: so that in effect, by this act, there is difference betwixt Ecclesiastick and Laick Regalities; that in Laick Regalities, there is a Right of Repledging still, as said is; wheras Ecclesiastick Regalities have not this priviledge, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they preveen the Justices; but otherwise, the Bailie of Regality may only sit with them: Which difference seems
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:55274:212"/>
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e acknowledged in the debate, at His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocats instance, against several Fore-stallers, upon the 26. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1596. And thus Mr. <hi>Iohn Prestoun,</hi> then Depute to the Regality of <hi>Musselburgh,</hi> was not allowed to Repledge, but to sit with the Justices, in the tryal of some Witches, upon the 29. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1661. The reason of this difference was, that the Regalities having been only granted, in favours of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houses which were supprest. The Regalities became extinguisht with them, and His <hi>Majesty</hi> having, <hi>ex gratia,</hi> only renewed their Offices to the Lords of Erection, he thought that they were abundantly gratified, by this new concession, without allowing them the power to exclude his own Justices, in case of prevention; and this was also a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the Liedges, in not troubling them with two Courts. Nor were the Lords of Regality much prejudged; for by this same Act, they retain the whole right to the Escheats, and Fines, even of these who are condemned by the Justices. And therefore the Lords found, that the Lord of Regality had right to the Escheats of such as were condemned by the Justices, or Justices of Peace, the 22. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1664. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Sutherland contra Conradge:</hi> so that this holds not only where the Justices sit with the Lord of Regality: but likewise where the Justices condemn without the others concourse; and yet it may be urged, that since the Lord of Regality serves not in that case, he ought not to get these Casualities, which are the reward due to these who do justice, and the Lord of Regality has himself only to blame, who did not either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veen, or repledge.</p>
               <p>Bailies of Regalities may likewise repledge from the Kings Lievtenent, as was found the 19. of <hi>August</hi> 1596. And as is clear by the foresaid Act of Annexation: and likewise from any Commissioners appointed by the Council, as was found in <hi>May</hi> 1568. And from the Justices of Peace, in Riots, and Bloods: as was found by the Lords of Session, <hi>Iuly</hi> 1617. though
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:55274:212"/>
these causes being of small moment, and requiring summar and unexpensive cognitions, seem to require easier, and less solemn tryals in the procedor, then repledgiations will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And yet by <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>de appell.</hi> I find that <hi>licebat in remimina appellare</hi>; nor can the parties injured complain, since they might have made their application to the Lord of Regality: Nor should their errour prejudge his juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The manner of repledgiation from any Court, is, that either the party himself, who hath the power of repledging, or some other having a Procurator from him, compears and produces his Charter of Erection; from the production of the Seasing is not sufficient, seing that is but <hi>assertio Notarii</hi>: yet sometimes without production of the Charter, repledgiation will be sustain'd: because it is notour that the repledger hath a Regality; as in the Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> case, 1637. As also, repledgiation will be sustain'd, upon production of the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Register, bearing, that it was formerly sustain'd to the same persons, <hi>May</hi> 1668. <hi>Arducaple</hi> against the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of the High-lands: Yet it may be doubted, whether the production of a Lord of Regalities retour, will be sufficient to instruct that he hath a Regality: and it appears it should, since a retour is a sentence, and so is a sufficient instruction, till it be reduced.</p>
               <p>He who offers to repledge, must find Caution of <hi>Culrach</hi> to do justice, within year and day, upon the person whom he repledges; and if the Judge to whom he is repledged, doth not justice within year and day, he <hi>tines his Court</hi> (as we call it) for year and day; and the <hi>Culrach</hi> (for so the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner is called) who hath, upon his becoming Cautioner, borrowed the Defender, is in an unlaw, and the Judge from whom he was borrowed, or repledged, may proceed to do justice, as formerly: <hi>Skeen, de verb. sig.</hi> The Pannel like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, who is repledged, must find Caution for his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:55274:213"/>
before the Lord of Regality, to underly the Law, for the crimes laid to his charge, the 16. of <hi>May</hi> 1599. <hi>Patrick M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>kalla,</hi> against the Regality of <hi>Lennox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No person can be repledged, except he be present at the Court, from which he is desired to be repledged: for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who is absent, cannot find Caution to sist himself before the Court, to which he is repledged; as was found in the case of <hi>Armstrong,</hi> who being pursued for murdering some Customers, was desired to be repledged by the Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandale, Anno</hi> 1666. Nor can a person be repledged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defences are proponed for him: for this being, <hi>recusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio judicis,</hi> it must be, <hi>ante omnia,</hi> propon'd, <hi>dum res est in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. When Regalities are erected, there is a Burgh of Regality expressed therein; and though that Burgh may choose Bailies, yet the Bailie of Regality hath still a cumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive jurisdiction with those Bailies of the Burgh of Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in that same way that other Superiours retain still a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulative jurisdiction with their Regality; as was found the 24. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1668. betwixt the Bailie of <hi>Killimure,</hi> and the Burgh thereof. This Burgh is oblig'd to maintain a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Prison, not only for Criminals, but for Debitors, by the 273. <hi>Act,</hi> 15. <hi>Parl. Ia.</hi> 6. And all Captions bear the Letters, to be direct to Bailies of Regalities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet by that Act, these Burghs seem only to be oblig'd to intertain Prisoners, where there are Provost, Bailies, and Common-good, <hi>Nota,</hi> that these words of that Act, <hi>by the Sheriff to Stewarts, and Bailies of Regalities, are ill print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; for the word <hi>to</hi> should be <hi>or,</hi> The Lords likewise decided thus against the Bailies of Regalities, the 7. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1668. <hi>Hamiltoun contra Callender.</hi> In this Burgh all Courts must be holden, Yet defenders are oblidg'd to compear at any other place within the Regality, to which they were expresly cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: As <hi>Had,</hi> observes in a case, the 16. of <hi>March</hi> 1622.
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:55274:213"/>
Or, if the Lord of Regality was in use to hold his Court else where, for a considerable time, without interruption, the Vassals, or any other Defender, is oblidg'd to appear thereat, though it be not the place design'd, in the Charter of Erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Had.</hi> observes, <hi>December</hi> 1624. And if the party, who is desired to be Repledged, dwelt within the Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the time of the committing of the Crime, the Repledgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation will be sustain'd, though at the time of his being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he be removed without the Regality: as was found, the 21. of <hi>November</hi> 1632. in the case of one <hi>Weems,</hi> who was desired to be Repledged, to the Regality of <hi>Methwen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lords of Regality are oblidged to hold Justice-Courts twice a Year, 3. <hi>Parl. K. Ia.</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. and if they be negligent in causing rest and stolen Goods be restored, the Sheriff may fulfil their place, <hi>Act</hi> 11. <hi>Parl.</hi> 15. <hi>Ia.</hi> 2. And when Erections fall into the Kings hand, the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be <hi>justified, id est,</hi> judged by the Justices, <hi>Act</hi> 26. <hi>Par.</hi> 6. K. <hi>I.</hi> 6 but this Act can only take place, till a Stewart, or Bailie be appointed. For <hi>Regulariter,</hi> the Kings own Stewarts of Regalities may repledge from the Justices.</p>
               <p>A Lord of Regality cannot fit himself in his own Court, but must administer by a Bailie, who is sometimes admitted by a simple Commission, during his life; or otherwise he is admitted to be Heritable Bailie: which Right passes by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festment; but this Bailie is in Lands belonging to the King, and is properly call'd the Stewart of the Regality: though sometimes the Kings Deputs in Regalities, are likewise call'd Bailies, as in the 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. <hi>Parl. K I.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Lords of Regality cannot cite Witnesses, without their own jurisdiction, but they must have Letters of Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that Office; though generally they may proceed in the same way that the Justice-General doth; but they
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:55274:214"/>
may exact Caution to enter as Law-will, from the defenders, after sentence is given, as was found the 7. of <hi>October</hi> 1668. betwixt Mr. <hi>Iohn Prestoun,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Pape,</hi> which seems to be a greater priviledge then the Justices have, who cannot presently exact Caution of any person, for paying an unlaw, but can only raise Letters of Horning upon the Act of Adjournal.</p>
               <p>The Lords of Regalities have right to the single Escheat of rebels, living within their jurisdiction; as also to the Escheats of all persons, condemned for crimes, committed by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants within their jurisdiction, albeit condemned by the Justices: from which general rule, <hi>Hope</hi> in his lesser Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiques, excepts only the case of Treason; but it may be doubted, whether exception may not be likewise made of all other Pleys of the Crown, seeing the Lord of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality is no more Judge competent to these, then he is to Treason.</p>
               <p>I was once consulted, whether a Lord of Regality might place a Gallows upon any part of his Vassals Land, lying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Regality? and at first it seem'd that he might: for, <hi>unaquaeque gleba servit:</hi> and what was lawful in some part, was, where there is no restriction lawful in any part: but if there was a former place fix'd upon by custome, I think the Lord of Regality could not alter the same. 2. If there were any apparent design of affronting the Vassal, I believe he could not use this priviledge; as if he did offer to place the Gallows, at his Vassals Gate, or at his Garden-door, or any such places: for, where the Law sayes, that <hi>quilibet potest uti jure suo,</hi> it adds, <hi>modo hoc non faciat principaliter in aemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationem alterius.</hi> 3. Even in other places, there is some <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deramon &amp; decorum,</hi> to be observed: and I doubt not, but upon application to the Council, they would appoint some persons to choose an indifferent place: for even in these ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitudes, <hi>ubi unaquequae gleba servit; hoc accipiendum est <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliter</hi>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:55274:214"/>
(sayes the Law) <hi>&amp; non judaice.</hi> for if a man should grant me a servitude of a way to my house through any part of his ground, yet I could not compel him to throw down his Garden walls, or to suffer me to go thorrow his Corns, if there were, or might be another passage found, though it were not so near.</p>

                  <hi>ALluredus,</hi> in the League made with <hi>Guntherus</hi> King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> divided <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Satrapias, centurias, &amp; decu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> and called <hi>Satrapiam</hi> a Shire, that is to say, a Section or division of Land, from the word Shire, which signifies to cut, so that a Sherifdom is a Jurisdiction within the bounds of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular limited Countrey: It is called in our Latine stile, <hi>vice comitatus</hi>; and though most of the Shires in <hi>Scotland</hi> be ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Sherifdomes by particular Acts of Parliament, yet by an unprinted Act in <hi>Anno</hi> 1504. It is declared that His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty may erect, unite, or divide Sherifdoms without consent of Parliament: And though his Majesty erect a Burgh-royal, or Barrony within the Sherifdome, yet they still continue to be under the Jurisdiction of the Sheriff, and they have a cumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Jurisdiction with him; but not privative of him. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> are either during life, and then the office passes by a signatour, and passes the great Seal, or otherwise it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred as an heretable right, <hi>quo casu,</hi> though it be transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the same way and manner with other heretable rights, yet because it is <hi>merum jus incorporeum,</hi> it requires no seasing, but albeit all these heretable offices were upon good reasons dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by the 44 <hi>Act</hi> 11. <hi>Parl. K. I.</hi> 6. seing <hi>industria perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae respicitur in judice</hi>; And albeit.

               <p n="2">II. The Sheriffs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> have a Civil and Criminal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, but the last of these, is that which we are only to consider as peculiar to this Treatise.</p>
               <p>The Sheriff is in effect the supreme Justice of peace, to whom is mainly entrusted by the Law, the securing of the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:55274:215"/>
and tranquility of that part of the Kingdom which is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Jurisdiction; and therefore though no other person be allowed to ride with gatherings of the Liedges, yet the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs is, nor can he be pursued for a convocation upon that account; seing he may convocat at his pleasure for repressing of tumults, and upon many other accounts, as was found in <hi>February</hi> 1664 betwixt the Earl of <hi>Seaforth,</hi> and the Laird of <hi>Ballingown,</hi> for it doth belong to his office, to discharge all convocations of the Liedges, and if they refuse, he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his Court, and advertise the King. K. <hi>Ia.</hi> 3. <hi>Parl.</hi> 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 104.</p>
               <p>Albeit, <hi>in civilibus,</hi> neither the Sheriff, nor Barrons, can hold Courts <hi>in feriat,</hi> or close, time of vacance. Yet in Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals he may hold Courts during the time of vacance <hi>quia pericu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum est in mora,</hi> as is observed by <hi>Haddingtoun,</hi> the 19. <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1623. And Sheriffs has not power to exact caution from a Malefactor to underly the Law, for he cannot proceed except either the defender be cited, or, <hi>deprehensus inflagranti crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> 25. <hi>Mart.</hi> 1628.</p>
               <p>The Sheriff is Judge competent to the crime of Witch-craft, Quen <hi>Mary</hi> her 9. <hi>Parl. Act.</hi> 37. albeit <hi>de praxi,</hi> none used to judge Witch-craft, but the Justices, or such as have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular commission from the Council. They should apprehend the sayers and hearers of Masse, <hi>Act</hi> 5. <hi>Pa.</hi> 1. K. <hi>I.</hi> 6. And the strikers of false Coyn, <hi>I.</hi> 3. <hi>Pa.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. but they are not allowed by the Law expresly to proceed in either of these cases; from which it may be argued that they are not Judges competent thereto, for else the Law had expresly allowed them the same, (<hi>&amp; inclusio unius est exclusio alterius:)</hi> They should apprehend, punish and banish Sorners, <hi>I.</hi> 2. <hi>P.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. Egyptians, <hi>I.</hi> 6. <hi>P.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 124. Idle-men, <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. <hi>P.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 66. Shooters with fire-works. Q. <hi>Mary. Par.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. Fore-stallers, <hi>I.</hi> 5. <hi>P.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. Transporters of Neat and Sheep, and other Cattel, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Par.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 124. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:55274:216"/>
                  <hi>Par.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 129. The destroyers of Planting, <hi>K. I.</hi> 6. <hi>P.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 84.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Sheriffs may at any time condemn for Blood-weits, but the penalty cannot exceed fifty Pounds.</p>
               <p>The Sheriff nor no other inferiour Judge, can Judge the four Pleys of the Crown, <hi>viz.</hi> open Robbery, Fire raising, and ravishing of Women, and Murder. Yet of old, Sheriffs might sit upon Slaughter, if the committers were attactht within fourty days thereafter, <hi>cap.</hi> 59. <hi>quon. attach.</hi> And <hi>Act</hi> 89. <hi>Par.</hi> 6. <hi>I.</hi> 1. And if he be taken red hand, he should be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute by the Sheriff within that Sun, <hi>ibid.</hi> And yet by the 28 <hi>Act, Parl.</hi> 3. <hi>K. I.</hi> 4. Three Suns are allowed conform to the old Laws; and if the committer of the Slaughter flee, the Sheriff shall acquaint the next Sheriff, and so from one Judge to another, until the committer be apprehended, and when he is taken, he is to be sent back to that Sheriff where the crime was committed, where justice is to be done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and if he be found guilty of Fore-thought Fellony, he shall dye; therefore <hi>Act</hi> 89. <hi>Par.</hi> 6. <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. <hi>Ratified Act</hi> 28.3. <hi>Par. K. Ia.</hi> 4. with this addition, that if any heretable Sheriff omit his duty in prosecuting of this crime, after this manner, he shall lose his heretable office for three years, but if he have only that office for the time, he shall lose it during all that time. From which Acts, it may be concluded, that the Sheriffs is not only Judge competent to Slaughter, but to murder, and both to the one and to the other at any time, if he has either ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the person, or has <hi>ex in continenti,</hi> done diligence for apprehending him, but the Sheriff is not Judge competent to murder, though committed within his jurisdiction, except in either of these cases.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The way of procedure before the Sheriff, is by an Assize, and the Procurator-Fiskal is pursuer in place of His Majesties Advocat; Yet sometimes the Sheriff, or Barron may condemn upon the Pannels confession, without an Assize, as <hi>Dur.</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:55274:216"/>
penult <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1622. but if the party be present, the Sheriff cannot condemn him, as holden, <hi>pro confesso,</hi> though he refuse to depon; but <hi>co casu</hi> he must put him to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an Assize, as was found 24. <hi>Iuly</hi> 1633. <hi>Dickson con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Halyday.</hi> And albeit a blood proven by confession, may be punished by an unlaw of fifty pounds; yet when blood is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon contumacious refusal to swear, the unlaw cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ten pounds, 17. <hi>February</hi> 1624.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Sheriff may pursue, when any person compears and insists with him in the pursuite, but if the crime be pursued by way of inditement without the concurrence of any party, the Justice general is only Judge competent thereto: <hi>Skeen verbo</hi> Sheriff, but that rule is too general, and may admit of this distinction, <hi>viz.</hi> that either the Thief is taken with fang, and then the Sheriff may proceed to judge him, though no privat pursuer insist against him. Nor needs there three fangs for justifying that pursuit, Albeit Sheriffs now never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, but where three fangs are proved. Or else no fang is found, <hi>&amp; eo casu,</hi> the Sheriff cannot judge the thief, except there be a pursuite intended at the instance of a privat party.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Sheriff should assist in all Justice Aires holden by the Justice General, or the Chamberlain, and should produce the verifications of all the Summonds which is made to the Justice Air, and should make prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sions at the Justice Air, and his Clerks, which should be allowed in the first end of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts to the Exchequer, and he should arrest such persons as the Crowner cannot arrest, and should those an Assize upon the last day of the Justice Air, anent the execution of his office. <hi>Ia.</hi> 3. <hi>Parl.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 102. and if he be found culpable, the Justice General may remove him from his office till the next Parliament, and put another in his place, to officiat in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim. <hi>St. Rob. Bruce, ex lib. Sconen.</hi> related by <hi>Skeen, ibid.</hi> but much of this is antiquated by custome, for the Thesaurer sends along with the Justice Air, a person specially commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:55274:217"/>
by them, who defrayes the charges of the Justices and Justice Clerk.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. If the Sheriff fail in his duty, he was punished of old by the losse of his office during his life, and imprisonment dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His Majesties pleasure, <hi>St. David Cap.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 69. but now for negligence in his office, he tines the same for year and day, and is punishable in his person, and goods, at his Majesties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <hi>Ia.</hi> 2. <hi>Par.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 37. And yet the Lord <hi>Yester,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving suffered two Thieves negligently to escape, and his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table office of Sheriffship, being upon that accompt taken from him by King <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth, that Decreet was reduced, for it was found too small to infer the loss of an heretable office, <hi>Stat. Sessionis, pag.</hi> 34. which is observed by <hi>Hop.</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in his larger Practiques.</p>
               <p>If the Sheriff absolutly refuse to do Justice, he loses like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his office, and is punishable at his Majesties pleasure, but if he do injustice, he loses his office, if it be heretable, for three years; but if it be not heretable, he loses it during the time he was to enjoy it formerly, and in both cases he is punishable arbitrary in his person, and is obliedged to refound the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and interest sustained by the parties laes'd, <hi>K.

               <p n="1">I. A Barron, in our Law, is generally understood to be one who is Infest in any Lands, though not erected in a Barrony; in which sense he has no Jurisdiction, but only that he can unlaw his own Tennent for Blood committed upon his own ground, as was found the <hi>penult</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1622. <hi>Iohnstoun</hi> against the Laird of <hi>West-nisbit:</hi> but a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron properly, is he who is Infest with power of Pit and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>fossa &amp; furca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Barron Judges crimes in the same manner, as they are judged by the Sheriff, and may like him proceed in time of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance, to judge these crimes, to which he is otherwise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent. But it has been controverted whether Barrons have been Judges competent to Processes, for penal Statutes; since the penalty there was to be applyed to the Kings Fisk, and so should be judged in his own Court: but the Lords found the 3. of <hi>February</hi> 1674. that they were Judges competent
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:55274:218"/>
to penal Statutes, by the constant custome of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Albeit in civil cases, Barrons may appoint Bailies; yet <hi>Balfour cap.</hi> 63. observes, that <hi>in criminalibus,</hi> no person below the degree of a Barron, may sit upon Blood, <hi>nam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas gladii est meri imperii quae nullo modo delegari potest,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be an express power given by the Soveraign for that effect, as in the case of Justices, and Sheriffs, who have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Deput; and that power of Deputation were unnecessar, if it were otherwise competent.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Clerks of all other Courts must be Notars, but the Clerk of a Barron Court needs not be a Nottar; and yet the Decreet of a Barron for an unlaw will be sustain'd, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a confession, though the confession be not subscrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as is observed by <hi>Durie,</hi> the <hi>penult</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1622. But by an Act of <hi>Sederunt,</hi> it is ordain'd, that no sentence of any Inferiour Court, for above an hundreth Pounds, shall be sustain'd, except it be otherwise warranted, then by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Clerk.</p>
               <p>Albeit by the 75. <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 6. <hi>K. Ia.</hi> 5. the Barrons Precepts (for Summonds in that Court is so called) should be execute, as Summonds before the Lords, and Coppies should be left, and they indorsed upon; yet the 11. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1634. <hi>Hay,</hi> against <hi>Airth,</hi> it was found, that executions by a Barrons Officer are valid, though not given in Writ, and that the same are probable by Witnesses.</p>

It is Statute, that Malefactors, who hold of Barrons, may be condemned after the same manner, that other Malefactors are, except in the four Pleys of the Crown, in which, Barrons have no power; from which it may be very clearly inferred, that <hi>quo ad,</hi> other crimes they have, <hi>nam exceptio firmat regulam in non exceptis.</hi> 3. By the 91. <hi>Act, Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>I.</hi> 2. It is Statute, if a man be slain in the Barrony, if the Barron be Infest with such freedom, he may proceed as the Sheriff doth. And albeit <hi>Hope</hi> in his larger Practiques, observes, that these words of the Act <hi>(if he be Infest with such freedom</hi>) may receive various interpretations; yet I see no interpretation they can properly receive, except this, that these words are meant, if he have the Jurisdiction proper and competent to a Barron, which is Pit and Gallows, <hi>nam verba generabia interpretanda sunt secundum subjectam mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Albeit wilful Fire-raising be one of the Pleys of the Crown, yet a Barron may cognosce upon, and punish the raisers of Fire rashly, within Husband Towns in the Barrony, <hi>I.</hi> 1. <hi>Parl.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 75. The words of which Statutes, are, if Fire happen within Husband Towns of Barronies, we leave them to be punished by their Lords, in like manner, as Bailiffs in Towns do within Burgh; in which Act, by the word, Lords, are meant Barrons, for they are in several Acts of Parliament, called Lords of their own Land, or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony.</p>
               <p>A Barron may unlaw for absence, for ten Pounds, but not above, and for blood, he may unlaw for fifty Pounds, but not above.</p>

for which the committer is to be conveened. Which interval is given to the Judge competent to do diligence, and if he omit the same during that time, then the Justices may judge the same, and one Justice has power to bind the party complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon, to the peace, under such pecunial Sums as he shall think fit, and that either at the instance of a complainer, who shall give his oath that he dreads harm or the Justice himself may exact the sum, though none complain. And if any person being charged to make his appearance before the Justice of peace shall refuse, it he be a landed man, whose rent exceeds a thousand Merks, or ten Chalders of Victual, then he shall inform any of his Majesties Privy Council, or if he be a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er person, he may cause bring him by force before himself.</p>
               <p>If the Sheriff, or Bailiff condemn any person in blood-weit, or any other pain, but not proportionally to the offence; then the Justices shall inform the Privy Council, that they may take order therewith; but if there be no satisfaction made by the Sheriff or Bailiff to the party, the Justices may modify a reasonable satisfaction.</p>

               <p n="1">I. ALL Nations have committed the cognition of crimes, to the wisest of their Judges, because our lives are our greatest concern, and if the Judge erre there, his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour can seldom be repair'd. The <hi>Athenians</hi> had the <hi>Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page</hi> for their Criminal Court, which was the most famous Court, then in the World, of whom the <hi>Grecians</hi> us'd to say, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And they judged Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, in a particular place, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it was very numerous, and the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:55274:221"/>
that were committed within the Town, <hi>&amp; intra centesimum lapidem,</hi> and the Proconsuls, and Presidents, judged crimes in the Countrey. But the <hi>praefectus praetorio, praefectus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustalis, Comes Orientis, &amp; vicarius praefecti praetorio,</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a criminal jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>The Justice Court with us, had for its Members, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice-General, the Justice-Clerk, the Justice-Deputs, the Clerk-Depute, the Dempster, the Officer, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Justice-General is constitute by a Gift under the great Seal, either <hi>ad vitam,</hi> or by a temporary Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but still under the great Seal; his Sallary of old, was five Pounds for every day of the Justice Air, <hi>leg. Malcol. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>num.</hi> 3.1. but now it is arbitrary, and the ordinary Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, by his Gift, is two hundreth Pound Sterling, to be uplifted by himself, out of the Fines of Courts, and if he cannot attain to payment that way, out of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</p>
               <p>The Justice-Court of old, was the only Soveraign Court of the Nation, and had then a great part of that Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Session hath now; for they were Judges to Recognitions, Brieves of <hi>Mortancestrie, Dissasine, Purpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi> and districtions for debts, <hi>Reg.

And after the constitution of the Session, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd still Judges to Perambulations, and Brieves were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in Latine, for tryal thereof, and the reason hereof seems to be, because as the Civil Law observes, <hi>ad armacurritur in sinibus regundis,</hi> and the fittest person for compeseing such tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, was the Justice-general; but now the She<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ffs, and Lords of Session cognosce such cases: and I having caused raise an Advocation from the Sheriff of <hi>Tividale,</hi> at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of some <hi>Iedburgh</hi> men, to the Justice-general, <hi>ex hoc capite,</hi> the Lords would not sustain the Advocation; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:55274:221"/>
the case back to the Sheriff, whom they found also competent, so that such Brievs may yet be directed to the Justice general, though he have not a privative jurisdiction therein.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I find the Justice-general, call'd the chief Justice in all the Registers, <hi>Annis.</hi> 1637. and 1638. and the principal Justiciar, <hi>Anno</hi> 1503. The Justice-Deputs were not limitted to any definit number, but usually they were two, and have each a pension from His <hi>Majesty,</hi> when they were constitute, by a Gift from him, which passes the Privy Seal only, and these were still call'd His <hi>Majesties</hi> Justice-Deputs, and are not Deputs to the Justice-general; for else they could not sit in judgement with him as they do, and in effect they have an equal power, and voice with him: but when he makes a Deput, he should not sit with him, <hi>nam delegatus non simul concurrit.</hi> And I find Mr. <hi>Alexander Colvil,</hi> call'd in his Gift, General-justice-deput, which is done to denotat the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of the Jurisdiction; and to distinguish them from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices in that part, such as are these Noble-men and others, who have the power of Justiciary over their own Lands. And in <hi>Binnies</hi> case, the Lords having remitted him to be tryed by the Justice-general and his Deputs; the Justice-deputs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that they accepted only of the remit, as meaning they were His <hi>Majesties</hi> Justice-deputs: and when His <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi> directs any Letter to them, he directs it to our tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and well beloved Cozen and Councellour, to our tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and well beloved, our Justice-general, and Justice-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puts.</p>
               <p>Of old, I find there were eight Justice-deputs. The Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice-deputs had formerly the priviledge of being Present at the Council, which was very fit, because many criminal cases comes in before them, and they retain still the priviledge of being Present at Parliaments: they were call'd <hi>attornati ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticiarii, quon. attach. c.</hi> 61. <hi>&amp; assis.

By the 1. Article of the Regulation, 3. <hi>Session</hi> 2. <hi>Par.

It seems, that of old, the Writers to the Signet, did use to write criminal Letters, without receiving Caution; but that is discharged by the 34. <hi>Act</hi> 4. <hi>Par. Ia.</hi> 5. And now, though Writers to the Signet may subscribe the Letters, yet the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice-clerk-deput can only write the deliverance upon the Bill, and receive caution.

But Sir <hi>William Bellenden</hi> being challenged before the Council, for many Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots and Crimes committed when he was in the West, they would not remit him to a Council of War, albeit that decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator was proponed. <hi>August</hi> 1667.

               <p n="2">II. The most considerable Military questions, which I remember in all the Adjournal books: are first, that which was debated, 5. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1666. the case wherof was, some west coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men had formed themselves in an Army, and were decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Traitors by the Council, and being thereafter beat at <hi>Pentland</hi> hills, Captain <hi>Arnot,</hi> Major <hi>Mackulloch,</hi> and others, were taken, by some of his Majesties inferior Officers, upon quarter, but being pannelled before the Justices, as Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, it was alledged for them, that they could not be put to the knowledge of an inquest before the Justices, because they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been modelled in an army, and taken in the field fighting as Souldiers, they behoved to be judged by the Military Law, and by that Law, such as get quarter in the field, are by that quarter secured therin for their lives, and cannot be hereafter qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rrelled. To which it was replyed, that there can be no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but where there is a <hi>bellum justum,</hi> and it is not the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:55274:224"/>
nor form of the Army, but the cause that makes <hi>bellum justum,</hi> and publick insurrections of subjects against their Prince, are rather Sedition, then <hi>bellum</hi>; and these insurrections, being Treason, none can remit Treason but the King, and therefore quarter could not be equivalent to a remission, but all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of quarter in this case, is to secure these who get the same from present death. To which it was duplyed, that all who got quarter from any who are authorized to be Souldiers, are by that quarter against that authority from whom these Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers derive their power, and these who get the quarter, are not to dispute, whether these Souldiers had a sufficient power to give quarter, or whether <hi>bellum</hi> be <hi>justum</hi> or <hi>injustum,</hi> for that were in effect to destroy quarter in all cases, and to make all such as take up Armes, to be desperat and irreclaimable; and the power of giving of quarter is naturally inherent in all Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as such: and as the Council, without expresse remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the King, upon submission might have secured their lives, so might Souldiers by quarter, for they have as much power in the field, as the others at the Council Table. 2.

               <p>Notwithstanding of which reply, the defence was repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the Pannels condemned, and thereafter execute.</p>
               <p>The second question was, that which was debated in <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's</hi>
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:55274:225"/>
case, 16. <hi>March</hi> 1642. At which time that Loyal Gentleman <hi>Haddo,</hi> being pursued, for killing Mr. <hi>Iames Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> Servitor to the Lord <hi>Frazer,</hi> he alledged that the said Mr. <hi>Iames</hi> was killed in the open field, in a conflict betwixt the Convenanters, and Ante-Covenanters: All which Acts of ostility were remitted by the pacification. To which, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was replyed, that the Pacification did only secure against acts of hostility, which were done <hi>in furore belli</hi>; but this was a privat murder; for the said Mr. <hi>Iames</hi> having been taken a Prisoner, <hi>Haddo</hi> did come up to him, and asked whose servant he was, and hearing that he was servant to the Lord <hi>Frazer,</hi> he said, your masters man is the person that I am seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thereupon ordered to kill him, which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done; by which it clearly appears, that this was a privat murder done in cold blood, and upon premeditat ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and Mr. <hi>Iames Stalker,</hi> being a Prisoner, any who killed him; was liable for his murder, <hi>ex jure militari,</hi> and the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication could no more defend the committer, then if he had gone into a prison and killed a prisoner, or if he had committed a Rapt upon a woman; likeas Murderers are expresly excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the pacification. 2. <hi>Haddo</hi> was no general person, and so could not give order for his execution; and so the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the defunct was not warrantable by the Law of Armes. To which, it was duplyed, that the pacification did secure against all deeds whatsoever done upon the field, by persons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in either party, without debating, whether the deed was lawfully or unlawfully done, and the occasion, and not the manner of killing, is to be considered. And as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is answered, that Mr. <hi>Iames</hi> had never got any quarter, and so was not a Prisoner in War; and therefore might have been killed by any engaged in the quarrel, whether general person, or other. But the truth is, the said <hi>Haddo</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that party which was equivalent to his being a general person; and albeit the pacification did expresly except mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet that behoved only to be interpret of such murders,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:55274:225"/>
as had no contingency with the troubles, nor were occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them: this debate was not decided, but was remitted to the Parliament; and that worthy Gentle-man executed, for rising in arms against the Estates of Parliament.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I find, that there was a Commission granted by the Parliament, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1644. to two Bailies of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to sit, and hold justice Courts, upon such Souldiers, as were runaways, and that upon this Commission, <hi>Iames French</hi> was condemned by them, for running away from his Collours, contrary to the Act of Parliament 1644. and was hanged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. From which, these observations may be made, 1. That the Justices are not Judges competent to crimes, that are meerly Military. 2. That we have no standing Law for executing runaways, beside the Martial Law; nor was there any Law founded upon this inditement, except the Act of Parliament 1644. which is now abrogat. 3. It is observe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that one Mr. <hi>Alexander Henderson,</hi> as Procurator Fis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and not His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat, was here pursuer. From all which, it seems somewhat strange, that this Process should have been insert in the Adjournal Books.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But albeit deserters were here punisht with death; yet <hi>regulariter milites gregarij,</hi> or listed Souldiers, are only punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in time of Peace, with degredation, and in time of War, with death, because the hazard is then greater, <hi>l.</hi> 5. §. 1. <hi>ff. de remilit.</hi> and by that Law they may be killed by any man, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cod. quando liciat. unic.</hi> &amp;c.

               <p n="1">I. ADvocation is the away calling of an intended cause, or pursuit, from an inferiour, incompetent judicatory, to a higher, and more competent; and is the same thing with
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:55274:226"/>
us, that <hi>recusatio judicis,</hi> was with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and is by the Doctors, call'd <hi>advocatio,</hi> or <hi>evocatio,</hi> which is by them defined to be, <hi>litis pendentis coram inferiore ad superiorem abs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que provocatione facta translatio Gail. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>obs.</hi> 41, <hi>num.</hi> 7. and is founded upon <hi>cap. ut nostrum de appell, &amp; l. jud. solvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ff. de jud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Their is no Advocation raised of pursuits, intented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Justices, but if ther be any design of stopping a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit depending before them, there useth to be a Petition giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in to the Lords of Secret Council, who, if they find the desire of the Petition just, will ordain the Justices to stop all further procedor, or will remit the inquiry to any other Court, as they did in a pursuit, intented at the instance of the Earl of <hi>Caithness,</hi> against some Vassals of the Earl of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> which they stopt, as to the Earl himself, and ordained his Vassals to be pursued before his own Regality Court: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also, they ordain Assessors to be Justices, so that there is never a cause formally Advocat, from before the Justices; albeit those courses, and Repledgiations be equivalent to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Advocations may be rais'd from inferiour criminal Judges, by the Lords of Session, as in the case of Theft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boot, before the Sheriff of <hi>Inverness,</hi> and Advocat by the Lords, because of the intricacy of the case; albeit, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged there, that the Lords were not Judges competent, in such Advocations, because they could not be Judges to the crimes pursued. To which it was answered, that though they could not be judges themselves, yet they might remit the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit, to these who were competent; even as Brieves raised, for serving a person Air, may be Advocat to the Lords, who may remit the case to another Inquest: But <hi>Durhie</hi> observes, the 9. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1629. that <hi>Kincaid</hi> of <hi>Waristoun,</hi> craving that the Process against him, for slaughter, might be Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat by the Lords, to the Justices, because of the ignorance
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:55274:227"/>
of the Barron Bailie, or else that they would grant Assessors; the Lords continued the Diet, till application should be made to the Council, but if the Council would not interpose, then they should do justice therein, by remitting the same to the Justices, or otherwise. But Advocations in criminal cases, are ordinarly raised by the Privy Council, who have the most natural power in such cases.</p>
               <p>Advocations are raised upon Bills, and the Letters pass the Signet of the Session, if the Bills be past, by the Lords of Session; or of the Council, if the Bill be past by the Lords of Council.</p>
               <p>This Advocation must be execute by a Messenger, and a full Copy must be given of the Letters, as in other Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; for in effect, an Advocation is a Summonds, and the Diets in Advocations are peremptor, as in all other crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pursuits: Neither is the Advocation given up to see, as in other criminal pursuits, at the day of compearance; and therefore a full Coppy should be given, to the end, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender may be ready to answer. The pursuer of the Action must be cited, and the Judge from whom the Action is to be Advocat, must be also cited, to the effect, he may defend his own jurisdiction; and if both these be not cited, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation will not be sustain'd.</p>
               <p>When the day of compearance comes, if the Advocation be raised before the Session, it is called before the Session, and if the reasons of Advocation be found relevant, the cause is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Justices; but, if that Advocation be raised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council, it is called before the Justices, and they are Judges to the relevancy of the reasons, and both pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and defender, must prove all that they alledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly.</p>
               <p>The Advocation of a criminal pursuit, doth contain the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons upon which it is founded, as in civil Advocations; but though <hi>in civilibus,</hi> the raiser of the Advocation will be
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:55274:227"/>
allowed to add a reason, though it be not libelled, which is called an eiked reason; yet that is not allowed, <hi>in criminali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> because all must be proved, <hi>instanter,</hi> and the defender is not able to prove his answer instantly, if he know not what is the reason, which he must answer, whereas, <hi>in civilibus,</hi> he will get a term to prove his answer, to the eiked rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The ordinary reasons of Advocation, are, 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity, or Affin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>esse Law for this, yet the Lords encline ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly to sustain this, and particularly in the Moneth of <hi>Decem.</hi> 1676. <hi>Ross contra Collodine,</hi> where a Decreet was turned in a Libel, because, pronounced by a Nephew, albeit it was there alledged, that by the 212. <hi>Act,</hi> 14. <hi>Parl.

               <p>It may be doubted, whether the Justices, or any of them, may be declined, as within degrees defendant; for though they must now be Senators of the Colledge of justice, yet they sit not there as such, nor are the Justice-general, or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice-clerk alwayes of that number; but yet I think, that since the Justice Court is a supream Judicatory, in its own kind, and that this respect that is put upon them, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their Eminency, and presum'd integrity, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they being the same persons, ought to have the same pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,

and the Justice-general, and Justice-clerks being superior in order to the Lords of Session, who are Justiciars, ought at least to have as great trust: but though the Admiral be a supream Judge also, yet it may be doubted, if this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute should be extended to him; because men of meaner parts may officiat there.</p>
               <p>It may be also doubted, whether this declinator against fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, brothers, and sons, should extend to the degrees of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity, as well as those of consanguinity, so that a father, or brother in Law may be declined, and though the Lords lately would not decline one of their number, though brother in Law to the pursuer; yet it may be argued, that albeit Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament must be strictly interpreted, yet where there is a pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reason, and the words may in propriety admit of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension, there the extention is to be allowed; but so it is, that here a brother in Law, is to be suspected, and a brother in Law, is in propriety of speech, a brother: Likeas, since wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses may be cast upon the suspition of affinity; why may not Judges? especially seing in the Statute 1621. against dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by Bankrupts: and in the opinion of Lawyers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of affinity, and consanguinity are still equiparat, and so wise are we in this point, that a pursuite, at the instance of a Procurator-fiskal, was Advocat upon this Statute, because the Procurator-fiskal, was brother to the Judge, though he was only pursuing <hi>ratione officii,</hi> and had no interest himself, and expresly renounced all interest in the pursuite, 28. <hi>Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 1629.</p>
               <p>Whether this statute is to be extended to unlawful relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; so that a Bastards brother, &amp;c. may be declined, <hi>vide,</hi> my observations upon the Statute 1621.</p>
               <p>Another reason of Advocation like to this, is that one of the members of the Court is pursuer; as for instance, the pursuite is at the instance of one of two Sheriff deputs, before his own colleague: <hi>habet quippe Societas jus quoddam fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis

               <p>A third reason of Advocation is, that the Judge is suspect, as if he had given partial counsel, or if he has repelled a just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or as being severe, above what the Law allows. 4. That he is incompetent, the case pursued being only proper to be tryed by the Justices, as being one of the four Pleys of the Crown, <hi>viz.</hi> Treason, Murder, Fire-raising, and Ravishing of Women; but sometimes, though the first Libel have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Treason, as in the case of <hi>Peddies, Ianuary,</hi> 1667. yet if the pursuer will restrict his action to damnage, and interest; but will desert the dyet as to the criminal pursuit it may be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd. 5. That the case is very intricat, as in a pursuit of Theft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boot, which was Advocat from the Sheriff-deput of <hi>Invernesse, eo ex capite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Members of the Colledge of Justice also pretend, that they cannot be pursued before any other Court, because this would draw them from attending the Session, but the <hi>Act</hi> 39. <hi>Pa.</hi> 6. <hi>Q. M.</hi> whereon this is founded, seems only to hold in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movings, so that no Action concerning Removings, should be Advocat, but in these cases, <hi>viz.</hi> deadly fead, where the Judge ordinary is party, or the defender a member of the Session and yet <hi>de praxi,</hi> that part of the Statute is extended to all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations But they cannot Advocat from the Justice Court.</p>
               <p>If the cause be Advocated, the pursuer of the first Libel, which is Advocated, must find caution <hi>de novo,</hi> to insist in the pursuit, else the Justices will desert the dyet, which cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is necessary, because the Judicature before which the cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was found, is altered, and neither the pursuer, nor his cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:55274:229"/>
are bound to insist before any other court.</p>
               <p>The defender likewise of the first cause, and who raised. the Advocation, is obliedged to renew his caution, that he will underly the Law, else the Justices will imprison him.</p>
               <p>The taiser of the Advocation must intimat to the pursuer of the principal cause, that he has raised an Advocation, to the end, that the said pursuer may be ready to insist at the day, to which the advocation is raised, and when the Procurator-fiskal, is the pursuer before the Court from which the cause is Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, the raiser of the Advocation should intimat to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Advocat, to the end he may be ready to insist, for His Majesties Advocat is in the Justice-Court, what the Procurator fiskal is in inferiour Courts: The office of both, being to pursue <hi>vindictam publicam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. The old custome was (as some alledge) that the Lords of Session judged all the Advocations, which were raised in Criminal causes, from inferiour Judges, even to the Justice Court and very judicious Lawyers do yet hold, that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices cannot judge, whether they be competent Judges in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Advocated from inferiour Criminal Courts, but that the Lords of Session should cognosce, whether the cause should be Advocat; and if they sustain the reason of Advocation, that they should remit the cause to be tryed by the Justices, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the tryal to the Court from which it was Advocated; if the reason of Advocation be not relevant: for they think it unreasonable, that the Justices should be Judges of their own competency; but since the Justices are supream and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Judges, as well as the Lords of Session, and since the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices are now many, and are Lords of the Session also, it seems reasonable, that they should be Judges to their own competency, especially since these reasons of Advocation do very frequently did upon Subtilties of the Criminal Law, and cannot be well judged, but by such as understand that Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly: as for instance, I have seen an Advocation raised of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel

In which Advocation these points were necessarily debated, 1. Whether Lords of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality were Judges to Treason. 2. Whether though they were Judges competent to Treason, founded upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, yet if they were Judges to Statutory Treason. 3. Whether though burning a Coal-heugh was Treason by Statute, yet if drowning of it fell under that Statute: all which po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nts were <hi>indagationis criminalis,</hi> and these who could judge such points, might judge any criminal case: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, both by the old and new stile of Advocations, raised either by the Council, or Criminal Court, the Letters bear, that the reasons are to be seen, and considered by the Justices, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly upon the Advocation, caution is found in the books of adjournal, and to answer before the Justices, and the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have been in constant possession of judging such reasons.</p>
               <p>And whereas it may be alledged, that though the Lords of Session are not Judges to crimes; yet the case of competency, in the matter of Jurisdiction is meerly Civil, and so it would seem proper to be judged by the Lords, especially since it is nor just, that the Justices should be Judges in their own cause. To which it may be answered, that though this case be civil, yet it has so necessary a contingency with what is criminal, as I have observed, that they ought not to be divided, since the Lords of Session are judges competent to Advocations, wherein their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">I. WHen a crime is committed, the Council, or the Justices, did of old, take a previous Inquisition of it, by examining Witnesses, and taking such other infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as they thought fit: And these depositions, and ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, are called <hi>informationes</hi> by the Doctors; but though they may examine Witnesses, before the intenting of a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pursuit: yet after it is once intented, the Justices found the 8. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1672. that they could not examine Witnesses; for the Inquisition ends by the intenting of the pursuit, <hi>&amp; ubi incipit accusatio desinit inquisitio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctors are very profuse on this subject, but I shall only excerpt from them, what is most suitable to our forms and practice; they define Inquisition to be an information of the crime, taken by the Judges own authority, <hi>&amp; ex officio</hi>: and they divide it in a general Inquisition, which is taken of the crime in general, without taking notice of any particular informer, or defender. And a special Inquisition which is taken against a particular person, of whose guilt they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:55274:230"/>
By the Civil Law, no Judge could proceed against any privat person, without an accuser; for Inquisition was by that Law, an extraordinar remedy, and no recourse could be had to an extraordinar remedy, till accusation, which was the ordinary remedy, were first tryed. But by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, Inquisition was declared to be an ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: and all the Doctors conclude, that generally, a Judge may now, by the practice of Nations inquire, <hi>ex officio,</hi> in all crimes, <hi>Farin. de inquisit. quest.</hi> 1. <hi>num.</hi> 10. which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to our Law; by which the Council, or Justices, may inquire into all crimes, without waiting for an accuser, which is done with us, without citation of the party, or other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities; but nothing can follow, till after information be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, an Enditement, or Summonds be raised, which is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed according to the ordinar rules. But yet, I think, that the Judge should not enquire, or take any previous tryal, even in our Law, where an accuser offers to insist, except he has just reason to fear collusion, for <hi>non recurrendum est ad extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarium remedium dum locus est ordinario</hi>: and albeit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition be declared by the Doctors, to be an ordinary reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet it is only declared so, to the effect, that a Judge may inquire, without any accuser, and that the Inquisition so taken, be not <hi>ipso jure</hi> null; but naturally, every man should have liberty to pursue the privat wrong done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which may be prejudged, either by the want of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or zeal of the Judge ordinar, and sometimes by col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion; and thus I have seen many Decreets, of inferiour Courts, wherein the defender was by collusion, fin'd at the Procurator-fiskals instance, reduced by the Lords, and not sustain'd by the Council; when it was alledged, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wronged appeared, and offered to pursue, but was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. And albeit, because of the wrong which is done to the publick, a Judge may likewise inquire: yet he who is
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:55274:231"/>
principally wrong'd, should be allowed to be chief in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution. And therefore, albeit the Council may in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick crimes, where the peace of the Countrey is chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, take precognition of it, and stop accusations, rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Justices, at a privat parties instance, as they did in the pursuit, at the instance of the <hi>Stranaver</hi> men, against the Earl of <hi>Caithness.</hi> And others for Fire raising, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations, in <hi>August.</hi> 1668. yet they refuse to stop accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and will not grant precognitions, in privat murders, or such like crimes, where privat persons are principally wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except the rigour of Law require some abatement.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It appears also, that pursuits at His <hi>Majesties</hi> instance, are only subsidiary, <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. <hi>Par.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 140. by which Act it is clear, that crimes may be punished at the Kings <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties</hi> instance, if no privat follower appears, and <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl,</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 76. where it is Statute, that the Thesaurer, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat, may pursue privat crimes, although the parties be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or would agree. From which Acts, two things may be concluded, 1. That of old, it was doubted if the King could pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue privat crimes, without an accuser. 2. That pursuits at His <hi>Majesties</hi> instance, for privat crimes, are yet only subsidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and allowable, if parties be silent, or collude. Which distinction, doth in my oppinion, solve that great debate amongst the Doctors, <hi>utrum accusatio cessare facit inquisitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nota,</hi> that albeit by the said Act, it is Statute, that the Thesaurer, and Advocat, may pursue without concourse of the party, yet <hi>de practicae,</hi> the pursuit is only raised at the Advocats instance, and so the particle (<hi>and)</hi> seems to be disjunctive, as <hi>and</hi> is very oft in the Civil Law. And it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that a pursuit at the Thesaurers instance, would be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd, without concourse of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat, if the Advocat should refuse his concourse</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:55274:231"/>III. The Doctors conclude, that a Judge cannot enquire summarly, <hi>&amp; necesse est ut, vel indicia, vel delator, vel diffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio àperiant viam inquisitioni,</hi> for else every Judge might diffame the best and most innocent men, at their pleasure, so that if a Judge have not some rise for his inquiry, I really believe he is punishable in our Law, for putting a person to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition for a crime, <hi>&amp; sindicandus est ex eo capite,</hi> but the malice of the Judge must be very clearly proved in that case.</p>
               <p>Of old, Judges did appoint Delators, whom might inform, <hi>denunciatores dicebantur</hi>; but of late, this employment doth belong to the Fisk, <hi>&amp; ejus sindicis.</hi> And by our Law, to His Majesties Advocat, in the Justice Court, and to the Fis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kal, in inferiour Courts; and they may pursue, or inform in Inquisitions, <hi>sine paena calumniae quia cessat in iis suspicio ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniae ex eo quod denunciant ex officio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the 13. <hi>Act</hi> 10. <hi>Par, Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Charges super inquirendis,</hi> are discharged, but it is a mistake to think, that by that Act, the King, or other Judges, cannot examine men, without a formal Process: for the design of that Act, is only to discharge the denouncing men Rebels upon such charges, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious tryal; and yet if the chief Officers of State, or at least four of them concurr. It would seem that by that Act, even such charges are yet lawful. And where the King, or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat has previous information of crimes latent, it were against the interest of the Common-wealth, that they should not be allowed to clear themselves of these, by particular interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>

               <p>There is likewise this difference betwixt an inditement, and an accusation, that an inditement properly is a Libel raised at the Kings instance, and not at the instance of any privat person; for in accusations, or Libels raised at the instance of privat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as pursuers, there must be a formal libelled Summonds under the Signet, so <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>R.

It seems likewise reasonable, that some distinction should be made, betwixt a pursuer and a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in this case; for it seems unreasonable, that he who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses another for a crime, should debar him from self-defence, though the debarring him from pursuit, be not so unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and upon this accompt, in a case betwixt <hi>Ninian Spence</hi> and <hi>Hector Bannatine,</hi> the Justices found, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer

And if in our last reformation of the Justice Court, it was found that the Kings Advocat should not make the roll of Assizers, because he is too much interested, much lesse should he for the same reason, be allowed to examine the witnesses, since that is not allowed to the Advocats for the defenders.</p>

not to allow it, where they are forced to plead, as they ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily are in cases of Treason, and yet if any Advocat will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his own escapes against authority, he may be punished by deprivation, but his punishment extends no further, even where he speaks Treason, as was found in the Senat of <hi>Savoy, Cod. fabr. tit. de paenis defin.</hi> 19.</p>

               <p n="1">I. A Libel is generally by Lawyers thought to be a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism, wherein the proposition (as we call it) is founded upon the Law, and though the proposition be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times generally conceived thus, that albeit by several Acts of Parliament, the crime of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be expresly forbidden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet it is more regular to expresse the particular Acts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the proposition is founded. The subsumption of the Libel, is the matter of Fact, which should condescend upon
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:55274:240"/>
the actors names, and designations, and upon the place where the crime was committed, either expresly, as the House of such a man, or <hi>per cohaerentias,</hi> as Lawyers speak, as that it was done near such an Hill, Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

That the place must be designed, is expresly required, <hi>l. libellorum, ff. de accus.</hi> But whether the Day, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth must be exprest, is more controverted; and by the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula,</hi> exprest in the former Law, the Place and Moneth, are necessar, and to that <hi>formula,</hi> is there subjoined, thir words, <hi>ne<expan>

                  </gap>e precluded from proving his innocence, <hi>Bart. in l. is qui reus, ff. de pub.

As also, if the pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can upon Oath depone, that he doth not remember the Day, and that he does not omit the same maliciously, <hi>eo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su,</hi> he is not obliged to express the same, <hi>Clar. q.</hi> 12. <hi>num.</hi> 13. But the former difficulty in this case still remains, which is, that the defender loseth the benefite of this defence, and is prejudged by his accusers ignorance, which seems to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just: and therefore <hi>Cook</hi> 7. <hi>rep. Calvins</hi> case observes, that an inditement should be most curiously, and certainly penn'd, and by the 37. <hi>Stat. Hen.</hi> 8. the Day, Year, and Place must be insert. By the 80. <hi>ch. quon. attach.</hi> these seven are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, the Names of the Parties, Day, Year, and Place, Cause of the Complaint, and Damnage. According to our Law, either the crime is such, as depends upon time, as is the striking one in the Session-House, whilst the Lords sit;
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:55274:241"/>
or the wounding, or killing one in time of Divine Service, and in these the particular time must be both libelled, and proved; because the time is not there a meer circumstance, but it is the <hi>medium concludendi</hi>; and therefore a Libel in Deforcement, was not found relevant, because it condescended not upon the time, since it was lawful, if the Rebel had been apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Sabbath, 1671. but I think that this might have been propon'd as a defence, and that the Libel without the Day, was relevant; but there also, the Year was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, nor would the Justices allow the filling up the same at the Barr, as in civil cases; but in other cases, where the crime depends not upon time, we use to Libel in the Moneths of <hi>May, Iune, Iuly,</hi> &amp;c. or one, or other of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, Weeks, or Dayes of the said Moneths, but the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Day, is not found necessary, as in the case of one <hi>Hay I</hi> was found the 5. of <hi>November</hi> 1612. and likewise upon the 8. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1615. where a dittay of theft, was found rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, though neither condescending upon the Day, nor the marks of the Goods: And in my Lord <hi>Argyls</hi> case, the Parliament found it not necessary to condescend, even upon the Moneth, but the ordinary Caution allowed the defender, in that case, is, that the defender may offer to prove, that <hi>quo ad,</hi> some particular Dayes of these Moneths, he was <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi,</hi> and <hi>quo ad</hi> these, the Libel will not be relevant, nor he passe thereupon, to the knowledge of an inquest, but will get a precept of exculpation: as for instance, if one should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of killing a man, in the Moneth of <hi>March,</hi> upon the Street of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he might alledge, that <hi>quo ad,</hi> the first fourth-night he was at <hi>London, quo ad,</hi> so many other dayes thereof he was at <hi>New-castle,</hi> &amp;c. And if the Witnesses, when the Libel comes to Probation, do depone, that upon any of these dayes the crime was committed, in which <hi>alibi</hi> is proved, the defender will not be thereupon convict; for though the pursuer needs not condescend upon the Day, yet the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses must condescend upon it, in the case where <hi>alibi</hi> is offered
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:55274:241"/>
to be proved, but otherwayes it may be controverted whether a Libel be relevant, bearing in the general, the committing of the Crime, but not condescending upon the particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: as for instance, if it should be subsumed upon the Acts against fore-stalling and regrating, that the defender did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal, but did not condescend upon the particular persons, from whom the corns were bought; or in usury, if the pursuer should not condescend upon the particular way how the usury was committed; and in my opinion, <hi>regulariter,</hi> the crimes should be particularly subsumed; because else the relevancy cannot be debated before the Justices, and the assize should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly judge of the matter of Law, and the Pannel should be put oft to the knowledge of an inquest, upon irrelevant crimes, all which were absurd; but yet there are some crimes, such as fore-stalling, and regrating, in which it is sufficient to libel the Crime, without condescending upon the particulars, for in this crime it is declared by 148. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 12. <hi>K. I.</hi> 6. that a Libel bearing common regrating, or fore-stalling, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral shall be relevant, without condescending on the time, and way of committing the same. And accordingly upon the 11. <hi>Iune</hi> 1596. A Libel against <hi>Young</hi> and others, for fore-stalling was found relevant, though it condescended not upon the particular persons against whom this crime was committed: And it may be debated, that a person being pursued for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon usury, if that crime of common usury, may be sustained without any particular condescention, because both the rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vany, and probation is referred to his own Oath, and so he is not precluded from any defence, but since it was necessary by a particular Law in regrating, to appoint the Libel to be found relevant upon that general, it seems to follow, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly the particular way, and manner must be condescended upon; else that particular dispensation had not been necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Whether a conclusion be necessary in Criminal Libels, is likewise debated amongst Lawyers; but the common opion is, that it is not, because though in Civil cases, the pursuer
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:55274:242"/>
may crave more, or lesse, nor what is due to him, yet in Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, either the penalty is determined by a Law, which the Judge must follow, though it be not craved, or otherwise the pain is Arbitrary, and there the pursuer cannot by his petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on determine the same, but must leave it to the Judge, <hi>l.</hi> 1. §. <hi>quorum ff. ad S. C. turpil. l. ff. de privat delicti l. ordine ff. ad unicipalem,</hi> and in the form set down <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>ff. de accusatio:</hi> by <hi>Paulus,</hi> there is no conclusion exprest, but yet with us, there is alwayes a conclusion in every Libel, though it be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and I perceive that most of the practitioners are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that at least a general conclusion should be added.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Whether a Libel being libelled <hi>qualificate,</hi> the pursuer may passe from the quality, has been thus determined by Lawyers, that if the quality amount to another different crime, it cannot be past from, but if the quality amount only to an aggraging circumstance, it may be past from. As for instance, if the pursuer Libel upon the Act of Parliament, whereby murder under trust, is Treason, and subsume that the Pannel is guilty of murder under trust, in so far as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son murdered, was father to the murderer, if when the case is to be tryed, the pursuer should declare, that he insists against him as a Murderer simply, because he is not sure to prove, that the person killed was father: I think <hi>eo casu,</hi> the pursuer could not so reform or declare his Libel, for that makes the crimes to differ, the one being Murder, the other Treason, and the defender was only obliedged to prepare him to defend against Treason, and finding that he was secure, as to the crime libelled, he needed not prepare other defences, or raise exculpations for that effect; but these qualities which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount only to aggravations, may be past from, as was decided, 11. <hi>November</hi> 1672. For <hi>Aikma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> having pursued <hi>Carnegy</hi> of <hi>Newgate</hi> for oppression, conform to the 25. <hi>Act</hi> 4. <hi>Parl. K. I:</hi> 5. because he had beat him, who was a Magistrat, in the exercise of his Office, the Justices having found, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:55274:242"/>
could not in the construction of Law be repute a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat, because he had not taken the Declaration, it was thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alledged, that the Libel being only founded upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Statute conceived in favours of Magistrats, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion being against oppression, and not against beating the pursuer, could no more insist upon that Libel, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, for the Justices found, that the beating any man, was a crime, and the pursuer might insist against the defender for beating him, since his being a Magistrat was only an aggraging circumstance: Yet this seems a hard decision, since the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Libel, did not bear, that beating was punishable, nor did the conclusion bear, that at least the Panel was punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for beating a free Liedge: &amp; if this were universaly allowed, alternative Libels were unnecessary, and this would occasion much looseness in Criminal Libels, whereas Lawyers trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Criminal Libels, have laid it down as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that <hi>in criminalibus non licet vagare,</hi> and the crimes of oppression, and beating, are different. Nor can it be denyed, but that a privat person differs from a Magistrat, so that this quality made the persons, the crimes, and the <hi>medium conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi</hi> to differ,</p>

<pb n="473" facs="tcp:55274:245"/>
Law, and a Principle in Reason, that <hi>quando aliquid concedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, omnia concessa videntur sine quibus hoc fieri nequit,</hi> and though where a party is taken reid hand, and confesses, the Judge ought to do present Justice upon him; yet that is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly introduced to make Judges diligent, but not at all to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude poor Pannels from their just defences, and it were a thing very inhumane, and unwarrantable, if a poor Pannel were taken reid hand, but could prove that he was forced to kill in self-defence; or if he could prove, that one of the Witnesses had been one of the Aggressors; that in either of these, or such like cases, he could not have time to cite Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses for that effect.</p>

Whether a person who is cited to compear in a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Court, as defender, at a particular day exprest in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, may not before that day appear in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> though he be banisht, was doubted, in the Action pursued at His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties</hi> instance, against several Gentle-men, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1674. and that they might come to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> was allowed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause being cited, they were commanded to come. 2. Their coming to Town was necessar, in order to their defence, and thus, when men are indited, they have the liberty of a free Prison, though till then they were ordered to be kept in close Prison; and yet some thought that this might be doubted, since they were once formally banisht, and so the banishment should be formally taken off, and the raising of a dittay is no discharge of the banishment, for else the Kings Advocat might discharge banishments when he pleased, and indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bear not to appear betwixt and such a day, but at such a day. 2. When men are under Caption, they may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if they appear before the day of compearance, if they have not a Protection, which shews, that a meer citation doth not take off the dangers, to which the person cited is liable. 3. Protections were needless, if this were allowed, for the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:55274:246"/>
would be a Protection, and yet Protections are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be granted to defenders in such cases.</p>
               <p>As also it was doubted there, if such as were cited upon six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days, might compear with others of their complices, who were cited upon six dayes, for it was urg'd, that the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon sixty dayes, was introduced in the defenders favours, and so he might renounce it, and possibly he cannot compear at the long Dyet; and yet it may be urged, that the pursuer has chosen his own Dyet, and it may be his true interest some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to divide the defenders, and sometimes his Probation cannot be sooner ready.</p>
               <p>When there are more pursuers, each Libelling a distinct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, as three brothers pursuing for the murther of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceast brothers, though they were all three killed at the same time, and in the same action. It has been found, that two of the pursuers being absent, the third could not insist: and so the diet was deserted, upon pretext that the Libel was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext, but I conceive, that the interests there were very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, though in the same Libel, and that though they had been all joint pursuers, yet the absence of the rest should not prejudge any one, who has a sufficient interest, <hi>per se.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. When the day of compearance comes, which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptor, and not with continuation of dayes, by the <hi>Act I.</hi> 6. the Justice-clerk calls the Summonds, and if the pursuer be present, and the defender be absent, he is declared Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and his Cautioner is unlawed, but if the pursuer be not present, then the Clerk calls upon the Act, for reporting the Criminal Letters, and the Cautioner is unlawed, for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Criminal Letters: And in either cases an Act is extracted; and if both pursuer, and defender be absent, the pursuers Cautioner is unlawed, for not reporting the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Letters, and the defender is outlawed, and his Cautioner is likewise unlawed for not presenting him; but if either, or both compear, the Cautioners takes Instruments upon their
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:55274:246"/>
reporting the Letters. If the defenders Cautioner present him at the day, but if the Judge be absent, or the day feriat, as if it be a publick Fast, then I think the Cautioner is not free; but he should present him at a day wherein he may be pursued, for his obligation must be interpreted to be, <hi>cum ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu,</hi> especially if the Pannel would have been imprisoned, if he had not found that person Cautioner.</p>
               <p>Upon their presenting the Pannel, then the defender enters upon Pannel, and the Clerk marks, <hi>curia affirmata die men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis per</hi> and marks such a man entered upon the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, such a day accused for the crime, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and marks who were pursuers, and who were Proloquutors in defence, and the Dittay is read, and the Justices ask whether the Pannel be guilty, or not; which is conform to <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>ff. quam aniss non possint, &amp; l. &amp; adulteram ff. ad leg. jul. de adult.</hi> and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocats for the defender, dictat both the Dilator, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptor defences, as the Advocats for the pursuer, do his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleys and triplys, which has been originally introduced amongst us, as <hi>I</hi> conjecture that the Judges might not be seduc'd, by the passionat, and well acted Eloquence of Advocats, <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til.

               <p>ALbeit after a crime is proved, the Pannel is most unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, yet till then, he is still presumed innocent, <hi>&amp; praestat nocentem absolvere, quam innocentem condemnare, &amp;
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:55274:247"/>
Petr. de Anach. consil.</hi> 23. observes well, that the Court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves much more honour, when they absolve, then when they condemn. The reason of which is, because when an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent person is condemned, the wrong cannot be repaired, but when a guilty person is absolved, yet God will either suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him him to fall in a second snare, whereby the first crime may be also punished, or at least, his infinite Justice will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him eternally if he repent not.</p>
               <p>When any person was Criminally pursued, he had by the common Law the benefite of exculpation, for so they term the defences of the Pannel, as is clear by <hi>Clar. quest.</hi> 51. But I find not this term used with us, till the Year. 1661. at which time, it was used first in <hi>Argyles</hi> processe. The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> call this, to traverse an Inditement, from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>traverser</hi> (as I suppose) which signifies to oppose, or cross.</p>
               <p>When a Pannel before that time, was pursued in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he behoved presently to propon his defences, and have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses there present, for proving it, or else he behoved to refer it to the pursuers witnesses, for our Ancestors thought that the pursuers Witnesses being present, could not but know all the matter of fact exactly, and so were as fit to prove the exculpation, as the Libel; but this was a mistake; for witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses might have been present when the wound was given, who were not present at the beginning, when the occasion of the wound was given, whereupon the exculpation of self-defence was founded; so that other witnesses are oftimes necessary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side these adduced by the pursuer, and it is not safe to presume, that these will come without a citation, or if they come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a citation, they are <hi>ultroni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In <hi>anno.</hi> 1661. the Justices did begin to grant precepts of Exculpation, which were drawn by the Clerk, and exprest, that in respect there was a pursuite of such a nature, intended against such a man, and that he had defences to propon (here the defences were exprest) therefore the Justices granted war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to him, to cite witnesses for proving thereof. &amp;c. That</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="478" facs="tcp:55274:248"/>This precept was subscribed only by one of the Justices, yet thereafter in <hi>anno</hi> 1666. the Justices ordained, that a formal Summonds, past under the signet of the Session should be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for citing witnesses for Exculpation, and they are called now Letters of Exculpation, which contain the defence, as formerly the precepts did, but because the Lords of Session use to scruple, to passe such Bills; therefore the Justices first consider the defence, and if they find it probable, they use to subscribe the warrand for a Bill, which Bill is past by one of the Justices amongst the common Bills, and that Bill is the warrand of the Letters.</p>
               <p>When the Pannel is accused, and the Libel read, his Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat doth propon the defence, or exculpation, <hi>v. g.</hi> if the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel be Murder, the defence is <hi>inculpata tutela,</hi> &amp;c. and after the defence is debated, and either admitted, or repelled, by an expresse signator of processe, then the witnesses are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly admitted.</p>
               <p>If the Justices refuse to passe a warrand for Letters of excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, the defender ought not to be thereby prejudged, but the dyet will be continued, till Letters of Exculpation be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as was found in my Lord <hi>Rentouns</hi> case, against the Laird of <hi>Wedderburn, December,</hi> 1669. And though the summonds of Exculpation should be execute to the same dyet with the Principal Summonds, yet if the Justices find it reasonable, they may continue the dyet, and allow a competent time for raising Exculpation, as they did 13. <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1676. In a case pursued by <hi>Mackintosh,</hi> against <hi>Grant,</hi> for in remote Shires, the defender has not time to raise and execute Exculpations to the day of compearance in the principal cause.</p>
               <p>The ordinary defences are to be seen in the respectiv Titles to which they relate, and it would swell too much, and too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily this Title to repeat them here.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is ordinarily replyed to defences of Exculpation, that
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:55274:248"/>
they are contrary to the pursuers Libel, and so ought not to be admitted to probation, and thus <hi>Mr. William Sumervel</hi> being pursued, for murdering of <hi>Bessy Rentown,</hi> it was alledged, that it was offered to be proved, that the wound was not mortal, as appeared clearly to many who saw the same immediatly after it was given, Likeas she went that night to her brothers house, three miles on foot, and never took bed, but wrought as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in her ordinary imployments, for twelve weeks, And at last having gone to attend her brother, who dyed of a spotted Fever, she was by him infected, and dyed of a Fever; which defence of Exculpation was repelled. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1669. as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Libel, wherein it was expresly Libelled, that he gave her a mortal wound, that she died of the wound that he gave her, and I find it formerly repelled. 15. <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1642. <hi>Cheyn</hi> against <hi>Mowit,</hi> But this principle, <hi>viz.</hi> that exculpation directly opposit to the Libel, should not be admitted, seems not to be allowable, for all defences of Exculpation might be thereby precluded, for the pursuer might so cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiat his Libel, upon design, as that the only excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation which he feared, behoved to be contrary to his Libel, and since in <hi>Scotland</hi> the pursuer is not precisely obliedged to prove all the qualities which he Libels, but it is sufficient that he prove the Libel it self, the poor defender might easily be cheated; for the pursuer might Libel all the circumstances ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of the exculpation, which he feared, and after he had thereby excluded the defence, he might contend, that albeit the qualities were not proved; yet the fact it self being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it was sufficient. 2. In Civil cases, some defences are admitted, though contrary to the Libel, as in Ryots before the Council, and in Spuilzies; and therefore they ought much more to be admitted, in Criminal cases, wherein the defender is more favourable, then he is in civil cases. 3. If this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple did generally hold, then self-defence, and casual homicide could never be allowed as Exculpations, for both these are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:55274:249"/>
contrary to the Libel, used in the case of <hi>Homicide</hi>; which bears still premeditation, and fore-thought-fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But to reconcile these differences, that which I find more suitable to reason, in these indigested discourses, which the Doctors make upon this Subject, may be comprehended under these conclusions, 1. Where the defence i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely contrary to the Libel, it ought only to be admitted to probation. 2. Though it be contrary to the Libel, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctors, a conjunct probation should be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for besides the former reasons, I find the <hi>Civilians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate very learnedly, whether when the pursuers probation of the Libel, is expresly contrary to the probation led by the defender, the pursuers, or defenders probation ought to be preferred, <hi>Bossius tit. defens. reor:</hi> which question were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, if a mutual probation were not allowed, <hi>eo casu,</hi> and <hi>Boss.</hi> there advises the defender, <hi>capitulare directe contrarium ejus quod libellatur,</hi> and when the probations differ, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rules to be followed are, that 1. The defenders proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be preferred, <hi>Gloss in cap in nostris detest</hi>; because it is admitted by the presumption, that <hi>nemo presumitur dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisse, Boss. ibid.</hi> But if the probation be not equal, the greater number, or these who depon what is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, or the worthiest persons ought to be believed, <hi>Boss. ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How far this Doctrine is allowed by our practique, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, from a case decided in <hi>Iun</hi> 1670. In which, <hi>William Mackie,</hi> being pursued for killing <hi>Hoom,</hi> in a single Combat, did alledge, that if he did kill him, it was in his own defence; in swa far as <hi>Hoom</hi> fell upon him, with a drawn Sword. To which it was replyed, that selfe-defence could not be receaveable; because it was expresly Libelled, that there past a mutual provocation: and though he went to the Park without his Sword, yet having been thereafter provock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fighting, and killing the Defunct, he cannot be said
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:55274:249"/>
to have done this, <hi>se defendendo,</hi> else the Act of Parliament against Duels, might be easily eluded; and though, if the Libells did only bear fore-thought-fellonny in general, self-defence might be receiveable to eleid the Libel; yet where the Libel was founded upon a special qualification of provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, self-defence was never sustained, to eleid the Libel, and the reason of the defence, is, because in the first case, self-defence is not contrary, <hi>substantiae libelli</hi>; but only eleids it in a quality, which is presumed, and so needs not be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> forethought-fellony, whereas, in this case, if self-defence were receiveable, to eleid a Libel, founded upon provocation, and Duelling, it would be expresly contrary to the Libel, and to the quality of provocation, which is a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that must be proved. In respect of which reply, the self-defence was repell'd</p>
               <p n="3">III. But since defences expresly contrary to the Libel, cannot be sustain'd in our Law; it may be doubted, if the exception of <hi>alibi,</hi> be relevant: for since the Libel bears, that the Pannel was actor there, it is contrary to the Libel to alledge, that the Pannel was else where, than where the crime was committed; for that is the same thing, as to alledge, and offer to prove that he kill'd not there. But I think in this case, <hi>alibi</hi> should be strongly qualified, and if it be, then both the Libel, and defence ought to be admitted to probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but so that if the Judge find <hi>alibi,</hi> not to be clearly proved, then only he should allow the pursuer to prove his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, for to admit contrary Probations, were to open a Door to Perjury, and not to allow the pursuer to prove also, were to infer a crime without Probation; for the Pannels not prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his defence, doth not, <hi>in criminalibus,</hi> relieve the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser from the necessity of proving his Libel, as it doth in civil cases. And this seems to be our Law, and more just and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, then conjunct Probations are.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. According to the opinion of the Doctors, Exculpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:55274:250"/>
is so favourable, that many who could not be received as Witnesses to prove the Libel, would be admitted to prove the defence, as a Brother, or a Domestick, <hi>Iason. in leg. ut. vim. ff. de just. &amp; jur. &amp; Clar.</hi>

And in <hi>Rutherfoords</hi> Process, in <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1664. it was found, that Women might be admitted to prove self-defence, if there were Women upon the place.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is very ordinary for some Judges, not to admit Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to exculpat, except they be cited, and all the formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be observed, in their citations, that are observed in other citations; But I should rather think with the <hi>Civilians,</hi> that as <hi>testes in defensam,</hi> are admitted, though they be not <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles,</hi> so Witnesses may be admitted, though not cited, for this was our ancient practice, and the benefit of Exculpation, is mainly brought in to favour the defender: And is it not strange, that if a man were Pannell'd for Murder, and saw two persons present, who knew that what he did, was done in his own defence, it should not be lawful to him, to desire them to be examined; this were to profer meer formalities, to real truth: And whereas, it is observed, that these <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,</hi> are <hi>ultonei,</hi> who came without being cited, and so ought not to be received. To this it is answered, that all such as come without being cited, are not <hi>testes ultronei,</hi> but only
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:55274:250"/>
such as offer themselves without being required, by Judge, or Party, as if a man should step out, and desire to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: And whereas, it is urg'd, that they must be presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed partial, who come there meerly to be examined, and this is the same thing, as if they offered themselves; it is answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the presumption is very groundless, for they might have come there without any such designs; and if they had such a design, they might safely have eluded the formality ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, by causing cite them. Others use a strang evasion in this case, for though they confess that Witnesses may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined in Exculpations, though not cited; yet if a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds be once raised, they conceive that none should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to depon, but such as are cited; because, say they, the defender can only in that case blame himself, who used not the remedy, that was competent to him. 2. If the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary were allowed, there needed no Summonds of Exculpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be raised. 3. It is presumeable, that the defender hath, <hi>ex post facto,</hi> corrupted that Witnesse; for if he had been able truely to depon any thing, he would have cited him at the beginning. Notwithstanding of all which, I humbly conceive, that even though no Summonds of Exculpation have been raised, it is lawful to examine such as are not cited, for the same arguments urge for their examination, that were urg'd for examining such as were not cited, where there is no Summonds raised. And as to the contrary arguments, it is answered, that as to the first, there may be cases wherein the defender is not to blame; as for instance, if he knew not the names of such as were present, when he was forced to kill; so that he could not cite them, but yet he knew their Faces, and so was forc'd to call them out, to be examined when he saw them in a Justice Court. As also, knowing that citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were introduced in his own favours, and to compel them to compear; he might have omitted the citation, or possibly knew not where they were to be found, or wanted Money to
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:55274:251"/>
cite them; and this answers likewise the third argument. To the second, it is answered, that Summonds of Exculpation, will be likewise very necessary in other cases, as if the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses be unwilling to compear, or design to go abroad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whereas it is pretended, that if a citation had been given, the pursuer would have gotten the names of the Witnesses, who were to be used in the Exculpation, and so might have been ready to object against them. To this it was answered, that if this argument proves any thing, it would prove that no Witnesses could be received in Exculpations, except they were cited, which were absurd; and the reason why Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses names were ordained to be given with the Libel, was introduced in favours of the defender, and that he might not dy upon Depositions of suspect Witnesses; and so it were unjust to detort this to the defenders prejudice: Nor is there such hazard of corruption in Exculpations, as in pursuites, for no man is to dy, no Estate to be forefeited, nor no mans Fame to be tainted by the Depositions, of exculpating Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
               <p>But I find no such speciality in our Law, nor is that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge reasonable, for men are prone, though they have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to depone in favours, rather of the Pannel, then of the accuser; and therefore it is, that our Law allows an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>size of errour against such as absolve, but not against such as condemn.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Doctors also allow Exculpation to be proved, <hi>per conjecturas, &amp; judicia, l. merito. ff. pro. socio Boss. tit. de favor. de fens.</hi> but this is likewise reprobated by our Law, and if it were allowed, punishments should be absolutely arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But it is questioned what punishment should be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon the defender, who hath proved his defence, but not fully: as if he prove by one Witness, that the murder was committed in defence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For resolution of which doubt, they distinguish, whether the imperfect Probation of
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:55274:251"/>
the defence, be Diametrically contrary to the pursuers Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in that case they think it ought not to be respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both because it is in it self imperfect, and because it is contrary to a concluding Probation: but if it be not fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but tending only to prove somewhat that is different from the Libel, as if the pursuer prove wholly the murder, and the defender that it was done in self-defence, then they think that the Probation, though not full, doth obsuscat, and weaken the pursuers Probation; and consequently the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ought not to be punished with death, which punishment ought only to be inferred, <hi>per probationem omni exceptione ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorem, Bart. in l. Admonendi ff. de jur Anchar. concil.</hi> 285. And I think, that albeit the Assize behov'd to file, <hi>eo casu,</hi> yet the Council ought upon a favourable representation from the Justices, to remit somewhat of the ordinary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. If the pursuer insist not, so that the defenders Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of self-defence may perish in the interim, or if he who may accuse, will raise no accusation, then the person to whom the Exculpation would be competent, may intend a Summonds, wherein he must cite the party injured, or his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat, and in it he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the depositions of the Witnesses, <hi>ad defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam,</hi> may be taken to ly, <hi>in retentis, ad futuram rei memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. When Witnesses are led, they should presently depon, and the Justices should be Judges to what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and it ought not to be remitted to the Assizer; because, <hi>non constat,</hi> till the probation be led, whether the Exculpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be exclusive of the Libel, or eleids it; and so the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel cannot go to the knowledge of an Inquest, as was found after much debate in <hi>Barcleys</hi> case, but this (in my opinion) should only hold where the defence is exclusive of the Libel, but where both the Libel, and Defence are admitted jointly
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:55274:252"/>
to Probation, I think that both should be referred to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; because the Probation must be jointly considered, and the Justices cannot be Judges competent to the Probation of the Libel, and so not to that which is joyned inseperably with it.</p>
               <p>If the defender propon a defence, but prove it not, it is doubted, if by proponing the defence, he acknowledges the Libel? The reason of the doubt, upon the one hand is, that in all civil Processes, he who propones a defence, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the Libel, and in reason it appears that this should hold in criminals; for he who alledges that he murdered a man in self-defence, doth acknowledge that he killed him: but upon the other hand it seems hard, that if the defender prove not his defence, that he should therefore dy: seing that were to condemn the Pannel, <hi>per judicia,</hi> and without Probation upon a meer formality, <hi>&amp; ante quam constat de corpore delicti,</hi> neither is the pursuer prejudged by the Pannels not proving his defence; seing his Witnesses must still be present at the same time, whereas in civil cases that danger is not so great, and the pursuer is prejudged; for he is not obliged to have Witnesses ready for proving his Libel. To which last I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, <hi>vid. tit.</hi> Confession where I have debated, how far a qualified confession ought to operat.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. It is ordinary for the violent pursuers of crimes, to cite as Complices, all such as may be led as Witnesses by the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, for proving his Exculpation, or other Defences, upon design to decline, or set them from being Witnesses, when they are led; for one Pannel cannot be led by another, as a Witness for him. And yet upon the other hand, if this were allowed as a sufficient exception, it should still be in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suers power to cut the Pannel off from proveing even his justest defences. To reconcile which, I remember that the Lords of Session in a spoulzie, pursued before them, the 24. of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary</hi> 1662. at the instance of <hi>Mackertney,</hi> against <hi>Irving,</hi>
                  <pb n="487" facs="tcp:55274:252"/>
ordain'd these Witnesses, against whom the exception was propon'd, to be first insisted against; to the end if they were found innocent, they might be allowed as Witnesses against the other Pannel, if not, they might be declin'd. Which Method was very just before them, but seems more difficult in Criminal Courts, where diets are peremptor, and where Courts cannot be continued: but to this difficulty it may be answered, that though Courts cannot be continued by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, <hi>regulariter,</hi> as in civil cases; yet in many cases, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents may occur, whereby continuations are necessary, and all Laws must yeild to necessity.</p>
               <p>The exception of self-defence is treated, Title Murder. And it is fit to observe that in the <hi>Areopage,</hi> if the Pannel confest he committed murder, but that he killed lawfully, he was not try'd, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Word <hi>Assize</hi> is originally French, and signifies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly siting, or Session, <hi>les assises sont les grands jours plaids solemnels, Roy Charles, Anno.</hi> 1413. <hi>vid. judicem Regean verb. assise,</hi> where it will appear, that Assize in French, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Judicator; and in our Law it is often taken for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, or Statute which is made by that Session, or sitting of the Judges, and thus the Statutes of King <hi>David,</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>assisa regis Davidis,</hi> and <hi>assisa terrae,</hi> is called the Law of the Land; <hi>Assisa</hi> is likewise sometimes called a measour, and thus it is said, <hi>Ia.</hi> 3. <hi>Pa.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 110. that the Barrel should contain the Assize, and measour of 14. gallons, and the <hi>assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cum,</hi> or assize of Herring, signifies a certain quantity, and measure of Herring, which pertains to the King, as a part of his Customes, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Pa.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 237. And in the French Law, it signifies a Tax also, <hi>Regean ibid.</hi> But the proper acceptation of the Word Assize, as it is now determined by custom, is to signifie those who are chosen by our Law to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, either in civil, or criminal cases, the matter of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and are in effect neither properly Judges, nor Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but both.</p>
               <p n="2">II. For the more exact clearing of the Office of Assizers in criminal cases, the Reader may take notice, that the Libel alwayes beats, that the pursuer shall Summond an Assize, not exceeding fourty five persons, which shall be given up in a Roll to the Messenger, and should be subscribed by the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer, which Roll shall be annexed to the end of his execution, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Pa.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>6. But albeit this Act appoints, that the Roll shall be subscribed by the pursuer; yet it is sustained as valid, though not subscribed by him, if he homologat, and ratifie the execution given in by the Messenger, albeit it may
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:55274:254"/>
be alledged, that the Summonding of Assizes, is, <hi>eo casu</hi> not lawful, seing it wants a warrand; this subscribed list be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the foresaid Act of Parliament, and Summonds it self, appointed to be the warrand: as also, albeit by the Act, the Messenger is prohibit to cite any more then fourty five, under the pain of five hundred Merks, yet the execution is not <hi>eo casu,</hi> declared thereby to be unlawful, and by that Act it is likewise declared that upon supplication, the Lords may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low more persons to be cited then fourty five,</p>
               <p>Why the pursuer should have had the choice of the Inquest, may be doubted. And if Assizers may judge, <hi>ex propria sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia</hi>; it would appear, that to allow the pursuer the choice of the Assize, were to put the defender absolutely in his will: And I find that <hi>Gail. l.</hi> 2. <hi>obs.</hi> 34. concludes, that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of some places allowing, <hi>domino electionem parium (pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res apud nos,</hi> signifies Assizers) is most unreasonable, <hi>quia dominus ita, est quodam modo judex in propria causa, nam est procul dubio eos electurus, per quos se victoria potiturum sperat Alvarot. ad cap.</hi> 1. <hi>de contrav. send.</hi> To which difficulty it may be answered, in defence of our Law, and Practique, that 1. Where the Advocat is pursuer, it is presumeable, that he will be most just, and that he will proceed without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, or malice. 2. These Assizers are in effect, either Judges, or Witnesses, and the pursuer hath still the choice, of both Judges, and Witnesses, if they be otherwise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent. 3. As the defender may decline them, if there be any reason for it, so they are sworn; nor is it presumeable, that any will be so impious, to condemn a man to dy, to please others: Upon which presumption, our Law leans so much, that though Assizers condemn unjustly, they are not liable to an Assize of error, as is believed. But by the third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Regulation, 1670. the list of the Assizers, is to be made by a Quorum of the Justices, and that list should
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:55274:254"/>
express, not only the names, but the designation of the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers.</p>
               <p>When the day of compearance is come, and the Letters are called, and the Assizers are likewise called, and each absent Assizer is for his absence fin'd in an hundred Merks, and their unlawes are to be taken up without any composition, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Par.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 126. by which act it is likewise appointed, that an act is to be extracted upon their said absence, and is to be delivered to the swearer, or his Clerk, within six dayes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that Letters may be direct therupon, for taking their unlawes, but the pain of ilk absent Assizer at a Justice Air, is to be fourty Pounds, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Par.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 81. If the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sizers Summond be not present, others may be Summoned at the Bar, or <hi>apudacta,</hi> as we call it, <hi>Ia.</hi> 4. <hi>Par.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 94. When the Assizers are called, fifteen of them are marked, and then the dittay is read; for the debate upon the relevancy must be in presence of the Assize, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Par.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 90. se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing albeit they be not Judges to the relevancy; yet since they are Judges to the Probation, which depends much upon the relevancy; and seing the Justices remit several defences, which are propon'd against the relevancy to the Inquest, it is most reasonable they should hear the debate.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The defence against the relevancy begins thus: it is alledged by <hi>A. C.</hi> as Procurator for the Pannel, that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel should not go to the knowledge of an Inquest; because <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after all the defences are discust, the words of the Interloquutor bear, that the Justices either sustain, or repel the defence, and find, or find not, that the Pannel should go, or not go to the knowledge of an Inquest; and if the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices find the Pannel should go to the knowledge of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, either the Pannel confesses, <hi>&amp; quia in confessum nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae sunt partes judicis,</hi> therefore he may be banished, or scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, without being put to the knowledge of an Assize, as in <hi>Rutherfoords</hi> case, the 9 of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1622, and in <hi>Iobs</hi> case, who
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:55274:255"/>
was scourged, and banished for Bigamy, without an Assize, 19. <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1650.</p>
               <p>But if the crime be capital, or the Pannel do not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly acquiesce to the punishment, it is still securer to put the Pannel to the knowledge of an Inquest; because the Justices are only competent Judges to the relevancy, and the Inquest only can find the Libel proved.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Albeit it be a received principle in our Law, that the Justices are only Judges to the relevancy, and Assizers to the Probation; yet to distinguish the limits of their different cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, becomes very oft difficult upon these two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, 1. By express act of Parliament, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Par.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 151. it is Statute, that because parties were oft-times frustrat of Justice, by alledging irrelevancy against criminal Libels; therefore when the persons complained upon, are libelled to be art and part, no exception, or objection shall take away that part of the Libel in time coming; so that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the greatest debate concerning relevancy, amongst Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers in criminal cases, did arise upon these common places, <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus ope, auxilio, assistentia, mandato,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ea crimina erant commissa,</hi> and from what circumstances these could be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet now the debate upon all this, falls not by that act, under the cognition of the Assise, all these being branches and qualifications of art and part. 2. The Probation requires oft-times in it, somewhat of relevancy, to be previously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, as for instance, whether an extrajudicial confession is binding, or what Witnesses in Law are receiveable, or not; all which cases, do oft-times confound the cognition of the Justices, and Assisers; but for clearing of these limits, thir following conclusions are to be observed, 1. That in <hi>Dubio,</hi> all that concerns Law, is to be judged by the Justices, and what concerns fact by the Assise. 2. <hi>Regulariter,</hi> all that is in the Libel falls under the Cognition of the Justices, and therefore I will recommend it as a caution to Advocats, that
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:55274:255"/>
when they are jealous of the ignorance of Assisers, and find the case intricat, that they do not simply libel, that such persons were art and part; but that they libel them to be art and part, in so far as they rescu'd the malefactors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For when the qualifications, from which art and part are inferr'd, are expresly libelled; the Justices are Judges to the relevancy of the inference, but if these condescend not that they are art and part, in so far as <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the Assizers are only Judges competent thereto, though the same be, <hi>in apicibus juris</hi>; because of the former act, as was found in Captain <hi>Barclays</hi> case, <hi>November</hi> 1668. where they refused to force the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer to condescend, <hi>quo modo,</hi> art and part; albeit this be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous, seing Assizers are oft-times ignorant persons, and yet they forced the Pannel to condescend upon the particular qualification of self-defence, and would not refer to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sise to consider the qualities of self-defence, which would arise from the Probation, as to which I could never find any reason of disparity, but that by the act of Parliament, the one case is appointed to be decided by Assisers, whereas there is no Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute as to the other; but to speak ingeniously, I find no act of Parliament more unreasonable then this; for the Statuto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y part of that act, committing the tryal of art and part to Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, seems most unjust, seing as has been said before, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the greatest questions of the Law, to the most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Subjects, is to put a sharp Sword in the hands of blind men, and the reason <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nductive of this act specified in the narrative, is likewise most inept; and no ways illative of what is thereby Statuted; since debates upon the relevancy could very litle have hindred, and never have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred justice, for the relevancy is debated now, as copiously as before that act, with this only difierence, that it was then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated before Judges, who could have kept Advocats at the point, whereas now it is debated before Assisers, who know not how to bound, or how to stop them. But a better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:55274:256"/>
for this Law had been this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the pursuer is not allowed to examine the witnesses, and so is not presumed to know what they can say, and therefore he cannot exactly know al the circumstances, which are necessar for founding a clear condescendency in Art and Part, untill he hear the Witnesses depon. And seing the Assizers are only Judges to the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Witnesses, therefore they ought likewise to be Judges to the qualification of Art and Part, but I think that after the Witnesses have deponed, the Justices should still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin, what is Art and Part, and should not leave the same to the Assizers, and as they are founded, <hi>quo ad,</hi> this upon the former principle, that they are only Judges to the matter of relevancy; so they are not excluded therefrae by the foresaid act of Parliament for it only ordains, that Art and Part being libelled, no objection shall take away that part thereof; And thus if a man be pursued as Art and Part of Murder, the Libel should doubtlesse go to the knowledge of an inquest. But when the probation is led, the Judge when he heares the Probation to run upon rescue, mandat, or ratihabition, should tell the inquest what Acts in Law do infer either of these, and then to leave it to them to judge, if these Acts which he declares to be relevant, be proved; And it is much fitter, then to leave poor ignorant Assizers, to the impression of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocats, who may byasse them by their repute, authority, or confidence. 3. Albeit the Assize be Judges of the Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet what manner of probation is requisit, belongs to the cognition of the Justices, and thus the Justices determined in <hi>Balcanquels</hi> case in <hi>Anno</hi> 1665. That witnesses could not be proved to have perjured themselves, by the depositions of other witnesses, but only by writ, or reexamination. And in the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Usury, pursued against <hi>witherspoon, March</hi> 1666. They found, that Usurary pactions, being extrinsick to the writ, could be proved by other witnesses, then the Witnesses insert: And in the case of <hi>Wilson, November</hi> 1667. they found, that
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:55274:256"/>
the receiving more then the ordinary Rent, was not probable by the Oath of the payer, and yet if any of the Assizers pleases, he may desire <hi>ad informandam conscientiam judicis,</hi> any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatsoever to be taken; and thus often times in the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Registers, Assizers have caused read Testificats from Chirurgians, and others, <hi>licet regulariter testibus, non testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niis est credendum.</hi> The last rule is that before the Assize be sworn, all the cognition belongs to the Justice, but after they are sworn, the Justices <hi>functi sunt officio,</hi> and all thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter falls under the cognition of the Assizers, as is clear, by the very words of the Justice Interloquutor, which runs thus, the Justices finds the Libel relevant, notwithstanding of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and ordains the Pannel to passe thereupon to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an inquest.</p>
               <p>But to prevent all thir difficulties, I wish that the Justices were Judges both to relevancy, and probation, which overture seems most fit, and advantagious for these subsequent reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is such a contingency, betwixt relevancy, and probation that they should not be disjoyned, and sure they must best understand what probation is requisit, who have considered the relevancy, upon which it depends, and for this cause it is, that even our Law appoints all the dispute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the relevancy, to be in presence of the Assize.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Assize is oft stumbled at what is referred to them, and do very often mistake what is found relevant, and what not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Assizers with us, are oftentimes ignorant persons, at least seldom or never are they so judicious, as to understand such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricat matters, as Advocats represent to them, especially in Circuite Courts, where few have seen Assizes before, and they are oftentims but mean persons, or persons who have interest.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By our Law the Libel is relevant, if Art and Part be Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled without condescending that they are Art and Part, in swae far as, &amp;c. and the Assizers are only Judges to what is
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:55274:257"/>
Art and Part, so that in effect they are Judges to the relevan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of almost all cases, and are put to decide what has troubled the ablest Doctors and Authors, and so often times they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unformal verdicts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Assizers are troubled in their commerce, and abstracted from their affaires unnecessarily, being obliedged frequently upon continuation of dyets, to wait whole years and are oftimes absent, whereby dyets are deserted, and they oftimes syned.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By this means, Assizes of Error would be supprest, with which Assizers are still threatned by the pursuer, before they be inclosed; and it seems Barbarous, that persons who absolve should be punished, whereas there is no punishment for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemning, which inconveniency would also be taken off by this overture.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Assizers may in our Law judge according to their privat knowledge, without Lawful probation, which seems dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in Criminal cases.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Though of old when Judges, and Assizers were equally ignorant, Assizers were appointed, yet now when Law is formed to a Science, and that judges are presumed to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and Assizers not, it seems reasonable they should be supprest, as well in Criminal cases, as they are already in Civil, and since we have receeded from the present custom of <hi>England,</hi> and our own old customs, by not allowing Assizes in Civil cases, why not rather in Criminal cases, these being both of more intricacy and weight; especially seing in <hi>England</hi> the probation is before neighbours in the Countrey, who know best the matter of fact, but with us Assizers are seldom or never choosed from the place where the crime was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but are Burgesses of <hi>Edimburgh</hi> who are as great strangers to what past, as the Judges themselves; and if Assizers were to be brought from the Countrey, it would be very expensive.</p>
               <p n="9">9, The most learned and polisht Kingdoms, and Common wealths, who have formed their Laws in calm and learned ages make there Judges discusse both relevancy, and probation;
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:55274:257"/>
and it is thought that either assisers have been introduced by us, when we and <hi>England</hi> were both barbarous, or else the Justices have invented this Act at first, to relieve themselves of a burden.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Assize is either an ordinary, or great Assize, the great Assize is that, whereby an ordinar is tryed, if they do wrong, and I find some foundations for thir terms, <hi>par la custum d. langumois, Act</hi> 4. <hi>&amp; de la Rochal art.</hi> 1. <hi>la grand assise est du seneshal la petit du juge prevostal.</hi> An ordinary Assize uses to consist of fifteen persons, but they may consist of more, or fewer if the number be unequal, and thus the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nult of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1614. <hi>Ronald</hi> was tried, and convict, for dismembering <hi>Donaldson,</hi> by an Assize of thirteen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. The reason why the Assize must be unequal in number, is, least by equality of Vots, affairs be not terminat, and brought to a speedy issue; for which cause likewise, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Reg. Maj. cap.</hi> 5. and by the 87. <hi>Act</hi> 6. <hi>Parl. K. Ia.</hi> 1. it is appointed, that arbiters should be appointed in an unequal number, and yet I find, that in the civil brief of right, an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sise should consist of twelve sworn men.</p>
               <p>Albeit according to the Law of <hi>England,</hi> the Assizers must all agree in one voice; yet with us the major part may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, or absolve; but if six, of fifteen be only positive, and eight, <hi>non liquets</hi>; it may be doubted, if this verdict should condemn; for else if one did condemn, and fourteen were not clear, that one would condemn, which were most absurd; and in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1675. a verdict in a Perambulation, betwixt, <hi>Walstoun,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Iohn Cheesly,</hi> being quarrelled in an Advocation, as unjust; because the greater number, were <hi>non liquets,</hi> the Lords did Advocat the cause to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which implyed that they did not sustain the verdict as valid.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Assizers are ordinarly called by sives, and the Oath administrat to them, is <hi>That you shall all the truth tell,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:55274:258"/>
and nae truth conceal, in so far as you are to passe upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Assise; swa help you God.</hi> Which I find likewise to have been the form of old, <hi>Reg. Maj. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 12. And albeit by the 138. <hi>Act</hi> 13. <hi>Parl. Ia.</hi> 1. it is ordained, that all Judges shall cause Assisers swear, when they take their Oath, that they have not taken any Buds from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet they do never tender to them this Oath; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept either the Judge, or Party be jealous of the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers.</p>
               <p>Assisers are party Judges, partly Witnesses, as has been said before, they are Judges in so far as they consider the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation led by others, and judge whether proved, or not prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: They are Witnesses in so far as they may condemn, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon proper knowledge, without any other Probation; And therefore whatever exceptions may be propon'd, either against Judge, or Witnesse, are admitted against Assisers; and thus an Assiser was set (for that is the term of declining used in this case) because he was not twenty five Years of age, which is the age required in a Judge, <hi>Act</hi> 132. <hi>Parl.</hi> 12. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>vid.</hi> 7. <hi>Iune</hi> 1616.</p>
               <p>But because the exceptions against Assisers, are ordinarly coincident with these, that are against Witnesses; therefore we shall remit them to the Title of Witnesses. Only it is fit to take notice that the Cherurgians of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> are exeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by <hi>Q. Mary,</hi> from being cited upon Assises; because of the peremptoriness of the employment, which was sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Justices, <hi>Iuly</hi> 1671. both as to Assises within the Town, and without the Town, though our learned <hi>Craig</hi> being a Justice-Deput, had formerly sustained it as to Assises, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Town only.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. It was a principle in the feudal Law, that all men should be judged <hi>per pares curiae,</hi> the meaning whereof was, that a Vassal should be judged <hi>per convassallo</hi>; because it was presumed that these understood best the person to be tryed,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:55274:258"/>
and the knowledge of the Pannels former life and conversation is a great help towards a sound judgement of the case; and from this feudal custom rises our maxime, that every man should be judged by his Peers <hi>quon. attach. cap.</hi> 67. The words are, It is Statute, that no man shall be judged by a lower person then his Peer, an Erle by an Erle, a Barron by a Barron, a subvas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal by a subvassal, and a Burges by a Burges, but a lower per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may be judged by a higher, and by the <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Stat. Alex.</hi> 2. A Knight should be judged by Knights, or free holders, but by an Act of Sederunt. 1. <hi>Iune</hi> 1591. The Lords of Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion declared all such as were landed men, sufficient to passe upon Assizes of Error, though the old Laws required noble men, and Gentlemen only in such cases: And albeit of old it was uncontravertedly received, that none should passe upon the Assize of Noblemen except Noblemen, Nor upon the Assize of Barrons, except Barrons, yet of late it hath been much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and especially in the case of <hi>Douglasse</hi> of Spot, 9. <hi>May,</hi> 1667. at which time he being accused for killing <hi>Home</hi> of <hi>Ecles</hi> it was alledged, that <hi>Spot</hi> was a Barron, and so could not be judged but by Barrons, holding of the King conform to the citations above duced.</p>
               <p>It was replyed by His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat. 1. Neither the books of <hi>quon. attach.</hi> or the Statutes of King <hi>Alexander,</hi> are binding Laws, but only books of Apocripha. 2. Though they were Laws, yet they are not <hi>in viridi observantia,</hi> seing Burgesses and others are daily admitted by the late practique, to passe upon Barrons Assizes, and at the time of the making of these Laws, Assizers were Judges both to the relevancy, and probation, whereas now in effect, they are but witnesses; and therefore since the Law reposes much lesse confidence in them now, then formerly, it should not now be so scrupulous in their election. 3. Burgesses are in Parliament allowed to sit upon the Assize of, and forefault Noblemen, and it were against reason that they should be admitted to the more solemn
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:55274:259"/>
Judicators, and be rejected in Judicators where cases of less im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, are ordinarily judged, and in which the Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced may be easier repealed. 4. Dyets before the Justice-Courts being alwayes peremptor, it is probable that dyets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved very frequently to be deserted, if only Noblemen were to be Judged by Noblemen, Barrons by Barrons. 5. By the state of King <hi>Alexander,</hi> above cited, it is only requisit that Knights be judged by Knights, but it is not added there, that Barrons should be judged by Barrons, which shews that that priviledge, was not allowed to them, even in those dayes, and lastly, seing all mens lives are of extraordinary concernment, it is not reasonable to think that he who can be judge of any mans life, may not be Judge of the lives of all men.</p>
               <p>To which it was duplyed as to the first. That debate is opponed, whereby it is evinced in the Title, by what Laws Crimes are judged in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Books of <hi>quon. attach.</hi> and <hi>Reg. Majes.</hi> are our Law, and the Act of Sederunt above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, dispencing with that priviledge in some cases, doth demonstrat, that regularly this priviledge taketh place with us: Likeas <hi>Skeen</hi> in his Treatise concerning the procedure before the Justice General. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>sect.</hi> 3. cites these Laws as bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gives for a rule that no man can be judged in that Court but by his peers.</p>
               <p>To the second it was duplyed, that this being a declinatur, and being arbitrary for parties, to plead the benefite thereof, it cannot be said to be antiquated, unlesse it had been alledged that it had been pleaded, and repelled: But as this citation out of <hi>Skeen,</hi> who is but a late Author, did show the same to be <hi>in viridi observantia,</hi> so Noblemen have lately had the same indulged to them, as in the cases of the Earl of <hi>Traquair,</hi> and Lord <hi>Ochiltree,</hi> which was allowed to them upon the Laws here cited. To the third founded upon Burgesses sitting upon forefaulters in Parliament; the same doth not meet the case,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:55274:259"/>
seing the Parliament may abrogat Laws and so are not in their procedure tyed to them: and though Burgesses singlie, be not Peers to Noblemen, yet the collective body of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which they are condemned are much more their Peers.</p>
               <p>To the fourth, it was duplyed, that inconveniences are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be looked to in the making of Laws, but not after, and the inconveniences of the other side are much more pressing, it being very inconvenient, that an Assize of 15. mean Trads<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, should be admitted to try a Duke, or Marquesse; and it was a vast mistake to think that Assizes are only wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and not Judges; seing they vote, and their verdict is called a Sentence, and if Art and Part be Libelled, the rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancy is in these cases, (which uses to be of all cases most intricat) Simply referred to them without any debate. To the fifth it was duplyed, that the inference is meerly conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but if the Text be considered, it will appear that by Knight, there is meaned Vassal, or free holder, for the <hi>Latine</hi> translation renders the word Knight, not <hi>eques</hi> but <hi>miles,</hi> and it is said there, that a Knight shal be judged by Knights, or free holders; So that the particle (or) is in that place exegetick, and not disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. And to the Last it is duplyed, that all mens lives are not equally precious in the eyes of the Law, for even by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, mean people were judged to dye for many crimes, which were not capitally to Noble <hi>Romans,</hi> and though with us the punishment may be the same, yet the way of procedure against Noblemen is justly allowed to be more solemn. Upon which debate, the Justices ordained a new Assize to be sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monded, whereof the most part should be Barrons, and the remanent landed Gentleman.</p>
               <p>It was thereafter doubted, whether an apparent Heir of a Barron, has the same priviledge, so that none can passe upon his Assize, who are not Barrons or Landed men; and it was
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:55274:260"/>
alledged, that the apparent Heir, had this priviledge, and was a Barron in the construction of Law, for his marriage, or es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat would fall, though not entered, and as a Barron though denuded, remained still a Barron, or a Prelat, though for age demitting, would be still a prelat; so the apparent. Heir of a Barron, though not entered, should be still a Barron, as was found, 23. <hi>December</hi> 1674. To which it was answered, that an appearent Heir, was not <hi>nomen juris,</hi> and priviledges ought to be strictly interpreted, and the appearing Air of a Barron, would not have an Heir, as was lately found in Sir <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Seatons</hi> case, <hi>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sequitur in comodum,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas in Law, all Barrons may have Heirs, nor did the instances addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Casualities of marriage, or escheat militat in this; seing these proceeded, <hi>ex natura feudi, non ex vi privilegii</hi> and was introduced in favours of the superiour, and not of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearent Heir. Upon which debate the Justices, 19. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1675. repelled the objection against the Assizers, and found the priviledged extended not to the appearent Heirs of Barrons; <hi>Mackintosh contra Frazer of Culbokie.</hi> Not is this priviledge extended to Landed men, though infest, if their Lands be not erected in a Barrony.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Albeit it be ordinarly received, that Assisers may Judge upon their proper knowledge, yet the truth of that principle may be doubted, upon these reasons, 1. Because by the foresaid Act of Parliament, <hi>par.</hi> 11. <hi>K. Ia.</hi> 6. All Probation should be led in presence of an Assise, and Pannel; but so it is, that the privat knowledge of Assisers, cannot be laid to be led before them. 2. If Probation were led publict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, defenders might propon interrogators, whereby the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact might be more fully cleared, and even the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses own mistakes might be removed; of all which just ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, he is precludit by that principle. 3. The great reason why by the act, Probation should be led in presence of
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:55274:260"/>
the Pannel, is, because in Law its presum'd, a Witness will stand more in aw to depon falsly, in presence of the Pannel, then otherwise: for which cause, confronting of Parties, and Witnesses amongst themselves, when they are contrary, is much used, and treated of by the Doctors, 4. If assisers may give their verdict upon privat knowledge, then they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be pursued for error; because if privat knowledge be the rule, I can hardly understand, how men can be convict, as having transgressed against that rule, seing albeit it be easier to judge what a man should know, yet it is impossible to judge what a man doth know. 5. By the Civil Law, and the opinion of almost all Divines, and Nations, <hi>judices de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent judicare secundum allegata &amp; probata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. From the foresaid <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 11. ordaining all Probation to be received, and used in the presence of the Assisers, and Pannel, it may be deduced by a necessary consequence, that no Witness should be examined in criminals, <hi>ad futuram rei memoriam,</hi> and that no witnesses should be examined by Commission: and albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, it may be objected, that <hi>in crimine falsi,</hi> the Probation led before the Lords, is not repeated before the Justice, and Assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, before whom nothing is used to instruct the falshood, but the Decreet of improbation pronounced by the Lords, for in that case, the Lords being by Act of Parliament, declared Judges competent to the cognition of Falshood, their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>habetur pro veritate,</hi> and is <hi>probatio probata</hi>; so tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the producing of it, is the leading of Probation before the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sise. This priviledge, that no Probation should be led, but in presence of the Pannel, and Assise, may be past from by the Pannel, seing it is introduced in his favours: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was found, the 9. of <hi>March</hi> 1671. that the diet could not be continued against <hi>Charles Robertson,</hi> because of the absence of the Witnesses, seing he was content to stand to the Depositions formerly taken; but they caused him subscribe his consent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="504" facs="tcp:55274:261"/>After the Probation is closed, the Pannels Advocats makes a speech to the Assise, wherein the termes they use to them <hi>is, good men of inquest,</hi> and after they have ended, His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat speaks, but there are no Duplys, or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys used; and it was the priviledge of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat to be the last speaker; which priviledge was assumed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by all other Advocats for the pursuer: but by the tenth article of the Regulations, 1670. the defenders Advocat is now the last speaker, except in the case of Treason, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; so that this priviledge holds only in Perduellion, but not in ordinary Treason.</p>
               <p n="10">X. When both these discourses are ended, then the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>size are inclosed; but before they be inclosed, they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be satisfied of any doubt; for if after inclosing any person speak to them, or if any of them come out of the place where they are inclosed, until the verdict be pronounced, the Pannel is <hi>eo ipso,</hi> clean and innocent, <hi>Act</hi> 91. <hi>Parl</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. the reason inductive of which act, seems to be, fear of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing, or suborning the Assize, and therefore, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice allows Assizers sometimes to send out some of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the Justices, to receive informations, in matters of fact, and finds that in so doing they transgress not this act, as in <hi>Kennedies</hi> case, <hi>August</hi> 1662.</p>
               <p>And after a full debate, upon the 24. of <hi>December</hi> 1672. It was found, that any of the Assizers disclosing, and coming out of the house, after they had past a vott, though the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict was not subscribed be the Chancellour, was not sufficient to annul the verdict, albeit it was here alledged, that there might be great debate upon the wording of the verdict, and so the Assize should not have disclosed, until the verdict was subscribed. By this act likewise the Assizers, and not the Justices are Judges competent to this exception against the verdict, as was found in the foresaid decision, 1672. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Justices found, that themselves were Judges compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:55274:261"/>
to the relevancy of any such alledgeance; but that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Assize to judge the Probation of that excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it was alledged, that the Assizers could not at all be Judges thereto, seing they were the delinquents in that case, and if most part of the Assize had disclosed, it were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, that they should be Judges to their own Delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. At that time the Lords did likewise declare, that if any Assizer should disclose before the vots were compleat, so that the vrdict might be thereupon anulled, they were punishable by the Justices, and should be obliged to repair the loss, which either the King, or Party incurred.</p>
               <p>So that Assizers are allowed to speak to Judges, or Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats, but are not allowed to make any address to them after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure, as said is. It is likewise observable from this act, that albeit the Clerk be discharged to enter in where the Assize sits, after they have chosen their Chancellour, yet <hi>defacto,</hi> the Clerk sits still with them, and it was thought fit he should do so; because they being oft ignorant, and unaquanted with the forms, and procedure of that Court, they should have some person to regulat them, and none so fit to do it, as the Clerk; yet by the late Regulation, 1670. it is appointed, that the Clerk shall not be present, and sure the Clerk was worth ten, and did influence too much.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. After the Assize are inclosed, they choose a Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, who is called Chancellour of the Assize, and proceed to read, and thereafter to reason upon what is debate, and their determination is called the verdict of the Assize, which is subscribed by the Chancellour, it is called verdict, <hi>quasi vere dictum,</hi> and sometimes it is called, <hi>warda curiae quon. Attach. cap. ubi aliqua.</hi> thereafter the Assizers enter again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court, and there the verdict is read, and the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour stands up and owns the same, after the verdict is read, it should, and is by the 9. <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Regulations,</hi> 1670. closed, and sealed with the Seals of the Court, of the Chancellour of
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:55274:262"/>
the Assize, and of so many of their number as the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our shall think fit, never to be opened, but by orders from the Judge; of which verdict, the Clerk is to have the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and if he open the same, he is to be deposed, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther punished as the Judges shall think fit.</p>
               <p>It was thought of old, that Assizers behoved presently to determine, after Probation was led, and that it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to dismisse them until they did enter, and return their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and the reason of that opinion is, because after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is led, there may be hazard of suborning the Assizers, if the matter were continued to a new day, and it were to be feared likewise, that the pursuer finding that the Witnesses which he had led, did not prove, he might be tempted to suborn others, and I think this opinion strongly founded; but yet in <hi>Anno</hi> 1665. &amp;c. a Baxter being pursued for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Justices did, at my Lord Advocats earnest soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation, dissolve the Court after Probation was led, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the matter to a new dyet, but the accusation was never further prosecute, and that procedure was thought, <hi>mali exempli</hi>; yet thereafter His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat continued an Assize, who sat upon <hi>Macknab</hi> for theft, for not being clear to condemn upon an extrajudicial confession, they proposed the case after they were inclosed, whereupon the Justices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the dyet till the next day, and having consulted the Council, they thereafter found the confession sufficient, and inclosed the Assize, notwithstanding of this objection, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 1669.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. When the Advocat closes his discourse for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer, he protests for an Assise of errour against the Inquest, if they assoilzie, which Protestation he causes to be marked by the Clerk, and it may be doubted, if the pursuer, or His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat can pursue the Inquest for errour, if this Protestation be not used, even as a qualified Oath is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:55274:262"/>
except it be protested for. And it was debated in the case betwixt the Lady, and Laird of <hi>Milntoun,</hi> if a reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor could be raised, where the party laesed protested not for it, seing Protestations were such solemn Acts as the Law requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in such cases, and they were unnecessary, and superfluous, if what were protested for, could be allowed, without being protested for, and the party to whom such Protestations were competent, doth, <hi>eo ipso,</hi> passe from his right, and seems to acquiesce in what is to be done, if he use them not, <hi>vid. Durand specul. tit. reprobat in initio,</hi> but this case was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; yet the Lords inclined to allow a reprobature if there was reason for it, though no Protestation was used; and I believe that action of errour may be raised, though it be not protested for, if the verdict be quarrellable, though a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station be both more secure, and formal, and really there is good reason why it should be used, seing the Inquest is by that solemn denunciation, and intimation warned of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and their errour, because it becomes thereby more wilful then otherwayes it would be.</p>
               <p>A Summonds of errour is alwayes raised in Latine, and upon Parchment, and is direct out of the Chancery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wilful errour</hi> is that crime which Assizers commit, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing an unjust verdict, and by our Law, an Assize con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, cannot be pursued, <hi>tanquam temere jurantes, supra asisa,</hi> as is commonly believed, by the 63. <hi>Act</hi> 8. <hi>Par. Ia.</hi> 3. the reasons of which opinion may be three. 1. It is not presumeable, that indifferent persons would condemn an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent out of feid or favour, though there be some reasons to be jealous, that they might be induced, out of either pitty, or clemency to assoilzie from a crime fully proved. 2. No per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son would be found to go upon an Assize, if they might be punished for condemning. 3. The penalty of such as <hi>temere jurarunt super asisam,</hi> is only confiscation of the moveable
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:55274:263"/>
goods, <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <hi>lib. Regiam. Maje.</hi> whereas death would be oft-times the punishment, if such as condemned might be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; yet I am of the opinion, that if the Assizers did condemn an innocent, without any Probation, or by palpable iniquity, that <hi>eo casu,</hi> they might be punished: And my reasons for this opinion, are 1. That else the people would be stated in a very unfortunat condition, if not only they lay open to the hazard of being condemned, upon the deposition of any two men, but likewise to the arbitrarinesse of an Assize, who might condemn without any clear probation. 2. Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers are Judges, and Witnesses, and therefore must be liable to all the errors, for which these are accountable; but so it is, that if a Judge condemn unjustly, or if a person be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned upon the deposition of any Witnesse, who depones falsly, that Judge, or Witnesse so deponing, are liable to a capital punishment, why then should an Assizer be exempted, seing there is no expresse Law, upon which he can found that exemption: And in answer to the contrary arguments, it may be contended: That as to the first, it is not conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, seing, else it might by the same argument be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that no Judge, or Witnesse could be pursued, when they condemned unjustly, seing <hi>omnis homo praesumitur bonus,</hi> at least Perjury should never be punished in a Witnesse, nor injustice in a Judge, deciding unjustly, and by that unjust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, murdering the person pannelled before them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause forsooth it is not presumeable, that a Witness, or Judge would murder an innocent by their sentence, or depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To the second, it is answered, that all men may be forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to passe upon Assizes, upon their perril, and thus Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers are forced, though there is hazard also in assoilzing, and Witnesses are forced, though there be great hazard in Perjury, if they depon falsly. To the third, it is answered, that there needs no Law to punish Assi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers, condemning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:55274:263"/>
seing they are punishable by the Common Law. But that it was necessary there should be a particular Statute, to punish such as assoilzied unjustly, both because the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law was not so express as to this, and because men might be induced to think, that there was no great hazard in it.</p>
               <p>This errour in Assizers, is to be tried by a great Assize, of twenty five Noble Persons, <hi>Act</hi> 63. <hi>Parl.</hi> 8. <hi>Ia.</hi> 3. but the person assoilzied is to be free, <hi>ibid.</hi> And by an act of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt,</hi> of the Session, <hi>Anno</hi> 1591. it is declared, that all landed Gentlemen shall be in a capacity to pass upon an Assise of errour, though they be of Quality, and Estate inferiour to the Pannel, and wilful errour is only punishable in this case, <hi>quaelibet probabilis causa ignorantiae excusat, Spot. tit. Retours, Ker</hi> against <hi>Hartwood-mires,</hi> and by the 47. <hi>Act Par.</hi> 6. <hi>Ia.</hi> 3. It appears, that no Probation can be adduced, to infer this action of errour, but what was at first produced the time of their verdict; whereas any Probation may be adduced in fortification of the verdict quarrelled, (<hi>tantus est favor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiae</hi>) the punishment of such as are found guilty by an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssize of errour, is the escheating of the Moveables, and a Years imprisonment, <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Reg. Maj.</hi> which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the 47. <hi>Act</hi> 6. <hi>Parl. Ia.</hi> 3. where it is Statuted, that wilful, or ignorant Assizers, shall be punished after the form of the Kings Law, in the first Book of the <hi>Majestie, Skeen</hi> observes upon that place, <hi>Reg.

which Paper is to be sealed, and kept till a Summonds of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour be raised.</p>
               <p>The Council sometimes rescinds verdicts, without any action of errour, <hi>in criminalibus,</hi> as in <hi>George Ghrahams</hi> case, where they ordain'd the verdict of the inquest, whereby he was found to be Art and Part of recept of stoln Bonds, to be unjust, and restored him against the same; but it may be doubted, whether these who are unjustly condemned, may be restored against that verdict, though it be found unjust; seing these who are unjustly assoilzied cannot be thereafter pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, though the absolvitur be found unjust, <hi>per argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum à contrario, vid. titl.</hi> of the Council, where this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is fully debated, and determined.</p>

<pb n="512" facs="tcp:55274:265"/>
will sometimes confess a Crime, rather out of wearinesse of their life, then a consciousness of guilt, therefore the Law hath required, that if there appear any aversion for life <hi>taedium vitae,</hi> or any signs of distraction, or madnesse, that these confessions should not be rested upon, except they be adminiculat with other probation: as also because confessions are oftimes emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted negligently, the confessors thinking that their privat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions cannot prejudge them, therefore the Law doth only give credit to judicial confessions, and not to these that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trajudicial, <hi>&amp; extra bancum,</hi> which maxime is stronger with us then elsewhere, because by a Particular Act of Parliament, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 90. All probation should be led in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Assize.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This Maxime doth admit in <hi>Farin icius</hi> opinion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny limitations, as 1. That if the extrajudicial confession be adminiculat by other presumptions, it is sufficient, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the presumptions be very violent, I cannot allow this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, seing <hi>confessio extrajudicialis in se nulla est, &amp; quod nullum est non potest adminiculari,</hi> and therefore some approve, <hi>Bossius</hi> who admits this confession, though adminiculat only to infer, <hi>paenam extraordinariam Sed non ordinariam,</hi> for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly such prevarication, and abusing of truth, and Judges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves some punishment. The second limitation, is, that if the confession be admitted in presence of the accuser, and accepted by him, then it is valid, though extrajudicial; but this I allow not, because it is still extrajudicial, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor knew that he should not die upon such a confession; for which reason likewise, I approve not the third and fourth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations, which are, that if the extrajudicial confession be <hi>geminata,</hi> and reiterated, or emitted in presence of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or <hi>ad exonerationem conscientiae,</hi> that then it should be valid; and I remember, that though Major <hi>Weir</hi> confest Sodomy, and Incest to Ministers, and Magistrats joyntly, for exoneration of his Conscience, in presence of many persons,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:55274:265"/>
that His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat took great pains to bring him to a judicial confession, as thinking the former not sufficient: and yet <hi>Frazer</hi> was condemned upon a confession, emited before the Assembly at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and other Noble men, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, 1641. where this limitation is alledged upon, out of <hi>Farinacius,</hi> and this being represented to the Parliament, they refused to give their opinion, and referred all back to the Justices, who sustained the confession adminiculated, as said is.</p>
               <p>The sixth limitation is, that an extrajudicial confession is valid, if upon Oath; but I allow not this, seing Oaths are not allowed in criminal cases, nor can the Pannel be forced thereto; and if he swear ultroniously, and undesired, the confession would appear to me, to be suspect, as emited, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>per surorem, vel ex taedio vitae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The seventh limitation, is, that an extrajudicial confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is sufficient, when the crime confest consists, <hi>in animo,</hi> as for instance, if it were doubted upon what reason a person accused fled, or shot a Pistol, &amp;c. But I neither allow this limitation, for else it should be as large as the rule, seing all crimes require, <hi>animum delinquendi</hi>; and yet I think that some circumstances of a crime, may be proved by an extraju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial confession, and so this limitation may be true in that sense. All these limitations are largely, rather then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly set down, by <hi>Farin. de reo confesso, quest.</hi> 81. <hi>Reg.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Confession though extrajudicial, may be sufficient (if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniculat) to subject the confessor to the torture; but this is rarely practized with us: But I remember to have seen <hi>Mitchel</hi> lately tortured, upon his retracting a confession emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, in presence of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Privy Council, and a confession extorted by torture, is in no Law sufficient, so that except it be adhered to, after the person tortured is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved

from the Rack, for two or three dayes, it makes no Faith, <hi>Farin. de reo. confesso. cap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>The custome with us, is, that the Advocat doth in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Justices, examine the party to be accused, and if he confesse, either he subscribes his confession, if he can write, or else the Justices subscribes for him, or which is securer, makes two Nottars, and four Witnesses subscribe; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit a confession thus subscribed by two Nottars, before four Witnesses, was found sufficient, upon the 7. of <hi>December</hi> 1669. in the case of <hi>Finla Macknob,</hi> who was pursued for Theft, yet it was then alledged, that the confession was not sufficient, and that for these reasons. 1. Because all Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should by the Act of Parliament foresaid, be led in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Assize; and therefore when the Probation was founded upon confession, the confession should have been ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally emitted in presence of the Assize, or at least adhered to before them, and the testimony of two Nottars, and four Witnesses, was not equivalent to a verbal confession; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they could not thereby know all the circumstances which are necessary to be known, such as whether the confession was voluntar, or extorted, or if it proceeded upon a mistake, or if it was founded upon promise of life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. The party who confessed might have emitted that Declaration, upon a confidence that the same could not operat against him, being extrajudicial, as said is. 3. That must be accounted an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trajudicial confession, <hi>quae non emanavit in judicio,</hi> and this is such; because there was no Court fenced here, nor yet an Assize sworn, whereas that is only called a judicial confession, which is emitted before those who are Judges, and whilst they are sitting in Judgement, <hi>Boss. tit. de confessis.</hi> 4. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor here was an ignorant person, and did not understand the <hi>Scottish</hi> Language, and so might be very subject to mistake; upon which reasons, the Assize having demured; the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices made application to the Council, but the case being by
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:55274:266"/>
the Council remitted intirely back to themselves, they did find the foresaid confession sufficient, and <hi>Macknab</hi> was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon convict accordingly, and hang'd; but if the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had only been subscribed by a Judge, I think it could not have been valid, for that were to confound the Office of a Judge, Witness, and Clerk, and would tend to make all Judges arbitrary; so that the life of the Leidges should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon one single Testimony, which were very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, especially in inferiour Courts, where it is very well known that persons of very little integ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So far doth our Law require judicial confessions, that it hath been debated, that even a confession taken by all the Justices sitting in Judgement, was not a sufficient warrand, for the Assize to proceed in condemning the party, except the confession had been renewed before them, though the confession it self was subscribed, and the subsc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iption acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, for the foresaid Act of Parliament requires, that the hail Probation should be used before the Assize, in presence of the party accused; but so it is that the emiting of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is a chief part of the Probation, since Law has laid great weight upon the way and manner, how a confession is eli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But to this it is answered, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions emitted in presence of a Judge competent, prove in all Nations, from which the foresaid Act should not be made
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:55274:267"/>
to derogat, except it designed the same clearly: but so it is, that it is clear by the foresaid Act, that it was not intended, that any Probation that was formerly good, and Probative, should be discharged; but only that the way of using the same should be regulat, and so subscribed Papers are not reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, for we daily see that Papers prove Treason, and Usury, though they be not subscribed before the Assize; but that Act only discharges a former wicked custom, of carrying in Papers claudistinely to the Inquest, which had not been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used before the Pannel. Likeas, Assizers do frequently condemn with us upon such confessions.</p>
               <p>The second question which may be here debated, is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when a person confesses a crime with a quality, and not simply, if his confession may be devided, so that he may be convict upon the confession, notwithstanding of the quality, except he can prove the quality, this was debated the 13. of <hi>March</hi> 1668. At which time, one <hi>Dumbar,</hi> being pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for wounding Collonel <hi>Innes,</hi> confest that he wounded him, but he did it in defence of his own life, being assaulted by the said Collonel; upon which confession it was alledged, he could not have been found guilty; since a confession can no more be divided, then an Oath, and it is a brocard in Law, that <hi>quod approbas non reprobas:</hi> As also, seing the crime could never be proved, but by the confession, the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being qualified, was no confession without the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore there was no Probation beyond the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I know that the Doctors do in this case, distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt such qualified confessions, as are omitted, <hi>sub unico structu verborum,</hi> as if the confession did bear, I did kill in my own defence, <hi>vel sub duplici,</hi> as I did kill, but I kill'd in my own defence; in the first, they think the quality cannot be disjoyned from the confession, but in the second it may; yet I think this but a subtilty, for poor persons especially, when they are tryed for their lives, take not such pains to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:55274:267"/>
their expressions, and their design in both is the same, but I approve more that other opinion of these, who think, that such qualified confessions may infer an arbitrary, though less punishment, <hi>paenam non ordinariam, sed extraordinariam,</hi> as is asserted by <hi>Decius in cap. cum venerabilis extra. de except vid. Far. de reo confesso quest.</hi> 87. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. And albeit I think, that if there were strong presumptions against the confessor, as there was in the above related case, he behoved, <hi>cocasu,</hi> to prove that quality of self-defence, otherwise then by adject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a quality; because Presumptions transfer the necessity of Probation, upon him against whom the presumption is brought, <hi>Cod. fab. de sicar. def.</hi> 6. <hi>non scinditur confessio in criminalibus nisi adsint contraria indicia.</hi> Yet I think, that such qualified confessions as this is, which imply a defence, should either prove the defence, or else they should not prove the Libel, and either should be altogether believed, or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether reprobated, for as it was not the design of the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, to bind a guilt upon himself by the confession; So it is to be presumed, that he who is so ingenuous as to confess a guilt against himself, would be likewise so ingenuous as to confess the Truth really, and sincerely, or if he omited this confession by a secret impulse, of a Superiour Power forcing him to confess the Truth, we may rationally conclude, that the same impulse would likewise have inforced him to confess the Truth in its fulness, and simplicity, <hi>&amp; homicidium indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bio non dolose sed ad defensionem factum praesumitur &amp; sic qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas adjecta habet pro se presumptionem, Mascard. deprobat, l.</hi> 2. <hi>concluss.</hi> 867.</p>
               <p>I do likewise think, if the quality, was not annexed to the first Deposition, that it should not afterwards be received, since it is presumeable, that it would have been adjected at the beginning, if it had been true; every man being more mindful to defend himself, then to confess a crime; and that notwithstanding of such a quality adjected, <hi>ex intervalo,</hi> the
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:55274:268"/>
confessor may be punished, <hi>pena ordinaria,</hi> which is also the opinion of <hi>Clarus Quest.</hi> 55.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The third Question is, whether a confession emitted before a Judge, who was not competent to punish corporally, be sufficient for a Judge to proceed who is competent, and this is oft contraverted with us, if a Confession, or Probation le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A <hi>Minors</hi> lubricity of judgement might prejudge him as much in criminals, as in civil cases, and therefore he ought to be reponed against the one, as well as against the other; and it were absurd, that a <hi>Minor</hi> should not be able to bind himself in the value of ten Pounds Scots, and that yet he should by his confession make himself liable to death. 2.

Lawyers as well as reason are very clear, that a <hi>Minor</hi> cannot be restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except he shew that he was circumveened, or lees'd by his confession, as for instance, if he should confess simply that he killed a man, but should forget to add that he killed him in self-defence, or should confesse that he committed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest; but should forget to add that he was ignorant, that the person with whom he committed the same, was within the degrees that inferred Incest: which opinion is to be seen, <hi>in Oddo.</hi> 5. <hi>Fortia. quest.</hi> 23. <hi>num.</hi> 9.

the interest of the Common-wealth, and the imbici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Minors</hi> are both salved: and therefore when Law, or Lawyers say that a <hi>Minor</hi> may be restored against his confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their meaning only is, that he may be restored if he can prove his error and mistake. 3. This being a confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on twice emitted, and adhered to, and adminiculated by the confession of other dying persons, who could not clear themselves by fyling him, there can no doubt of its truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with any disinterested person. This case was not decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but I conceive that a <hi>Minor</hi> cannot be restored against his own confession, except he shew, wherein he was either cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumveen'd, or mistaken. And if a person past 21. years of age, can prove, that he has confest what was not true, he ought to be restor'd: as for instance, if he can prove that the man whom he confest he did kill, is still alive.

punishment is not corporal, <hi>&amp; corporis afflictiva,</hi> the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will be forced sometimes to give his Oath, as in the case of Riots, and Blood-wyts. Sometimes likewise the Law, because of the scantness of the Probation, obliges him who is accused to give his Oath, as in the case of Usury, which is a crime odious in it self, and cladestinely carried on, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 247. <hi>Par.</hi> 15. And in the case of Simony, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 21. yet neither of these crimes are corporally punished, and therefore these rules may still hold. 1. That Probation by Oath of the defender, is never allowed by Law, neither <hi>ubi paena est corporis afflictiva, nec ubi infamia irrogatur, quia nemo tenetur probare suam turpitu d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nem, &amp; fama &amp; vita quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad hoc aquiparantur.</hi> 2. That a person accused may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by an express Law to depon, though the crime for which he is accused, may infer Infamy. 3. That no Law should force the defender in a criminal Process to swear, where the crime may infer death, nor have we any such Law in our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is oft contraverted, both in the Council, and Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Court, whether though the crime be in it self, such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves a corporal punishment, yet if the pursuer, and His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties</hi> Advocat likewise declare, that they will not pursue the same criminally, <hi>&amp; ad paenam corporalem infligendam,</hi> if <hi>eo casu,</hi> the defender may not be forced to depon, which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion may be resolved, by these conclusions, 1. That though the pursuer declare that he will not insist criminally, yet that declaration is not sufficient, because His <hi>Majesties</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dvocat may pursue. 2. Though His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat concur with the pursue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, in the declaration; yet it is not sufficient, seing His <hi>Majesties</hi> Officers cannot prejudge His <hi>Majesty</hi> by any Declaration of others, for else they might by such Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations as these, in effect remit crimes. 3. The Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Council is not sufficient, because they may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge a criminal action, which may be intented before the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:55274:271"/>
Court, as was found in the case of some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and others, who being pursued before the Council, as <hi>Plagiaries,</hi> for taking away <hi>Anna Gibson,</hi> it was found by the Council, that they were not obliged to swear, though both the pursuer, and Advocat declared they should never be criminally pursued. 4. I conceive that neither the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the pursuer, nor defender, even in a criminal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit before the Justices, though agreed to by the Justices, would not be sufficient to force the defender to swear; for I think, that though the defender should, <hi>co casu,</hi> upon Oath deny his guilt, that he might be of new pursued, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict upon clear Probation; for His <hi>Majesty,</hi> and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks interest can never be prejudged by any Declaration of His Officers, nor can any remit crimes, as I said former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Crimes do not ordinarly use to be proved by Write, and when they may be so proved, there is little difficulty as to the Probation; only it may be observed, that it was found in the crime of Falshood, pursued against Captain <hi>Barclay,</hi> that a Write may be proved false, without p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oduction of it; and in <hi>Purdies</hi> case, that a discharge was sufficient, to prove Usury, though it wanted both Writers name, and Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, seing the pursuer offered to prove the subscription by his Oath; but it is observable that Pannels are in Usury obliged to swear, and therefore it may be doubted, whether a Write not subscribed before witnesses, doth prove a crime, since all writes of importance, are by Act of Parliament decla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed null, if they want the Writers name, and Witnesses, and if they be not believed, <hi>quo ad,</hi> a civil effect, much lesse in a criminal; nor is the Pannel here oblidged to make up the same by his Oath, as in civil cases: And yet the Marquess of <hi>Argile</hi> was convict of Treason, upon Letters writen by him to General <hi>Monck</hi>; these Letters being only subscrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, and not Holograph, and the subscription having
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:55274:271"/>
been proved, <hi>per comparationem literarum,</hi> which were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard in other cases; seing <hi>compara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>io literarum,</hi> is but a presumption, and mens hands are oft-times, and easily imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and one mans write will differ from it self at several oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Presumptions are divided, in Presumptions that are violent (for strong Presumptions are so called) and these that are not violent, they are likewise divided, <hi>in praesump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones juris, &amp; presumptiones juris &amp; de jure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether crimes may be proved by p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esumptions, is much contraverted, both in Law, and Practique, and that they cannot be proved by presumptions, is inferred from these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, 1. Presumptions are only founded upon verisimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and what may be, may not be; whereas all Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, especially in criminals, should be infallible, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>&amp; conclusio semper debet sequi debiliorem partem.</hi> 2. If crimes could be proved by presumptions, Judges would be arbitrary in all cases, seing the Law cannot determine the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and weight of Presumptions, as it doth in other Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 3. The Doctors universally conclude, that Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do not prove crimes, as is clear by <hi>Mascard. Farin.</hi> &amp;c. Upon the other hand it may be argued, that a crime may be inferred from Presumptions, and that for these reasons, 1. <hi>l. ult. Cod. de probationibus ubi asserit p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sse crimina vel ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niis testibus vel apertissimis documentis vel judiciis judubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis probari &amp; l.</hi> 2. <hi>ff. quon. apell. non recip. ubi jubetur cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialis observare ne quis homicidarum Adulterorum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentis convictus, testibus superatus, vel voce propria confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus audiatur apellare.</hi> 2. Since Witnesses are only believed, because it is presumed they will not damn themselves; why may not other Presumptions be likewise received? 3. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions are in many cases allowed as a sufficient Probation, as the presumption of Cohabitation, after the parties are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, is sufficient be Act of Parliament, to infer Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:55274:272"/>
4. The depositions of Witnesses are oft-times founded upon Presumptions, as when they depon upon <hi>dolus malus,</hi> ebriety, or any other thing which depends upon acts of the mind. 5. Many have been condemned upon Presumptions, as <hi>Ianet Brown,</hi> who was convict for Murder of her own Child, upon presumptions, and hang'd accordingly, the 25. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1614. And <hi>Scot</hi> was convict, and hanged for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Drumlanrigs</hi> Sheep, the 20. of <hi>February</hi> 1616. And after a solemn debate, how far Presumptions could prove in criminals: in <hi>Alexander Kennedies</hi> case, he was convict, and hanged for falshood, upon Presumptions in <hi>Anno</hi> 1662.</p>
               <p>This difficulty hath forced some of the Doctors to conclude, that this case is arbitrary; and others to conclude, that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions may infer, <hi>paenam extraordinariam, sed non ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nariam, Cod. fab. tit. de paen.</hi> which last opinion, is upon the matter coincident with the first; for in arbitrary cases, the Judges can never proceed to death, and it seems that both these opinions are well founded, because not only the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of crimes, but even the giving of scandal, and the doing that which is like a crime, deserves to be some way punished; but this arbitrariness should only in my opinion, be allowed to the Council, who are a supream Judicatory, and are in such extraordinary cases, tyed to no express Law.</p>

               <p>IF the crime be pursued by raising of a Summonds, that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds contains a warrand to cite witnesses; but if the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite be by way of inditement, the Justices grant warrand by precept for citing of Witnesses.</p>
               <p>At the day of compearance, the pursuer gives in with his execute Summonds, executions likewise against the Witnesses, and if the executions against the Witnesses, be not legal, the dyet is deserted; But if the witnesses be lawfully cited, and compear not, of old, there was a warrand given to apprehend them, and the dyet was continued, but now there are formal Letters of Caption, given under the Signet of the Session, and not of the Justice-Court, and the Letters are still raised by the Justice-Clerks deput<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> who is the ordinary Clerk of Court; And if the Sheriff refuse to apprehend the Witnesses by vertue of the Caption, the Letters will be direct against himself, as in civil cases, and this was first observed in the cases of <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalla</hi> against <hi>Lindsay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Justices have found that the Pannel should go to the knowledge of an Inquest, he asks the pursuer what way he will prove his Libel: and if the probation by witnesses be chosen as the manner of Probation to be used.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Justices desire the Clerk to call the Witnesses, and if any be given in, in the list, against whom there is no formal execution; it is alledged they cannot be received, and this is the first objection against the witnesses, and is founded upon this reason <hi>viz.</hi> that he who offers himself to depon, without being lawfully cited, is presumed to be too desirous to depon, and so to have malice. These the Civil Law calls <hi>testes ultron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i,</hi> yet I find
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:55274:273"/>
that the Justices sometimes receives witnesses cited, <hi>apud acta,</hi> as <hi>Alexander Forrester</hi> against a Witch, the 3. of <hi>August</hi> 1661. So though they will not receive a witnesse, who appears upon an unlawful citation, and which he knows to be unlawfull, yet they will receive some, though not at all cited; for the first show a complyance, but not the last, all the objections against the Wittesses are discust before they be sworn, for it is below the Majesty of an oath, to administrat the same unnecessarily, before it be known whether the person to whom the oath is to be administrat will be received.</p>
               <p>To object against a witness in our Law, is called to <hi>cast a witness,</hi> or <hi>to set him</hi>; and by the Doctors it is called to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel a witnesse, but because objections against the witnesses, or <hi>oppositiones contra testes,</hi> as <hi>Farinacius</hi> calls them, are so large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated of by him, and others, I shall therefore only take notice of some particular objections, which are mentioned, and made use of frequently in our Law, and practique. And in Law these objections are divided into such as are used <hi>contra personas testium,</hi> and these which are used <hi>contra dicta testium,</hi> I shall therefore first treat of these objections which are used <hi>contra personas testium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Witnesses are not admitted with us, if they be not worth the Kings unlaw, which we interpret to be ten pounds; and because no man can know the value of anothers estate, this objection is found therefore only probable by the oath of the witnesse himself, as was found in the case of <hi>Ruchead</hi> against <hi>Muire,</hi> the 9. of <hi>December</hi> 1668. But this seems strange; for since the Law is jealous that he will depon unjustly, why it should believe him as to his own quality; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think that in Criminal cases, when the hazard is so great, the being known to be an actual beggar, should be sufficient, <hi>per se,</hi> to cast a witnesse, without referring the same to the witnesses oath.</p>
               <p>This objection is founded upon the presumption, that such
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:55274:274"/>
as are poor, are liable to impression. And such as are poor are expresly repelled from being witnesses, by the 34. <hi>cap. stat.</hi> 2. <hi>Rob.</hi> And they were likewise repelled by the Civil Law.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Women <hi>regulariter</hi> are not witnesses, neither in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil nor Criminal cases with us, nor should they make as much faith with us <hi>in criminalibus,</hi> as is allowed by the Civil Law, and Doctors; seing with us they are excluded from being wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses even in Civil cases, <hi>ergo à fortiori,</hi> they ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in Criminal cases; for albeit the Doctors allow them sometimes to prove in Civil cases, yet they reject them in the same causes, when they are Criminally pursued, as in <hi>Furto,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Farin. quest.</hi> 56. <hi>num.</hi> 31. and by an expresse Act 1. <hi>Agust</hi> 1661. The Justices ordained, that no women should be examined as witnesses in Theft, for the future, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>ex officio, &amp; cum nota:</hi> and that same day they rece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ved <hi>Elisabeth Watson,</hi> as witness in Theft against <hi>Bruntfield.</hi> 2. Women are sometimes received witnesses in some cases, <hi>ob atrocitatem criminis,</hi> as in Treason, by an expresse act of Sederunt 1591. And in Witch-craft, most ordinarily, as is to be seen by the Books of Adjurnal, and particularly in the Process of <hi>Margaret Wallace,</hi> the 20. of <hi>March</hi> 1662. where <hi>Margaret Grahame,</hi> and <hi>Marion Wear,</hi> are received witnesses. 3. They are admitted <hi>in criminibus domesticis,</hi> because of scantness of probation; and thus they were received against <hi>George Swintoun,</hi> who was accused for murdering his own wife, within his own house, 21. <hi>Agust</hi> 1664. 4. Women are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived witnesses, where women use only to be present, as in the being brought to bed, murdering of Children, <hi>&amp; in partu supposititio,</hi> &amp;c. very many instances whereof are to be seen in the Adjurnal Books. And yet <hi>Farin. quest.</hi> 59. sayes <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier non potest esse testis, &amp; quo ad suppositionem partus si inde agitur criminaliter, ad suppositionem corporaliter puniendam:</hi> And by these we may conclude that women are not <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lariter</hi> admitted witnesses in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Likeas by the 34. <hi>cap.
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:55274:274"/>
Rob.</hi> 1. These are expresly excluded from witnesse bearing; yet <hi>Matheus</hi> concludes they may be received witnesses, <hi>ex hoc, quod mulier adubterii condemnata non admittatur, ergo in aliis mulieres admitti debent</hi>; But this opinion is contrary to all the Doctors, <hi>vid. Farin. quest.</hi> 59. <hi>casu,</hi> 1. where he gives it for a rule, that <hi>mulier in criminalibus testis esse nequit,</hi> which rule extends so far that according to his judgement, three or moe women cannot prove a crime, <hi>num.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>The reason why women are excluded from witnessing, must be either that they are subject to too much compassion, and so ought not to be more received in Criminal cases, then in any Civil cases; or else the Law was unwilling to trouble them, and thought it might learn them too much confidence, and make them subject to too much familiarity with men, and strangers, if they were necessitated to vague up and down at all Courts, upon all occasions.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Minors</hi> if they be past fourteen years of age, and no otherwise, may be admitted to be witnesses, by the foresaid Act of <hi>K. Robert,</hi> and it being alledged in the Proces of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet Wallace,</hi> 1622. That <hi>Margaret Graham</hi> could not be received a witness, because she was not past eighteen years of age, this was repelled, because a Testificat bore, that she was past fourteen years of age, and might be man'd. The reason of this objection, is, because <hi>Minors</hi> understand not to answer all circumstances, which must be necessarily considered by the Judge; nor yet the nature of that Oath, which should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aw them, and they are very subject in their youth to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a clear instance whereof, I saw my self, in a little boy, against <hi>Towie,</hi> who after he was received, did first depon m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="532" facs="tcp:55274:275"/>
is repuisit that the deponer be of a more advanced age then fourteen.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. By that Act likewise of <hi>K. Rob.</hi> such as are Furious, Adulterers, Robbers, Thieves, Perjured, Scourged, and Servants cannot be received witnesses; not yet Laiks against Church-men, nor yet Church-men against Laiks: whereas according to the Cannon Law, <hi>cap. de cetero decret. de testib.</hi> Laiks are forbidden to be received against Church-men, <hi>sed non contra.</hi> The reasons of which constitution, are given to be partly the reverence due to Church-men, and partly the hatred whereby Laiks do persecute them; but this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is justly reprobat by our custome: by which likewise Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are received to be witnesses, notwithstanding of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Law against it; but not for their Masters: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he who hath redeemed himself from Justice by a Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, should be received a witness, may be contraverted? and that he should not be received, may be argued, 1. Because of this Law of <hi>K. Rob.</hi> which doth expresly repel him. 2. A Remission takes not away the guilt, but is only a defence against the punishment, <hi>l. Fin. C. de gener. abolit.:</hi> And <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel malus semper praesumitur malus,</hi> which wicked dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be altered by a Remission; and since the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a man good, it follows, that he cannot make him a sufficient witness. 3. It hath been found by several Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that a person convict, and brought off by a Remission, <hi>redemptus à justitia,</hi> as this Law calls him, hath been there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore set, from being a witness, as in the case of <hi>Tossoch,</hi> who was condemned as a false Nottar, and was thereupon set from being a witness, in the Proces, for burning the House of <hi>Frendraught</hi>; and yet I my self have objected this against an <hi>English</hi> Captain, in <hi>Argiles</hi> case it was repelled. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile these two opinions, I think we should distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt such as make use of the Remission, before they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict, and these who are convict, and thereafter make use of
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:55274:275"/>
the Remission; for those who propon upon the Remission, do <hi>eo ipso,</hi> acknowledge the guilt; yet that it is only <hi>fictione juris</hi>: And therefore the foresaid Law sayes, copulative that <hi>convicti, &amp; redempti à justitia non possunt esses te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.</hi>

               <p>Guiltiness which casts a man from being witness, must be proved by a sentence, and it was not found relevant, that the Theft was offered instantly to be proved, the 10. of <hi>February</hi> 1673. in <hi>Ashintillies</hi> case; but it would appear, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Theft is so recently committed, that there could be no time for convicting him; and yet it were hard that a person so guilty, should be received. The dependence also of a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal pursuit against a witnesse, should cast him, if it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented before his citation, to be a witness, else every wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness might be cast, by intenting a criminal pursuit against him.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. These within degrees defendant, by blood, or affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are likewise repelled by the foresaid Act. Degrees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, are by our Law the fourth degree, or Cousen Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, as is expressed in the foresaid Chapter, and this term comes, in my opinion, from the French word, <hi>defendre,</hi> to forbid, so that degree <hi>defendu,</hi> is the true expression, though we say <hi>defendent,</hi> by corruption of the word. Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat persons cannot by that Law be witnesses, nor such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carcerat: yet <hi>de practica,</hi> such as are incarcerat, are receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except they can be cast by some other objection. Nor such as are accused for a criminal Cause, during the dependence of the Proces: nor such as are of the pursuers Counsel: which objection is, <hi>de practica,</hi> called the giving of partial counsel, and this is only proved by the defenders own Oath, properly, yet the being present at a consultation with the pursuer, or the solisting for him, are likewise branches of partial Counsel, and are probable by witnesses.</p>

It is ordinary for any person who is pursued for a crime, to raise a reconvention, and to call therein all such as defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whom they think may be led as witnesses against them; and it is ordinarly controverted, whether in such mutual pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, <hi>seu ante categoriis,</hi> may be received as witnesses? To which the solid answer is, that though it seem that they may; because else it should be in the power of the person accused, to set all such witnesses as may be led against him; seing he may raise a reconvention, or it may be intent the first criminal pursuit, upon design, and call all these as defenders; yet it is thought they cannot be received witnesses, until that Process depending against themselves be first discussed; by the event whereof, it may appear, whether that pursuit be just, or unjust: And by the former Law of <hi>K. Robert,</hi> none can be received witnesses, against whom there is a criminal pursuit intented. Notwithstanding of all which, I have seen the Lords receive witnesses in this case, but <hi>cum nota.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Witnesses who may be received, are called <hi>testes habiles,</hi> and they are distinguished, <hi>in idoneos,</hi> or sufficient witnesses, or <hi>testes omni exceptione majores,</hi> who deserve yet a further degree of Faith, and against whom there is not only no obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but even no suspition, <hi>et testes optimae opinionis,</hi> who deserves the highest degree of Trust; Sometimes likewise, witnesses are received, though they be not altogether <hi>habiles,</hi> and these are called with us, <hi>testes cum nota,</hi> who in our Law prove not fully, either the Libel, or defence; albeit by the Civil Law, <hi>testes inhabiles,</hi> were admitted to exculpat, or prove a defence propon'd for the Pannel, if there did not ly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions of guilt against them.</p>

<pb n="537" facs="tcp:55274:277"/>
what was done: thus <hi>Wilson</hi> was repelled, in the Process against <hi>Cask,</hi> the 10. of <hi>September</hi> 1661.</p>

It is oft-times controverted with us, if such wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses as could not be received at the instance of the accuser, may be received at the instance of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat, which question may be answered by these conclusions, 1. If the objections against the witnesses be such, as make the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses <hi>inhabiles,</hi> as that he is <hi>Minor,</hi> or infamous, then these witnesses cannot be received at the instance of the Fisk. 2. If the objections be such as tend to cast the witnesses, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his relation to the party wrong'd, as that he is Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, or within degrees defendant to the party wrong'd, then though the party wrong'd insist not; yet these witnesses can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be received, if any advantage may accress to the party wrong'd, by their deposition; and except he declare that he shall thereby reap no advantage, and except the crime be such as did no affront to the party injured, for <hi>eo casu,</hi> it is still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd, that his relations will retain a privat grudge, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, whereupon they may prejudge in their depositions, both the truth, and the defender; and yet ordinarly with us the relations of the persons injured, are received at the instance of the Kings Advocat. Thus <hi>Neilson</hi> was received against <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet Wallace,</hi> for Witchcraft, though he was brother in law to <hi>Nicol,</hi> who gave information in the dittay, because the Summonds was not raised at his instance, the 20. of <hi>March</hi> 1622. and yet in that same Process, <hi>Stirling</hi> was not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be an Assizer, because he was brother in law to <hi>Muir,</hi> who was one of these who was alledged to be malificiat by her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Libel was not raised at the instance of <hi>Muir,</hi> nor none of his relations, which I think both irregular, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>Albeit these be relevant objections against witnesses, yet if the proponer of the objection, cite them also at his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>eo ipso,</hi> he acknowledge the witnesses to be, <hi>habiles

               <p n="4">IV. The objections, <hi>contradicta testium,</hi> are <hi>singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>contrariety,</hi> and the not giving a sufficient <hi>causa scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Singularity is, when the witnesse who depons, hath no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring witness, and this singularity is divided, <hi>in obstativam, adminiculativam, &amp; diversificativam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Singularitas obstativa,</hi> is, <hi>in acta non reiterabili,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance whereof they give in <hi>Susanna,</hi> and the two Elders, who deponed upon the same Adultery, but differed in the place, and therefore did not prove. And it is a general rule, that where the crime is not reiterable, or reiterated, that two witnesses varying upon the time, or place, as if one should say, a man were murdered at <hi>Edimburgh,</hi> and the other at <hi>Haddingtoun,</hi> these depositions could not be conjoyned, for proving the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Singularitas adminiculativa,</hi> is, where the witnesses do not concur in their depositions, yet they are not contrary, and the one assists the other, as in the proving that a Horse was stoln, one should depon that he saw the Thief go in without a Horse, another saw him take the Horse, but no more, which singularity in depositions, doth not hinder the witnesses to prove, neither by our practiques, nor in the opinion of the Doctors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Singularitas diversificativa,</hi> is, when witnesses depon diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Acts, as in a crime which is reiterable, and thus the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery against <hi>Iohn Maxwel,</hi> was found by the Lords to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved, though one of the witnesses deponed only upon an Adultery committed at one time, and another, of an Adultery committed at another time, <hi>February</hi> 1666. for
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:55274:278"/>
the Lords thought, that if one witness should peep in through a hole, and see Adultery committed, and thereafter another witness should peep in, and see the Adultery likewise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, yet they were <hi>contestes,</hi> and did prove sufficiently, <hi>etiam ad paenam mortis infligendam,</hi> as was found in the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Adultery, led against <hi>George Swintoun</hi>; (but in my opinion) this case differs from the former, for in <hi>George Swintouns</hi> case, both the witnesses concurred in one Act, but they did not so in the case of <hi>Iohn Maxwel,</hi> and therefore, though the depositions were conjoyned against him, by the Lords, for sustaining a Decreet of Divorce; yet it were hard that these different Probations could have been conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if the case had been criminally pursued, as is clear by <hi>Farin. quest.</hi> 64. <hi>de oposition. contra exam. testium. num.</hi> 55.</p>

whether it be asked or not, because in effect, it is the <hi>ratio scientiae,</hi> and not the deposition, which proves in that case.</p>
               <p>Witnesses must in our Law be received in presence of the Pannel, and Assize, that the Pannels presence may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aw the deponer, and that the Assize may judge by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poners countenance, gestures, and assurance, how far he should be believed, and Advocats are to be present, that they may interrogat upon emergents, and this is much ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, than the Laws of other Nations are, who allow nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advocat; nor party to be present, whilst the witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses depons, <hi>Gomes. de delict. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>num.</hi> 65.

               <p n="18">XVIII. It was a defect in our Law, that albeit it allowed the Pannel to object against witnesses; yet it did not allow him to cite witnesses to prove his objections: as for instance, if the pursuer adduced a witnesse, who was convict of Theft by a sentence at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> this would be relevant, but the Pannel could not prove his exception, both because the dyet was peremptor, and because he was not allowed to have a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:55274:279"/>
for proving thereof; for remedy whereof, by the 11. Article of the Regulations of the Justice-Court, it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that when the Libel, or Summonds of Exculpation is execute, the names of the inquest, and witnesse should likewise be given to the defender, to the effect he might know what to object against them, and diligences are thereby allowed him for proving his objections. Against this Article it was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, that first this would be very difficult; for the pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er could not know what witnesses were to be adduced, and much lesse what Assizers might be present, for they could not assure their attendance. 2. This might prove a mean of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting witnesses, and Assizers, who if known, might be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised.</p>
               <p>But to these it may be answered, that no man should raise a Criminal pursuite to vex men in their fame and fortune, till he were secure that he could prove hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Libel, which infers necessarly that he knew the witnesses who were to be adduced: And seing the pursuer might cite 45. he might be confident fifteen of them would obey, and be so wise as to evite the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty: And this objection would tend much more against all continuation of Assizers for a whole year, which is very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. To the second it may be answered, that either the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to be adduced, are honest, and then there is no fear of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising, or they are false and obnoxious to corruption, and then they should not be received at all: And it were inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane that a mans life and fortune should be laid open to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of these, whom the Law durst not allow to be known, for fear of being brib'd, and corrupted. And this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enience could hardly have been evited before thir regulations, for ordinarily the defender knows who were present, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed suspect that none will be adduced, who were not present. As likewise when dyets are continued (as frequently they were) the witnesses were still known, but these jealousies
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:55274:280"/>
are by very much lesse dangerous, than the inconveniencies which attend the not allowing the Pannel to know what wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are suspitious, and should be declined. And our Law should either not have allowed objections against witnesses, or else should have allowed a dyet, and means for proving them: <hi>nam quando aliquid conceditur omnia concedi debent sine quibus ad hoc perveniri nequimus.</hi>

If witnesses compeared not of old, the dyet was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly deserted, but now Caption will be direct against them, and the dyet will be continued, for it is unreasonable that the pursuer or Fisk, should be prejudged by the contumacy of the witnesses; but if two compear, it may be doubted if <hi>eo casu,</hi> if the dyet should be continued, for two are sufficient for proving the Libel, but because moe witnesses than two are oftimes requisite, there being many circumstances to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, therefore it seems hard, that the dyet should not be even <hi>eo casu,</hi> continued: And at other times there may be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which may cast such as are present, and therefore the Justices continued the dyet against <hi>Braco Gordoun,</hi> the 11. of <hi>November</hi> 1671.

<pb n="549" facs="tcp:55274:283"/>
must find caution to refound the party injured, of all his damnage and interest, within fourty dayes after he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his Remission, else his Remission is null, <hi>Act</hi> 75. <hi>P.</hi> 14. <hi>I.</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 136. <hi>P.</hi> 8. <hi>I.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; Act.</hi> 154. <hi>P.</hi> 12. <hi>I.</hi> 6. but these Acts are only temporary.

               <p>Notwithstanding of these Acts, it is <hi>de practica</hi> very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to challenge a Remission, and I am informed, that one of the learnedest Lawyers of his time, was sent to the Castle for quarrelling the Kings power, in granting a remission for fire-rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet I find a Remission produced by <hi>Iohn Bell,</hi> quarelled as null, because 1. It was given for murdering <hi>Cristopher Irving,</hi> and so is null by the foresaid Act. 2. The remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should contain the greatest crime, and Slaughter is not so great a crime as murder, Nor was the quality of fore-thought-fellony exprest. 3. It was not subscribed by the Thesaurer. The Justices delayed to give answer, but I find not the person was punished, 1643. As also <hi>Mackie</hi> being convict for falsit, and having enacted himself never to return under pain of death; thereafter he returned, and being pursued for his life, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Remission. To which it was answered, that the remission was null; because he returned before it was obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and past the Seals, nor was it yet past. Upon which the dyet was continued, the 23. of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1622. But it is observe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the pursuit was here at the Advocats instance only, who could not quarrel his Majesties remission upon no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This rule hath some exceptions, both by the Common Law, and by ours, for by ours, exception is made of remissions granted for pacifying the <hi>Highlands,</hi> and Borders, which are valid, though the party laesed be not satisfied. <hi>Act</hi> 174. <hi>P.</hi> 13. <hi>I.</hi> 6. Which is introduced in favours of the publick quiet, and is founded upon the same reason, from which acts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity are granted, without gratifying, or repairing these who were ruined by the persons indemnified. And for that reason also, <hi>rex potest gratiari nocentem, sine pace privati in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse habenti, quando damnandus laborasset pro bono reipubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae &amp; fecisset illud, per quod multorum salus causata esset. l. non omnes. §. fin. ff. de re militari.</hi> By thir Remissions, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not restored to his good fame, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>C. de gen. abolit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgentia patres conscripti quos liberat, notat, nec infamiam cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis tollit, sed paenae gratiam facit.</hi> And though I think this should hold in such as are remitted, after they are condemned, because they are known to have diffamed themselves, by contracting that Criminal guilt; yet it should not hold in such, as secure only their own innocence by a remission, and redeem themselves rather from hazards, then from guilt.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Kings Majesty sometimes restores the person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, by way of Justice, <hi>per modum justitiae,</hi> which he doth by rescinding the sentence, that stands against him as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just; and this is done, either in Parliament, if the person was condemned by them, or by a review, in the Justice Court, if he was condemned there; and in this case the party is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, not only to his Fame, but likewise to all his Estate,

That the only end of punishment, is, that the crime committed, may be punished, to preveen the errour of others; but so it is, that after a long time, both the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is presumed to have forgot, that any such crime was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the parties injured, or presumed to have forgot, and remitted their privat revenge, for satisfying whereof, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:55274:285"/>
are inflicted. 2. After so long a time, any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that could be led, against the Malefactor, either fails, or the witnesses after so long a time, may have forgot the exact circumstances; and it were very hard upon testimonies, that have so unclear a <hi>causa scientiae,</hi> as these witnesses can give, to take away a mans life. Likeas, the witnesses, and other probation will probably perish, whereby the defender might have exculpat himself, and mantained his innocenc; so that the Fisk, or any privat party, may by their negligence, or upon design, prejudge the Pannel of his defences, against the common rules of the Law, whereby mens negligence can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrong themselves, and they have only themselves to blame, that did not make use sooner of the remedy appointed by the Law, for satisfying either publick, or privat revenge. 3. Since our Law doth punish Perjury, and poinding of Oxen, Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Stellionatus,</hi> and others; according to the Civil Law, it seems to be most agreeable to reason, that as these crimes are punished, according to the Civil Law, so they should be extinguished by the Civil Law, <hi>nam nihil est tam natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, quam unumquod<expan>
                        <am>

It were absurd, that in the case of Treason, which may be inquired into after the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders death, there should be no period of time, whereby Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies might be secure; and that it should be lawful, after two, or three hundred yeares, to vex Families, of great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Interest upon pretext of crimes committed by their Predecesso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s. 5 This prescription is very justly introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to punish the negligence of such, as will not pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sue crimes; and it is most presumeable, that if they pursue, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have delayed for so long a time, that any pursuit thereafter intented, is rather intented upon some superveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:55274:286"/>
quarrel, and picque, then upon the account of the crime. 6. The fear of punishment, and conscience of the guilt, for so long a time, is in it self a sufficient punishment; And so GOD Almighty himself thought in the case of <hi>Cain</hi>; and therefore to punish after so long a time, were to punish twice. By our Law, recent crimes are more severely punisht then others, as murder with red hand, and the thief taken with the fang, and by how much the crime grows older, by so much it should be the less punished. 7 The necessity of example, which is the reason inductive of punishment, fails in old crimes, so the punishment should then also be remitted, as unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
               <p>To the contrary arguments, it may be answered, to the first, that our criminal law, being much more founded upon the Civil Law, then any other part of our Law is (as shall be clearly proved) there needed no particular statute in this case with us, especially seing this prescription of twenty years in crimes, has in effect become the Law of Nations, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Nations, who have many Statutes in other cases, have yet allowed of this prescription without any particular Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. 2. There seems to be greater reason, that an Act should have been necessary for prescription, <hi>in civiltbus,</hi> then in crimes, because in civil cases, the <hi>Roman</hi> Law was very various, and <hi>quoad,</hi> the particular periods of time was alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all Nations, according to the particular state of their affairs; but in criminals, their prescription was exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, by all Nations, and was very reasonable; and there being exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>esly, <hi>jus quaesitum incivilibus,</hi> to every privat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it was necessary that should have been taken away by an expresse Statute; but it is not so in crimes, where in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. At first there was no express, <hi>jus quaesitum,</hi> either to the King, or any privat party, but only <hi>à <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="555" facs="tcp:55274:286"/>
the Malefactors goods, and this answers likewise the second reason.</p>
               <p>To the second, third, fourth, and fifth, it is answered, that doubtless, the wise <hi>Romans,</hi> and other Nations, could not but have these inconveniencies under consideration, when they introduced the foresaid prescription in crimes; and to the third, it is particularly answered, that if privat parties will not pursue their revenge, they justly lose the capacity by their negligence, and His <hi>Majesty</hi> having so many sworn Officers, in every corner of the Land, it is not presumeable, that any inconvenience will arise through want of information, but if there do, it is much more reasonable, that these negligent Judges should be punished, especially seing there are express Laws, appointing negligent Officers, in such cases, to be punished. To the fourth, it is answered, that negative Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, brought from the not being of a Law, or a custome, is not concluding, for as in many other cases, so this might have been argued, as strongly as here against His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat, when he of old crav'd, that the Heirs of Traito<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s might be forefaulted, for their Predecessors guilt. And when he of late crav'd, that probation might be led against Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in absence; in either of which cases, there was neither Act, nor Practique; nor could any thing have been alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the Authority of the Civil Law, and the consent of other Nations. To the fifth, the crime being taken away by so long a time, it were unjust to take away a mans life, upon the former prescriptions; and the fear of punishment, is a sufficient punishment, for all the malice arising from that prescription: neither is it presumed, but that if a Malefactor continue to be ill, he will be pursued within twenty years; and if he did for twenty years live so soberly, and discreetly, as that the Law thought not fit to take notice of his former crime, there is little hazard of any future malice.</p>

PUnishments are inflicted, not only to satisfy, either the publick revenge of the Law, or the privat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the party, but rather to deter others for the future; and yet they are rather inflicted upon either of these designs, then to punish the offender, and make him insensible, for what is done can no more be helped.</p>
               <p>Some crimes are so horrid, and so unknown to the world, that it is not fit the Malefactor should be punisht publickly: thus some crimes have been tryed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at midnight, and the Malefactor immediatly drowned in the <hi>North-loch,</hi> without inserting any part of the Process in the Journal Books, wherein also I found, that Malefactors were ordain'd to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute very early in the morning, for bestiality, which was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by the confession of one, who asserted, that the reason of his committing that crime, was a curiosity he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted at his seeing one execute for it. And in such crimes no man needs to be deter'd, nor w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Since then executions for some crimes, incite some to curiosity, and vex others with horror, and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to none, some may be more properly punished privat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then publictly, and thus such persons as are popular, and are execute only for crimes, for which the people have a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, will be more happily execute privatly, then publickly, because the persons executed, are by publick executions ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leidged to die rebelliously, and the people are confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:55274:288"/>
in their good opinion of them, by their courage at death.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Constantine</hi> did forbid, <hi>that any Malefactor should be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi> and this he did, <hi>because of his respect to the Cross</hi>; he likewise did forbid, <hi>to stigmatize the face,</hi> l. 17.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martyrus</hi> was of opinion, <hi>that banishment was not lawful, lest the person so punished, should be forced to live amongst Turks, and others, by whom he might become more flagitious, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly</hi>; and I have oft thought it inhumane, to send our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors to our neighbours, and imprudent, because it will occasion the sending of theirs from home, whereby we may be likewise troubled with such as they have banished: and it is probable, that Correction-houses would be both safer, and more advantagious, for in these they may serve the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, whom they have offended; but with us, no Judge can confine a man, whom he banisheth to any place without his Jurisdiction, because he hath no Jurisdiction over other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, and so cannot make any Acts, nor pronounce any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences relative to them.</p>
               <p>Torturing punishments at death, are also very inexcuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for they oft-times occasion blasphemies in the dying Malefactor, and so damn both soul and body, whereas the soul should be allowed to leave quietly this Earth, and go in peace to the Region of Peace; nor doth these terrifie others from the like offences, for these who fear not death, will fear nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It was a rule amongst the <hi>Civilians,</hi> that no man could obliedge himself to any thing under a corporal pain, <hi>quia nemo est dominus suorum membrorum.</hi> But with us, it is most ordinary for a man who is guilty of a crime, to obliedge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self never to return to <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the pain of death; thus <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> was hang'd, <hi>Anno</hi> 1649. for returning to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> after she ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="559" facs="tcp:55274:288"/>
of death, and her dittay was only founded upon that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; and certainly, contempt being added to the former guilt, may make a crime that was not capital, become so: and this contravention implies in effect, <hi>paenam effracti carceris,</hi> which is oft-times capital; so that though a person cannot bind himself, when he is guilty of no crime, to perform any thing under pain of life, or limb; yet if he be guilty of a crime, he may consent, and enact himself, as said is.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Whether when Law allows a Judge an arbitrary power in punishing, that Judge may inflict death, in that case is much contraverted. <hi>Chassan.</hi> and <hi>Socin.</hi> think that he cannot, and this seems clear, 1.4. <hi>qui vexant annonam debent puniri extra ordinem non tamen animae amissione Inst. de publ. ind.</hi> And <hi>Pappon.</hi> relates, a Decision of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris,</hi> finding that it could not. 2. This would make Judges very arbitrary, and render the Lives, and Fortouns of the Leidges very unsecure. 3. Seeing Lawyers are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that no mans life can be taken away without an expresse Law, it seems very consequential to this, that no mans life can be taken away upon so general a Law. 4. By the 20. <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>Sess.</hi> 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. death, and arbitrary punishment are opposed: For these who haveing past sixteen years of age, beat, or curse parents, are ordained to die, but if they be within sixteen, and past pupilarity, they are ordained to be arbitrar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished. Whereas, if arbitrary punishment might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to death, this difference would be ineffectual, and the Law thereby evacuat. And by the 5. <hi>Act</hi> 1. <hi>Parl. Ia.</hi> 6. the punishment of saying, and hearing Messe, is escheating of their goods, and an arbitrary punishment of their persons, for the first fault, banishment for the second, and death for the third; so that arbitrary punishments is lookt upon, as lesse then death, else the first fault should be as seveerly punished as the third, against both the principals of reason, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Law-giver. 5. Arbitrary punishment is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

ordinarly for so mean, and inconsiderable faults, that it were inhumane to think, that these could be extended to death: <hi>Skeen</hi> also, <hi>de verb. sig. verb. iter.</hi> sayes, that if the Pannel come in will, it is lawful for the Justice to fine him, according to his offence, but he speakes not there of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherein it is statute, that the Marischal, and Constable shall punish offenders, according to the quality of the offence, observes, that <hi>paena extraordinaria,</hi> may be sometimes extended to death; because of the aggradging circumstances, and cites for this, <hi>l. ult. ff. de priv. delict. &amp;</hi> 16. <hi>de paenis,</hi> but these Laws are ill cited, as will appear by reading them. When the pain is by Law, or custome arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and the defender comes in will, he must presently find caution to satisfie the Kings will, betwixt and such a day, this is the constant custome, and was practized the 22. of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1600. <hi>Advocatus contra Patrick Mc. creif,</hi> and others, but where the crime is punishable by an expresse, and determinat punishment there, though a defender come in will, it ought not to be received, and thus the Marquise of <hi>Argile</hi> being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued before the Parliament for Treason, offered to come in will, but his submission was not accepted.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is uncontraverted with us, if when any crime is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by death, the Moveables falls to the King, though the Act bear not, that the crime shall be punishable by death, and confiscation of Moveables; and according to the Civil Law, <hi>proscriptus eratis cujus bona expressim confiscabantur, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus vero cujus bona tacite, publicatio enim bonorum sequebatur ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite paenam capitalem,</hi> Matheus <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>de Sicartis, num.</hi> 2. And albeit the Judge should omit in his Sentence, the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due by Law; yet <hi>ipso jure,</hi> there is by the damnation, <hi>jus quaesitum fisco,</hi> as was found after a large debate, in the case of <hi>Wauch,</hi> who being a landed man, found guilty of Theft, though he was only fined by the Sheriff in a thousand Pounds;
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:55274:289"/>
yet the Donator to the Escheat was found to have right to all the Estate, and that without any new sentence, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>ff. de bon. damnat. &amp; l.</hi> 2. <hi>C. de bon. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrip.</hi> But it seems hard, that confiscation of Moveables, should still follow upon all crimes, though the Law expresse not that way of punishment, seeing this is to punish the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and not the committers only, and since this having been only invented by <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> as <hi>Suet.</hi> observes, <hi>Iustini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> did hereafter by his <hi>Novel.</hi> 117. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. appoint that the offenders Goods should only be confiscated in Treason, for that crime taints the Blood; nor have we any Law with us, appointing confiscation in all capital cases: <hi>Liv.</hi> tells us, that this seem'd barbarous in the <hi>Roman decemviri. lib.</hi> 3. and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodot.</hi> assures us, that even the <hi>Persians</hi> would not confiscat the offenders Estate, in the Crime of Treason, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. Nor would the <hi>Emperor Aurelian,</hi> allow it, lest it should be thought, that he pursued rich Malefactors, meerly for their Estates, and really some Judges are to be jealous'd upon that account. But though mens escheat should not fall without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Law, yet custom hath supplied Law with us in this.</p>
               <p>Since a person who is interdited cannot, dispon upon his Moveables, the question is, if they can fall under his Escheat, or if he can prejudge himself by his confession, for <hi>tantum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit quis de linquendo quantum facere potest contrahendo</hi>; And therefore since he cannot alienat them by contracting, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should he be able to alienat them by delinquency, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the interdiction be judicial, by the authority of a Judge, and founded upon the persons being prodigus, or of a weak judgement: the like may also be doubted, in the case of one who is Proprietor of Lands by a Tailzie, bearing a Clause, <hi>de non alienando, irritanter, &amp; resolutive concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> who may evacuat the Tailzie, if it may be forefeited upon his delinquency; As to the first of which cases, Lawyers are of opinion, that since Prodigals are esteemed as Pupils,
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:55274:290"/>
that therefore their Goods cannot be confiscated upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession emited by them, without the consent of these to whom they are interdited. <hi>Cabal. Cas.</hi> 48. <hi>Bald. ad l.</hi> 1. <hi>C. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess.</hi> But they think that if the crime be proved against them, then their Goods may be confiscated, for this priviledge of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction being introduced in their favours, ought not to be advantagious to them, in defending them against guilt, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strens. ad l. etiam. ff. Solut. matr.</hi> And with us, since inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction cannot defend against Captions, much less ought it to defend against crimes. As to the second question, it is clear, that such Tailzies, how ever conceived, cannot defend against forefeiture, for it is not in any Subjects power to secure his own Estate against crimes; and if this could hold, then no mans Estate should ever forefeit, for all men would adject such conditions, and this would invite them to commit crimes, whereas the Law endeavous by all means to deter them.</p>
               <p>Because many of our Laws appoint crimes to be punished, according to the prescript of the Civil, and Common Law, as Falshood, Perjury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that many punishments there used, are now in desuetude: therefore it is fit to know, that in place of <hi>damnatio ad bestias,</hi> succeeds heading, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collation, in place of <hi>damnatio ad metallum,</hi> Succeeded the <hi>Gallies</hi> in <hi>Erance,</hi> and the Correction-house with us. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portatio</hi> with them, is ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">VIII. Whether the meannesse of the transgression, should defend against punishment, or should only mitigat the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, seems to be dubious; because of the undigested dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, of such as treate that subject; yet I think they may be solidly reduced to these three conclusions, 1. That where there appears to have been <hi>dole,</hi> or contrivance in the committer, there the smalnesse of the transgression, doth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lessen the punishment, if it be arbitrary by the Law, as for instance, if a man should paction for sex Shilling, and two pence <hi>per cent,</hi> where the Law allows only five Shilling, <hi>per cent</hi> though the Sum lent, were very inconsiderable, and the excess be there very Small; yet it should infer Usury; because a clear design of offending the Law, did there appear, by the expresse paction: and in such cases our Judges find the Libel relevant, but reserve to themselves the consideration of the Smalnesse of the excesse, when they shall come to tax the punishment. 2. If the punishment be severe, and that it cannot be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Judge, As if the Law appoint Theft to be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by death, it were unjust that an inditement of Theft, should be found relevant for stealing two pence. 3. If it appear by the meanness that there was no design of transgression, and that the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitter designed not for so small a matter to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit a crime, in that case, the meannesse of the transgression ought to defend against the relevancy; For as Lawy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs have well observed, <hi>minimum non attenditur in delictis dolosis Cravet.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>able and was taken, but a Moneth or so, before the Term of payment, the Libel should not be sustained against him; for it is not presumeable, that he took that Annualrent out of avarice, but negligently, looking upon it as no breach of the Law; or upon some other innocent accompt, as because the Debitor and he were to fit other accompts, or the Debitor was to go out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and thus the Council decided in the case of <hi>Purves Anno.</hi> 1666.</p>
               <p>Where the punishment is arbitrary of its own nature, the Council may moderat the punishment determined by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices. 2. Where the punishment is statutory, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a special Law, as in Treason, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it may be argued, that there the Council can no more mitigat, then they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. 3. Though custom be equivalent to statute in other cases, yet in cases where the punishment depends upon custom, as theft, I have often seen the Council alter the punishment from death to banishment: But it were surer, that even in this last, the mitigation were procur'd betwixt the reading of the verdict, and the pronouncing of doom; for after doom, <hi>jus est quaesitum Regi,</hi> as to all the Moveables, and life.</p>

                  </gap>sued a declarature; in which the Lords found, that <hi>Wauch</hi> being once found guilty of Theft, there was <hi>jus quesitum Regi,</hi> which the Sheriff could not prejudge, by any Sentence, no more then he could remit the punishment altogether, for in so far as he did mitigat the punishment, in so far he remitted it.

If the Sheriff had done wrong, he was lyable, <hi>ex sindi catu,</hi> and might be punisht for exceeding his power, but the party was free by his Sentence; and if the Sheriff had absolved him, though injustly, he could not have been pursu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet I would rather choose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, that albeit regularly, a Judge ought to proceed in open day, to sentence criminals, yet he may pronunce Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences lawfully in the night time, in these cases. 1. If the case require hast, as in mutinies, and conspiracies falls oft out. 2. If the crime be so abominable, that the Prince, or Judge is unwilling that the people should know that there was such a crime committed, as was done twice by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, in the reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> the 6. by his own special recommendation, and then all the Process, Sentences, and Executions, was at midnight. 3. If there be just ground to suspect, that force will be used, for rescuing the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel 4. Some add, that if the Judge be so busy, that he cannot proceed in the day time, he may proceed in the night time; but this seems hard, <hi>vid. Cab. res. crimin. cas.</hi> 218.</p>

And though <hi>Durhie</hi> observes, that the Lords found, that Sheriffs, and other inferiour Judges, could not fine in Bloodwites, for above ten Pounds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Inquest; yet now Sheriffs fine, and imprison for all Bloodwites, and lesser delicts upon probation, led before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves without an Inquest.</p>

                  </gap>ge, within thirty dayes. And the <hi>Basilicks</hi> translate this Law thus, <hi>ne diu is qui com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensus est, mancat in custodia opportet enim eum cito ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvi, vel puniri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reason of allowing thir thirty dayes, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Theodosius</hi> having executed many Inhabitants of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> whilst he was in passion, and for raising of a slight tumult, he was so sensible of this frailty, that at St. <hi>Ambroses</hi> desire, he did endeavour to bridle that rage, in succeeding Princes, which he did then so abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat in himself, <hi>Euseb. Eccles. hist. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. And yet I find, that this same Law indulging thirty dayes, has been much older, as appears by <hi>Quintilian declamatione de falso caedis damnato,</hi> the words are, <hi>&amp; mihi videtur ideo constituta esse lex, quae damnatum post tricesimum diem puniri voluit, quia modo videbat legumla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor possi fieri; ut deciperetur accusator, modo ut calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaretur.</hi> And though it may be urged, that a present Execution is convenient; because that prevents the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners escape, by tumult, or killing himself; and that
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:55274:297"/>
the more speedy the Execution be, the Justice is the more remarkable, and can be the less interrupted by appeals, and intercessions; Yet certainly a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magistrat, should allow sometime to the Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, for setting his Soul, and House in order; lest he else by his precipitancy, destroy the Soul, with the Body, and punish the innocent Posterity, with the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Pannel, who gets not this time to settle his affairs: and it hath been oft found, that persons thus too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily Execute, have been thereafter found innocent; great examples whereof, are set down by <hi>Valer. Max. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>de temeritate:</hi> And <hi>Seneca de jra lib.</hi> 1. It is likewise the interest of the Prince, that he may have time to interpose; and for this cause, <hi>Tiberius</hi> being offended, at the Senats too speedy Executing <hi>Caius Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius,</hi> ordered, that no man should be Execute with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ten dayes after the Sentence, <hi>Dion. in Tiber. lib.</hi> 57. <hi>vid. Sidon. Epist.</hi> 7. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. By this delay like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the persons convict, have oft-times been indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to discover their Complices, and to confess the Crimes, which others have denyed in a rage, or confusion, occasioned by the shortnesse of their respite.</p>
               <p>With us, a Sentence may be presently put to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and the Judge is confined by nothing, but by his own discretion; yet where pecuniary Mulcts are inflicted, either the Pannel is returned to Prison, till he pay his fine, or the Act of <hi>Adjournal,</hi> bears ordinarly, that payment should be made within six dayes, and though Barrons cannot poynd in Civil Cases, upon lesse then fifteen dayes; yet it was found that they might presently poynd, <hi>sine ullisindiciis legalibus,</hi> upon Criminal Sentences.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Sentences were execute of old, amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> either by the Common Executioner, or by
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:55274:297"/>
Souldiers, <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>C. de Cohort.</hi> an instance whereof, is clearly to be seen in Our Saviours Passion; and these Souldiers were called, <hi>optiones &amp; speculatores, l.</hi> 6. <hi>ff. de bon. damnat.</hi> And yet I rather think, that the Souldiers were only Guards, and never Executioners, and were called <hi>Speculatores,</hi> because they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to oversee the Execution, and to restrain Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults. Especially seing common Executioners were so infamous, that they could not be advanced ever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to any sacred orders, <hi>C. clericum distinct.</hi> 50. And I remember to have seen the Executioner of St. <hi>Iohnstoun,</hi> repelled by the Lords of Session, from being a witnesse.</p>
               <p>That the Justice may force any of the Magistrats of a Town, to supplie the place of an Executioner, if they want one, is I think, without all warrand; seing <hi>officium nemini debet esse damnosum:</hi> And no man would be a Magistrat, if that were allowed; but I think that the Magistrats may be fined for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, if they omit to appoint one; and for the same reason, I think that the Magistrat cannot force any mean person, who leads an honest life, to be an Executioner: albeit <hi>Clar. §. Fin. quest.</hi> 99. <hi>num.</hi> 4. And <hi>Gomes. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap. ult. num.</hi> 5. do assert, that the Judge may force any, <hi>ex infima plebe,</hi> to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat in that employment; and yet their opinion agrees with our custome. The Executioner hath right to the Cloathes (<hi>pannicularia</hi>) of the person executed, by our custome. And <hi>per. l. D.

And in my opinion, Letters of fire and sword may be granted, though the Malefactor hath not deforced, if it be not our that the Malefactor be not to be reduced in the ordinar way: for it is unreasonable to expose His <hi>Majesties</hi> Laws to contempt, and His Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to certain hazard, as in the case where a person is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced fugitive for deforcing Messengers, or hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat loose men, and lives in open rapine: it were against sense, that a new deforcement were necessar. But thir commissions are never granted but in criminal cases; and yet I remember, that one was granted to <hi>Mackintosh,</hi> against <hi>Lochiel,</hi> after that <hi>Mackintosh</hi> had obtained De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creets of removeing, and had raised Letters of ejection, but the Sheriff had declared that he durst not eject, for the Council thought ti not just to expose the Sheriff to certain hazard. And yet the ordinar course is, that the Sheriff should offer to eject, and if he be deforced, then the case becomes criminal; and some think that the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of deforcement is not sufficient in that case, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a sentence ensuing on it, and that the deforcers be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat at the Horn thereupon. But others think, that as in civil cases, Letters of second Caption are granted, where the first Caption cannot take effect; so in cases of extraordinar opposition to authority, Letters of fire and sword are granted, upon a meer execution, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar course of <hi>Law</hi> cannot take effect.</p>

The other side of the doubt, <hi>viz.</hi> whether a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son once absolved, may be thereafter pursued for the same crime, is more intricat, but may be somewhat cleared by these positions, 1. The same party cannot upon new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, much less upon the old probation, accuse a person once assoilzied by an Assize, though he may accuse the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>size who assoilzied him of wilful errour, and that even though he should thereafter willingly confess the crime, for which he was formerly accused, though <hi>Farin. quest.</hi> 4. <hi>num.</hi> 43. thinks that he may be again pursued, and I should think that confession savoured too much of madness, to be the foundation of a criminal sentence. 2.
