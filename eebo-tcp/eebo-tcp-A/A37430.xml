            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have been pleas'd to sollicite my Opinion in a Matter of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, by way of Request, when You might <hi>have</hi> justly <hi>lay'd Your</hi> Commands; and I now present it with all imaginable <hi>Deference</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi> You have led me into a large Field of <hi>Argument,</hi> and propos'd several <hi>weighty Enquiries;</hi> but since they are advanced with regard to a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54806:4"/>
               <hi>General Design,</hi> viz. The <hi>Liberty of the</hi> PRESS; I shall not bind my self up to that Order they are propos'd in, but shall speak to them, as they will best comport with the Scheme I have projected, to evince the <hi>Expediency</hi> of <hi>Restraining the Press.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to this Design, I shall reduce them to three or four General Enquiries.</p>
            <p>As first, <hi>How far the Duty of the Civil Governing Powers extends in Matters of Religion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>When there are two or more Sects of Religion in any Government, why the Magistrate is under an Obligation of protecting, or rather advancing the one, more than the other:</hi> And on this Head I shall consider the Rights and Authority of a National Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Whether the Restraint of the Press is not a necessary provision, not only to advance the Interests of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but to preserve and maintain the Ends and Designs of it, as profess'd in a National Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54806:4"/>
SECT. I. I begin with an <hi>Enquiry into the Duty of the Civil Governing Powers in Matters of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, First, It will be received as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable <hi>Article,</hi> or <hi>Proposition,</hi> That every <hi>Governing Power</hi> (of <hi>Duty</hi> as well as <hi>Right</hi>) is so far to inspect the Affair of <hi>Religion,</hi> that nothing be advanced, that manifestly incommodes the Rights or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of the <hi>Civil Polity:</hi> But whether any Government is under a further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern or Obligation, seems to be the Case under debate. Now it will best be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed by considering the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> of Civil Government; first under a state of <hi>Nature,</hi> and secondly under a state of <hi>Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Government in general is an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of</hi> GOD, <hi>by Divine Institution,</hi> as well as <hi>Allowance,</hi> and consequently that there are certain <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Designs</hi> pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to it, established in the same Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, are Truths that will be easily subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to. But then if Government rests on a <hi>Divine Original,</hi> and there are certain DivineEnds and Purposes appropriate to it; it cannot well be imagin'd that the <hi>Civil</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54806:5"/>
Welfare and Conduct of Mankind, is the sole and entire Province of the <hi>Civil Magistrate.</hi> If <hi>Religion</hi> is the most important Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of Mankind; and if there's <hi>Fealty, Worship,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> due from a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> towards a Sovereign <hi>Creator,</hi> even under the most simple state of Nature; why should not that Great GOD, which constitutes the Civil Magistrates <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendants</hi> over the Secular affairs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, be as zealous to make them <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> of those things that are placed more near him, and them too, his <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory?</hi> And therefore I'm perswaded it's neither Boldness nor Arrogance to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, That the Civil <hi>Governing Power,</hi> or <hi>Magistrate,</hi> was originally constituted for the Conduct of Mankind, in all the Instances of <hi>Human Happiness;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently in a <hi>Religious</hi> as well as <hi>Civil</hi> Capacity. Indeed the inseparable Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Affinity, between <hi>Civil Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> (were other Arguments wanting) is alone sufficient to evince it: But were the Experience of Mankind, and the universal Practice of all Civiliz'd Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, summoned in to decide the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54806:5"/>
Controversy, they must place it above Dispute, or Cavil. If we respect the earliests Accounts of Governments, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly those delivered in Sacred Story, we find the Characters of <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Priest,</hi> residing in the same Person.</p>
               <p>Before GOD had instituted a <hi>positive Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> of Religion, and a peculiar Order of <hi>Priesthood,</hi> it was part of the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> province, not only to instruct their People to <hi>call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> but to wait on the very <hi>Altar;</hi> and perform the Priestly Function of <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> As <hi>it's highly probable from the History of the Creation,</hi> the first Governments of the World, had their Rise and Foundation in Fathers of Families; so we are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly instructed that they obtained the Character of <hi>Patres patrioe,</hi> by executing all the Offices of a <hi>Parent,</hi> as well as <hi>King. Abraham</hi> had no doubt his Duty repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented as a <hi>Prince,</hi> as well as <hi>Master</hi> of a <hi>Family,</hi> under the Compliment of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Confidence: for <hi>I know him that he will command his Children, and his hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54806:6"/>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. And truly since both <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Parent,</hi> have the Impress of <hi>Divine Authority</hi> upon 'em; and there is such a strict Affinity and Correspondence between 'em, from the original frame of things; if the Character of a <hi>Parent</hi> extends to a <hi>Religious</hi> as well as <hi>Civil</hi> Capacity, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be disputed, but that of a <hi>Prince</hi> carries the same extent and latitude. And therefore it may safely be concluded, that it was a point of Duty in the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> antecedent to any <hi>positive Oeconomy</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> to promote the Interests, if not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Spiritual Functions of <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as advance the Welfare of the State: And very probably it was a Divine Institution, as ancient and primitive as Government it self.</p>
               <p>And certainly the Model of all Heathen Governments confirms the Notion.

peculiar to the <hi>Sovereign.</hi> Religion in the Eastern and Western parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> was always so much the Business of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that if the publick Acts and Offices of Religion were not immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly directed, and enforc'd by him. If the publick Defence of a Countrey, where its Territories were enlarged and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, diverted him from attending the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> it was his special Care to constitute a <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and regulate the Affairs of <hi>Religion,</hi> by publick Laws and Sanctions: these are such known and allow'd Truths, and so well attested, in the Learning of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> that I shall not now appeal to <hi>Authors;</hi> and they are all convincing Evidences, that one End of Government, in the original Frame and Model of it, was to <hi>inspect</hi> the Conduct of Mankind in the <hi>Affairs</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> Thus far not only the <hi>Duty,</hi> but <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> discovers it self in a State of Nature, antecedent to Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>

SECT. II. It remains that we consider it under a positive Oeconomy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>And, first, under that of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Now tho' GOD thought fit upon the first posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Establishment of Religion, to insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute an Order of Men, and separate them from the rest of the People, to attend at his <hi>Altar,</hi> to <hi>offer for themselves, and the sins of others;</hi> yet it's manifest he did not exempt the Civil <hi>Magistrate</hi> from inspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Affairs of <hi>Religion.</hi> No, it was his special Duty, to protect and defend the <hi>True Religion;</hi> to punish and suppress <hi>Idolatry, Seducers,</hi> and <hi>Falle Prophets,</hi> and to make such wholesom provisions, as served the cause of Religion, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of its <hi>Publick Acts</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> and in the Advancement of its <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Designs.</hi> The Sacred Writings have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered so many Instances, and Rules of this Nature, that it is wholly needless to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large in an express Citation. It's well known he often directed the Building of places of <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> enjoyn'd <hi>Fasts;</hi> and in a word, interpos'd in most of the Circumstantials of <hi>Religion.</hi> Now it's
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54806:7"/>
certain these were not bare <hi>Arbitrary Offices,</hi> and the product of a <hi>Voluntary Zeal;</hi> but they were either the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Instruction of <hi>Heaven,</hi> or the effects of some <hi>General Precepts;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently were intended as standing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of <hi>Duty.</hi> If we examine the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> we must conclude, That as we have not the least hint that any ways abridges the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the Civil <hi>Magistrate,</hi> further than they were exercised under the <hi>Law,</hi> so we do not find the least Exemption from any Moral point of <hi>Duty</hi> in the Affairs of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> to which they were antecedently bound. Now it cannot be deny'd, but that the Nature and State of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> is frequently describ'd in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the <hi>Prophets:</hi> And among those various Descriptions, the Character of <hi>Christian Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> recorded by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> is as glorious as it is remarkable: <hi>And Kings shall be thy nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Fathers, and their Queens thy nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Mothers—for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me, Isa.</hi> 44. <hi>v.</hi> 23. This Passage is unanimously interpreted
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54806:8"/>
of the <hi>Christian Magistrate;</hi> and certainly we are not to receive it as a Prediction of a <hi>Contingent Blessing,</hi> or <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> but agreeable to the <hi>Prophetick</hi> Style (which often exhibits Duties, under simple Predictions) as carrying the Force of a <hi>Precept</hi> in it. Thus we see the <hi>Magistrate</hi> is not only <hi>Pater Patrioe,</hi> but <hi>Pater Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesioe.</hi> This is his <hi>Character,</hi> and his <hi>Duty:</hi> and certainly, if he answers the Designs of it, he must not only <hi>cherisb,</hi> but <hi>protect,</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> and in a word, liberally minister to it, whatever is necessary for its <hi>Support</hi> and <hi>Preservation.</hi> Upon the whole then, we may justly conclude, That tho' GOD, under the <hi>Jewish,</hi> as well as <hi>Gospel</hi> oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, was pleased to select a peculiar Order of Men, to wait on his Altar, and more immediately prosecute all the Designs of Religion; yet the Civil Magistrate still rightfully ministers to the same Designs in all Cases, where GOD has not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by some <hi>Positive Rule,</hi> or <hi>Precept;</hi> so that he's still the <hi>Supreme Guardian</hi> and <hi>Protector,</hi> in the <hi>oeconomy</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as <hi>Civil Polity.</hi> He's <hi>Custos utri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usque</hi>

                  <hi>Tabuloe;</hi> that is, he's not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to enforce the Observance of all <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Vertues,</hi> upon which the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> of Government moves, as upon its <hi>Axis;</hi> but a <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Orthodox Faith,</hi> and a <hi>pure Worship,</hi> and the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of that <hi>Great</hi> GOD, that has made him his <hi>Vicegerent</hi> and <hi>Representative;</hi> and by whose <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Blessing</hi> he's enabled to answer the <hi>Designs</hi> of his <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence the Dis-ingenuity, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Impiety of some late designing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, abundantly discover themselves; viz. <hi>That the care of</hi> Religion <hi>is no real Branch of the</hi> Magistrate's <hi>Office; that he's no further concerned for it, than as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conduces to the Civil Weal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of every particular Constitution or Government; and in a word, That for the advance of a National Trade or Wealth, he may treat all Sects of</hi> Religion <hi>with equal privileges and respect.</hi> But certainly the care of Religion can now no longer be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed, to be an <hi>Indispensible Duty</hi> in the Magistrate; since it appears not only that every Positive Oeconomy of Religion, has
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54806:9"/>
expresly taught it; but the very <hi>Nature, Designs,</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> of the <hi>Character,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate it.</p>
               <p>But then, if this be admitted, we must grant that there is a <hi>True</hi> and a <hi>False Religion,</hi> and an <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Heterodox Faith;</hi> that the true Religion is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished on certain Laws, and Immunities, which in the ordinary course of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, are necessary to the Preservation of it; and consequently we must conclude, That it's an Indispensible Duty in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, to have recourse to the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Methods for enquiring into the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> and <hi>Grounds</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> and for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing the <hi>True Religion</hi> from the <hi>False,</hi> and an <hi>Orthodox</hi> from an <hi>Heterodox Faith;</hi> whether by applying to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Religion, separately,</hi> or in <hi>Council.</hi> And upon a fair and impartial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that which appears to be True and Orthodox, is to be <hi>cherisbed, defended,</hi> and <hi>promoted,</hi> against all Attempts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions of the <hi>Heterodox</hi> and <hi>Unbeliever;</hi> even tho' some present Temporal Interest seem to clash and interfere with it.

of the first and <hi>most pious Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> upon which they enlarged the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories</hi> of the Christian Church.</p>

               <p>SECT. III. But to this 'tis <hi>popularly</hi> reply'd, That if Kings and Princes once thought themselves obliged to espouse the Care of Religion, as a positive Duty (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Errors and Superstitions of Mankind) it would prove the most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Method, not only to obstruct the growth of the True Religion, but endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Extirpation of it. But in answer to this, it's to be considered, That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Religion does not direct to Acts of force and violence, much less the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of it; except where the Rights and Immunities of the Established Religion are apparently invaded.

               <p>But in a word, if the Care of Religion is a standing Duty, in the Magistrate; (as has been abundantly evinced) and if there be such a thing as a True Religion, and sufficient Means (if duly attended to) to distinguish it from the False; the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>Rule</hi> is, That the <hi>Duty</hi> is to be <hi>pursued,</hi> and the Consequences left to the Providential <hi>Care</hi> of the Blessed <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of it; who has the Hearts of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the Sovereign Disposal of <hi>Grace,</hi> and

                  <hi>SECT. IV. I proceed to the second En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi> viz. When there are two, or more Sects of Religion under any Government, why the Magistrate is under an Obligation of protecting, or rather advancing the one, more than the other?</p>
               <p>And <hi>First,</hi> I shall consider this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with regard to the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church.</hi> And in order to this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54806:11"/>
it will be requisite to enquire into the Rights, and Authority of a <hi>National Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, <hi>First,</hi> its indisputably evident the <hi>Christian Church</hi> is one <hi>Society,</hi> or <hi>Body</hi> of Men united to CHRIST, and <hi>each other</hi> in certain <hi>External,</hi> as well as <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Bonds of Union. It's truly a <hi>Seamless Garment;</hi> nay, it bears the Exact Portraicture of a <hi>Natural</hi> Body, <hi>whereof</hi> CHRIST <hi>is the Head, from whom the whole Body fitly joyn d' together, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted by that which every joynt supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the Body, Eph.</hi> 4. 16. In a word, it carries the Symmetry and Proportion of a <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fitly framed together, growing into an holy Temple in the</hi> LORD, <hi>Eph</hi> 2.21. The first Division of this Spiritual Body, arises from the <hi>Necessity of Divine Worship;</hi> viz. into particular Congregations. Other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributions arise from the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> which is warranted and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, by the express <hi>Canon</hi> of Scripture. Thus, <hi>Obey them that have the rule over vou, and submit your selves, for they watch</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:54806:11"/>
                  <hi>for your Souls, Heb.</hi> 13.17. And St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Instructions to <hi>Titus</hi> are, <hi>For this cause I left thee in</hi> Crete, <hi>that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting,</hi> Ch. 1. ver. 5. And, <hi>These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all Authority,</hi> Ch. 20. We may add to this, the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Binding</hi> and <hi>Loosing,</hi> and <hi>Excommunication</hi> it self, being expresly committed to the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Powers;</hi> and evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating the <hi>Necessity,</hi> as well as <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of Ecclefiastical Government.</p>
               <p>But to return: Whatever Distributions were made, either from a Necessity of Worship, or Government, every Branch or Part, is indispensibly bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Mystical Union; by a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Essentials of <hi>Faith, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Discipline:</hi> for otherwise it's impossible the <hi>Christian Church</hi> should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Character of a <hi>Natural Body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that which every joynt supplieth, even to the making increase of the Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Government of the Church, we are assured, partly from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and partly from the <hi>earliest Antiquity,</hi> That
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54806:12"/>
the Order of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> rests on <hi>Apostolical Institution.</hi> Both <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> in the judgement of the most Learned <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> were Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the rest of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> within their <hi>Districts,</hi> at least in <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> if not <hi>Order.</hi> And tho' <hi>Antiquity</hi> has not expresly fix'd the Origine or Rise of <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans,</hi> yet it may justly be presum'd to be <hi>Apostolical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>First,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs an Epistle to the Metropolitical Church, to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the whole Province; for such was <hi>Corinth</hi> in the Province of <hi>Achaia. To the Church of</hi> GOD, <hi>which is at</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, <hi>with all the Saints that are in all</hi> Achaia.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The <hi>most ancient Canon in force, from the times of our Forefathers.</hi> But that which conduces to the present Argument, is, <hi>That all the Establishments of Church Government,</hi> and <hi>the Districts of particular Churches, were originally mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54806:12"/>
                  <hi>according to that of the State.</hi> The Bishop presided over a City, and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Villages and Territories; where a Temporal Magistrate was likewise placed. As the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of every Province had its <hi>Proconsul</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> so it had its <hi>Archbishop,</hi> or <hi>Metropolitan</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> And when the Government of <hi>Patriarchs</hi> prevailed, it was formed after the same Model, either in Imitation of the <hi>Vicars,</hi> or <hi>Lieutenants</hi> that presided over a <hi>Diocese,</hi> composed of several Provinces; or at least in Imitation of the <hi>Pretorian Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi> that had several <hi>Dioceses</hi> under their Jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole then, as we are assured, That the forming a Government in the Church, after the Model of that of the State, was by <hi>Apostolical Institution;</hi> so we may justly conclude, that it was by the special Directions of the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> And, no doubt, the great Design was to advance the Interests of <hi>Religion,</hi> by placing every particular <hi>Church</hi> under the <hi>Protection</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> whenever it should become <hi>Christian.</hi> And certainly, as it was the only true Expedient to enable the Civil
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54806:13"/>
Magistrate, to execute that Trust, that is lodged in the Character of a <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Nursing Mother,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Christ;</hi> so it's a considerable Argument that the Care and Protection of the True Religion is a standing Duty, incumbent on the <hi>Civil Magistrate.</hi> For to make the Districts of particular Churches, terminate with those of Civil Governments, was absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to make the <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> the Supreme Guardian of the True Religion: and, since 'tis an Ordinance, that may very justly be resolved into <hi>Apostolick Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> it's a manifest Indication, that the Civil Magistrate should be obliged punctually to answer the Character, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he became <hi>Christian.</hi>

            </div>
            <div n="5" type="section">
               <p>SECT. V. From hence we may gain a true Notion of the Rights and Authority of a <hi>National Church.</hi> And truly, if we duly weight the Premises, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That it rests upon nothing less than <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Apostolick</hi> Institution. For if the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves constituted par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, with regard to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricts of particular Provinces, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54806:13"/>
of the State; and if it be a standing Duty in the Christian Magistrate, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and advance the <hi>True Religion,</hi> within his Dominions; we must conclude, That a Church is to be established upon that Model of Government, which was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by our Saviour, or his Apostles, in every respective Nation, over which the Magistrate is to preside, as a <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Guardian,</hi> and <hi>Protector;</hi> and such a <hi>Church</hi> is what in other terms is called a <hi>National Church;</hi> and a Church thus established, undoubtedly rests on the Authority of <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Apostolick</hi> Institution.</p>
               <p>I would not be mistaken, as if I intended to deny the being of a <hi>National</hi> or <hi>Provincial Church,</hi> till it has obtain'd a <hi>Civil Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> for it's manifest, the Churches of <hi>Greece,</hi> and of the <hi>Proconsular Asia,</hi> had a being, and a distinct Denomination, before <hi>Christianity</hi> was received in the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Princes.</hi> Indeed when a particular Church enjoys a <hi>Civil Establishment,</hi> it receives, as it were, a new <hi>Authority;</hi> in as much as it becomes a <hi>Civil Right</hi> or <hi>Property:</hi> So that unless its Constitution is <hi>Materially</hi> vitious and finful, it's a high piece of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54806:14"/>
to destroy or infringe any of its <hi>Established Rights,</hi> or <hi>Immunities.</hi> But yet since the Magistrate is only the <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> not the <hi>Founder</hi> of a National Church, (its Original Authority resting on certain positive <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Sanctions,</hi> enjoyned by a Power superiour to that of the Magistrate, even that of GOD <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>) where-ever a Church in any Province or Nation, professes the True Religion by an Orthodox Faith, and a pure Worship, under <hi>Lawful Church Governours</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi> that is the <hi>True National Church,</hi> in opposition to all dissenting <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Parties;</hi> tho it wants the Authority of a <hi>Civil Establishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to return: From hence we may easily determine the merits of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in debate, I mean</hi> When there are two, or more Sects of Religion in any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, why the Magistrate is under an Obligation of protecting, or rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the one, more than the other?</p>
               <p>For, <hi>First,</hi> it is abundantly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated that the Christian Magistrate, <hi>ex officio,</hi> is constituted a <hi>Guardian, Father,</hi> and <hi>Protector</hi> of the True Religion; and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54806:14"/>
therefore if in any Nation, or Government, the true Religion is professed in an <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi> and a <hi>pure Worship,</hi> under <hi>lawful Church Governours</hi> and <hi>Pastors;</hi> there the Magistrate is indispensibly boundto act as a Guardian and Protector, in opposition to all Models, and Platforms that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced against it. For by this alone he pursues the Great Design of the <hi>Apostolick Platform,</hi> in the Institution of <hi>National Churches,</hi> as well as answers that of his Character; I mean as he's Prophetically styled, a <hi>Father</hi> to the Church of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>It's certain one Great Design of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is <hi>Unity;</hi> or to range all the Parts and Members of the Church of CHRIST into an <hi>Holy Building:</hi> and therefore, if the Magistrate is constituted a Guardian of the True Religion, all his Offices of <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> must be directed to this End; I mean the maintainance of the Bonds of <hi>Catholick Unity,</hi> throughout his whole Dominions. Without this, the Great Ends, and Proposals of so pure and holy a Religion, cannot be accomplished; and therefore whatever Indulgences, or Exemptions the Christian Magistrate may
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54806:15"/>
rightfully grant to <hi>Erroneous Judgments,</hi> or <hi>Consciences,</hi> acted with simplicity and a pious Disposition; he cannot upon the <hi>Laws and Oeconomy of the Gospel, or any Authority derived to him from thence, rightfnlly</hi> give a <hi>Positive Establishment,</hi> within the Districts of the same Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to two <hi>Opposite Communions,</hi> or <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> of <hi>Worship;</hi> especially when one of them is founded in a revolt, from a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>Orthodox National Church.</hi> This is the very reverse to a <hi>Protector</hi> and <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of the True Religion. For it implies a power to <hi>pervert</hi> the Great Design of the Christian Religion; <hi>vis.</hi> a <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship;</hi> by dissolving the Bonds of <hi>Catholick Unity,</hi> and Authorizing the Members of CHRIST'S <hi>Mystical Body,</hi> to disband and break into <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:</hi> whereas it's an External Rule, That the <hi>Magistrate</hi> can only challenge a Power to <hi>Edification,</hi> not to <hi>Destruction.</hi> This is so far from being a Prerogative of the Magistrate, that where a National Church is constituted under <hi>Lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> and <hi>Pastors,</hi> tho' there may be some Defects, or Errors in her <hi>Faith, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,</hi>

And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> I hope I have prepared You for the main Argument You proposed, by informing You how the Magistrate is determined, for the Interests of Religion, and particularly those of this <hi>National Church.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <p>SECT. VI. I shall proceed to consider, <hi>Whether the Restraint of the</hi> PRESS, <hi>is not a Necessary Provision, not only to advance the Interests of the True Religion, but to preserve, and maintain the Ends aud De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of it, as profess'd in a National Church?</hi> And this will appear from the <hi>Necessity</hi> of a publick Establishment in Religion, and the <hi>Pernicious Influences,</hi> which the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> of the <hi>Press</hi> has upon it.</p>
               <p>It's already concluded, that GOD has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted a Governing Power in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church; and the accommodating it to the Districts of the State, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting the Civil Magistrate a <hi>Guardian,</hi> and <hi>Protector</hi> of the Church of CHRIST, is at least a sufficient Warrant of the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of a publick Establishment, if not an Indication of its <hi>Necessity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54806:16"/>
Indeed since there are Governing Powers in the Church of CHRIST, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that GOD foresaw a great many Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and Miscarriages, under the great Revolutions and Emergencies of Human Affairs; which he has Authorized them to <hi>adjust, correct</hi> and <hi>remove:</hi> and this will justly infer the Necessity of publick <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, Articles,</hi> or <hi>Canons,</hi> and that too in Matters of <hi>Faith, Worship,</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> It cannot be denied, but <hi>Scripture</hi> it self has established the Authority of such Powers, and Injunctions; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it's an indisputable Argument of their <hi>Necessity:</hi> since GOD never imparts special Powers, or Functions, but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly discerns the Necessity and Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of'em. Thus we have General Rules directed to particular Churches, in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of Publick Worship, <hi>That things be prescribed, and done according to the Laws of Decency, Order, and Edification.</hi> And no doubt St. <hi>Paul</hi> points at the same thing, when he reminds <hi>Titus,</hi> why he placed him over the Church of <hi>Crete, That thou shouldst set in order the things that are wanting: Tit.</hi> 1. 5. So that we may justly conclude,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54806:17"/>
there's a Power given to prescribe such Laws and Rules, and make such Publick Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as manifestly tend to the <hi>Edifying the Body of Christ;</hi> or as are requisite to maintain the Catholick Laws of Unity, or the <hi>Unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to descend to particulars. And <hi>first,</hi> as to matters of Faith; Indeed it will be easily granted, That the Holy Scriptures are a compleat <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they seem to be a competent Standard, for the Governours of particular Churches, to try the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> by. But yet we are assured that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>Great many things, hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, which the ignorant and unlearned wrest to their own destruction;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently things of the greatest moment, and importance. Again, we are assured, that <hi>Heresies</hi> will come, that there will arise <hi>False Christs,</hi> and <hi>False Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Men of corrupt Minds,</hi> who have not only <hi>erred,</hi> but are <hi>reprobate concerning the Faith.</hi> In a word, it's impossible but Controversies and Divisions, as well as Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, will come; this is the case of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54806:17"/>
every Tribe, or Colony of <hi>Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is there no Judgment to be made in these Circumstances? Are these Persons to be suffered to proceed in their Errors, and <hi>pervert</hi> the <hi>Faith</hi> of others? If this must be so, for what End has the Blessed AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOR of our Religion placed <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> in his Church, and enforced their Authority by the Discipline of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Censure? They cannot remonstrate against them, without making a Judgment whether the <hi>Doctrine be of</hi> GOD, or is consonant to the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> And yet 'tis their Duty to declare the <hi>whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of</hi> GOD in these Cases. And certainly, if <hi>Private Pastors</hi> are Authorized to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Sence of Scripture, and make a Judgment in these Matters, and expect the Directions of the Holy Spirit, to wait on their pious Labours, and Endeavours; much more may an <hi>Assembly,</hi> or <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Church-Governours</hi> interpose, state the Sence of Scripture, and deliver a Definitive Sentence in express <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> and expect the Influences of the same <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> in the whole performance. Certainly, where <hi>two or three,</hi> or more, are for these
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54806:18"/>
Ends <hi>gathered together,</hi> (it may justly be presumed) GOD <hi>will be in the midst of 'em.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are Proceedings warranted by the Practice of the College of Apostles, and of all particular Churches, from their Days, to this very Hour: Such Errors, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and Miscarriages <hi>concerning</hi> the <hi>Faith</hi> authorized, and gave birth to the <hi>Confessions</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> in all Particular Churches. They were the only Barriers against <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Error,</hi> and indispensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly necessary, to preserve the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of CHRIST, from Distraction and Ruine. To affirm that Scripture in these Cases is a sufficient Rule, and reject all Interposals, or Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions pursuant to it, is to mistake or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex the Argument. For tho' Scripture is an adequate Rule of Faith, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; yet GOD has constituted <hi>Guardians</hi> and <hi>Trustees,</hi> to assert the Sence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and enforce a Faith and Practice, conformable to it: and to deny this, is in effect to discard the necessity of any <hi>Visible Ministry;</hi> since Scripture, with the help of private Reason, is as much an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54806:18"/>
Rule in this respect, as the other; and consequently there could be no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of a standing Ministry. It's true, these <hi>Publick Determinations,</hi> these <hi>Confessions</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> are not established upon a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Infallibility:</hi> but they are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, or less <hi>necessary;</hi> because not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi> GOD has not thought fit to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part a Spirit of Infallibility, in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Excommunication;</hi> yet Scripture establishes it as a <hi>Standing Ordinance</hi> in his Church A Spirit of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility does not accompany the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Function;</hi> and yet GOD has made it absolutely necessary. In a word then, in as much as they are Decisions grounded on <hi>Scripture,</hi> supported by <hi>Reason,</hi> and confirm'd by the joynt <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of GOD, in the earliest Ages, and of <hi>Saints, Confessors</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;</hi> they are the most apposite Moral Instruments, under GOD, and the use of <hi>Reason,</hi> to determine the <hi>Judgment,</hi> and satisfie the <hi>Conscience;</hi> or at least to stop the Mouths of <hi>Gainsayers,</hi> as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the outward <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:54806:19"/>
In this Case, they become indispensibly necessary; there must be some External Umpire and Decision, where Matters must at last terminate: that the publick Peace and Unity (things in the judgment of our Blessed Saviour, of the greatest value and importance) may not be sacrificed to the Dissentions, Heats, and Animosities of Corrupt and Restless Spirits.</p>
               <p>If such Decrees, or Injunctions are not to be imposed as <hi>Essentials</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion;</hi> yet they are, in the Language of our Church, to be received as Injunctions <hi>for the avoiding Diversity of Opinions, and for establishing Consent touching True Religion:</hi> Or, in one word, as <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Peace;</hi> so that whosoever publickly oppugns'em, is at least to be censured, as a Breaker of the Peace of the Church.</p>
               <p>But further, as to the Duty of <hi>Publick Worship,</hi> it's undeniably evident, the great <hi>Circumstantials</hi> of Worship are no where determined in Scripture, such as the <hi>Time, Manner,</hi> and <hi>Place;</hi> and yet these are Moral, and inseparable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, without which'tis impossible the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54806:19"/>
Duty can be performed. And therefore it's absolutely necessary, they should be committed to the Determination of those Powers and Authorities, GOD has consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in his Church. For tho'this, or that <hi>Particular Determination</hi> be not necessary, till'tis settled; yet it's absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they should be <hi>determined some way or other.</hi> And this demonstrates the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Publick Establishments, in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Publick Assemblies, and Publick Worship.</p>
               <p>Again, as to the Case of Discipline, how can that <hi>Decency, Order,</hi> and <hi>Uniformity,</hi> which the Word of GOD so passionately recommends, be maintained without the Establishment of Districts, and the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Time and Place? how can the Manners of Men be animadverted on, or their Neglects, or Irregularities in the Publick Worship of GOD be censured? what must become of the Publick Duties of <hi>Admonition</hi> and <hi>Reproof,</hi> and <hi>Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> from the <hi>External Means</hi> of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the <hi>Correction</hi> of Offenders, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving</hi> of <hi>Scandal,</hi> and the <hi>Deterring</hi> of others? These are such clear and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54806:20"/>
Evidences of the Necessity of Publick Establishments, that we find them in all the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World: and the Civil Government, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Prophetick Character, is the professed <hi>Guardian,</hi> and <hi>Protector</hi> of'em.</p>

               <p>And certainly, where Men are under an unlimited Allowance to publish their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of things, it's the <hi>Publick Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment,</hi> that must suffer the sharpest at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack.

a powerful Restraint on the <hi>Press.</hi> In a word, it is concluded, If a <hi>National Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment</hi> is any way defective, or unfound in <hi>Faith, Worship,</hi> or <hi>Discipline,</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi> is to endeavour a Reform, in a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> and <hi>Canonical Method:</hi> and this, I'm confident, was never declined by the <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> but if nothing of this Nature can, with any force of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Reason, be charged upon <hi>Her,</hi> then the Magistrate, <hi>ex officio,</hi> is bound to <hi>protect</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> Her, in the Purity of Her <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> and in Her just Rights and Immunities, <hi>exclusive</hi> of all other <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Parties;</hi> especially where the Publick Peace and Unity is attempted by 'em.

pernicious Influences it casts upon <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> as 'tis the direct <hi>Inlet</hi> to <hi>Scepticism, Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Infidelity.</hi> It's certain the Attempts of a Licentious <hi>Press,</hi> are almost infinite, and inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Error,</hi> as well as <hi>Vice,</hi> is extreamly prolifick, and even as numerous as the sand of the Sea; the most virulent Poison may be gilded over, and Varnish and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour may be laid on the foulest Cause; and consequently the <hi>Press</hi> may be the Parent of the grossest Errors, under the Mask of <hi>Innocence, Zeal,</hi> or <hi>Charity.</hi> And truly, if <hi>Experience,</hi> and <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the Controversie, we are convinced, that the Lewdest Notions that ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Heart of Man, have been of late advanced from the <hi>Press.</hi> And moreover, the Mischiefs that are this way propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are much more fatal than any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because 'tis the most <hi>Effectual</hi> way of <hi>Communicating 'em.</hi> A Transient Harangue or Discourse, tho' never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, cannot be so entirely lodged in the <hi>Memory,</hi> as totally to infect the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and after this, it passes not much beyond the <hi>Present Audience.</hi> But the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54806:23"/>
                  <hi>Press</hi> is a standing <hi>Monument</hi> and <hi>Record,</hi> that not only communicates the whole Poison, and leaves it to <hi>rest</hi> upon the <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>Judgment;</hi> but conveys it to <hi>Posterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, as the Mischief is more <hi>Success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully propagated;</hi> so 'tis more <hi>difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</hi> The Men of Learning, Judgment, and Probity, may be engaged in Matters of too great Importance, to be at leisure to obviate the <hi>Mischiefs</hi> of every <hi>Poisonous Libel;</hi> but if it happens to receive a just Confutation, it's odds it either reaches not the deluded <hi>Reader,</hi> or loses its just Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy by not presenting it self before the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> is rivetted, and the Defence of the Error become a <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Interest</hi> or <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which is more fatal than all this, is, an Unrestrained <hi>Press</hi> gives a kind of <hi>Imprimatur</hi> to every thing that comes from it. As the Case stands, the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mankind are scarce able, or at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to detect the false Colours of an <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Harangue;</hi> much less enter into the <hi>Merits</hi> of any particular <hi>Controversie;</hi> and in these Cases, where a right Judgment
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54806:24"/>
cannot be made, every thing that appears in publick, must pass for <hi>Orthodox,</hi> unless it has some publick <hi>Note</hi> of <hi>Distinction</hi> fixed upon it. So that the most <hi>Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Positions</hi> in this Case rest upon equal Authority with the most convincing Truths, till they have received a Censure from the <hi>Government,</hi> either in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> And Since <hi>Paradoxes</hi> are capable of receiving a <hi>plausible Dress,</hi> and <hi>Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Contradictions</hi> may be advanced, under a shew of <hi>Argument;</hi> what fatal Consequences may not we justly dread, when <hi>Religion</hi> is the subject of both? The Injudicious and Illiterate <hi>Reader</hi> is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Rack, and left to be divided and torn in pieces, between contrary Opinions; and either hangs so long between both, till he commences <hi>Sceptick,</hi> or <hi>Infidel,</hi> and <hi>Believes Neither;</hi> or at least follows the Biass of <hi>Lust,</hi> and <hi>Corrupt Nature;</hi> and is carried away with <hi>Declamation</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue,</hi> the <hi>Usual Artifices</hi> of a <hi>Bad Cause;</hi> and consequently is inevitably plunged into <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But further, the Mischief rises higher yet, for it's concluded, An Unrestrained
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54806:24"/>
                  <hi>Press</hi> is often the most familiar with the <hi>Established Religion,</hi> and never spares in bringing Disgrace on any Branch, or part of it: It's the Publick Mark of <hi>Envy</hi> or <hi>Malice,</hi> and consequently never wants the most Furious and Envenomed <hi>Assailant.</hi> But then, this is the direct <hi>Method</hi> to usher in the most fatal Consequences; for it will not only sap the <hi>Foundations</hi> of an <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment,</hi> by bringing Her <hi>Authority</hi> into Contempt (it being the Moving Principle of all such Attacks) but it strikes at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> and makes way for resolving the whole into <hi>Sham,</hi> and <hi>Imposture.</hi> For when the <hi>Government</hi> suffers the <hi>Press</hi> to attack a <hi>Received Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> of the <hi>Established Religion,</hi> without the least <hi>Censure,</hi> or <hi>Controul;</hi> an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Judge must conclude, that both can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true: And because <hi>Authority</hi> does not proceed, to Assert and Vindicate its own <hi>Establishment,</hi> or upon a fair Estimate, establish and determine for the <hi>Truth;</hi> he'll conclude, there's no real Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood,</hi> and that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it self</hi> is nothing but a Set of <hi>Maxims,</hi> calculated according to the several <hi>Aspects</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:54806:25"/>
and <hi>Interests</hi> of <hi>Government.</hi> This is so great a Truth, that I'm highly perswaded, those publick and repeated Attacks, made from the <hi>Press</hi> of late Years, upon the <hi>Faith, Authority, Worship,</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi> (so many <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> having been so professedly question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and rejected) is the <hi>Great Cause</hi> of that <hi>Scepticism</hi> and <hi>Infidelity,</hi> or at least <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> which so visibly reigns in this <hi>Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Give me leave to represent the Force of the present <hi>Arguments,</hi> in a single <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi> It's already concluded, that the <hi>Press</hi> has appeared in a Line of <hi>Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> to two of our <hi>Publick Offices</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> the <hi>Anniversaries</hi> of that <hi>Glorious Martyr King</hi> Charles <hi>the First,</hi> and the <hi>Restauration</hi> of <hi>King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second.</hi> They are by <hi>Royal Authority,</hi> as well as <hi>Statute-Law,</hi> made part of our <hi>Publick Service.</hi> The whole Body of the <hi>Clergy</hi> are indispensibly bound to Celebrate them, and the whole <hi>Legislative</hi> Power, in a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Manner, joyns in the <hi>Celebration</hi> of 'em; and yet we have Books published in Contradiction to 'em; published in the most
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54806:25"/>
open and audacious Manner. For the <hi>Press</hi> has not done its Duty, by sending 'em into the World, but they are publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sold in the Shops, and exposed to sale from our <hi>Publick Prints,</hi> and <hi>Term-Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues.</hi> Now, what dismal Consequences can we imagine must attend such vile Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices? Our <hi>Law-givers</hi> piously declare, That <hi>By the Murder of Our late Dread Sovereign, the</hi> Protestant Religion <hi>hath received the greatest Wound and Reproach, and the People of</hi> England <hi>the most insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Shame, that was possible for the Enemies of</hi> GOD, <hi>and the</hi> King, <hi>to bring upon us;</hi> 12. <hi>Car.</hi> II. c. 30. But pardon me, if I pronounce the <hi>Liberty of the Press,</hi> to have advanced some Degrees beyond this: For the <hi>Fact,</hi> with its <hi>Prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> is now not only levelled against the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> and consequently that <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> and <hi>Reproach</hi> that is due to it, is renewed, and heightened; but a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest <hi>Blasphemy</hi> and <hi>Reproach</hi> is entailed on the very Cause of <hi>Religion:</hi> Such Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances as these, must cause the <hi>Enemies</hi> of GOD to <hi>Blaspheme;</hi> and tell us, that we either <hi>Worship we know not what,</hi> or that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54806:26"/>
our <hi>Worship</hi> is a Solemn piece of <hi>Mockery,</hi> or at least a piece of <hi>Lip-Devotion;</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the whole of Religion is <hi>Cheat</hi> and <hi>Imposture.</hi> For if these things be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable, there can be no <hi>Truth</hi> nor <hi>Reality</hi> in Religion; and this or that Profession, is no longer a piece of <hi>Religion,</hi> than it runs with the Tide and Bent of a Community.</p>
               <p>But now when things discover such a fatal Tendency as this is, if there be any such thing as a <hi>Guardian</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of CHRIST, and if the <hi>Magistrate</hi> by <hi>Divine Designation,</hi> is invested with the <hi>Character,</hi> it must be an Indispensible Duty to exert with Vigour, and Resolution. The whole Case will turn upon a short Issue; if upon a Due and Regular <hi>Examination,</hi> these <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Offices</hi> are <hi>Materially Evil,</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable;</hi> let 'em be set aside, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, that GOD may be no longer <hi>trifled with</hi> and <hi>blasphemed;</hi> nor His <hi>Pastors</hi> load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Contempt,</hi> by being bound up to the Observance of things that are not Warrantable: But if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the utmost Efforts of <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Declamation,</hi> they appear to be a <hi>Pious</hi> and a <hi>Just Institution,</hi> the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> if
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54806:26"/>
ever, must be obliged to endeavour a speedy Redress; and since these Mischiefs appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently derive from the <hi>Liberty of the Press,</hi> certainly the <hi>Trust</hi> of a <hi>Guardian</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be discharged, without destroying the <hi>Evil</hi> in its <hi>Cause:</hi> and consequently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out laying a Powerful Restraint on it. When a Mischief is thus dangerous, and destructive, it becomes the proper subject of a <hi>Law,</hi> and is to be suppressed with all the Ensigns of <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> I hope I have, in some measure, answered Your Demands, and discovered the <hi>Necessity of Regulating the</hi> PRESS; and that too with Regard to the <hi>Ecclesiastical Establishment</hi> of <hi>this Nation:</hi> and therefore I'm inclined to perswade my self, the <hi>Argument</hi> will have its just Weight, and Influence on Your <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> for the Publick <hi>Good,</hi> as well as <hi>Judgment.</hi> But that nothing may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, to cause a Miscarriage, I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a short return to the most <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objections,</hi> that have been advanced against it.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="10" type="section">

                  <hi>SECT. X. And,</hi> first, It may be objected, That the Mischiefs of the <hi>PRESS</hi> may be effectually obviated, by <hi>Particular Laws;</hi> and that a <hi>Restraint</hi> of the <hi>PRESS</hi> from the Experience of former Times, has not prevented 'em.</p>
               <p>Now it must be confessed, That the <hi>Law</hi> produced in the last <hi>Parliament,</hi> may serve as a Bridle to the <hi>Deist, Atheist,</hi> and <hi>Anti-Trinitarian;</hi> but this can by no means obviate the Mischiefs of a <hi>Licentious Press:</hi> For there are other Truths, and Doctrines set forth in the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and this <hi>Established Church;</hi> which if publickly oppugned, must prove highly Injurious to the <hi>Main Design</hi> of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as well as the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Present Establishment,</hi> such as the Doctrine of CHRIST'S <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> by the <hi>Sacrifice of Himself;</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Grance,</hi> or <hi>Divine Assistance.</hi> How these have of late suffered, the Publick has been too lately made a Witness, if not a Judge.</p>
               <p>But certainly, the Mischiefs of the <hi>Press</hi> can never be fully obviated, unless by the <hi>Restraint</hi> of it; or at least, by such a <hi>Law</hi> as makes it highly <hi>Penal,</hi> to publish any
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54806:27"/>
thing in Writing, that is level'd against any <hi>Branch</hi> of the <hi>Established Religion;</hi> for since <hi>National Establishments</hi> appear to be absolutely Necessary for the Carrying on the Ends and Designs of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that which is amiss is to be regularly corrected; and after this is done, nothing is to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that any-wise invades the <hi>Peace</hi> of such an <hi>Establishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after all, <hi>Penal Laws</hi> of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are not so apt Instruments to prevent the Mischiefs that usually spring from the <hi>Press,</hi> as an absolute <hi>Restraint</hi> of it, when the Authority of a <hi>License</hi> or <hi>Imprimatur</hi> is wanting. Such a <hi>Restraint</hi> destroys the Mischiefs in its <hi>Seeds</hi> and <hi>Principles;</hi> it stops the Contagion in the very <hi>Spring</hi> or <hi>Fountain:</hi> whereas such <hi>Laws</hi> take place at a Distance, it may be when the Infection is propagated to a considerable Degree.</p>
               <p>There is a solemn Process, and a great many Formalities, and Steps to be made, which may serve as so many Advantages, or Chances, to escape the <hi>Force</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> is not only to be discovered, but an <hi>Information</hi> given in, and received too, according to the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:54806:28"/>
of the <hi>Magistrate;</hi> and consequently the <hi>Undertaker</hi> must have Courage enough to bear the Title of <hi>Informer;</hi> an Office, which as the World goes, neither the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> nor <hi>Merits</hi> of the Cause can secure from <hi>Ignominy</hi> and <hi>Contempt.</hi> Again; there must be a Prosecution by course of <hi>Law,</hi> and the Case examined, and tried whether it falls within the Penalty of the <hi>Law;</hi> and all this, perhaps, without the least Recompence to the <hi>Prosecutor,</hi> for <hi>Expences</hi> or <hi>Attendance.</hi> In a word, a Verbal Recantation, after the Labour and Difficulties of Conviction, may render the Author <hi>Rectum in Curia:</hi> and after this, he may under Disguise go afresh to work, at the small hazard of the least of Punishments. I wish some Provisions of this Nature had not been wanting in the late <hi>Act against Profaneness and Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> whereby a Pious Design may become Insignificant and Useless. For upon this bottom, while the <hi>Press</hi> is open, I'm afraid the Enemies of our Establishment will publish their Notions, with the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of secret Smiles and Triumphs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:54806:28"/>
But now if the <hi>Press</hi> were shut, till an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> is obtained, the mere want of one is a <hi>Competent Evidence</hi> for Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and tho' some may be so daring to expose their <hi>Notions,</hi> at the hazard of their <hi>Safety,</hi> yet such a Restraint of the <hi>Press</hi> gives this considerable Advantage, That whatever comes forth without Authority, carries its own <hi>Mark</hi> in the <hi>Title-page;</hi> and consequently gives an Alarm to the incautious READER, of <hi>Infection</hi> and <hi>Mischief.</hi>

                  <hi>SECT. XI. But</hi> Secondly, <hi>it is objected,</hi> That such a Restraint of the <hi>PRESS</hi> is a giving up the Consciences, and Judgments of Mankind to a Party, and a condemning them to an Implicit Faith, and is a direct Method to involve the World in Ignorance and Error.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>First part</hi> of the <hi>Objection;</hi> If an <hi>Orthodox National Church</hi> is the <hi>Party</hi> intended, I may safely affirm, That as it is the Duty of every Person within her Communion, to conform to her <hi>Faith, Worship</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> so I hope it already appears, that it's a standing Duty
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54806:29"/>
in the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> as well as <hi>Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi> not only to enforce all <hi>Gospel</hi> Means to bring every Soul into the Pale of it; but to <hi>Maintain</hi> and <hi>Cultivate</hi> the Purity of its <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> against all the Attempts of its Enemies. If any thing is unsound and deficient, GOD has invested a Power of using such proper Means in the Governours of his Church, and the <hi>Believing Magistrate,</hi> as under his Divine Protection, will secure a True and Orthodox Religion; but if nothing of this Nature can be truly charged upon Her, when Endeavours have been made in this kind, tho' there may be no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by Violence and Force, to compel Men to be of <hi>one Mind,</hi> and <hi>one Heart;</hi> yet the Magistrate is of <hi>Right,</hi> as well as <hi>Duty,</hi> bound not to suffer her <hi>Peace</hi> to be <hi>Disturbed,</hi> or her <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship shaken</hi> by <hi>Publick Harangues,</hi> and <hi>Professed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations:</hi> This is no Persecution, but a Necessary Provision, whereby the Designs of an important Trust committed to the Magistrate, are fulfilled and answered, I mean that of a <hi>Guardian;</hi> and since it is so, I cannot imagine why any Government
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54806:29"/>
should be slack in the Exercise of a <hi>Just Power;</hi> especially since all sides are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible how much <hi>Unanimity,</hi> in Matters of Religion, contributes to the <hi>Publick Weal</hi> of a Nation. And truly, if to this Just Law, another as <hi>Equitable</hi> were established, <hi>That Persons who will not content' emselves with the Communion of the Established Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, should thereby be uncapable of any Places of Trust or Office, either in Church or State;</hi> as we find it in Neighbour Countries, I question not but it would have produced a greater <hi>Unanimity</hi> in Matters of Religion, than the most hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Projects of <hi>Comprehension.</hi> As the Case now stands, the Tolerated Party is envigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the Hopes of one Day reducing every thing to their own Model; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had an <hi>Incapaciting Clause</hi> been fixed to the last <hi>Act of Grace,</hi> I mean that of <hi>Toleration,</hi> it would not only have proved an invincible Bulwark to our Pure and <hi>Apostolick Establishment,</hi> but the most Healing Principle of Unity that could have been contrived, or thought of.</p>

SECT. XII. But to return: As to the Charge of <hi>Implicit Faith,</hi> it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, That the Depriving Mankind of any of those Means, or Instruments which GOD has appointed for the Discovery of His <hi>Revealed Will,</hi> is a direct Invasion of the <hi>Privileges</hi> of a <hi>Christian,</hi> and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable step towards the Introduction of an <hi>Implicit Faith.</hi> But I presume it cannot be pretended, that an <hi>Unlimited Power</hi> of <hi>Printing</hi> is one of those <hi>Means</hi> which GOD has appointed for the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the True Religion. If so, GOD seems to have been very much wanting to his own Designs, in not communicating the Art by some <hi>Apostle</hi> or <hi>Prophet,</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it obtained in the Christian World. But it's well known, the True Religion rests upon other Foundations; it was <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished</hi> in <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Perfection,</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this useful Art was formed, or thought of; and I question not, will long continue so, unless the <hi>Privilege</hi> of <hi>Printing</hi> the <hi>lewdest</hi> and most <hi>Heretical Notions,</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert its Foundations.</p>
               <p>As for this <hi>National Establishment,</hi> I challenge her most avowed Enemies to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54806:30"/>
produce one single Instance, wherein she denies her Members the use of any <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Apostolick Means,</hi> that are Instituted for the Discovery of the True Religion. Our Church imposes no Article of Faith upon pure Church-authorities; she recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends every thing to the Mind and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science upon rational Motives, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions: She is careful to publish useful Discourses, in Matters of Faith and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; and, in a word, every thing <hi>that is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness, that the Man of</hi> GOD <hi>may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good Works.</hi> She does not only allow, but exhort her People, <hi>To examine themselves whether they are in the Faith:</hi> She denies 'em no Means of Information, she does not only lay open the Well of Life, or Fountain of Living Waters, the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> but recommends 'em to their Search and Enquiry, even to the Trying <hi>of the Spirits</hi> by them: She allows 'em to propose their Doubts and Scruples to their <hi>Spiritual Pastors,</hi> and administers Counsel and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice upon the force of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:54806:31"/>
In a word, as she conceals nothing of the <hi>whole Counsel of</hi> GOD, so she ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits all their Proposals, by way of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry</hi> and <hi>Information:</hi> So that there is nothing wanting of those Means GOD has instituted to enable every Man <hi>To give a reason of the Hope that is in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where then is that <hi>Nursery</hi> of <hi>Implicit Faith</hi> and <hi>Ignorance?</hi> If Mens Judgments by all these Methods cannot, or will not be set right and informed, shall they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a Right to publish Dogmatically, what they pretend to retain on no other Authority, than that of a weak Conscience, to bear down <hi>a rightful Establishment?</hi> Are all the <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Information</hi> useless, and to be despised, if this is not suffered?

When therefore an Establishment has done all this, shall the Magistrate that is constituted a <hi>Guardian;</hi> and <hi>Trustee</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of CHRIST, suffer the consciences of Men to be distracted, and the <hi>Publick Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> invaded, by the bold Cavils and Harangues of every <hi>Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gainsayer?</hi>

                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:54806:32"/>
But, <hi>First,</hi> it's an indisputable Truth, That the <hi>Natural Rights</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Private Persons,</hi> are perpetually conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Interests</hi> of <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Societies;</hi> and the Exercise of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is for the most part to be regulated, and determined by the latter. Again, Whatever the Rights and Interests of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Persons may be, the Magistrate is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely entrusted with the Preservation of the Publick Peace; and consequently may rightfully suppress every thing that is level'd against any Branch of the <hi>Publick Establishment;</hi> since such Attempts unsettle the Minds of a People, and engender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate Heats and Animosities, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently carry a direct Tendency to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and Confusion.</p>
               <p>All Governments give a latitude for <hi>private Opinions</hi> and <hi>Sentiments;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not usually extend their <hi>Tests</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,</hi> beyond Places of <hi>Trust</hi> or <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employments:</hi> whereas 'tis their Care and Prudence to keep a watchful Eye upon <hi>New Notions</hi> obtruded on the Publick. Whilst an Opinion rests in the <hi>Breasts</hi> of private Persons, the <hi>Publick Peace</hi> is not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54806:32"/>
exposed; but when 'tis pressed upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in <hi>Publick Harangues,</hi> and transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>Press</hi> too; it gives Umbrage to the Peace and Weal of the Community, and consequently calls for the Care and Vigilance of the Magistrate. In Cases of this Nature, the first Christian Emperors appear'd as <hi>Guardians</hi> in the Church of CHRIST, and vigorously exerted their Power and Authority, to maintain its publick Peace and Unity.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Importance</hi> of the <hi>Opinion,</hi> and</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> If the Opinion be such as does not affect any considerable Interest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or correct or remove any dangerous Error, but rather serves to entertain our <hi>Speculation</hi> and <hi>Curiosity,</hi> than regulate our <hi>Conscience</hi> or <hi>Practice;</hi> there can be no Obligation to disturb the World by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing <hi>Established Doctrines</hi> or <hi>Notions,</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:54806:33"/>
when after all they may carry in them greater Marks or Evidences of Truth, than a private Judgment can reasonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Unless our Opinions are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the clearest Convictions of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> (as all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Importance undoubtedly are) there can be no just Plea for <hi>Duty,</hi> to engage the rest of the World to become <hi>Disciples</hi> or <hi>Followers.</hi> And indeed it seems highly unreasonable, that private Persons should amuse the Minds of others by obtruding <hi>New Notions,</hi> when it may be they rest upon bare <hi>Probabilities,</hi> or no higher Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences than those that have been <hi>peaceably</hi> received from <hi>Publick Authority</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> If the Projections and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men were governed by these Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, I'm perswaded the <hi>Restraint</hi> of the <hi>Press</hi> (when it is thereby only committed to the Inspection of <hi>Publick Authority</hi>) would seldom be interpreted a Breach of any <hi>Natural Rights</hi> or <hi>Duties.</hi>

on, except for its <hi>Popularity</hi> and <hi>Modern Fashionableness:</hi> 'Tis this, <hi>That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of the</hi> PRESS, <hi>is an Invasion of the Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property of an</hi> Englishman.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54806:34"/>
but dispel'd that Cloud of Objections that of late has been raised to obstruct the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of the <hi>Press.</hi> If therefore what has been already offered has the good Fortune to carry the Balance, against Your former Sentiments, be pleased to suffer a short Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress on my part, in the case before us, as a hearty Advocate for the Maintainance and Welfare of the <hi>Government</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> We have been hitherto engaged in the Cause of Religion, and the Methods of its Preservation and Support. And the late passionate Address of the last <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and His <hi>Majesty</hi>'s most Gracious Answer to it, seems to Authorize the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of the Argument. That <hi>Venerable Body</hi> wisely applied Themselves to their <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,</hi> to consult His <hi>Pleasure,</hi> as well as excite His <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Piety:</hi> and He was pleased to signifie His concurrence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Managery of the Affair to His <hi>House of Commons,</hi> as to the proper <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to prepare Matters for the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a just Law. It's true, that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable House</hi> formed a Bill upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Argument; but the Miscarriages of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54806:34"/>
it, where-ever justly to be fixed, cannot conclude against, the Reasonableness or Necessity of it. I'm confident the Eyes and Heart, the Hopes and Expectations of every <hi>Englishman,</hi> that is acted with a true Concern for the True Religion, are fixed on the ensuing Session; and pardon me, if I flatter My-self, That the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments already suggested, demonstrate the absolute Necessity of Restraining the <hi>Press,</hi> as an effectual Expedient to preserve the Interests of it.</p>
               <p>The Liberty of Printing without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense or Inspection, has sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged its poisonous Influences against the <hi>Interests</hi> of the <hi>Established Religion;</hi> and a small tract of Time in the same Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, would demonstrate its Force and Efficacy against the Interests of the <hi>Civil Polity,</hi> as established in a <hi>Monarchy.</hi> I wish some late Essays had not asserted the Truth of the Observation: witness those gross Insinuations the <hi>Press</hi> has presented us with, for the preference of a <hi>Republick</hi> to that of <hi>Monarchy:</hi> [See <hi>Ludlow's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs</hi>] Witness those base and unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Characters vented, in a late Paper,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54806:35"/>
wherein the present Reign seems to be blacken'd by the Help of a <hi>Prophetick Spirit,</hi> and making it an Accessary to what may come hereafter; where every Estate of the Realm, and every Order of Men in Authority and Places of Trust, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed like Ruffians and Paltroons, rather than Persons of Dignity and Honour. What can be the Scope of such unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Declamation, but to bring the <hi>English</hi> Constitution into Disgrace, and prepare the Minds of the People for <hi>Anarchy</hi> and Confusion. [See <hi>The short History of Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Armies in England.</hi>]</p>
               <p>But to return: YOU, <hi>Sir,</hi> and Your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Brethren,</hi> are concerned as Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stees and Guardians in part for <hi>Religion;</hi> and since the necessity of a National Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment is fully demonstrated, all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interested Persons must conclude, That Your special Care and Inspection should be engaged to advance that of this Nation, of which You profess Your selves <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and from whose <hi>Communion,</hi> by Civil Appointment, You receive Qualifications for <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Trust,</hi> or <hi>Publick Employ.</hi> A Temporary Interest may engage a great
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54806:35"/>
many Men, to declare 'emselves <hi>Members</hi> of Her Communion; but it's certain the true Test of <hi>Membership</hi> is to use all imaginable Endeavours to maintain her <hi>Rights,</hi> and support her <hi>Constitution;</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she's publickly attack'd in any Branch of it.</p>
               <p>To have the <hi>Press</hi> regulated by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Doctrines of a <hi>National Establish ment,</hi> is to be esteemed one of her <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Rights</hi> and <hi>Immunities;</hi> and therefore when Invasions of this Nature are daily made, she may justly expect the interposal of <hi>Authority:</hi> But if she could not challenge thus much of Right, yet since the <hi>Dissenting Sectaries</hi> have received very ample <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> under the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Government;</hi> the <hi>Established Religion,</hi> one would think, may reasonably expect her tail in this kind, and command the <hi>Press</hi> in matters of Religion, as the <hi>First Act</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi> especially since 'tis no more but what <hi>Former Reigns,</hi> by an indisputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authority, afforded her.</p>
               <p>But to draw towards a Conclusion: Give me leave to tell You, <hi>Sir,</hi> If the <hi>Restraint</hi> of the <hi>Press</hi> cannot be obtained by way of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54806:36"/>
Right, nor Grace and Favour: I question not but the fatal influences it has upon <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> is Motive sufficient to accomplish it. I shall not resume the Argument I have already enlarged on; but certainly it seems to be a fruitless Attempt to suppress <hi>Immorality</hi> and <hi>Profaneness,</hi> and establish a Sence of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of <hi>Piety,</hi> whilst a latitude is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the most publick manner, to dispute the most <hi>Sacred Points</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry <hi>National Establishments,</hi> arraign the whole Order of the <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the Solemnities of <hi>Publick Worship.</hi> It's impossible the generality of Mankind under these Instructions, can entertain any serious Thoughts concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> but are rather prepared to contemn and vilifie the <hi>Blessed</hi> AUTHOR of it, and the whole <hi>Contrivance:</hi> and therefore if <hi>Morality</hi> and strict <hi>Vertue</hi> is pursued on these terms, it's more to be ascribed to the happy <hi>Genius</hi> of Mankind, than any Principle of Religion. In a word then, If the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Assembly of <hi>Commons</hi> is in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest for <hi>Reformation</hi> (as I question not but they are) what has already been offered,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54806:36"/>
seems to bespeak the <hi>Regulation</hi> of the <hi>Press</hi> to be the most likely <hi>Introduction</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have delivered my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents with as much Sincerity as Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. All that remains, is, If they happen to make You a <hi>Proselyte,</hi> I hope You'll employ Your hearty Endeavours, in the Post You're fixt, to make the Argument the subject of a Law; and the greatest Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of this will be, that Care be taken, not only that a Law be formed, which will effectually answer the Designs of it; but that the Forming of it be done with that Prudence and Caution, as not to give a handle to crush it in its first Production. When. this is accomplished, it will lay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Obligations of Gratitude and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect towards the Instruments of it, on all those in whom the Interest of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment apparently consists; <hi>The True Members of the Established</hi> CHURCH <hi>of</hi> ENGLAND.</p>
