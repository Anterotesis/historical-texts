            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have found nothing (good Reader) in Mr. Michel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons confutation worthie of any answere, but that which is borrowed from D. Morton or D. Denison, and hath been already answered in Perth assemblie. What is his owne, is new, but so absurd, that just lie he hath deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the change of his surname fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Michelsone to Nihilsone. The judicious Reader may finde as much in Perth assemblie untouched, as may serve for defence of that which he hath lightly touched: and may find further in the Solution of D. Resolutus his resolutions for kneeling. I have now added this defence of our reasons, not so much for reply to his confutation (for that was needlesse) as for illustration, and confirmation of that which hath been alreadie written in the two former, and to obviat such cavillations, as perhaps may be used by some other of our opposites. I will keep the same ordour, which our Antagonist hath set down<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e: howbeit he hath divided our arguments, to make them seeme the weaker, as Medea rent, and scattered the members of her brother, that ther by she might the more safely flee: which fault Peter Martyr objected to Gardinerus. His arguments for kneeling shal be answered in the defence of our reasons, as occasion shall offer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <head>DEFENCE OF OUR I. ARGVMENT.</head>
            <p>THE gesture of our Lord, and his Apostles, at the Paschall Supper, was a kind of sitting gesture. The same gesture was continued at the Eucharisticall Supper. For whilst they did eat, to wit, of the second service of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Supper (and consequently whilst they did sit) Christ took bread, and gave thanks, Math. 26. 26. Mark. 14 22. This collection is so cleere, and evident, that the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, hote persecuters for kneeling, doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the same. Cardinall Baronius; <note n="a" place="margin">Annal. tom. 1. an, 34. num. 44.

               <hi>That Matthew sayth, And as they were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Jesus took bread, and blessed; and Mark saith, And as they did eat Iesus took bread, and blessed, and brak it, it is all one, as if they had sayd, whilst they were sitting.</hi> But Matthew and Mark, sayth our new made Doctor, must be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by Luke and Paul, who do say, that Christ did institute the Sacrament after they had supped, Luk. 22. 19. 1. Cor. 11. 24. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that Paul and Luke speak of the cup, and not of the bread, <hi>Likewise after Supper, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ook the cup, and blessed. Likewise,</hi> that is, hee give thankes, as he had done before, when hee took the bread. Neither Paul, nor any of the Evangelists do say, that after hee had supped, hee took the bread, as they doe of the cup. This difference of speech made Bellarmine <note n="b" place="margin">De Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist lib. 4. cap. 27.</note> to follow their opinion, who thought, that Christ consecrated, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21385:4"/>
distributed, the bread, in the very time of the Legall Supper, whilst they were eating of it, and that after other actions intervee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the Supper ended Christ took the cup. There is no necessitie to collect such a disjunction of so heavenly a mysterie; but the common opinion is to be retained, that this Mysterie was instituted <hi>per modum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> signi,</hi> in one continued action. Alwayes wee may see, that the bread being consecrated, and distributed, and eaten, before Christ took the cup, justly it may be said, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter supper he took the cup, seeing now the first halfe of this holy action was ended, and had intervened between their eating of the Paschall Supper, and the taking of the cup. Put the case that Luke and Paul had said that after Supper he took bread, their words must so interpre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They did not kneele; for if Christ had changed the ordinarie gesture of sitting at the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall supper, into kneeling at the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risticall, a gesture of adoration, and no ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gesture, then kneeling had been institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and not left indifferent, and arbitrarie: For to what end should Christ have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the one in the other, except it had been his will to have it observed, as other chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges made in passing from the last act of the Paschall supper to the Eucharisticall. But our opposites dare not say, that knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was instituted.

            <p>Our first Argument then against kneeling in the act of receiving the sacramentall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is drawn from the example of Christ and his Apostles at the first institution; and the practise of the primitiue Kirks follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Apostles times. Their gesture was not a gesture of adoration in the act of receiving, but a Table gesture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it was a sit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing gesture they used, and not kneeling. Christ instituted Baptisme, but wee reade not that he baptised in his own person. But in this Sacrament hee was not onely institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as Lord, but also celebrated as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and set down a most exact and perfect paterne of celebration. The practise of the Apostles following the same order is a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to us to follow the same also.</p>
            <p>We reason likewise from this example and practise, against any other gesture which is not a Table-gesture, howbeit not with the same force, as against kneeling. There is eating with walking (as Pios the Monk did, who said hee would not make a worke
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21385:6"/>
of eating his meate) but this is no table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesture. To stand in the act of receiving, and then passe by, as in some Churches they do, is not a table-gesture. For there is no more use of a Table in this case, when the communicant standeth, &amp; taketh out of the ministers hand, more then of a cupboord, or dressor, suppose it were never so long. For so it serveth onely to the setting on of the elements, that from thence they may bee reached by the hand of the Minister to the Communicant. A table of as short dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, may serve to that use, at the Papists re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of necessitie for their Altar to hold up the foot of the Chalice, and so much of the plate, as may keep it from falling, together with the Masse-book, and the candle.</p>
            <p>We reason thirdly from the same exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and practise, but with least vehemencie, against other table-gestures also, as standing about the table; because it is not agreeable to the first paterne and practise. It was not <hi>coena stataria, aut ambulatoria,</hi> but <hi>accubitoria,</hi> which Christ and his Apostles celebrated: not a standing or walking, but a sitting sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. But to returne to kneeling, I conclude with the words of Calvin, who sayth, <hi>That</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It is objected first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if this argument be go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d then the minister should teach sitting, because Christ taught sitting. But the case is no alike. For the Lords supper is a rituall action, and a visible object is presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the communicant. Christ taught us by his example, how to behave our selves in such a case. Next, Christ taught sometime standing, sometime sitting, according to the opportunity of time and place. He sate in the mount, Mat. 5. he stood in the plain, Luk. 6. Paul stood up and made his exhortation in the synagogue, Act. 13. He that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied stood up, 1. Cor. 14. 30. as Cajetanus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth collect. <note n="l" place="margin">Audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes sedere, prophetantes stare signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat dicendo, Quod si alij sedenti.</note> The originall word signifieth, that the other prophet who was not in the act of prophesying, was <hi>sitting,</hi> not <hi>sitting by.</hi> Lastly, this objection may be retorted upon themselves, That seeing Christ and his Apostles and all teachers and hearers in all ages afterward, did not preach or heare prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching kneeling, we can have no warrant to do it. If not at delivery or receiving of the word, then also not at the delivery or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21385:7"/>
of the sacramentall elements.</p>
            <p>It is objected next, that Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles sate not at the paschall supper alter our manner of sitting, and that it was rather a lying then a sitting, as the originall words <hi>anakeisthai</hi> and <hi>anapiptem</hi> do import? It hath been answered already <note n="m" place="margin">P. A. pag. 38. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea the holy Ghost doth expresse this same gesture also by the word sitting in the originall language, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 23. 41. That kind of gesture, (whether brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes by the Romans or Persians, or if it was as ancient as the dayes of David or Salomon, as some do collect out of 1. Sam. 9. 22. Prov. 7. 14. 16. Cant. 1. 12. it is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall) succeeded in the roome of upright sitting, and hath given place again to the same, as answering analogically to it. It was in Christs time the received manner of sitting, and no further is required of us but to observe the received gesture of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where we are. It is also to be observed that <hi>anakeisthai</hi> and <hi>anapiptein</hi> are not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vocables to expresse this kind of gesture, as Athenaeus doth testifie. <note n="n" place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 18.</note> Beza in Math. 8. 11. sayth, that <hi>anaclinesthai</hi> is put there for <hi>cataclinesthai</hi> the proper greek vocable of this gesture. Farther, howbeit in a private par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor a small number did sit after that manner at the first paschall supper, yet it is no way probable, that in the Christian assemblies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in Corinth, Ierusalem, or else where, they sate after the same manner. For howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21385:7"/>
there is mention made in ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of houses of 60. 80. or 100. beds, that was not common, but peculiar to princes and great men. Plutarch <note n="o" place="margin">Sympo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia 5.</note> noteth it as a vice in a man to build houses for 30. supping beds, or above. Shall we then think, that the Apostolicall Kirks had the use of such houses for their meetings, or that the Lords supper could be celebrated in such a form in their numerous assemblies.</p>
            <p>It is thirdly obiected, that if we be bound to the imitation of Christ, and his Apostles gesture by as good reason we shall be bound to the imitation of the time and place; that is, to celebrate after supper, and in a private house. It is answered that the circumstances of time and place of the first supper were onely occasionall, and the occasion of them was vnavoydable because of the law of the passe over. But the gesture might be easily changed by Christ without violation of Gods law, namely seeing the paschall supper was ended. It was a easie to them to goe to their knees, as to the Aegyptian Naucratits after they were set downe to their feasts, when they began to sing hymnes to their gods. But our Lord would keep the same forme at the Eucharisticall supper, which hee kept at the paschall. Our Doctor sayth, that the Apostles retained these circumstances, and changed them not. I answer, if that were true, we have no reason, nor warrant to doe otherwise. Next, if the Apostles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained these circumstances upon occasion, and not for imitation, upon necessitie, &amp; not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21385:8"/>
voluntarily, then he hath gained nothing. For we deny not, that in times of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or when occasionally there falleth out any necessity, we may celebrate in the night, and in a private house, where the Church is assembled. The Apostles would not have been suffered to celebrate the supper in the temple, as sometime they were overseen to teach. Next, it was not so fit for the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Lords supper, as for the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word. The first was ordeined onely for the beleevers: the last, to convert also unbeleeving Iewes. Thirdly, there is no likelihood that they celebrated ever at night. For howbeit at Troas Act. 20. it were granted to have been celebrated at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; as some do call it in question, yet who seeth not, that it was then d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>layed to that time, not because it was the usuall time, or for imitation of the institution but onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasion. The Apostle being to depart, did continue preaching, and so that action was continued. The Centurie vvriters doe not affirme, that the Corin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>TO the due ministration of the Lords Supper there is required a table, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about the communicants are to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. If a table, then also a table gesture; knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is not a table-gesture. Therefore knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is not a fit gesture for this Supper. A table is so requisite to this action, that from a table this supper hath received one of the scripture names, that is, to bee called the Lords table, to distinguish it from common tables. As it is called breaking of bread, because that rite was usuall in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this sacrament. By this reason, sayth the Doctor, it should be celebrated at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, because it is called the Lords Supper. It is true, that in our language, this word, Supper, signifieth onely the evening meale, but not so in the originall.

            <p>The Doctor casteth by, in a dark corner, two of our reasons, as not worthy to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, or ranked in order, &amp; number with the rest. First we say, that where kneeling is in use, the Sacramentall breaking after that ksgiving is not enioyned, so far as we can find in their Service books, when as other rites invented by man are injoyned. And for practise, <hi>Paraeus</hi> testifieth that the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran Kirkis have it not, but have the bread cut in small pecces before it be brought to the hands of the Minister, which is not that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21385:11"/>
Sacramentall breaking instituted by Christ. The Doctor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith that he and some other of his followes doe break the bread. But I would demand, if that be the common or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Kirks where kneeling is in use. Next if it be a breaking in the own time, and place, that is betwixt the thankesgiving, and giving with these words, <hi>This is my body, as</hi> Christ gave it. For the Papists have a kind of breaking after all the words are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. For belike it is heresie to breake it before they have said; <hi>Hoc est enim corpus meum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second reason disdainfully rejected by the Doctor, is this, that kneeling hath brought in a change upon the sacramentall word, changing the enunciative forme of the words, <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>KNeeling, say we, maketh many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions in one Congregation, in the place of one, without any necessity: wheras if wee keeped the right order, wee needed not to doe so.

That you come not together to iudgement, that is, that you keep not the mystery so, as you bee worthy to be reprehended with offence,</hi> Hierome or some other under his name, upon this same place sayth, <hi>Because none taried for other, that the offring might be made in common, therefore they came together, not unto sanctification, but unto iudgement.</hi> Bilson <note n="t" place="margin">Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, p. 461.</note> citeth Augustine to the same purpose: yea Augustine affirmeth, that <hi>the Apostle speaking of this sacrament, sayth, For which cause brethren, when you assemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eat, expect one another.</hi> And againe, <note n="v" place="margin">Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence p. 494.</note> he citeth these words of Chrysostome, <note n="x" place="margin">Homil. in dictum Pauli opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet hereses esse.</note>

He saith that we may communicate Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally in divers Parishes, which I thinke no other man ever affirmed. For howbeit they communicate together spiritually, as all Christians doe in the remotest parts of the world, receiving the same spirituall food signified in this Sacrament. Yet they doe not communicate together sacramentally, but who receive the Sacrament together. Cartwright, writing against the Rhemists, speaketh well to this purpose <note n="z" place="margin">In 1.

For notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Christ (who is the Lamb and the Bread) be but one, yet the outward matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be one but many, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of places, wherein the Sacrament is ministred.</hi> See more in this place, and in 1.

No more is the image to these Papists, and their adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is as abstract from their object, as the kneeler is from his. But, sayth the Doctor, there is difference betwixt images, and the sacramentall symbols. The first, are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of men, and forbidden to be used in the worship of God, the other are Gods own ordinance, and commanded to be used in his worship: and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth this his saying with the testimonies of Martyr; which needed not. For we deny not, that they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be used in Gods worship, as the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God is taken in a large sense, for his publick worship, and all the parts therof, the preaching of the word, ministration of the sacraments, &amp;c. But they were not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be used in the worship of God, as it is taken in a strict sence, <hi>in statu accommodato ad adorationem,</hi> for adoration properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to fall down before them, and worship

Christ absent. The force of this argument must be this. Whatsoever thing God hath commanded to be used in his publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, we may lawfully fal down before it, and worship God by way of adoration properly so called. The sacramentall symbols are commanded to bee used in Gods publick worship: Therefore we may fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them and worship God. The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this argument is seen in the propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I hope, they will not maintaine. If the Iewes had fallen before every signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant object commanded by God to be used in time of divine service, they had continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed Idolatry.</p>
            <p>P. Martyr professing in Oxford at that time, when kneeling was enjoyned to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Papists somewhat, who had made some stirres, pretending that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was prophaned; was loath, being a stranger, to contradict the prescribed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and his great friends, who called him to that place. He was forced afterward to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, what he had written before, and through the importunity of Gardiner his adversarie, was driven to plaister the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish adoration, with such speeches as cannot be well allowed. But even then, when hee was excusing, he was wishing it were not, and was ever warning them of the danger of it; and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But let it be so, that they kneele onely when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, do they not kneele before it, when they receive it? What matter of the length, or shortn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>se of the time; or the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving? If it be unlawfull at any time, even for a moment, or in any act. God never ordained, that any act of his service should
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21385:23"/>
be performed with any sinne, but rather in case there lay such a necessity on a man, that he cannot performe service to him without sinne, that he should omit his service. For God will not accept of sinne in no case. Next, why will they make scruple to kneele at the elevation, seeing it is then consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; it is <hi>objectum a quo significative;</hi> it is in the ministration of the Mysteries, in the time of Gods publick worship. God forbid, that we see the day, wherein he and his fellowes may do this without controulement. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Formalist did not commit Idolatry in bowing before the creature by direction, yet he committeth idolatry, in that he knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for reverence of the creature. For to kneele before a creature, because of a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent estimation of it, is to adore it. Because kneeling in religious worship, is ever the gesture of adoration. The formalist kneeleth for reverence of the Sacrament, and the sacramentall actions, taking, eating, drinking. For kneeling is enjoyned in the Kirk of England for reverence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Ministers of Lincolne do prove in their Abridgment. Conformity with England is intended. Therefore kneeling for reverence of the Sacrament is intended. Next kneeling is enjoyned by the act of Perth, for reverent and due regard of so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine a Mysterie, as is the Sacrament. Seeing therfore the publick intent is to kneele for reverence of the Sacrament, let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himselfe with his own private intent; for his act must be interpreted before men
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21385:23"/>
according to the publicke intent, and before God he shall be guilty, not onely of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, but also of dissimulation. Otherwise he may go to Rome, and take kneeling <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Christi,</hi> out of the Popes own hand. Thirdly, this private intent, must either be for reverence of the Sacrament, or else with prophannesse, and mocking of God. For put the case he be praying in the act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, hearing receiving, eating, drinking; he cannot, nor should not be praying all that time, and performe these actions also, as he ought to do, but sometimes he must have his senses, the members of his body, his mind exercised otherwise then in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to wit, outwardly beholding, taking, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, drinking; considering inwardly, what these signes, and rituall actions do meane. If in this time he be not praying, and yet kneeling, he is either mocking God, not caring for what respect he kneeleth; or else he kneeleth for reverence of these sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, and actions, whereabout and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is exercised. But the truth is, that the short <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jaculations of the heart, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we shal speak afterward, may consist with any other actions, either civill or religious: but a set or continued prayer, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist vvith any other actions, either civill or religious, except the gestures of prayer themselves, whether a man stand, sit, or kneele. If a man should be praying on his knees, and in the meane time be eating his meat, vvould ye not thinke, that that man vvere either mocking GOD, or
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21385:24"/>
kneeled for reverence of his meat, and made an Idoll of it. Ye will say, the case is not alike: for the one is consecrated, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lv, the other is but common. Is not then, the kneeling at the one, and not at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for reverence, holinesse being the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, wherfore a man doth kneele. As the King is the person honoured <hi>ut quae,</hi> and the Royall Dignity is the reason <hi>ut qua,</hi> wherby h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

With what face then, can men say that they kneel not for reverence of the elements, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons employed about the elements? And this is more then I think a Papist will do to the crucifix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is objected first, that we uncover our head, why may we not also bow ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> knees: I answer, that we uncover our heads in the time of this action, as we doe at the hearing of the Scripture read, which we do for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, not for adoration. For in this Sacrament CHRISTS own words are heard, and his actions, which were divine and holy, reiterate, and therfore we owe reverence or veneration, but not adoration
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21385:24"/>
for reverence, no more then at the hearing of the scripture read. For as Chrysostome sayth, <note n="s" place="margin">In 2. Tim. hom. 2.

As he that giveth almes to a poore man, is said to doe it to Christ, because he doth it for Christs sake, and honoureth Christ in the poore man. But in adoration God will have no mediate creature to goe betwixt him and the worshipper, howbeit he would pretend, that it is done for his sake; as all Idolaters doe pretend. Kneeling is the gesture of the high and divine worship, which the schoolemen call <hi>cultus latria,</hi> and never given in Scripture to any other, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worship: howbeit the Papists have given it also to inferiour creatures, which is their vile idolatry.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21385:25"/>
vve uncover our heads, and do say grace. I answer, There is a relation here between God and the meat, but not a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vvorship, either from the meat to God, as if our vvorship did passe by the meat, and determine in God, or return from God, and determine in the meat. The meat is the subject vvherupon vve desire Gods blessing to be bestowed before vve use it. And therfore vve use the gestures of prayer, vvhich are used in blessing of other things, that is, vve stretch out our hands over our meat, or use the like demonstrative signe of the creature, vvhich vve desire God to blesse.

where it hath bene out of use these threescore yeares by past, and cast away as a menstruous cloath. He telleth us that the Ark was in the Philistimes hands: that the gold, brasse, and Iron of Iericho was taken into the Lords treasure, and other like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. The Arke was Gods own ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The silver, the gold, the brasse, were not idolatrous, but the civill goods of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.

True: but not, kneeling before the elements of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the act of receiving. He saith Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah brake the Idoll, but reserved the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Incense to God: So they have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in peeces, the idoll of Reall presence, but reserved kneeling to Christ. But we say, that he abolished the burning of Incense not simply, for it was a part of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but burning of Incense before the brasen Serpent. So we crave not kneeling simply to be abolished, but kneeling before the elements in the act of receiving. <note n="y" place="margin">P. A. p. 55. Sol. p. 38.</note>

in well reformed Kirks do think the same; and yet he will say, that the Belgick Kirks feared where there was no need of feare. At last he telleth us, that a Synod in Pole made standing or kneeling indifferent, but sitting they condemned. That Synod was a confused or mixt Synod of sundry sorts of professors, some adhering to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustane confession, some to the Helvetian, some to the Bohemian. Next, they thought that the Arrians had been the first authors of sitting after the reformation, when as both the Scottish and Belgick Churches at that same time, and many yeares before, did use the gesture of sitting; and as worthy a Polonian, as that Church bred in his time, Iohannes Alasco, a Polonian Baron, wrot before the holding of that synod many years more amply, and more earnestly for sitting, then any other man els, and did put it in practise in the kirkes, where he bare office. So it was in them a grosse ignorance in a matter of fact, which was so publick in the view of all men. Thirdly, howbeit there was at that mixt Synod a great number of Lutherans, yet they consent with the rest, that no man should be urged to kneel; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was neither the will of God, nor custome of the purer Kirk to censure, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish godly men for externall rites. The Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran, yee may see, is more favourable in this poynt, howbeit he maintain Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily presence, then these who would seem to be of our own profession. <note n="d" place="margin">Sol. pag. 36.</note> It is to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that in this place the Doctor esteemeth

            <p>KNeeling in the act of receiving, say we, is will-worship. He sayth it is no part of Gods worship properly; and therfore it cannot be will-worship. This followeth not: for will-worship is of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry sorts; as when a man inuenteth a new kinde of service to God, which hee never commanded; or when he misplaceth that vvhich God hath commanded, and useth it vvhere he will; or vvhen that, vvhich is not in the own nature vvorship, the user maketh it worship in his own conceit and opinion. Next, it followeth not, because that knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is a signe of vvorship, that therefore it is not worship properly; or because some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time we use it, and sometime not: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be a signe of the internall adoration, yet is it the matter it selfe of externall ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for by it we do not onely signifie the affection of our heart, but also honoureth God, either in secret, or before men. For he that adoreth, honoureth; and we honour. God not onely with our spirit, but also with our body. As the Doctor himselfe said before; we direct to God, not onely the worship of our hearts, but of our body: When wee pray without kneeling we give spirituall vvorship, vvithout determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that particular bodily vvorship at that time: but vvhen vve pray kneeling,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21385:29"/>
vvee cojoyne the bodily, and spirituall worship. Thirdly, it is not the kneeling out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward onely, that we call will-worship, but that also wherupon kneeling doth usually attend, that is set and continued prayer. For we say, that in the act of receiving, there is not the proper time and place of set and continued prayer; wherof we shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in the own place. To pray then, is Gods worship, but to pray in an unfit time, to displace any other part of God worship, is will-worship.</p>

            <p>VVEE say, that kneeling entred into the Kirk under Antichrist: whether Honorius was the first deviser of it, or not, we regard not as a point materiall. It appeareth that Honorius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed onely an inclination, or bowing of the super our bulk of the body at the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not kneeling. If he ordained so much to be done at the elevation, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that in the act of receiving, kneeling was either then also ordained, or come in a little after. But whether before, or after, is not the chiefe question. It is sufficient, that it was not in use in the Kirk of God for a 1000. years, or before the time at least, when the Antichrist was at his height. For there is not one expresse testimony in all the ancient Writers for kneeling in the act of receiving,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21385:30"/>
except some counterfeit worke; yea, not so much as in any counterfeit work, so farre as we have yet seen alledged, except in one Cyrillus. The censure of Moulins upon these Catechismes of Cyrillus is marked and set down already in Perth Assembly <note n="e" place="margin">P. A. p. 60.</note>.

Beza saith, that kneeling in the act of receiving, brought in Popish bread-worship, and transubstantiation, because, it may be, he gave some credit to Cyrillus; but it is very likely that it came in after the opinion of the reall presence, and transubstantiation. For as I have said, there is not a testimony we can heare of, yet alledged for kneeling, within the space of a 1000. yeares. And suppose that kneeling went before the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Reall Presence, or Transubstantion, yet even then it was, (and no other wayes it could be) the Formalists idolatry, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the way to, or rather drawing on the worshipping of Christ as bodily present, or the bread transubstantiated into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For I have already declared, that kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the act of receiving, eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cannot be but idolatrous. Many grosse corruptions were in the Kirk before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Reall Presence, or Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation prevailed. Seeing then it came in under the Antichrist, whether should we

            <p>KNeeling in the act of receiving is scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous to many.

This shew of idolatry that is in kneeling, suppose there were no more, is an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and occasion to others to commit ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, &amp; hardneth the Papist in his idolatry; It is an active, not a passive scandall. We must not omit a necessary duty, suppose o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unjustly take offence. But kneeling in the act of receiving is not a necessary duty, but such a deed as is inductive to scandall.</p>
            <p>The Doctor' saith that it is a necessary duty to obey the ordinance of our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and not to withstand the Authority. No man denyeth obedience to be due to the Magistrate, or Superiour, suppose others should take offence, for that were <hi>mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21385:31"/>
in the act of receiving hath proved by the event, or experience both of the ages before and at this present. Neither is in this same case obedience passive denyed; and so the Morall duty of obedience is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. Daniel would not desist from ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his windowes toward Ierusalem not withstanding of the Kings edict. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Magistrate cannot make a thing, which of it selfe is scandalous, and hurtfull, not to bee hurtfull, but rather by the strength of his authoritie maketh it more scandalous and hurtfull, then it would be. But none of our Formalists will deale in earnest with the supreme Magistrate, and tell him that he committeth active scandall in laying a stumbling block before the people, and therfore sinneth against the LORD. The Nurse that left a knife vvith the child found dead at her returne, could not be free of blame; but the Nurse that layeth downe the knife, is farre lesse to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.

Seeing therefore there is passive scandall in this kneeling, it is sufficient cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, suppose there vvere no active. Will the flattering Formalist then bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant vvith the Magistrate to remove, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to reinduce this passive scandall, and follovv the example of good Ezekias. For this invention of man, hath beene, is, and is still likely to be abused superstitiously, giving and not granting that of it selfe it vvere not

What is that to the purpose, that the idolatry of the Papist, and of the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list, is not all one in every respect, seeing he misapplieth onely the popish adoration, as I have sayd before. Bellarmine sayth not, that Christ and the image is to be worshiped with one vvorship after one manner: for Christ is to be vvorshiped vvith that high worship called <hi>cultus latriae,</hi> and that proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the image of Christ improperly, and <hi>per accidens;</hi> as he that adoreth the King, adoreth him and his purple robe at one time with one vvorship, but after a divers manner.

            <p>THe ancient Kirk received not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion kneeling.

He sayth, that howbeit in time of prayer they stood on the Lords day, to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their profession of Christs resurrection, yet at the celebration of the supper they might have kneeled. I ask then, was it more needful to testifie their profession of Christs resurrection in time of prayer, then in the act of receiving the elements. It was that day, that they observed vvith such a rite, because Christ rose on that day, and not a part of the day.

He formeth his second Argument flat contrariwise in this manner. In worshipping God with solemne prayer and thankes giving we may lawfully kneele. In the act of receiving the Sacrament wee
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21385:35"/>
worship GOD with solemne prayer and thankes giving. Ergo, in the act of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacrament we may lawfully kneele. We deny the assumption, for the reason al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready alledged, to wit, that it is not a fit time of solemne prayer and thanks giving when men have their outward senses, and members of their bodies outwardly, and the powers of their soule inwardly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise employed. He proveth his assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both here, and in his second Argument after this manner: We should meditate on Christs death; We cannot remember of his death, except we remember also that by his death life commeth unto us; we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member of this, without remembrance of our own misery. The remembrance of our miserie ministreth matter of prayer: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the remembrance of Christs death cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth prayer and thanks giving: praver, that by his death we may have life; thanksgiving, for the benefit of redemption. Ye see the whole force of his reason dependeth upon the duty of remembrance of Christs death. Now Becanus the Iesuit saith <note n="q" place="margin">De com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munione sub utra que spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie cap. 12.</note> That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wayes we may remember of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of redemption, which Christ hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered to us by his death. First, in partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Sacrament of the Enchartist: Next, in reading the Gospell, where his death and passion is described. Thirdly, at the sight of an Image, which representeth him and his Passion. If therfore at the sight of a Crucifixe the Doctor be put in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christs death, should he blot out
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21385:36"/>
so good a thing out of his mind? If not, how then can he remember of Christs death, but he must also remember of his miserie, &amp; the benefite gotten by his death, and so burst forth in that very time, and act (for so doth he reason) into prayer, and that kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. To say, that we are forbidden to performe that duty before a crucifix, is to grant that we ought not, and lawfully may not bow down, whensoever we remember of Christs death: And it we may not doe it before a ciucifix, by his own grant, we say we may not do it, when there is any other, or the like impediment, as there are many. For howbeit we remember of Christs death when we are most busied in our worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, yet we must not burst forth into le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne prayer and thanks-giving. When the historie of the Passion is read, we are put in remembrance of his death; and yet in the act of hearing that Hysto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the sacramentall elements there is like wise impediments, that we may not burst forth in solemne prayer and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and kneele in the very act it selte of receiving. First, the solemne prayer and thanks-giving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He saith, if a man fall down on his knees where the Idoll is, praying against the idolatry committed in that place, no man seeing him to take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: or if he will turne his face from the Idoll he doeh not unlawfully.

There is in the act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving presupposed two actions, one of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall prayer, another of communicating, that is, taking, eating, drinking.

Not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly momentanean petitions, but every godly motion, and elevation of the mind, is called by the divines, by this name of mentall prayer. These require not, nor cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the action with which they are mixed, have geniculation to attend them. For geniculation during for a certaine time must attend upon a permanent action of prayer, and not upon a transient, This transitorie ejaculation may, and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with the taking of the Sacramentall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, eating, and drinking, seeing it may, and doth consist with all other our actions, even taking, eating, drinking, at our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meales. It is the permanet action of mentall prayer which we deny, can consist with the act of receiving, eating, drinking. The understanding cannot in one continued act be employed in a continued operation, about another action during the same time without distraction, and consequently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unreverent behaviour.</p>
            <p>If a man were speaking to a Prince, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21385:38"/>

               </gap>. Our opposites must either confesse, that during that act of receiving, eating, drinking I mean not onely the soule, but one power of the soule, As for example the intellectuall faculty is exercised by a permanent operation in the action of prayer during the time of their geniculation, and also at the same time, the same faculty of the understanding is exercised by a permanent operation in another action, considering the analogy of things sensible with things invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, according as the symbols, and every rite ministreth occasion of meditation, which is the carefull inquisition of the soule. And so confesse that they doe both a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, and unseemly, or els, that one acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on succeedeth another, and that geniculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in respect of both, which is idolatry. Yee suppose the first were supposed to be true and possible, that both the permanent actions must consist together, yet were it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so idolatry. For mentall prayer should be concealed at all times in publick, and ought not to be expressed by signes and gestures of prayer outwardly: farre lesse in the place, where it cannot be done without idolatry, or a shew of idolatry: for otherwise the three children might have bowed before the golden image: and Nehemias, when hee stood before the King.</p>

            <head>Answer to his ten Arguments for kneeling</head>
            <p>I Have no will to spend another sheet of paper on them, therefore I will be short. To the first: All our former arguments proue this kneeling not to be indifferent. Sitting we think not so necessary, as that there could not be a sacrament without it, but to the due ministration of the sacrament we think a table-gesture necessary. As for the gesture of sitting, we think that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the first supper, seconded with the practise following, should be equivalent to a precept, seeing it is so taken in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of policie. Howbeit to sit be not in the Categorie of actions, yet it necessarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth local motion, vvhich is an action. And Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding them in these words, <hi>Doe this,</hi> comprehended not onely deeds, but also words, and the whole forme of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21385:39"/>
as if he hadisayd, celebrate this supper, is yee see we have now celebrated it The rest of the confirmation of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been answered in the defence of our first, second and sixth arguments, and the two former treatises. His second and third arguments are answered in our seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth argument. The sensible manner of giving in the sacrament, is one of the chiefe reasons, wherefore we should not kneele; least we seem to adore the means when vve are in the very use of them. And as for the spirituall manner, we receive these same things in the word one by one, as vve do in the sacrament, howbeit outvvardly the vvord sound generally to the eares of all. We uncover our heads, when the scripture is read not for adoration, but veneration, whereby vve discerne betwixt it, and the voyce of men. To kneele vvhen the vvord is read, is to adore in the time of another action, and confound them, or rather to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the duty of hearing vvith such attention, as we are bound to; or else to adore the word it selfe, which is idolatry, or else to mock God, and his publique worship. Of this we have spoken sufficiently in the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Argument. Yea, further, suppose it were lawfull to kneele at the hearing of the Word read, it is not lawfull to bow down before a creature in the Sacrament. To the fourth Argument: a table-gesture we hold necessary to the due ministration, suppose sitting in speciall be not so necessarie, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not kneeling is as necessarie, as sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21385:40"/>
because kneeling is no table-gesture; the rest is answered in our 1. 2. 6. 7. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. His fifth Argument is answered in our 1. and 2. Arguments. His six<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in our first Argument. The gesture of Christ at preaching and prayer, was variable; and therfore we may v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry. His gesture at the Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>chall suppers, and at this last Supper was one, and in a rituall action requiring some competent gesture. The seventh Argument is answered in our 16. Argument. That the Ancients changed sitting into standing, was done without good reason: Their liberty of changing that, and many other things in the Sacrament, drew on at last the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minabl Masse, and the breadie God. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Church now should take greater liberty, and change from siting or standing to kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they did, it were but to proceed from worse to worse. For there is great difference betwixt change of one Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesture into another, and a change of a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-gesture into a gesture of adoration. The eighth Argument is answered in the 8. 9. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 11. Arguments. To the ninth, Howbeit the Lutheran thinketh that Christ is not to bee adored in the bread, out of the use of the Sacrament; yet in the use and in the act of receiving, they kneele; because of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the reall presence of Christs body. The rest hath bene answered in our 11. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. The tenth doeth not conclude for kneeling, and impugneth sitting as thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> urged necessarily by us. When as we onely ground upon Christ, and his Apostles sitting,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21385:40"/>
and other rites, the necessitie of a Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesture, not to the essence of a Sacrament, but to the due ministration of that action: that the rest of the commanded rites may be performed, which cannot be performed with a gesture of adoration. Sitting wee thinke ought not to be changed, no not into standing, without some waighty considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some urgent occasion, because it was the gesture of Christ, his Apostles, and the Apostolicall Kirkes; it is the ordinary ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of guests at feasts, and resembleth best the familiar accesse of the soule to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Table. As for types of our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in heaven, and sitting at it, we have answered in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the seventh Argument.</p>
            <closer>VVHat I have omitted in the answer to his ten Arguments, is either not worthy of answer, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready answered in the preceeding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as also in the two former treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</closer>
