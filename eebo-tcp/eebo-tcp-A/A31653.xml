            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I had no reason to apprehend
Your <hi>Majesty</hi> would reprove these <hi>Addresses</hi> of
mine, if, in presenting You with those <hi>Antiquities</hi> on
which that excellent <hi>Master</hi> form'd his <hi>Studies,</hi> I
intituled Your <hi>Majesty</hi> to a <hi>VVork</hi> so little inferior

indeed to whom could I more aptly <hi>Inscribe</hi> it? a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse</hi>

whose august attempts have already given so great a

but by it to take occasion of celebrating Your
<hi>Majesties</hi> great <hi>Example,</hi> who use Your <hi>Empire</hi>
and <hi>Authority</hi> so worthily, as <hi>Fortune</hi> seems to
have consulted her <hi>reason</hi> when she poured her <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi>

<hi>that you may Oblige, and that you may Build.</hi>
And certainly, <hi>Sir,</hi> Your <hi>Majesty</hi> has consulted the
noblest way of establishing Your <hi>Greatness,</hi> and of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating
Your <hi>Memory;</hi> since, whilest <hi>Stones</hi> can

those of <hi>Marble.</hi> It would be no <hi>Paradox,</hi> but a

(notwithstanding the difficulties, and the necessitie of an

than all Your <hi>Enemies</hi> have destroy'd in
<pb facs="tcp:53015:4"/>
               <hi>Twenty;</hi> nay then all Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Predecessors
have advanc'd in an <hi>Hundred,</hi> as I could easily make
out, not only by what Your <hi>Majesty</hi> has so magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
design'd and carried on at that Your antient <hi>Honour</hi>
of <hi>Green-VVich,</hi> under the conduct of Your most
industrious and worthy <hi>Surveyor;</hi> but in those Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
<hi>Apartiments,</hi> and other useful Reformations for
<hi>security</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> about Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Palace
at <hi>VVhite-Hall;</hi> the chargeable <hi>covering,</hi> first
<hi>Paving</hi> and <hi>reformation</hi> of <hi>Westminster-Hall;</hi>
care, and preparation for Saint <hi>Paul's,</hi> by the impiety
and iniquity of the late confusions almost <hi>Dilapidated:</hi>
With what Her <hi>Majesty</hi> the <hi>Queen Mother</hi> has
added to her <hi>Palace</hi> at <hi>Sommerset House</hi> in a <hi>Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
becoming her Royal grandeur, and the due venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Subjects for the honour <hi>She</hi>
has done both this Your native <hi>City</hi> and the whole <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
Nor may I here omit (what I so much desire to transmit
to <hi>Posterity</hi>) those noble, and profitable <hi>amaenities</hi>
of Your <hi>Majesties Plantations,</hi> wherein You most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
the <hi>Divine Architect;</hi> because Your <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi>
has proposed in it such a <hi>Pattern</hi> to Your <hi>Subjects,</hi>
as merits their imitation, and profoundest acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in one of the most worthy, and Kingly <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
that <hi>Nature</hi> is capable of. I know not what
they talk of former <hi>Ages,</hi> and of the now contemporary
<hi>Princes</hi> with Your <hi>Majesty;</hi> These things are <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi>
and should I here descend to more Particulars,
which yet were not foreign to the <hi>subject</hi> of this <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi>
I would provoke the whole World to produce
<pb facs="tcp:53015:5"/>
me an <hi>Example</hi> parallel with Your <hi>Majesty,</hi> for
Your exact judgment, and mervailous ability in all that
belongs to the <hi>Naval Architecture,</hi> both as to its
proper <hi>tearms,</hi> and more solid <hi>use,</hi> in which Your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
is <hi>Master</hi> of one of the most noble, and profitable
<hi>Arts</hi> that can be wished in a <hi>Prince,</hi> to whom <hi>God</hi> has
design'd the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> which renders
Your <hi>Majesties Empire Universal;</hi> when by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
Your royal talent, and knowledg that way, You can
bring even the <hi>Antipodes</hi> to meet, and the <hi>Poles</hi> to
kiss each other; for so likewise (not in a <hi>Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
but <hi>natural</hi> sence) Your equal and prudent <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
of his <hi>Nation</hi> has made it good, whilest
Your <hi>Majesty</hi> has so prosperously guided this giddy
<hi>Bark</hi> through such a <hi>Storm,</hi> as no hand save Your
<hi>Majesties</hi> could touch the <hi>Helm,</hi> but at the price of
their temerity. But to return to that of <hi>Architecture</hi>
again (for it is hard not to slide into the <hi>Panegyric,</hi>
when once one begins to speak of Your <hi>Majesty</hi>) I am
witness not only how pertinently You <hi>discourse</hi> of the
<hi>Art,</hi> but how judiciously You <hi>contrive;</hi> and as in all
other Princely and magnificent things Your <hi>Notices</hi>
are extraordinary, so I cannot but augure of their <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi>
and that Your <hi>Majesty</hi> was design'd of <hi>God</hi>
for ablessing to this <hi>Nation</hi> in all that can render it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
if we can have the grace but to discern it, and be
thankful for it.</p>
            <p>This is, <hi>Sir,</hi> the glorious <hi>Idea</hi> which I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
of Your <hi>Serene Majesty,</hi> and which I propose
<pb facs="tcp:53015:5"/>
for as emulous an <hi>Example</hi> as any <hi>Age</hi> has hitherto
produc'd; nor can there anything be added more, but
that permanency which the rest of Your <hi>Virtues</hi> do
promise us: If such were those glorious <hi>Hero's</hi> of old,
who first brought Men out of <hi>VVildernesses</hi> into
Walled and well built <hi>Cities,</hi> that chased <hi>Barbarity,</hi>
introduced <hi>Civility,</hi> gave <hi>Laws</hi> to <hi>Republiques,</hi>
and to whose rare <hi>Examples</hi> and <hi>Industry</hi> we are
accomptable for all that we possess of <hi>useful</hi> in the <hi>Arts,</hi>
and that we enjoy of <hi>benefit</hi> to the <hi>Publique;</hi> how
much cause have We in these <hi>Nations</hi> to rejoyce, that
whilest Your <hi>Majesty</hi> pursues these Laudable <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,</hi>
that <hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Demy-Gods</hi> is not altogether
extinct! And if after the support of <hi>Religion,</hi> and
the establishment of <hi>Laws,</hi> the Perfection of <hi>Sciences</hi>
be the next in order to the Well-being of a State, <hi>This</hi>
of <hi>Architecture</hi> (as one of the most <hi>beneficial,</hi> and
<hi>useful</hi> to <hi>Man-kind</hi>) ows her <hi>renascency</hi> amongst
<hi>Us</hi> to Your <hi>Majesties</hi> encouragements, and to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those <hi>Illustrious</hi> Persons as by their large and
magnificent <hi>Structures</hi> transcribe Your Royal <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi>
in particular, my <hi>Lord</hi> high <hi>Chancellor</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> my <hi>Lord</hi> high <hi>Treasurer,</hi> and my <hi>Lord</hi>
the <hi>Earl</hi> of Saint <hi>Albans,</hi> whose <hi>memories</hi> deserve
this Consecration;</p>
            <p>I have now but <hi>one</hi> thing more to speak, <hi>Sir,</hi> and
that is for the <hi>reputation</hi> of the <hi>Piece</hi> I present to
Your <hi>Serene Majesty:</hi> It is indeed a <hi>Translation;</hi>
but it is withall the <hi>marrow</hi> and very <hi>substance</hi> of no
<pb facs="tcp:53015:6"/>
less than <hi>ten</hi> judicious <hi>Authors,</hi> and of almost <hi>twice</hi>
as many the most noble <hi>Antiquities</hi> now extant upon
the bosom of the <hi>Earth;</hi> 'twere else a difficult Province
to conceive how one should entertain Your <hi>Majesty</hi>
without a <hi>Spirit</hi> and a <hi>Subject</hi> worthy Your applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
There is something yet of <hi>addition</hi> to it, which
is <hi>new,</hi> and of mine <hi>Own,</hi> the defects whereof do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
Your <hi>Majesties</hi> pardon; to say nothing of the
difficulty of rendring a <hi>VVork</hi> of this <hi>nature</hi> intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
to the <hi>vulgar,</hi> and not unworthy the <hi>Stile</hi> of a
<hi>Gentleman;</hi> seeing it is not the talent of every one
who understands a <hi>Language,</hi> unless he also under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the <hi>Art;</hi> But these may seem to defer to my own
<hi>Glory,</hi> which is conspicuous in nothing so much, as
in laying it at Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Feet, and the permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of using that <hi>Sacred Name</hi> to protect</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now some <hi>ten</hi> years since, that to gratifie a
<hi>friend</hi> of mine in the <hi>Country,</hi> I began to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
this <hi>Parallel;</hi> but other things interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it was lay'd aside, and had so continu'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thoughts of reasumption, had not the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my worthy Friend M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Hugh May</hi>
to oblige the <hi>Publick,</hi> and in commiseration of
the few assistances which our <hi>Workmen</hi> have of this nature (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to what are extant, in other Countries) found out an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
and by procuring a most accurate <hi>Edition</hi> of the <hi>Plates,</hi>
encourag'd me to finish what I had begun; and to make a will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Present</hi> of my <hi>labour</hi> and of whatever else I was able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to so generous a designe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53015:7"/>Sir, I am not to instruct <hi>you in</hi> the merits and use of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Piece;</hi> but it is from your approbation and particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
that our <hi>Workmen</hi> ought to esteem it, and believe me too
when I affirme it: That the Ten <hi>Authors</hi> in this <hi>Assembly,</hi> which
compose both so many, and (for not being vulgar) unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Volumes,</hi> will neither afford them so full instructions in the
<hi>Art,</hi> nor so well inable them to judg, and pronounce concerning
the true <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Maximes</hi> of it as this one <hi>little,</hi> but incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable,
<hi>Collection.</hi> You well know, that all the mischiefs and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
in our modern <hi>Structures</hi> proceed chiefly from our busie
and <hi>Gotic</hi> triflings in the <hi>Compositions</hi> of the <hi>Five Orders;</hi> and
that an able <hi>Workman,</hi> who is <hi>Master</hi> of his <hi>Art,</hi> and has a true
relish indeed, carries on all his undertakings with applause and
satisfaction: That there is not in the whole <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Authors</hi>
who have Written on this Subject, a more safe, expedite and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
guide than this <hi>Parallel;</hi> where, from the noblest <hi>Remaines</hi>
of <hi>Antiquity</hi> accurately <hi>Measur'd,</hi> and perspicuously <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,</hi>
the <hi>Rules</hi> are lay'd down; and from a solid, judicious,
and mature comparison of <hi>modern Examples,</hi> their <hi>Errours</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected;
so that were but a little more pains taken by our young
<hi>Architects</hi> and their <hi>Subsidiaries,</hi> about the easier <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometrie,</hi>
the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of <hi>Perspective,</hi> and a ready address of well
<hi>Designing,</hi> we might by the conversation of this <hi>Author</hi> alone,
promise our <hi>Country,</hi> and the <hi>Age</hi> to come, a miraculous improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their <hi>Buildings</hi> in a short time. Nor would this be in
the least, to the augmentation of their <hi>expenses;</hi> since there is
nothing costs dearer, and displeases more, than our undigested
contrivances, and those intolerable defects which we have enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated.
It is from the <hi>asymmetrie</hi> of our <hi>Buildings,</hi> want of
<hi>decorum</hi> and proportion in our <hi>Houses,</hi> that the irregularity of our
<hi>humors</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> may be shrewdly discern'd: But it is from
His <hi>Majesties</hi> great <hi>Genius,</hi> and the choice he has made of such
an <hi>Instrument,</hi> that we may hope to see it all reform'd; it being in
so worthy an imitation of that magnificent <hi>Emperour,</hi> that touch'd
with the like indignation at the <hi>Encroachments</hi> and <hi>Deformities</hi> of
the publick <hi>Edifices</hi> and <hi>Waies,</hi> caused a like <hi>reformation</hi> also;
so as we may now affirme of <hi>London,</hi> as the <hi>Poet</hi> once of <hi>Rome,</hi>

the <hi>Publick;</hi> when that which is begun in

that <hi>more</hi> has been done for the <hi>Ornament</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi> of the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
in <hi>two years</hi> time, that your <hi>Self,</hi> with the <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners</hi> who
undertook the <hi>Inspection,</hi> have acted, then in <hi>five hundred</hi> before:
They were not a foolish or impolitick <hi>People,</hi> who from the very
<hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>humanitie,</hi> destin'd for the ease of their <hi>Subjects,</hi> so
many spacious <hi>Waies,</hi> cool <hi>Fountains,</hi> shady <hi>Walks,</hi> refreshing
<hi>Gardens,</hi> and places of publick <hi>Recreation,</hi> as well as stately <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
and <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> that <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> might be
published with the more <hi>pomp</hi> and <hi>veneration:</hi> And if his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53015:8"/>
with your pains and industry, hath contributed to <hi>something</hi>
of <hi>all</hi> this, it is <hi>that</hi> for which the whole <hi>Nation</hi> becomes obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
as the promoting of such <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>useful</hi> Works (and
especially that of <hi>Building</hi>) a certain Indication of a <hi>prudent
Government,</hi> of a <hi>flourishing</hi> and <hi>happy People:</hi> So that if there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
but <hi>one thing</hi> more to be desir'd in order to the <hi>Consummation</hi>
of its perfect <hi>felicity;</hi> how infinitely were it to be <hi>wished,</hi> that
whilest the <hi>beautie</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> increased in <hi>one</hi> part, the
<hi>Deformity</hi> and apparent <hi>Ruine</hi> of it might cease on the <hi>other:</hi> But
this we are to hope for, when, to bring this <hi>monstrous Body</hi> into
shape, and scatter these ungovernable <hi>enormities,</hi> either the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint</hi>
of Building <hi>irregularly</hi> shall polish the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> or (which

and more particularly, for being indeed the true <hi>Authour</hi> of this <hi>Book;</hi>
since I had never taken it in hand but by his special Order, and to afford
him some little entertainment during his Solitude of <hi>Dangu,</hi> where he was pleased, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

was quickly interrupted by I know not what unlucky <hi>Genius,</hi> and by an intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestive
and precipitous death, which soon extinguisht this glorious light of Vertue. In this
great loss (which was, my dear Brothers, common to us all, since we all had the honour to be
<pb facs="tcp:53015:10"/>
related to him both by our services and birth) I onely had the affliction to be present at the
lugubrous Object, and to behold it with mine eyes. This has often caus'd me seriously to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the vanity and volubility of the fortunes of the <hi>Court,</hi> of which I am now suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
disabus'd: For considering that so rare a Personage, the greatest <hi>Minister,</hi> the most
disinteress'd, most laborious, most successful, of so extraordinary and approv'd a Probity,
so universal in all sorts of excellent qualities, and, in a word, so extraordinary, after a
twenty years service and employment in the greatest Offices of State, that a Subject (I say)
of so great merit should come to conclude his dayes in the <hi>Country</hi> like an <hi>Exile:</hi> I confess,
my dearest Brothers, whil'st I think of this, all things appear so transitory and uncertain in
Greatness, that I find the Retreat of the disgrac'd (provided they are honest men) infinitely
preferrible to their Favour. Could Merit and considerable Services have for ever fixt
and establish'd a man at <hi>Court,</hi> or been a rampart against that envy and jealousie, which
are the immortal enemies and pests of <hi>Vertue,</hi> unhappily reigning in that <hi>Climat:</hi> The
late <hi>Monseigneur de Noyers</hi> was the most worthy to have finish'd his dayes gloriously in his
high Employments; since he alone performed more, in less then ten years space, than all his
<hi>Predecessors</hi> together had done in an hundred; whether we have regard to <hi>Works</hi> which
are necessary for the Conservation and good of the <hi>State,</hi> or consider <hi>Those</hi> onely which gave
splendour and magnificence to the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> It is not my design to repeat them <hi>here</hi> for
<hi>your</hi> instruction, because you know them much better then my self; Onely that I may leave
some <hi>Memorials</hi> to the <hi>Publique,</hi> I shall mention a few of them. It may be affirm'd in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
that he had in his time exalted the noblest <hi>Arts</hi> to the supreamest degree of Perfection
that was ever seen in <hi>France:</hi> as <hi>Architecture</hi> both <hi>Civil,</hi> and <hi>Military; Painting,
Sculpture,</hi> and <hi>Printing</hi> which he then made truely <hi>Royal</hi> when be lodg'd it at the
<hi>Louure;</hi> the very first Productions whereof, were not onely unparallel'd <hi>Master-pieces,</hi>
but, as one may say, <hi>Libraries</hi> compleat; for in two years there were publish'd <hi>threescore</hi>
and <hi>ten</hi> great <hi>Volumes,</hi> in <hi>Greek, Latine, French,</hi> and <hi>Italian;</hi> from one part of which,
one may judge of the rest, <hi>viz.</hi> that general Collection of all the <hi>Councils,</hi> set forth in seven
and thirty <hi>Volumes,</hi> which is certainly the most noble, most useful, and royal Work that
ever saw the light to this hour: This incomparable <hi>Stamp</hi> was accompany'd with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
very rich one, I mean the new <hi>Money,</hi> which <hi>Monseigneur de Noyers</hi> plac'd also in
the same app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtment of the <hi>Louure,</hi> that he might allye together two of the most universal
and most permanent Monuments of <hi>Kings,</hi> spreading themselves over all <hi>Nations,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
for so many successions of Ages. The excessive abuses which were found in the years
1638, and 1639, both in the title and weight of the greatest part of the <hi>Moneys</hi> as well of
this <hi>Kingdom</hi> as of others, which had almost all of them been chang'd or disfigur'd, stood
in need of this excellent man to reform them, whose affection and zeal to the Publique might
produce so extraordinary effects: But as it was impossible to remedy it on the sudden without
putting <hi>Commerce</hi> into very great disorder, <hi>he,</hi> from the ill course of these <hi>Moneys</hi> which
for some time they were forced to connive at, well knew how to derive the greatest advantages
of <hi>State,</hi> and most signal honour to the <hi>King.</hi> And in effect, 'twas none of the least pieces of
<hi>Politiques,</hi> to permit and even authorise this abuse by an <hi>Edict,</hi> which could not else have
been so easily oppos'd; whil'st in the mean time, it invited the People of the neighbouring
<pb facs="tcp:53015:10"/>
               <hi>States</hi> in hopes of gain, to transport into <hi>France</hi> all the light <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> which they
had, and which remain'd there by reason of its being decry'd few months after, bearing now
the <hi>Armes</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> with the <hi>Name</hi> and Effigies of Lovis le Juste, by that noble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
which he order'd to be made of it. Whil'st this strange <hi>Matter</hi> was uniting to ours,
he sought out and discove'd prompt and easie expedients of giving it that excellent <hi>Form</hi>
which it now bears, curing at the same instant, and by the same remedy, both the present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
and that to come: Thus we see, that its just and equal roundness, the <hi>Grenetis</hi>
or graining which is about it, and the <hi>Politure</hi> which is on the flat of every piece, not onely
defends it from the <hi>Clipping,</hi> the <hi>File,</hi> and operation of <hi>Strong-waters,</hi> but even renders its
imitation in a manner impossible to our false <hi>Coyners;</hi> so as one may affirm of this <hi>Money,</hi> that
it is the most artistly contriv'd, and the most commodious, that ever was used in <hi>Commerce.</hi>
He caused to be coyned in less then <hi>four years</hi> above an <hi>hundred</hi> and <hi>twenty Millions,</hi> and
that after fifteen or sixteen years that the <hi>Warr</hi> had lasted, and the <hi>State</hi> seem'd to have been
utterly exhausted by the great and continual expences which were incessantly <hi>made,</hi> laid out
in <hi>fortifying</hi> of places, paying of <hi>Armies,</hi> and the assistance of the <hi>Allies</hi> of the <hi>Crown.</hi> At
the same time was the <hi>Louure</hi> seen to augment, and the <hi>Royal</hi> House of <hi>Fontainebleau,</hi>
which owe not onely a part of their Ornaments to the care of this great <hi>Minister,</hi> but their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
also and absolute restauration; since but for him, they had been at present but
one vast ruine, a very Carkass of building, desolate and uninhabitable: The Castles of S.
<hi>Germains</hi> and <hi>Versailles,</hi> which were then the ordinary residence and delices of the <hi>King,</hi>
carry on them some marks of the same hand; The <hi>first</hi> by the Construction of the noblest <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
and <hi>Manege</hi> which is in <hi>France,</hi> with divers other accommodations necessary for the
lodging of a <hi>Royal Court;</hi> and the other, by a <hi>Terrasse de Gresserie,</hi> which is of the kind
an incomparable work, with a <hi>Circle</hi> of an hundred and twenty yards <hi>diameter:</hi> But
whil'st he thus worthily acquitted himself in the charge of <hi>Superintendent</hi> of the <hi>Royal
Houses</hi> and <hi>Buildings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> (with which the <hi>King</hi> was pleas'd to gratifie him for four
or five years) he employ'd in the mean time his chiefest cares for the safety and enlargement of
the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> dispencing all necessary Orders for the <hi>Armies</hi> both of <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land;</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
and furnishing the <hi>Magazines</hi> and <hi>Garrisons</hi> of <hi>Places,</hi> and a good part of the
<hi>Provinces:</hi> But as things useful and necessary are to be preferr'd before splendour and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificense,
he first began with <hi>Military Architecture</hi> which he caused to march before the
<hi>Civil:</hi> All our <hi>Frontiers</hi> are full of his Works; In <hi>Picardy</hi> the <hi>Port-royal</hi> of <hi>Calais,</hi>
compos'd of two of the greatest <hi>Bastions</hi> of <hi>Massonry,</hi> the most regular and noble that are
in <hi>Europe:</hi> all the <hi>Fortifications</hi> of <hi>Ardres;</hi> most of the <hi>Bastions</hi> of <hi>Peronne,</hi> of S.
<hi>Quentin,</hi> of <hi>Han,</hi> of <hi>La Fere, Dourlans, Amiens,</hi> and of <hi>Montreuil,</hi> especially an <hi>Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work</hi>
also of <hi>Massonry</hi> of extraordinary beauty, and magnitude; not to omit that <hi>half Moon</hi>
of <hi>Abbeville,</hi> where the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> not prevailing with him to have his <hi>Armes</hi> set on it,
in acknowledgment of the favour which they had by this means received (permitting it in no
place built by him, from a particular sentiment of honour to the <hi>King,</hi> and out of a most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
modesty) planted two rows of <hi>Walnut-trees,</hi> that under that Pretext they might call it
by his Name: In <hi>Champagne,</hi> the Fortress of <hi>Mount Olympus,</hi> which serves <hi>Charleville</hi>
for a <hi>Citadel;</hi> several other Works at <hi>Stenay,</hi> at <hi>Mezieres, Mouzon,</hi> and <hi>Rocroy.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53015:11"/>
Then, in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the <hi>Citadel</hi> of <hi>Nancy;</hi> the Places <hi>de Vic, Moyenvic,</hi> and of <hi>Marsal.</hi>
In <hi>Normandy, Havre de Grace;</hi> where (besides the Fortifications of the Place) he excavated
a large <hi>Basin</hi> of Masons work in the <hi>Port,</hi> of near <hi>two hundred yards</hi> long, and above <hi>six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score</hi>
wide, to contain <hi>Vessels</hi> always afloat: Also at <hi>Brouage</hi> in the Isles of <hi>Xainctonge,</hi> which
are two maritime <hi>Keyes</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> In <hi>Italy, Pignerole,</hi> and all the new <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi>
of <hi>Cazal.</hi> Now for works and curiosities of <hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Sculpture</hi> (which are as
'twere the two <hi>Sisters</hi> of the Art I am now going to treat of) it would require a large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to particularize them one after another; besides that, one could not well do it, without
a little reproach to our <hi>Nation,</hi> which (by reflecting on sudden cessation of so many excellent
things) one would almost believe had but one onely person capable of those rare Productions.
It shall suffice then to say in general, that he made the <hi>Louure</hi> the Center of the <hi>Arts</hi> whose
concourse thither in a few years began to render it the most noble and magnificent Structure of
the World. It was for this glorious Design, and for the decoration of other Royal <hi>Houses,</hi>
that the famous <hi>Monsieur le Poussin</hi> had the honour to be sent for by the <hi>King</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the year 1640. It was then that the late <hi>M. de Noyers</hi> dispatch'd us, <hi>You</hi> and my
<hi>Self</hi> (dear Brother) towards his <hi>Holiness</hi> about an important affair, with order at our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to make way for <hi>France</hi> to all the greatest <hi>Vertuosi</hi> of <hi>Italy;</hi> and as he was their
Load-stone, we easily drew a considerable number after him, whereof the Chief was that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
and singular <hi>Painter M. le Poussin,</hi> the glory of the <hi>French</hi> in his Profession, and,
as it were, the Raphael of our Age: To this effect we likewise used great diligence to get
made, and collect together all that the leisure and the opportunity of our Voyage could furnish
us of the most excellent <hi>Antiquities,</hi> as well in <hi>Architecture</hi> as <hi>Sculpture;</hi> the chief pieces
whereof were two huge <hi>Capitals,</hi> the <hi>one</hi> of a <hi>Column,</hi> and the other of an angular <hi>Pilaster</hi>
from within the <hi>Rotunda,</hi> which we chose as the most noble <hi>Corinthian Models</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Antiquity: Two <hi>Medails</hi> of eleven <hi>Palms</hi> diameter, taken from the <hi>Triumphal Arch</hi>
of <hi>Constantine;</hi> threescore and ten <hi>Bas-reliefs</hi> moulded from <hi>Trajans Column,</hi> and several
other of particular <hi>Histories,</hi> some of which were the next year cast in <hi>Brass;</hi> others were
employed in manner of <hi>incrustation</hi> about the <hi>Compartiment</hi> of the arched <hi>Cieling</hi> of the
<hi>Louure</hi> great <hi>Gallery,</hi> in which <hi>M. le Poussin</hi> most ingeniously introduc'd them, and that
with an extraordinary address and consideration, to answer a certain design which was then
requir'd of him, not as the most magnificent, and superb he could have compos'd; but for an
<hi>Ornament</hi> which should be speedily executed, and of moderate cost, with regard to the time
and the impatient humour of our <hi>Nation.</hi> A little while after that, you returned (my dear
Brother) to obtain the <hi>Popes</hi> blessing of the two <hi>Crowns</hi> of <hi>Diamonds,</hi> and the <hi>Golden Babe</hi>
carried by an <hi>Angel,</hi> which their <hi>Majesties</hi> sent you to present our <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Loretto</hi> in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
and as a token of gratitude which they rendred to the <hi>Virgin</hi> for the most happy and
almost miraculous <hi>Birth</hi> of our <hi>Daulphin,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> which now reigns; You continued to have
divers figures and <hi>Bass-relievo's</hi> wrought off, particularly the <hi>Flora</hi> and the <hi>Hercules</hi> in
<hi>Farnese's Palace,</hi> of which there is now one <hi>cast</hi> at <hi>Paris:</hi> Two other <hi>Medails</hi> from the
same <hi>Arch</hi> of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and both the <hi>Colosses</hi> of <hi>Montecavallo</hi> with their <hi>Horses,</hi> the
greatest, and the most celebrated works of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> which <hi>M. de Noyers</hi> designed to have
also cast in Copper, to place them at the principal Entry of the <hi>Louure.</hi> You behold the splendor
<pb facs="tcp:53015:11"/>
which all this great Provision made in <hi>Rome,</hi> and how every body wonder'd that the <hi>French,</hi>
who were till now renown'd onely for their valour and invincible courage in <hi>Warr,</hi> and seem'd
to be affected onely to the <hi>Arts Military,</hi> should shew so much passion for <hi>These</hi> which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
the reputation of being the most glorious, by a Prerogative above others; as if the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere
of <hi>France</hi> had been lately chang'd, and <hi>Mercury</hi> in conjunction with <hi>Mars</hi> began
now to pour down new <hi>Influences</hi> upon her. For my own part, I can testifie how the report of
it spread as far as <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whither <hi>Fame</hi> had born the name of <hi>Monseigneur de
Noyers</hi> with so much glory, that the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of that renowned <hi>City</hi> writ him <hi>Letters</hi> full
of profound admiration, which he address'd to <hi>Monfieur de Villeray,</hi> a <hi>Noble Athenian
Resident</hi> in <hi>France</hi> for the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> delivering them to my Lord at <hi>Dangu</hi> after
his Retreat from the <hi>Court,</hi> and where I have had and kept them a great while, and read
them to several of my Friends. They take notice chiefly, how new and unheard of a thing it
was that there should be found a <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> of our <hi>Nation</hi> so transcendent in all excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
of which some markes he had seen, easily perswaded him to believe all the other marvels
which were reported of him: (these <hi>Exemplars</hi> were the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Royal Press,</hi> and some
Pieces of <hi>Coyn</hi>) His Letter was somewhat prolix, and written in a more polite <hi>Style</hi> then the
vulgar <hi>Greek</hi> now spoken in that Country: It were great pity that a thing so memorable and
signal should be buried in oblivion, and therefore I take notice of it with more circumstances
then many others. But during all these mighty <hi>Projects,</hi> there happen'd a strange revolution
which in less then six Moneths changed the whole face of the <hi>State,</hi> by the death of that superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Minister</hi> the great <hi>Cardinal de Richelieu,</hi> the very <hi>Column</hi> and Ornament of <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;</hi>
and a short space after that, by the <hi>Recess</hi> of <hi>Monseigneur de Noyers;</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon this, by that loss to all <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> himself; so as all these noble beginnings
had none that follow'd them, there remaining not one of those which enter'd afterwards into the
management of the publique Affairs, who had, with their affections, the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and the
<hi>Talents</hi> which were requisite for the continuation of these great Designs. We then presently
beheld the work of the <hi>Louure</hi> abandoned, the finishing of the great <hi>Gallery</hi> to cease; and
generally all the <hi>Fortifications</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> without hopes of seeing the Work reassumed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in hand again of a long time, it being necessary, for such an enterprise, to find assembled in
the same person (as it was seen in that of <hi>M. de Noyers</hi>) virtues and qualities both rare and
extraordinary. Besides, to produce such a one as he was, of an universal <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi>
that loved the <hi>Arts</hi> with judgment, and cultivated them; that would neglect his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Interest, to preserve that of the <hi>State</hi> and of the <hi>Publique,</hi> who, amids an Authority and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Favour, retaining still the modesty of a private man, thinks not of establishing his <hi>house,</hi>
and, against the ordinary course so natural to all men, should refuse to augment and heap up
riches, or seek Titles and Dignities for it, and that never took thought, or laboured, as did he
during an employment of <hi>twenty years</hi> (for the latter six of which he had almost the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
management of <hi>State</hi> affairs) but for the safety, enlargement, and splendour of the
<hi>Kingdom;</hi> For such a <hi>Master-piece</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> I say, there needs the efforts of many <hi>Ages:</hi>
The recompence of so many <hi>Virtues</hi> was very small on <hi>man's</hi> part, but great and inestimable
on <hi>God</hi>'s who crown'd this illustrious <hi>life</hi> with a most happy <hi>death.</hi> I reserve as a treasure
inestimable a certain small Collection of the <hi>sayings</hi> of this <hi>holy Courtier,</hi> our most dear
<pb facs="tcp:53015:12"/>
               <hi>Master,</hi> during the continuance of his <hi>Sickness,</hi> which was assisted by his <hi>Director</hi> the R. P.
<hi>de Sainct Jure</hi> who was with him to the last; and as I have had the sad consolation of being
present at this last act of his life, during which I remember to have heard from his own mouth
all that is contain'd in this recital, I am not able to read them without a great deal of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and indeed without tears. He dyed in his <hi>Castle</hi> of <hi>Dangu</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> the twentyeth of
<hi>October,</hi> at one a clock after noon, in the Year 1645. and in the <hi>six and fiftyeth</hi> of his <hi>Age,</hi>
two years and an half after his Recess from <hi>Court,</hi> his body being transported to the <hi>Church</hi>
of the <hi>Noviciat</hi> belonging to the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> which he had built in honour of St. <hi>Xauierius,</hi> and
destin'd for his <hi>Sepulchre.</hi> This <hi>Church</hi> is look'd upon as the most regular piece of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture</hi>
in <hi>Paris;</hi> and though it be not so exceedingly charg'd with <hi>Ornaments,</hi> as some
others are, yet it appears very noble in the eyes of Intelligent persons; all that is there being
done with an attention and care so extraordinary. But that which in it excells all therest
is a <hi>Picture</hi> of one of the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by St. <hi>Xauier,</hi> which was Painted here at the
same time, with that admirable <hi>Supper</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> (which he caused to be plac'd at the
Altar of the <hi>Chappel-royal</hi> of the <hi>Castle</hi> of St. <hi>Germains,</hi> where all the <hi>figures</hi> exceed
the <hi>natural:</hi>) both of them the Works of our famous Master <hi>le Paussine,</hi> and indeed worthy his
<hi>Pencil,</hi> though the first of them was Painted with extraordinary hast, and during the Winter.</p>
            <p>You see (dear Brothers) a small draught of a part of the <hi>life</hi> of our most precious and most
honour'd defunct <hi>M. de Noyers,</hi> that incomparable <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>France</hi> never to be sufficiently
praysed, never enough regreted, because comparable to the greatest <hi>examples</hi> of <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
I would by all means place him in the <hi>front</hi> of this <hi>Book</hi> of mine, to let the world see that I had
no other object in the finishing of this Work (of which he honour'd me with the charge) then
to render the same service and veneration to his Memory being dead, I could perform to his
<hi>Person</hi> were he yet alive. However, in reassuming it at your request; My first ardour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much aloy'd, what was heretofore a liberal and divertissant Study during the presence of
my late <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> is now become a difficulty and a kind of constraint; since I have
been forc'd to alter, and even retrench divers particularities which were then very essential to
my designe, but would now have been altogether useless and unseasonable. Receive then (my
dear <hi>Brothers</hi>) this <hi>Fragment</hi> of a <hi>Book,</hi> so much at least as remains of it, and if there oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
any thing which may prove yet considerable in such clear and discerning eyes as yours are,
and that my designs seem worthy of any place amongst your other <hi>curiosities,</hi> you owe the
entire obligation of it to our common <hi>Friend Monsieur Errard,</hi> who was pleased to
take a great deal of pains to see it perfected; and has not only perswaded me (as well as you)
to publish it to the world, but has more then this contributed likewise to it, of his own labour
and particular elucubrations.</p>

any man, much less yet to satisfie those <hi>Critical</hi> spirits which the
World so much abounds with: nor, is the Publique at all behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to me; I have no thought of obliging it, an envious, and
evil Judge: In a word, being nothing inclin'd to give them sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
I have easily gratified my labour with the desir'd suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess:
My principal drift was, First, to satisfie my self, nor has it cost me much

to themselves, then they would prove to others: For my part, I do not so use,
to treat my self: We have Enemies enough besides; and whatever I were able to do,
I expect that men should presently say of me, all that Jealousie does commonly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest

rendring our selves their Slaves; since <hi>Art</hi> is an infinite thing, growing every day
to more perfection, and suiting it self to the humor of the several <hi>Ages,</hi> and <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
who judge of it differently, and define what is agreeable, every one according to
his own mode, with a world of such like vain and frivolous reasonings, which yet leave
a deep impression on the minds of certain half-knowing people, whom the practice
of <hi>Arts</hi> has not yet disabus'd; and on simple <hi>Workmen,</hi> whose <hi>Trade</hi> dwells all upon
their fingers ends onely: but we shall not appeal to such <hi>Arbiters</hi> as these. There
are others to be found (though truely very rarely) that having their first studies
well founded on the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Geometry</hi> before they adventur'd to work, to after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
easily, and with assurance arrive to the knowledge of the perfection of the <hi>Art:</hi>
It is to such onely that I address my self, and to whom I willingly communicate the
thoughts which I have had of separating in two branches the <hi>five Orders of Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi>
and forming a <hi>body</hi> a part of the <hi>Three</hi> which are deriv'd to us from the <hi>Greeks;</hi>
to wit, the <hi>Dorique, Ionique,</hi> and the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> which one may with reason call the
very flower and perfection of the <hi>Orders;</hi> since they not onely contain whatsoever
is excellent, but likewise all that is necessary of <hi>Architecture;</hi> there being but three
manners of <hi>Building,</hi> the <hi>Solid,</hi> the <hi>Mean,</hi> and the <hi>Delicate;</hi> all of them accurately
express'd in these three <hi>Orders here,</hi> that have therefore no need of the other two
(<hi>Tuscan,</hi> and <hi>Composita</hi>) which being purely of <hi>Latine</hi> extraction, and but forrainers
in respect to <hi>them,</hi> seem as it were of another <hi>species;</hi> so as being mingl'd, they
do never well together, as those to whom I discourse will soon perceive, when they
shall have once put off a certain blind respect and reverence, which <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and a
long custome (even of the greatest abuses) does commonly imprint in the most part
of men, whose judgements they so pre-occupate, that they find it afterwards a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
matter to undeceive themselves; because they deferr too much, and hardly
dare to examine what has been receiv'd by the vulgar approbation for so long a time:
Let them but consider, that we find no <hi>antique example</hi> where the <hi>Greek Orders</hi> are
employ'd amongst the <hi>Latine,</hi> and that so many ages of ignorance have pass'd over us,
especially in the Arts of <hi>Architecture,</hi> and <hi>Painting,</hi> which the Warr, and frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations
of <hi>Barbarians</hi> had almost extinguish'd in the very Country of their <hi>Originals;</hi>
and which were in a manner new born again but a few years since, when those great
Modern <hi>Masters, Michael Angelo,</hi> and <hi>Raphael,</hi> did as it were raise them from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers
of their antient ruines, under which, these poor <hi>sciences</hi> lay buri'd; and I
shall have fair hopes of their Conversion, and to see them of my opinion. It is the very
least of my thoughts to broach <hi>Novelties;</hi> on the contrary, I would (were it possible)
ascend even to the very sourse of the <hi>Orders</hi> themselves, and derive from thence the
<hi>Images,</hi> and pure <hi>Ideas</hi> of these incomparable <hi>Masters,</hi> who were indeed their first <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors,</hi>
and be instructed from their own mouths; since doubtless the farther men have
wander'd from their <hi>Principles,</hi> transplanting them as it were into a strange soile, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53015:13"/>
more they are become degenerate, and scarce cognoscible to their very <hi>Authours.</hi> For
to say truth, have we at this present any reason in the World to call those <hi>three</hi> by the
name of <hi>Orders,</hi> viz. <hi>Dorique, Ionique,</hi> and <hi>Corinthian,</hi> which we daily behold so disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd,
and ill treated by the <hi>Workmen</hi> of this age? to speak seriously, remains there so
much as a simple <hi>Member,</hi> which has not receiv'd some strange and monstrous alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Nay, things are arriv'd to that pass, that a man shall hardly find an <hi>Architect</hi> who
disdains not to follow the best and most approved <hi>examples</hi> of <hi>Antiquity:</hi> Every man
will now forsooth compose after his own fansie, and conceives, that to imitate <hi>Them,</hi>
were to become an <hi>Apprentise</hi> again; and that to be <hi>Masters</hi> indeed, they must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
produce something of new: Poor men that they are, to believe, that in fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastically
designing some one kind of particular <hi>Cornice,</hi> or like <hi>Member,</hi> they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
the <hi>Inventors</hi> of a new <hi>Order,</hi> as if in that onely consisted, what is call'd <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
as if the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> that same stupendious and incomparable Structure (which
is yet to be seen at <hi>Rome</hi>) were not the <hi>Invention</hi> of the <hi>Architect</hi> who built it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he has vary'd nothing from the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Ordinance of which it is intirely
compos'd? 'Tis not in the <hi>retail</hi> of the <hi>minuter portions,</hi> that the talent of an <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect</hi>
appears; <hi>this</hi> is to be judg'd from the general distribution of the <hi>Whole</hi> Work.
These low and reptile <hi>Souls,</hi> who never arrive to the universal knowledge of the <hi>Art,</hi>
and embrace her in all her dimensions, are constrain'd to stop <hi>there,</hi> for want of
abilities, incessantly crawling after these poor little things; and as their <hi>stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
have no other objects, being already empty, and barren of themselves; their
<hi>Ideas</hi> are so base and miserable, that they produce nothing save <hi>Mascarons,</hi> wretched
<hi>Cartouches,</hi> and the like idle and impertinent <hi>Grotesks,</hi> with which they have even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
all our <hi>Modern Architecture.</hi> As for those other to whom Nature has been
more propitious, and are indu'd with a clearer imagination, they very well perceive
that the true and essential beauty of <hi>Architecture</hi> consists not simply in the minute
separation of every member <hi>apart;</hi> but does rather principally result from
the <hi>Symmetry</hi> and <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the <hi>whole,</hi> which is the union and concourse of them
all together, producing as 'twere a visible harmony and consent, which those eyes
that are clear'd and enlightned by the real Intelligence of <hi>Art,</hi> contemplate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
with excess of delectation. The misery is, that these noble <hi>Genius</hi>'s are in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
small numbers, whereas the vulgar <hi>Workmen</hi> like to <hi>Ants</hi> swarm prodigiously in
all places. Would but our <hi>Grandees</hi> once devest themselves of that prejudice and
disdain which they conceive of the <hi>Arts,</hi> and of those who apply themselves unto
them, and but consider the necessity which they above all others particularly have
of this of <hi>Architecture,</hi> there would be great hopes we should yet see them reflourish,
and be born again as 'twere from <hi>New</hi> to <hi>Antique:</hi> We have had fresh experience of
this under the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Francis</hi> the first, one of the most illustrious <hi>Princes</hi> that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
has recorded, and who from an affection extraordinary which he bore to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
and great <hi>Attempts,</hi> peopl'd his <hi>State</hi> with <hi>Persons</hi> the most rare and accomplish'd
of the age wherein he liv'd, who erected those glorious Monuments to the memory of
this incomparable <hi>Monarch.</hi> It is in my opinion, the onely expedient to re-establish all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53015:14"/>
the <hi>Arts</hi> in that primitive splendor from whence this unworthy neglect has precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
them. The <hi>Greeks</hi> who were the first Inventors of them, and with whom alone
they happily arriv'd to their supreamest perfection, preserv'd them in so high esteem
amongst them, that the <hi>Greatest Personages</hi> of their <hi>Common-wealths</hi> were not asham'd
to make open profession of them, but after a manner nothing <hi>Mercenary;</hi> Their
Works were payd with Honor; and as they propos'd to themselves the glory onely,
and immortality of their <hi>Name</hi> for recompence; so, nor did they make any thing
save what was truely great and magnificent. It would appear incredulous, to relate
onely what we read of this <hi>Nation,</hi> were not the credit of their <hi>Ancestors</hi> altogether
irreproachable, and that there did not remain even to this very day, the most visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
marks of what is reported. There is not in the whole <hi>Vniverse</hi> any thing worthy
of renown, which that divine <hi>Country</hi> did not once produce in its height of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Those great <hi>Captains,</hi> so many <hi>Philosophers</hi> of all sects, <hi>Poets, Orators, Geometrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Painters, Sculptors, Architects,</hi> and, in summ, whatsoever hath stamp'd on it the
Character of <hi>Vertue</hi> proceeded first from thence. Would <hi>wee</hi> now do worthily? Let
us not then forsake the paths which these excellent guides have trac'd before us;
but pursue their footsteps, and generously avow, that the few gallant, things which
have yet reached down to us, are due onely as deriv'd from them. This is the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
that has invited me to assemble and begin this <hi>Collection</hi> by the <hi>Greek Orders,</hi> which
I had first drawn our of <hi>Antiquity</hi> her self, before I so much as examin'd the Writings
of our modern <hi>Authors:</hi> For even the very best-<hi>Books</hi> extant on this <hi>Argument,</hi> are
the <hi>Works</hi> of these old <hi>Masters</hi> which remain to this day, and whose beauty is so
perfect, and so universally receiv'd, as has for almost two thousand years been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
by the whole World. It is to them we should repair to learn to accustom the
eys, and to conform the imagination of Young Men to the <hi>Ideas</hi> of those excellent <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
who being born in the midst of the light and serenity of the fairest <hi>Climat</hi> under
heaven, were so defecate and inlightn'd, that they discern'd those things as 'twere
naturally, which we discover with so much pain, after a long and laborious indagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I know 'tis free for every one to esteem what pleases him best in the mix'd <hi>Arts,</hi>
such as is <hi>this,</hi> whose <hi>Principles</hi> for being soly founded upon <hi>Observation,</hi> and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>Examples,</hi> can challenge no precise <hi>demonstration,</hi> and therefore I shall make
bold to assume the same priviledge which I leave to others, of judging according to
their fansie: For my part, I find so excellent, and particular a beauty in the three
<hi>Greek Orders,</hi> that I am hardly at all concern'd with the other <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>Latine</hi> in
comparison; and the Station which has been assign'd them, sufficiently demonstrates
that there was no place for them, but after all the rest, as if indeed they had been
refus'd by them both: The rusticity and meanness of the <hi>Tuscan</hi> having exil'd it
from the <hi>Cities,</hi> has sent it to the <hi>Country Cottages;</hi> and as unworthy of entering into
<hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Palaces,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tis become the very last, as even destitute of employment: For
the <hi>other,</hi> which would pretend to exceed, and refine upon the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> and what
they name the <hi>Composita,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tis in my apprehension yet more irrational, and truely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
altogether unworthy to be call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d an <hi>Order,</hi> as having been the sourse of all that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53015:14"/>
confusion which has been brought into <hi>Architecture,</hi> since <hi>Workmen</hi> have taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to dispense with <hi>those</hi> which the <hi>Antients</hi> had prescrib'd us, to <hi>Engotish</hi> (as one
may say) after their own capricious humour an infinite many which do all pass under
this appellation. Honest <hi>Vitruvius</hi> in his time well foresaw the ill consequence which
those of the <hi>Profession</hi> would introduce out of their love of <hi>Novelty,</hi> which already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
it seems to incline them to <hi>Libertinism,</hi> and the disdain of the <hi>Rules</hi> of that <hi>Art,</hi>
which ought to remain most sacred and inviolable; so that we must look on this as on
a grey-headed evil which grows worse and worse daily, and is become now almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable:
Notwithstanding, would our Modern <hi>Architects</hi> but yet fix any limits to the
freedom they have taken, and keep themselves within the precincts of the <hi>Roman Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
which is the legitimate and true <hi>Composita,</hi> and which has likewise its <hi>Canons</hi> and
<hi>Rules</hi> as well as the rest, I should find no cause of complaint, since we see instances
of it among the <hi>Vestigia's</hi> and footsteps of the most flourishing ages; as in particular,
that of <hi>Titus Vespasianus;</hi> to whom the <hi>Senate</hi> (after the sack of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) erected a
most magnificent <hi>Arch Triumphal,</hi> compos'd of this <hi>Order:</hi> But then it should never
be employ'd without mature advice, and always alone by it self; for so we find the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors</hi>
of this <hi>Order</hi> us'd it, who well knowing its defects (compar'd with the rest) did
ever forbear to paragon them together: But our <hi>Architects</hi> never entring into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
have faln into an <hi>Errour</hi> which admits of no excuse, by forcing the weaker
to support the stronger. <hi>Scamozzi</hi> is the first that has spoken of this in his <hi>Treatise</hi> of the
five <hi>Orders,</hi> where he assignes to the <hi>Corinthian</hi> the most eminent place: However, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
all contest, I find it safest, never to mix them together at any time, seeing it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
practis'd by the <hi>Antients;</hi> though <hi>Philibert de Lorme,</hi> and <hi>Sebastian Serlio</hi> fansy to
have both of them seen it in the <hi>Coloseum,</hi> and produce likewise a <hi>design</hi> for an <hi>Example</hi>
of their <hi>Composed Order.</hi> But believe it, the observation is very erroneous; for they are
indeed two <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the one over the other, and albeit in the upmost, which forms
the <hi>Corona</hi> of this great <hi>Coloss</hi> of Building, the <hi>Cornic</hi> resembles not the other, as being
very particular; yet are the <hi>Capitals</hi> for all that of the same <hi>Order,</hi> as <hi>Scamozzi</hi> has not
forgotten to observe. This may therefore suffice to advertise us, not lightly to credit
what is deliver'd to us out of <hi>Books,</hi> when we have the opportunity of repairing to the
<hi>fountain,</hi> and to be satisfied of the truth from thence: For having oftentimes dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
examin'd the <hi>designs</hi> of sundry <hi>Masters</hi> on the same subject, and made an exact
calculation of the <hi>measures</hi> which they establish, we seldom find them to agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves, notwithstanding that all of them profess to have accurately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
them. But that we may wound no mans reputation, since every one does the
best he is able, and that we have ever some obligation to those who have so freely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
their Labours to us, I will forbear to exemplifie. Let it suffice to have given
you this <hi>Caution:</hi> Those who shall be so curious as to try, and which will (I assure
them) be no fruitless attempt, shall soon find difficulty enough in the extraordinary
confusion of the different manners of those <hi>Architects,</hi> who instead of working upon the
accompt of the <hi>Models</hi> of <hi>Columns</hi> (which is the most natural <hi>Method,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected to the <hi>Proportions</hi> of <hi>Architecture</hi>) amuse us with <hi>Palms, Feet,</hi> and other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53015:15"/>
                     <hi>Measures</hi> (as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eer <hi>Masons</hi> would do) which so confounds the Imagination, that
'tis extream difficult to dis-intangle ones self out of them, and costs a world of time ere
one comes at last to reduce and apply them to the <hi>Scale</hi> of the <hi>Model,</hi> without which,
all their industry becomes fruitless, and to no purpose. To this it is I have principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeavour'd to apply a timely remedy, reducing all the <hi>designs</hi> of this <hi>Treatise</hi> to
one <hi>Common Model,</hi> namely, to the <hi>Semidiameter</hi> of the <hi>Column</hi> divided into thirty <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,</hi>
that so I may approach the <hi>precise</hi> measures as near as is possible: There are
haply some <hi>Workmen</hi> who upon the suddain will not approve of it, as being not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom'd to so exact an <hi>examen</hi> of the particulars which concern their employment:
<hi>However</hi> (to prevent their censure) I shall referr them to the writings of <hi>Andrea Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladio,</hi>
and <hi>Scamozzi,</hi> two of the greatest <hi>Masters</hi> which we have of the <hi>Profession,</hi> who
in their <hi>Treatises</hi> of the <hi>five Orders</hi> (taking the intire <hi>diameter</hi> for <hi>Model</hi>) have assign'd
it no less then <hi>sixty minutes,</hi> which yet they frequently subdivide into <hi>halfs, thirds,</hi> and
<hi>fourths,</hi> according as they conceive it necessary, and as will appear in this <hi>Collection,</hi>
where I have punctually reported their <hi>designs</hi> parallel'd one with the other, by a
<hi>Method</hi> so perspicuous, that one may instantly perceive both in <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>how much</hi>
they differ amongst themselves: so that by help of this <hi>Comparison,</hi> every man has the
liberty of pleasing his own fansy, and following whether of the <hi>Authors</hi> I propose, as
being all of them within the common approbation. But to the end we may proceed
solidly, and made a judicious <hi>Election,</hi> it will first be requisite to be throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Architecture,</hi> and to have apply'd our studies to <hi>Antiquities,</hi>
which are the very <hi>Maxims</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> of this <hi>Art:</hi> Not as if generally the <hi>Antients</hi> were
to be imitated indifferently; on the Contrary, there are but very few of <hi>them</hi> good,
and an infinite number of them bad, which is <hi>that</hi> has produc'd this confus'd varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
amongst our <hi>Authors,</hi> who treating of the <hi>Orders,</hi> and their <hi>Measures,</hi> have differ'd so
strangely from one another. It is therefore undoubtedly the safest way to have access
to the <hi>Sourses</hi> themselves, and to follow precisely the <hi>Models</hi> and <hi>Proportions</hi> of such
antient <hi>Structures</hi> as have the universal consent, and approbation of those of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi>
Such <hi>Examples</hi> we have at <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Theatre</hi> of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> the Temple of the
<hi>Rotunda,</hi> the three <hi>Columns</hi> near the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and some others of this sort, whose seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Profiles</hi> I shall produce on every of the <hi>Orders,</hi> and after them, those of our more
Modern <hi>Architects,</hi> that so in confronting them to these glorious <hi>Examples</hi> which are
the <hi>Originals</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> they may as to an impartial <hi>Touchstone</hi> have recourse to <hi>them,</hi>
for the tryal and examination of their <hi>Works,</hi> as I my self have done with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
satisfaction in compiling of this present <hi>Treatise,</hi> and which every one may
do as well as I, and at a far less expense by all that time I have spent in opening and
preparing for them the way. This is, <hi>Reader,</hi> what I thought fitting to inform
<hi>Thee</hi> of concerning my <hi>Labour,</hi> to the end thou mayest have a sincere, and judicious
estimation of it.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is sufficiently difficult to determine precisely, what the name of
<hi>Order</hi> may signifie amongst our <hi>Architects,</hi> though it be indeed
very necessary to understand it well. Of all the <hi>Moderns</hi> who
have written upon the five <hi>Orders,</hi> there is none save <hi>Scamozzi,</hi>
who has once remember'd to give us the definition, and it is in
the 1. <hi>cap.</hi> of his <hi>second part, line</hi> 42. where he saith, That it is a
kind of excellency, which infinitely adds to the shape, and beauty
of Buildings, <hi>Sacred,</hi> or <hi>Profane.</hi> But in my opinion, he had even as good have held
his peace, as the rest have done, as to have spoken in such wandring terms, and
with so little solidity. The Father <hi>Vitruvius</hi> in <hi>c. 2. l.</hi> 1. calls it <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and
the term is at present in huge vogue amongst our <hi>Painters:</hi> When they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the elegant composition of a <hi>Piece,</hi> or the distribution of <hi>Figures</hi> in an <hi>History,</hi>
they say, that the <hi>Ordinance</hi> is good: Notwithstanding this is not yet exactly the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Architects;</hi> and <hi>Vitruvius</hi> (in pain to express it to us) adds, That it is <hi>An
apt, and regular disposition of the members of a Work separately; and a comparison of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
proportion to the symmetrie.</hi> Another peradventure more subtile and penetrant
than I am, might find out the mystery of these words, which I confess I comprehend
not; and therefore it is, that I have thus translated them purely from the <hi>Latine</hi>
text word for word, that I may the more naturally propose them to those who shall
desire profit by them: <hi>Daniel Barbaro</hi> (who hath given us two excellent <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries</hi>
upon this <hi>Author</hi>) has been very industrious to clear this passage, which yet
is not without some difficulty; <hi>Philander,</hi> on the same chapter, found out a shorter
way to say nothing at all, and amuses himself upon other matters far more unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary:
so that to get out of this <hi>Labyrinth</hi> we must even take it in pieces, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the things apart, that so it may, as it were, touch our imagination, and distinctly
form its <hi>Idea's</hi> in us, which is the business we are to enquire after: For the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture</hi>
does not consist in <hi>Words;</hi> the <hi>Demonstration</hi> ought to be sensible, and ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
It is very perspicuous to all those of this <hi>Mystery,</hi> that the principal Piece of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53015:16"/>
an <hi>Order</hi> is the <hi>Columne,</hi> and that its <hi>Entablature</hi> being once placed on the <hi>Capital</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
the entire <hi>Composition.</hi> If therefore we will define it exactly, and give the most
express meaning of it, we must, as it were, make a very <hi>Anatomy</hi> of the parts, and
say, that the <hi>Column,</hi> with its <hi>Base,</hi> and <hi>Chapiter,</hi> crown'd with an <hi>Architrave, Frieze,</hi> and
<hi>Cornice,</hi> formes that kind of <hi>Building</hi> which Men call an <hi>Order;</hi> seeing all these indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
parts do generally encounter, and are found through all the <hi>Orders;</hi> the difference
amongst them consisting in no other particular, then in the proportion of those <hi>parts,</hi>
and the figure of their <hi>Capitals.</hi> They have yet indeed some peculiar ornaments, as
<hi>Triglyphs,</hi> the <hi>Dorique; Dentelli,</hi> or Teeth, the <hi>Ionique;</hi> and the <hi>Corinthian</hi> her <hi>Modilions;</hi>
but they are none of them of so general and indispensible obligation, but that even
the most regular of the <hi>Antients</hi> themselves, have upon some considerations frequently
dispensed with them. For <hi>Ornaments</hi> are but accessories in the <hi>Orders,</hi> and may be
diversly introduced as occasion requires; principally in that of the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> where
<hi>Artists</hi> being to represent an effeminate and virginal beauty (as we may easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
from what <hi>Vitruvius</hi> has recounted to us of <hi>Callimacus.</hi> 1. cap. 4. book) ought
to omit nothing which may contribute to the perfection and embellishment of the
Work: and the Antients have prescrib'd us so many Examples of this <hi>Order,</hi> in which
they have been so profuse and luxurious in Ornaments, that one would swear, they had
drawn their imagination quite dry to crown this Master-piece of <hi>Architecture.</hi> But
it is not with the other <hi>Orders</hi> after this sort, where there is a more masculine beauty
requir'd; especially in the <hi>Dorique,</hi> the solidity whereof is totally repugnant to
the delicateness of these Ornaments; since it succeeds so much better in the the plain
and simple regularity of its proportions. <hi>Garlands</hi> and <hi>Posies</hi> suit not with <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules;</hi>
He is best adorn'd with a rough-hewn and massie Club: For there are Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of several kinds, and those oftentimes so unlike, as what is agreeable to the <hi>one,</hi> is
quite contrary to the <hi>other.</hi> As for the <hi>Ionique Order,</hi> 'tis as it were in the middle of
the two extreams, holding in a manner the Balance 'twixt the <hi>Dorique</hi> solidity, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileness
of the <hi>Corinthian;</hi> for which reason we find it diversly employ'd in ancient
Buildings, simple and plain according to the genius of the <hi>Architect,</hi> or quality of the
Structure. So as <hi>these three Orders</hi> may very well furnish all the <hi>Manners</hi> of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without being at all oblig'd to have recourse to the <hi>Tuscan Order,</hi> or that which is
<hi>Compos'd,</hi> both which I have therefore expresly reserv'd for the conclusion of this
<hi>Treatise,</hi> and separated from the rest, as in truth but Supernumeraries, and almost inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.
For the excellency and perfection of an <hi>Art,</hi> consists not in the multiplicity
of her <hi>principles;</hi> but contrarily, the more simple they are, and few in number, the
more worthy are they of our admiration: This we see manifested in those of <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,</hi>
which is in truth the very foundation, and universal magazine of all those <hi>Arts,</hi>
from whence <hi>This</hi> has been extracted, and without whose aid it were impossible it
should subsist. Well therefore may we conclude, That the <hi>Orders</hi> being no other
then the very <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Architecture,</hi> and these <hi>Three first</hi> which we have deduc'd
from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> comprehending all the <hi>Species</hi> of Building; it were but a superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thing we should pretend to augment their number.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Dorique Order.</head>
                     <p>IT is no small advantage for the <hi>Dorique Order,</hi> to demonstrate that it has been
the very first regular <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Architecture;</hi> and that, as the first-born and heir
of this <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Arts,</hi> it has had the honour also to have been the first builder both
of <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Palaces.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Antiquity of its Original (according to all those who have written thereof)
is, in a manner, immemorial; notwithstanding <hi>Vitruvius</hi> referrs him (and that with
sufficient appearance) to a Prince of <hi>Achaia,</hi> named <hi>Dorus;</hi> who being Sovereign
of <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> built in the famous City of <hi>Argos</hi> a magnificent <hi>Temple</hi> to the Goddess
<hi>Iuno,</hi> which was the very first <hi>model</hi> of this <hi>Order:</hi> In imitation whereof, the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
people erected divers others; amongst which, the most renown'd was that which
the Inhabitants of the City <hi>Olympia</hi> dedicated to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whom they furnam'd <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picus.</hi>
The Iland of <hi>Delos</hi> built another very famous one to the God <hi>Apollo,</hi> in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of his Birth in that place, and of which there is to this day some <hi>Vestigia</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining.
And in this it was that the first <hi>Triglyphs</hi> were made in the form which we
now behold them, representing the Figure of an antique <hi>Lyre,</hi> of which Instrument
this <hi>God</hi> had been the Inventor. In <hi>Elis</hi> a City of the same Countrey there were
divers memorable Fabricks consisting all of this <hi>Order,</hi> whereof the principal were
a large <hi>Peristyle</hi> or Porch, serving for a publick place, having about it a triple range
of <hi>Portico</hi>'s built on Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mns, and three magnificent <hi>Temples,</hi> as <hi>Pausanias</hi> in his fifth
Book makes mention; the one consecrated to the Goddess <hi>Iuno,</hi> environ'd with huge
Marble Pillars; the other to <hi>Dyndima,</hi> the mother of the Gods; and a third to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi>
which bore the name of their City: And this last was without doubt a most
incomparable Master-piece, having been built by the famous <hi>Scopas</hi> competitor
with <hi>Praxiteles</hi> in the Structure of that stupendious <hi>Mausoleum</hi> which the Queen <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temisia</hi>
erected in memory of her Husband. In his <hi>Preface</hi> to the seventh Book, <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
makes mention of others, amongst which he celebrates those of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serpine</hi>
in the City of <hi>Elusina,</hi> as a work of prodigious Grandure. But it would be
but unprofitable for us to make any further disquisition concerning these Edifices,
since those who have treated of them, have left us no particular remarks touching
their form, from whence we might derive any thing of advantage for our Imitation.
They talk much also of the names of many great <hi>Architects</hi> of this age, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
writ the <hi>Rules</hi> of their professions, amongst whom, one named <hi>Silenus</hi> had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
treated of the <hi>Dorique</hi> proportion; and a certain <hi>Theodorus</hi> made the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a <hi>Temple</hi> of the same <hi>Order,</hi> erected to the Goddess <hi>Iuno</hi> by the Inhabitants of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53015:17"/>
the Ile of <hi>Samos,</hi> with sundry other mention'd in the same place, whose Books and
Works are not now to be found; so that after the loss of so many incomparable <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi>
who were the very source and fountain of the <hi>Art</hi> whence we might at present
extract the purity of its <hi>Original,</hi> we must of necessity content our selves with the
Observations and Conjectures which the <hi>Moderns</hi> have made upon certain tracks and
footsteps of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> which in this conjuncture serve us instead of <hi>Books,</hi> and wherein
all those <hi>Masters</hi> which I have here assembled, as to an <hi>Oecumenical</hi> and general <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
of <hi>Architecture</hi> have finish'd and perform'd their Studies.</p>
                     <p>But for as much as naturally every man abounds in his own sense, and dresses up
a beauty after his particular mode, I conceiv'd it expedient from the Designs which
they have left us for <hi>Rules,</hi> to have continual recourse to the <hi>Antients,</hi> as to the best
and most invariable <hi>Compass</hi> which we can possibly steer by; amongst whom we shall
find sufficient variety, reasonably to satisfie the <hi>Gust</hi> of such as are desirous of choice.
And for this purpose, I shall upon every <hi>Order</hi> exhibit two or three <hi>Examples</hi> drawn
from the <hi>Originals</hi> themselves, and very accurately measur'd by the account of the
<hi>Modole</hi> of the <hi>Column,</hi> with the very <hi>Division</hi> which I have observ'd in the <hi>Designs</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Masters;</hi> that so all concurring in one Uniformity, and under the same <hi>Scale,</hi>
the Comparison and Examen may become the more easie and intelligible: For the
multiplying of <hi>Operations</hi> is ever disadvantageous by reason of the Confusion which
it ordinarily produces in the minds of those who work, and that it also wastes more
time; both which inconveniencies are of very great importance. And when all the
fruit of my Travel in this Assembly of <hi>Authors</hi> should be of no further profit to the
Studious in this <hi>Art,</hi> then to have thus adjusted them together, I conceive they ought
to be very well satisfied.</p>
                     <p>But let us return to the <hi>Dorique Order,</hi> and consider its <hi>form, proprieties,</hi> and <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
from the others in gross, before we enter into the Parcels of its Proportions,
since general rules are ever to precede particular. Having then propos'd for a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
that this <hi>Order</hi> represents <hi>Solidity</hi> to us, as its <hi>Specifique</hi> and principal quality,
we ought not to employ it but in great massie Buildings and Edifices of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
as for <hi>Ports</hi> of <hi>Citadels,</hi> and <hi>Fortresses</hi> of <hi>Towns,</hi> the outside of <hi>Churches</hi> or <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
places,</hi> and the like, where the delicateness of the Ornament is neither conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
nor profitable; for as much as the heroick and gigantine manner of this <hi>Order</hi>
does excellently well in those places, discovering a certain <hi>masculine</hi> and natural beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which is properly that the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>la grand Maniere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon this subject I am observing a thing which in my opinion is very curious
touching the beginning of the difference of <hi>Manners;</hi> whence it proceeds, that in
the same quantity of <hi>Superficies,</hi> the one seems great, and magnificent, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appears poor and but trifling. The reason of which is very prety, and not
ordinary. I say then, that to introduce into <hi>Architecture</hi> this <hi>grandure</hi> of <hi>Manner</hi> of
which we speak, we ought so to proceed, that the division of the principal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Orders</hi> consist but of few parts, that they be all <hi>great</hi> and of a bold and
ample <hi>Relievo</hi> and Swelling; that the <hi>Eye</hi> beholding nothing which is little and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53015:17"/>
mean, the <hi>Imagination</hi> may be the more vigorously touch'd and concern'd with it. For
Example: In a <hi>Cornice,</hi> if the <hi>Gola,</hi> or <hi>Cy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>atium</hi> of the <hi>Corona;</hi> the <hi>Coping,</hi> the <hi>Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,</hi>
or <hi>Dentelli</hi> make a noble shew by their graceful projectures; and that we see
none of that ordinary Confusion which is the result of those little cavities, quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds
of the <hi>Astragal,</hi> and I know not how many other intermingl'd particulars
which produce no effect in great and massie Works, and which very unprofitably
take up place to the prejudice of the principal Members; it is most certain, that
<hi>this</hi> manner will appear solemn and great, and <hi>that,</hi> on the contrary, become pitiful
and mean by reason of the multitude of these smaller ornaments which divide and
scatter the angles of the sight into so many beams, and so press'd together, that the
<hi>whole</hi> appears but a Confusion. And though one would judge upon the sudden,
that the multiplicity of the parts should contribute something to the appearance of
the grandure and state; yet notwithstanding it happens quite otherwise, as we may
easily perceive in examining it by <hi>Examples,</hi> and in the <hi>Designs</hi> of the <hi>Masters</hi> which
I have here collected together, where in the same instant a man may discern both
the quality of their <hi>Genius's,</hi> and the variety of their judgments: For some of them
esteem <hi>that</hi> to be delicate and rich, which others term mean, and confused; and <hi>that</hi>
which seems to us of the <hi>Grand maniere,</hi> in their eyes appears to be but gross and
heavy; and indeed it would so prove if one should exceed the terms of proportion,
and did incline too much to either extreme: But be this only spoken in Passage; We
proceed now to our <hi>Orders</hi> in general.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Colomnes</hi> of the <hi>Dorique Order</hi> have this of remarkable amongst the rest, that
in the fairest Works of <hi>Antiquity</hi> in which they have been employ'd, we find them
without <hi>Bases;</hi> as in the <hi>Theater</hi> of <hi>Marcellus</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> in that at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and in a
very magnificent <hi>Triumphal Arch</hi> at <hi>Verona;</hi> and <hi>Vitruvius</hi> having treated of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Order</hi> more exactly then of any other, speaks not so much as a word of its <hi>Basis,</hi>
albeit he hath sufficiently describ'd the measures of the <hi>Ionique,</hi> and of the <hi>Attique</hi> for
the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> without having so much as omitted that of the <hi>Tuscane;</hi> though there
is not one of our modern <hi>Architects</hi> but make some cavil at it, forming <hi>one</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
after their own invention.</p>
                     <p>For my part, I should make a great scruple to condemn these old <hi>Masters</hi> who
did all with so much circumspection. One had much better endeavour to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Intention, who did certainly proceed with great judgment; then to add
any thing preposterously to this <hi>Order,</hi> and which may prove repugnant to its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                     <p>Let us take therefore the thing from its original, and consider upon what account
they added <hi>Bases</hi> to the foot of <hi>Colomns,</hi> and what <hi>there</hi> they represent, that thence
we may infer whether they are likewise as proper to these we speak of here, as they
be to the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vitruvius</hi> tells it us in the first Chapter of his fourth Book, and had not it seems
so much as once spoken of it, but upon occasion of the <hi>Ionique,</hi> which he affirms
to have been compos'd after the <hi>module</hi> of a feminine beauty, to which he suits all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53015:18"/>
the rest of the parts; as the <hi>Voluta's</hi> of the <hi>Capital</hi> to the mode of the <hi>head-tire</hi> and
tresses of Womens hair. The <hi>Vivo,</hi> or shaft of the <hi>Colomn,</hi> to their airy and delicate
shape: the <hi>flutings</hi> and Channelling to the plaits of their Robes: and the <hi>Base</hi> to the
buskin'd Ornament of their legs and feet.</p>
                     <p>In the same place he compare our <hi>Dorique</hi> to a robust and strong Man, such as
an <hi>Hercules</hi> might be, whom we never represent but on his bare feet: so as from
hence we may reasonably judge, that to the <hi>Dorique Order</hi> also <hi>Bases</hi> are no wayes
proper.</p>
                     <p>But the custom which has licentiously been introduc'd amongst so many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as we find among the <hi>Antiques,</hi> has so strangely debauch'd and prevented the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
by I know not what false appearance of Beauty; that it now transports it
quite besides Reason. Nevertheless such as are clear-fighted, being advertis'd of this
abuse, will soon rectifie, and undeceive themselves: and, as what seems most <hi>likely</hi> is
then detected to be erroneous when 'tis diligently examin'd; so also the appearances
of Beauty, when they are against Reason, become in fine but the more extravagant.</p>
                     <p>This Observatio being establish'd upon those great Examples which I have cited,
and Reason serving for its guide, let it pass for <hi>demonstration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But we will now consider the rest of the <hi>Order.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His <hi>Entablature</hi> is more massie, and tall, then any of the following Orders; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the strength of the <hi>Colomn</hi> for being greater, prepares him also for the greater
burthen. It has ordinarily one fourth part of the <hi>Colomn,</hi> whereas in the other he
has very often but a fifth, and sometimes less. The <hi>Cornice</hi> would not be deck'd with
and <hi>Foliage,</hi> or like trimming; but in case you allow him <hi>Modilions,</hi> they should be
square, and very plain. The <hi>Freeze</hi> has a regular Ornament, which are the <hi>Triglyphs,</hi>
the <hi>Compartiment</hi> whereof obliges one to a very great inconvenience, and which was
heretofore so cumbersome, that even the skilfullest <hi>Masters</hi> had much ado to disengage
themselves. But <hi>Vitruvius</hi> has found a very sufficient Expedient, as may be seen in
his fourth book Cap. 3. In the interim let it suffice, to affirm here, that all the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
consists in so contriving the matter, that the <hi>Triglyphs</hi> be precisely plac'd
over the middle of the <hi>Colomn</hi> which it encounters; and that the <hi>Metops</hi> (that is to
say) the spaces twixt the <hi>Triglyphs,</hi> be perfectly square; for that is so effential in this
<hi>Order,</hi> that one should never dispence with it. That which renders the execution
difficult proceeds from the distribution of the <hi>Intercolumniations,</hi> which have also their
distances regular, and determin'd, which does not justly quadrate and suit with those
of the <hi>Triglyphs.</hi> See the second Chapter of the third Book of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> Commented
by the Reverend <hi>Daniel Barbaro,</hi> where all this is rarely well explain'd, both by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and figure.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Architrave</hi> hath also its Ornament particular, which consists in certain pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>drops</hi> under the <hi>Triglyphs</hi> that seem after a sort, to be fastned to it, as if they were
all of a piece; for that one never sees the one, without the other.</p>
                     <p>The entire body of the <hi>Architrave</hi> ought to appear solid and very substantial; for
which effect I would not have it exceed one full <hi>face,</hi> lest parting it in two, it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53015:18"/>
appear feeble and weak, according to the principle which we have newly establish'd
upon the diversity of <hi>Manners;</hi> Nevertheless this is but of small consequence <hi>here,</hi>
provided one be careful not to break it in three <hi>faces</hi> as in the other <hi>Orders</hi> they do;
in which case, the fault would be remarkable.</p>
                     <p>Behold then in gross as 'twere a rough draught of the <hi>Dorique Order,</hi> upon which
one may with ease find out all the several parts of its members in particular, with
their respective measures, which is by this expedient found alwayes within the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
terms of its extent.</p>
                     <p>I shall touch some of the Principal only, that I may facilitate the way; referring
you for the rest, to the <hi>Designs,</hi> where every thing is so clear, and punctual, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once conceiv'd the <hi>Model</hi> (which I make use of throughout) to be the <hi>Semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter</hi>
of the <hi>Colomn,</hi> divided into thirty <hi>Minutes;</hi> and, that I continually begin to measure
the <hi>projectures</hi> of every <hi>Profile</hi> from the <hi>Central</hi> line of the <hi>Colomn,</hi> to have (in the
mean time) with the proportion of the Members, the right position, and just level of
the <hi>Pillar,</hi> all the rest admits not of the least imaginable difficulty: for presently
you'l find, that thirty <hi>minutes</hi> making the <hi>semidiameter,</hi> sixty must compose the whole
<hi>diameter,</hi> and forty five the three quarter; forty, two thirds; twenty, one third; fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
a quarter, and so of the rest, as I have expresly observ'd it, that I may by the same
means make you comprehend, how I have reduc'd all the Measures of my <hi>designs</hi> by
<hi>minutes,</hi> without making use of the terms of <hi>Module, Diameter, Thirds, Quarters,</hi> or the
like proportions, to avoid perplexity, and cumbring the <hi>designs</hi> with so much wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
and indeed, for that they are not precise enough, and would have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
me to superadd the <hi>minutes,</hi> and to repeat one <hi>Module</hi> and three <hi>Minutes,</hi> two
thirds of a <hi>module</hi> and four <hi>minutes,</hi> a quarter of a <hi>minute,</hi> half a <hi>module</hi> and two <hi>minutes,</hi>
with a number of such like fractions, which would have created much unprofitable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and bred infinite confusion.</p>
                     <p>This establish'd, let us proceed to the application, and take our <hi>Dorique Order</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in pieces. But lest the Variety which we frequently encounter amongst the
designs of the modern Authors that I have here collected, should hinder us from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
upon something fix'd, and determin'd, I will only pursue that <hi>Antient</hi> Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
taken out of the <hi>Theater</hi> of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> as being the most regular of all the rest, by
the universal suffrage of those of the Profession; and so conformable to what <hi>Vitruvius</hi>
has written concerning the general proportions of this <hi>Order,</hi> that some are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
he was himself the <hi>Architect</hi> of this magnificent work. But I must confess, I
am not of their faith, because of the <hi>Dentelli</hi> which are cut in the <hi>Cornice;</hi> for <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
in the <hi>second Chapter of his first Book,</hi> plainly interdicts them the <hi>Dorique Order,</hi> as
being naturally affected to the <hi>Ionique:</hi> but this <hi>Question</hi> concerns not our present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
I find then that the whole <hi>shaft</hi> of the <hi>Colomn</hi> has in length <hi>seven times</hi> its <hi>diameter;</hi>
which on the foot of the division of the half <hi>diameter</hi> in <hi>thirty minutes</hi> (for in all this
Treatise I ever take the <hi>semidiameter</hi> of the <hi>Colomn</hi> for the <hi>module</hi> of the <hi>Orders</hi>) make
<hi>four hundred</hi> and <hi>twenty minutes,</hi> which amounts to fourteen <hi>modules.</hi> The height of the
<hi>Chapter</hi> contains <hi>thirty minutes,</hi> which make <hi>one module;</hi> as does likewise the <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trave;</hi>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53015:19"/>
The <hi>Freeze</hi> with its <hi>Fillet</hi> (which is that flat, and thin <hi>band</hi> or list which
separates it from the <hi>Cornice</hi>) has <hi>one module</hi> and a <hi>quarter,</hi> which are <hi>thirty seven mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes</hi>
and <hi>an half;</hi> so that all these <hi>modules</hi> computed together, and the number of
their <hi>minutes</hi> reduc'd to a <hi>total sum,</hi> the altitude of the entire <hi>Order</hi> amounts to <hi>eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
modules</hi> and <hi>three quarters,</hi> which make up <hi>five hundred sixty two minutes</hi> and an
<hi>half;</hi> and the <hi>Entablature</hi> (which is the <hi>Architrave, Freeze,</hi> and <hi>Cornice</hi>) being to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
one quarter part of the <hi>Colomn</hi> (which is its regular proportion) comprehends just
an <hi>hundred twelve minutes</hi> and <hi>an half,</hi> which are <hi>three modules</hi> and <hi>three quarters;</hi> and
which I expresly repeat, that I may yet add, that though all the <hi>Examples</hi> of this <hi>Order</hi>
(which may be as well found amongst the <hi>Antients,</hi> as the <hi>Modern</hi>) have not always
the <hi>Entablature</hi> comprehended within the same Termes of <hi>Modules</hi> that <hi>this</hi> has <hi>here,</hi>
they may yet notwithstanding be according to rule in the general proportion; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that the <hi>Entablature</hi> contain a quarter of the <hi>Colomn;</hi> which is neither limited
to <hi>fourteen Modules,</hi> nor yet to <hi>fifteen,</hi> but may sometimes advance even to <hi>sixteen</hi> and
more as occasion presents it self: So that a <hi>Colomn</hi> of <hi>seven Modules</hi> shall have a
higher <hi>Entablature</hi> then one of <hi>fourteen.</hi> But then it is necessary, that all this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of one <hi>Entablature</hi> to the other happen only in the <hi>Cornice,</hi> in regard that the
<hi>Freeze,</hi> and the <hi>Architrave</hi> have alwayes their precise and determinate measures:
The one has a <hi>Module;</hi> the other a <hi>Module</hi> and an <hi>half,</hi> without any respect to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
height of the <hi>Colomns.</hi> Now the <hi>Cornice</hi> being to supply what is deficient to
arrive to the fourth part of the <hi>Colomn,</hi> 'tis evident that its particular proportion
must depend on that of the <hi>Colomn;</hi> and that the <hi>Cornice</hi> of one <hi>Profile,</hi> can never
serve for another, though it be of the same <hi>Order,</hi> unless the height of the <hi>Colomns</hi> be
likewise equal in them both, which thing ought very diligently to be consider'd:
that from this observation a man may arrive to a good, and judicious examen of all
those <hi>Profiles</hi> which the <hi>Modern</hi> have given us of this <hi>Order;</hi> and understand such as
are worthy the being follow'd; For the general proportion being once defectuous,
'tis in vain to search for it in the <hi>retail,</hi> or <hi>minuter</hi> parts; because <hi>that</hi> is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
relative, and that the one, cannot possibly subsist without the other.</p>
                     <p>But to the end we may render what we have discuss'd easie to the Reader, who
happly, for want of practise may find himself at a loss, I am going to deliver him
a <hi>Method</hi> extraordinarily short and expedite, by means whereof, he may instantly
make it without the least disorder or confusion,</p>
                     <p>He must take the whole height of the <hi>Entablature</hi> of the <hi>Design</hi> which he would
examine, and thereof make a <hi>multiplication</hi> conformable to the proportion which it
ought to bear with its <hi>Colomn,</hi> having still a regard to the <hi>Order</hi> which it represents.
Put case, <hi>for example,</hi> one <hi>quarter,</hi> as in this of the <hi>Dorique;</hi> he must multiply the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablature</hi>
by <hi>four;</hi> if it be a <hi>fifth</hi> (as we shall see in some of the following Examples
of the <hi>Corinthian</hi>) he must multiply it by five; and so of the rest: For the total
of this multiplication ought to give us precisely the height of the <hi>Colomn;</hi> and
wherever this does not quadrat, certain it is, the <hi>Profile</hi> is irregular.</p>

the Theater of Marcellus.</head>
                     <p>I Admire that of all our modern <hi>Architects,</hi> the greatest part whereof have seen, and
spoken of <hi>this</hi> Examples, as of the most excellent <hi>Dorique</hi> model which has been left
us by the Antients; there is not so much as one of them who has followed, or perhaps
well observed in the Original the just <hi>compartiment</hi> of the members of the <hi>Capital,</hi> nor
the height of the <hi>Freeze,</hi> the which I find <hi>here</hi> visibly less then that which they allow
to their Designes; though some of them (particularly <hi>Vignola</hi>) have proposed the
very same <hi>Profile</hi> for the Rule of the <hi>Order;</hi> but with so much alteration in its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
that there is not one of them remains entire: A man shall easily find it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
them together; all the designs of this <hi>Assembly</hi> being therefore fitted to the same
<hi>Scale.</hi> As for the <hi>Capital,</hi> they do all without exception affect the dividing of it in three
parts, as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> will have it in his <hi>fourth Book, Chap. III.</hi> giving one to the <hi>Hypotra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelion,</hi>
or neck of the Pillar; the other to the <hi>Echinus</hi> bracelets, or small mouldings;
and the third to the <hi>Abacus</hi> or <hi>plinth</hi> of the <hi>Capital;</hi> whereas they ought to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
that the <hi>Text</hi> of this <hi>Authour,</hi> besides that it is oftentimes suspicious, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>then</hi> when he is not conformable to the practice of the <hi>Antient Masters</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries,
it is by no means just, he that should presume thus to carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such Examples as this here, which is without all reproach and exception. It had
been more reasonable that they who propose it for their model, had at least been so
discreet as to have added nothing, but left him in his original proportion. As for those
others who have formed designs after their own fancies, they are no more to be blamed
for having followed the opinion of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> and obliged themselves to the terms
which he has prescribed, though they might haply have well dispensed with it, and with
more reason have imitated the <hi>Antients</hi> where this irregularity is not to be found. The
<hi>Crown</hi> of the <hi>Cornice</hi> is also sufficiently observable for its extraordinary projecture, and
which is after a sort augmented by the sloops which the <hi>Architect</hi> has given to the <hi>drops</hi>
which compose the ornament of the nether face, and which fall on the <hi>Triglyphs.</hi> Now
albeit this piece of <hi>Opticks</hi> be admirable in this huge <hi>Coloss</hi> of Building, yet is it by no
means to be indifferently used every where, and upon all occasions, for in places
much inclosed, where there is not ample space and freedom for the Eye, as the inside
of <hi>Churches,</hi> &amp;c. it would produce but an ill effect. Wherefore I have thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to propose <hi>here</hi> divers <hi>antient Examples</hi> upon each <hi>Order,</hi> that I may thereby
give opportunity to those of the <hi>Profession</hi> to make use of them judiciously; regard
being duly had to the Place, and the Occasion.

                     <head type="sub">Another Profile taken from the fragments of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesian
Bathes at Rome.</head>
                     <p>THIS <hi>Profile</hi> was one of the most excellent pieces of <hi>Architecture</hi> in the <hi>Baths</hi> of
<hi>Dioclesian</hi> as far at least as I am able to conjecture from a good number of <hi>draughts</hi>
which lye yet by me, all of them design'd by the same hand very neatly, and measur'd
with extraordinary study; although some of them methinks appear to be sufficiently
licentious: But this <hi>Profile</hi> is of so noble a composition, and so regular, that it's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
inferiour to that which went before: And though the specifique proprieties of
this <hi>Order</hi> are to be single and solid; yet are the Ornaments <hi>here</hi> so very judiciously
applyed upon every of the Members, that they conserve the one without the least
violation to the other.</p>
                     <p>It may serve upon some occasions where that of the <hi>Theater</hi> of <hi>Marcellus</hi> would
not be so proper, in as much as the projecture of its <hi>Cornice</hi> is a great deal less; add
to this, the curiosity of its <hi>mouldings</hi> which allure the eye to consider them at a nearer
distance.</p>
                     <p>The general Proportion of it is not absolutely conformable to that of our first <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;</hi>
and the difference makes me judge, that the <hi>Column</hi> belonging to it contained
eight <hi>diameters,</hi> that is to say, sixteen <hi>Modules;</hi> for so the <hi>Entablature</hi> (which is of
four <hi>Modules</hi> high) comes to make up a fourth part of the Pillar.</p>
                     <p>That which is considerable in this <hi>Profile,</hi> as universally observed through all the
<hi>Moderns</hi> for the height of the <hi>Freeze,</hi> is, that in this partition of the three members of
the <hi>Entablature,</hi> the flat <hi>Fillet</hi> which forms the <hi>Capital</hi> of the <hi>Triglyphs</hi> composes a part
of the <hi>Cornice,</hi> and is not compriz'd within the limits of the <hi>Freeze,</hi> though in that of
<hi>Marcellus</hi>'s <hi>Theater</hi> I have made it to be a part, to the end we may religiously preserve
our selves within the termes of the general rules of the <hi>Order,</hi> which precisely requires
that the height of the <hi>Freeze</hi> should be of one <hi>Module</hi> and an half, that so the square in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
of the <hi>Metops</hi> with the <hi>Triglyphs</hi> (which is indeed an inconvenience very great,
but withall most necessary) may be handsomely adjusted. To the rest, I will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
positively that the <hi>Column</hi> of this <hi>Profile</hi> was without a <hi>Basis,</hi> for my design gives
me onely the <hi>Entablature</hi> and <hi>Capital;</hi> though I might well be inclin'd to think so for
the reasons before deduc'd, and amply demonstrated in the second Chapter.

                     <head type="sub">Another very antient Profile after the Grand Maniere
elevated in Perspective, and now extant at Albano
near Rome.</head>
                     <p>I Conceiv'd it very advantageous, and indeed in some sort necessary the better to
represent the beauty and goodly effect of this <hi>Profile,</hi> to give you <hi>one</hi> elevated in
<hi>Perspective;</hi> because I would gratifie the eye with as much as <hi>Art</hi> is capable to add
to the real and natural <hi>Relievo,</hi> and shew how it ought to succeed in the execution.</p>
                     <p>This incomparable <hi>Dorique</hi> Master-piece was discovered at <hi>Albano,</hi> joyning to the
Church of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> amongst divers other old fragments of <hi>Architecture</hi> very curious,
and of which I have a good number design'd, and with great diligence examin'd as
to their measures, though drawn something in haste and as it were in passing, by
the hand of the famous <hi>Pyrrho Ligorio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which I particularly esteem in this is a certain <hi>grandure</hi> of <hi>Manner</hi> majestical
and surprising which is altogether extraordinary; all which results from its having but
few members, and from the largeness of those which it has; an account whereof I
have already given, speaking of the difference of <hi>Manners</hi> in the second <hi>Chapter.</hi> For
the rest, the <hi>shaft</hi> of the <hi>Column</hi> stands simply on a step which serves it instead of a
<hi>Plinth,</hi> as I have here represented him.</p>
                     <p>Now to the end this <hi>design</hi> may not only prove agreeable to the eye, but likewise
profitable to those who shall desire to put it in practice, I have also accompanied it
with its <hi>Profile,</hi> and particular Measures.</p>
                     <p>I advertise moreover, that the <hi>Pillar</hi> has fifteen <hi>Modules</hi> in height, and the
<hi>Entablature</hi> three, with two thirds, which amount just to the quarter which is the
regular proportion of the <hi>Dorique Entablature</hi> with the height of its <hi>Column:</hi> I have
omitted the <hi>Profile</hi> of the <hi>Capital</hi> for want of space, as likewise for that it is so little
differing from the ordinary in its mouldings, and so perfectly resembles it in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
                     <p>That which is most worthy remark, and indeed to be admir'd in this Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is, the richness, and extraordinary form of his <hi>Modilions,</hi> which lying plumb
over the <hi>Triglyphs,</hi> and being as it were a king of <hi>Capitals</hi> to them, produce a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
effect, which is yet much augmented by those great <hi>Roses</hi> of the <hi>Sofitto</hi> or <hi>Eves</hi>
of the <hi>Corona,</hi> which having an extraordinary projecture, render the <hi>Order</hi> altogether
<hi>Gigantique;</hi> and this is properly that which they term the <hi>Grand Maniere.</hi>

together in this Collection.</head>
                     <p>THAT the Reader may now come with some kind of preparation to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Examen of the <hi>Designes</hi> which follow, I shall here endeavour to give
him a general hint of the severall talents and abilities which I have remark'd
in every one of those <hi>Masters</hi> we are taking a survey of in paragon one with the
other.</p>
                     <p>The first of all is without any contest the famous <hi>Andrea Palladio,</hi> to whom we
are oblig'd for a very rare Collection of antique <hi>Plans</hi> and <hi>Profiles</hi> of all sorts of
Buildings, design'd after a most excellent manner, and measur'd with a diligence so
exact, that there is nothing more in that particular left us to desire: Besides the very
advantageous opportunities which he has had at <hi>Venice,</hi> and in all the <hi>Vincentine</hi> his
native Country do leave us such markes as clearly shew'd him not onely to have
been a Sectator of these great <hi>Masters</hi> of <hi>Antiquity;</hi> but even a Competitor with
them, and emulous of their glory.</p>
                     <p>The Man who nearest approaches to him is also another <hi>Vincentine, Vincent Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mozzi</hi>
by name, a far greater talker (as well appears in his Books) but a much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
workman, and less delicate in point of design: A man may easily perceive
it by the <hi>Profiles</hi> which he has left us of the five <hi>Orders,</hi> the manner whereof is a little
dry; besides that, he is very poor and trite in his Ornaments, and but of an ill
<hi>gusto:</hi> He is notwithstanding <hi>this</hi> the nearest that approaches him as to the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his proportions, and the most worthy to be parallel'd with <hi>Palladio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sebastiano Serlio</hi> and <hi>Iacomo Barozzio</hi> surnam'd <hi>Vignola</hi> hold of the second <hi>Class;</hi>
and albeit they have both follow'd contrary wayes, and very different manners, yet
I forbear not to place them in the same range, and am indeed in some difficulty to
determine which of the two has deserv'd more of the Publique; were it not that
one might say, the <hi>first</hi> had the good fortune to work for <hi>Masters</hi> who needed onely
to be shew'd the <hi>Idea</hi> of the things in gross, without having any thing to do with the
retail of their Proportions; and that the <hi>other</hi> onely propos'd to himself the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of young beginners, and to deliver to them the rules of <hi>Art</hi> and good design:
But it were of excellent advantage for us all that <hi>Serlio</hi>'s Book had been design'd
like that of <hi>Vignola;</hi> or that <hi>Vignola</hi>'s study and diligence in searching, had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to that of <hi>Serlio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:53015:23"/>The famous Commentator of <hi>Vitruvius, Daniel Barbaro Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Aquilea,</hi> whom
with very great justice we may fitly style the <hi>Vitruvius</hi> of our Times, shall in this place
be seated in the middle of all the <hi>Masters</hi> to be their President; as being indeed the
<hi>Interpreter</hi> and <hi>Oracle</hi> of the very Father of <hi>Architects:</hi> and his Companion <hi>Pietro Cataneo</hi>
(whom I assign onely to preserve an equal conformity in my designs of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Modern <hi>Authors</hi>) shall serve only as a petty <hi>Chaplain</hi> in the retinue of this great
<hi>Prelat,</hi> though he might well claim <hi>Peerage</hi> even with the most part of the rest.</p>
                     <p>Among the other latter four, I have a particular esteem for <hi>one</hi> above the rest, and
that is <hi>Leon Baptista Alberti,</hi> the most Antient of all the Modern, and happly too, the
most knowing in the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Building,</hi> as may be easily collected by a large and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Volume</hi> which he has published, wherein he fundamentally shews whatever is
necessary for an <hi>Architect</hi> to know. But as to the <hi>Profiles</hi> of the <hi>Orders</hi> themselves
and his regulation of them, I cannot but strangely admire at his negligence in drawing
them no more correctly, and with so little art himself being a <hi>Painter;</hi> since it had
so notably contributed to its recommendation, and to the merit of his works. But
this I have reform'd in our following <hi>Collection,</hi> and believe in so doing to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
him no little service, as happly in danger to have otherwise never been follow'd;
there being hardly any appearance, that whilst the designs of his <hi>Book</hi> were so pitifully
drawn, being made use of in work, they should ever produce so good effect.</p>
                     <p>To the most <hi>Antient</hi> I would assign for <hi>Corrival,</hi> the most <hi>Modern,</hi> that by confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them to each other, we might the better come to discover whether the <hi>Art</hi> it
self improve and proceed to any further perfection, or do not already begin to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
and decline. This last Author, namely <hi>Viola,</hi> is of the <hi>Categorie</hi> of those which
the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Cicaloni,</hi> eternal Talkers to no purpose. He, whilst he proposes to
himself to write of the <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Proportions</hi> of <hi>Architecture,</hi> of the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Perspective,</hi>
of some <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Geometry</hi> and other the like dependencies on his principal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
amuses himself, poor man, in telling stories; so that in stead of a Book of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,</hi>
he has made (ere he was aware) a Book of <hi>Metamorphoses.</hi> Besides he has
<hi>this</hi> in common with <hi>Leon Baptist Alberti,</hi> that his designs are both very ill-contriv'd,
and executed; notwithstanding he follows a more elegant manner, and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enough to that of <hi>Palladio;</hi> but the <hi>Method</hi> which he uses in his partitions is so
gross, and <hi>mechanique,</hi> that he reckons all upon his fingers, and seems to have never
so much as heard speak either of <hi>Arithmetique</hi> or <hi>Cyphers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the two which remain, a man cannot well affirm them to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to those who preceded them, nor yet to have been of the same force with the
first, though I conceive they may well compare with three or four of them at least. And</p>
                     <p>These are two <hi>French Masters</hi> sufficiently renown'd both by their Works and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; <hi>Philibert de Lorme,</hi> and <hi>Iean Bullant,</hi> whom yet I do not here place in the last
range as being at all their inferiours; but onely that I may separate them from the
<hi>Italians</hi> who are in far greater numbers.</p>

the <hi>Parallel</hi> of the <hi>Architects</hi> which I have there assembled together, and whose
<hi>designs</hi> I am hastning to examine by comparing them with our three <hi>Antique Designs,</hi>
that according to their more or less conformity with these Original Models, we may
pronounce concerning their merit, and see what esteem they indeed deserve. From
this consideration it is, that of all the <hi>choice</hi> of the other <hi>Masters,</hi> I have extracted
<hi>Palladio</hi> and <hi>Scamozzi,</hi> who having propos'd to themselves the imitation of the antient
<hi>Architects</hi> by studying those admirable Monuments yet remaining in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi>
have follow'd a <hi>manner</hi> infinitely more noble, and <hi>proportions</hi> more elegant then those of

                     <p>The first <hi>Profile</hi> of <hi>Palladio</hi> hath a great affinity with our second example, <hi>Antique,</hi>

with reason omitted, all the rest of the <hi>Entablature</hi> is upon the matter the same.</p>
                     <p>He has likewise been so discreet (being peradventure oblig'd to follow the vulgar
errour, which will have the <hi>Base</hi> of a <hi>Column</hi> of this <hi>Order</hi> to be all one with the others)
to advertise before hand by an example which has none at all, that the <hi>Antients</hi> did
never use it after this manner.</p>
                     <p>He allows but fifteen <hi>Modules</hi> to the <hi>Column,</hi> without <hi>Base,</hi> and with its <hi>Base</hi> he
makes it of sixteen, and sometimes proceeds even to seventeen and a third. The rest
of the measures are so distinctly mark'd upon the <hi>Profile,</hi> that it were superfluous
to explain them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scamozzi</hi> gives ever precisely seventeen Modules to his <hi>Columnes,</hi> accommodating
it with the same <hi>Base</hi> that <hi>Palladio</hi> does; but to a great deal less purpose, in as much
as he thinks fit to deck the <hi>Tore's</hi> with I know not what delicate <hi>foliages,</hi> which does
not at all become the <hi>Order;</hi> no more then does the <hi>Ionique fluting</hi> which is abusively
employ'd in this place in stead of the natural <hi>Dorique.</hi> His <hi>Entablature</hi> (as well as that
of <hi>Palladio</hi>) sufficiently resembles our second <hi>Model,</hi> to which he has onely added a
small cavity betwixt the <hi>Corona</hi> and the greater round, a thing not at all considerable.</p>
                     <p>The Composition of his <hi>Profile</hi> taken in gross, and altogether simple appears of a
great <hi>Idea,</hi> but the Ornaments are to be rejected.

                     <p>THESE two <hi>Masters</hi> are infinitely oblig'd to their <hi>Interpreters</hi> who produced
them first amongst the <hi>Tramontani</hi> and strangers, and particularly to our work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in <hi>France</hi> who hold them in very great estimation: And though they are in
truth highly worthy of it, nevertheless being compar'd to the preceding <hi>two,</hi> they
lose much of their lustre, and come exceedingly short of them.</p>
                     <p>This the <hi>Reader</hi> may easily find by comparing the one to the other with the Antient
<hi>Originals</hi> which I have prefix'd as the <hi>Lantern</hi> and <hi>Compass</hi> of all true <hi>Architecture.</hi>
But it were not just we should treat <hi>Serlio</hi> in this <hi>Examen</hi> with the same rigour we
have done his Companion; for that intending to follow <hi>Vitruvius</hi> (who is the most
renown'd and venerable <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Antients</hi>) he has worthily acquitted himself:
Whereas <hi>Vignola</hi> who has pursu'd another course, really a more noble, and the very
same which I also observe here, knew not how to proceed without deviation. The
<hi>Dorique</hi> Profile which he here presents us, is taken out of the first Order of the <hi>Theater</hi>
of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and the most worthy example of this kind which is to be met with
amongst all the <hi>Roman Antiquities,</hi> and of which also I have made choice for the first
model of this <hi>Collection,</hi> with this only difference, that I have precisely observ'd all
the measures and allowances of the Original, which you will perceive in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
to be exceedingly changed, particularly in the <hi>Cornice</hi> and Capital: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of the two designs will in one instant afford more light to the Reader, then I
can do by the discourse of an entire Page.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Serlio</hi> gives here fourteen Modules onely to his <hi>Column,</hi> comprehending the <hi>Base</hi>
and <hi>Chapter;</hi> and the height of the <hi>Entablature</hi> amounts to three Modules and a little
more then two thirds, insomuch as (contrary to his ordinary custom) he extremely
exceeds the quarter of his <hi>Column,</hi> which is the largest proportion that the <hi>Antients</hi>
did ever practise; so as this great excess puts me in doubt whether the Text of <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
upon which he relies be not corrupted in that place; or else, when he spake of
that <hi>Column,</hi> he did not mean the <hi>Shaft</hi> without its <hi>Capital:</hi> for so by adding one
<hi>Module</hi> more (which is the precise height of the <hi>Chapter</hi>) the entire <hi>Column</hi> would be
fifteen Modules, and consequently the <hi>Entablature</hi> hold proportion conformable to
the Antients.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vignola</hi> forms his <hi>Column</hi> of sixteen Modules, and the <hi>Entablature</hi> of four, which
is exactly the fourth part of the <hi>Column,</hi> and which makes it appear very regular: As
touching the <hi>Base</hi> introduc'd by the <hi>Moderns</hi> into this <hi>Order,</hi> I have already declar'd
my Opinion concerning it.

                     <p>THIS is here the perfect <hi>School</hi> of Father <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> whose very name and
authority does extremely recommend it to us. Not that we are oblig'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently,
and without choice to follow all those who pretend to have understood
this grave and abstruse Authour; seeing every man strives to make him of his own
party, and to accommodate him to his particular Genius.</p>
                     <p>The very best of them all was without exception <hi>Daniel Barbaro,</hi> as well for his
excellent <hi>Commentaries,</hi> as for the exactitude, and cleanness of his <hi>designs.</hi> A man
may perceive by the <hi>Parallel</hi> of his <hi>Profile</hi> with <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Cataneo</hi> his adjunct; of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi>
in the page before, and some others following this <hi>Class,</hi> that he presides here as
a <hi>Master</hi> among his Disciples.</p>
                     <p>It were an amusement to no purpose, and very impertinent should I quote every
minute and small difference of one <hi>design</hi> from the other; since the <hi>Reader</hi> may better
see it by one cast of his eye, then I can describe it to him in all the rest of this Page.</p>
                     <p>I will add onely this general advertisement, that the proportion of the <hi>Colomn,</hi>
with its Entablature, is the same <hi>here</hi> which <hi>Serlio</hi> gave us before, without being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to repeat my own opinion thereof; since my Observation is upon <hi>Vitruvius,</hi>
and not against those who have explained him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Daniel Barbaro</hi> has judiciously introduc'd a <hi>Boucler</hi> in the angular <hi>Metop</hi> of the
<hi>Freeze,</hi> thereby signifying, that all Ornaments should be accommodated to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
which they are applied to; and that <hi>this</hi> being of a robust, and martial kind,
one may as occasion requires, enrich it with <hi>Trophies</hi> of <hi>Armes, Clubbs, Quivers</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi>
and such like instruments of Warr.</p>
                     <p>To the prejudice of <hi>Cataneo</hi>'s design, I find that the <hi>Gula</hi> of the superiour part of
the <hi>Entablature</hi> is somewhat too great, that the <hi>Projection</hi> of the <hi>Plinth</hi> of the <hi>Capital</hi> is
a little too small and renders the whole <hi>Chapter</hi> mean, and short, which extremely
disfigures his <hi>Profile;</hi> besides, that the <hi>Base</hi> below has <hi>that</hi> in excess, which is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
in the <hi>Chapter</hi> above.

                     <p>AT sight of this first design of <hi>Leon Baptista Alberti</hi> whose <hi>Capital</hi> is entirely <hi>Gotique,</hi>
one might with reason wonder why I should speak so advantageously of him
in the general Examen which I have made of the modern <hi>Architects,</hi> amongst whom I
assign him one of the principal places; and in earnest I cannot excuse him <hi>here</hi> of
that ill relish, and of this so ill-favour'd a Composition, however he pretends to
have seen it, and to have taken it from some antient fragments: But suppose it true
(for a man may meet with bad ones enough) he might also have found others a great
deal more tolerable: That which falls out the most unluckily for him in this his first
production of skill, is, that it is of very great importance for a man to begin well;
since the first impression continues long, and introduces a consequence for those who
follow after. Nevertheless, be it what it will, every man is obliged to accord with the
truth, and to judge of things honestly, and without preoccupation. And therefore
to do him justice, having first condemned this defective part in his <hi>Profile,</hi> we are not
to reject all the rest for that reason; seeing it is in truth very good, of a great and
noble manner. It has also much conformity with our third <hi>antique</hi> Example in the
<hi>Modilions,</hi> whose projectures put into work would produce a noble effect, as may be
judg'd by the <hi>Perspective</hi> which I have made of it. His <hi>Architrave</hi> and <hi>Freeze</hi> are both
regular, and the <hi>Entablature</hi> entire to its exact proportion with the <hi>Column;</hi> for it
consists of four Modules in height, and the <hi>Column</hi> of six. The proportions of the
<hi>Base</hi> are likewise very handsome, so as in the whole design there is nothing scandalous
besides the <hi>Capital,</hi> which may easily be supplied by borrowing from his Collegue

of <hi>Palladio</hi> whom I perceive he has imitated in all the following <hi>Orders</hi> as well as in
this here. But since he endevours to disguise his theft as much as possible in alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some of the mouldings, or mutilating some member, he has here made a quarter
round in stead of the direct <hi>Cymatium</hi> or <hi>Ogee</hi> of the <hi>Cornice,</hi> which is but a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
or tolerable at least in the <hi>Dorique Order,</hi> that of <hi>Marcellus</hi>'s Theater being
the very same.

                     <p>'TIS not without some difficulty that I have been able to reduce the second <hi>Profile</hi>
of this <hi>Page</hi> to the termes you here behold it, <hi>Philibert de Lorme</hi> having design'd
it so slightly, and in so small a Volume (though that in his book be large enough) that
it had been impossible to give any of the members its due proportion without the
assistance of the <hi>Text,</hi> upon which he has made three large <hi>Chapters;</hi> whereas by the
aid of some better draught, he might easily have spar'd many words and letters of
direction extremely confus'd throughout his whole discourse, which he uses to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the particulars of the proportions of each part of his <hi>Profile;</hi> and this makes
me judge that the good man was no great <hi>Designer,</hi> which is a very ordinary defect
amongst those of his Profession: But this does not much concern our Subject in
hand, where we have onely to examine, whether the <hi>Dorique Order</hi> which he proposes,
has any conformity to the <hi>Antique,</hi> or at least to the Precepts of <hi>Vitruvius;</hi> as one
may perceive by the <hi>Parallel</hi> of his Companion <hi>Iohn Bulliant,</hi> who has followed
this old Author in his <hi>Profile</hi> very punctually, though he also produce others from
<hi>Antiquity,</hi> in which I find him not so just and exact as I took him to be in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     </p>
                     <p>I will not here stand to particularise the difference which there is betwixt these
two <hi>Architects,</hi> lest I my self fall into the same inconvenience which I but now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in <hi>Philibert de Lorme;</hi> and for that the exactness of my <hi>designs</hi> have
neither need of illustration or discourse: However, this I may add in favour of <hi>Iohn
Bulliant,</hi> that he is the sole Sectator of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> who has contain'd himself within
the regular termes of his <hi>Master</hi> as to the height of the <hi>Entablature,</hi> to which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
three Modules and a half that precisely make the fourth part of the <hi>Column,</hi>
which ought to have but seven Diameters in height, according to <hi>Vitruius Lib. IV.
Cap. I.</hi> which amounts to fourteen Modules.

                     <head type="sub">Of the Ionique Order.</head>
                     <p>THE first productions of <hi>Arts</hi> have alwayes been exceedingly rare, because it is
so difficult to invent; but it is not the same of Imitation: For after men had
once seen Regular Structures, and those famous <hi>Temples</hi> of the <hi>Dorique Order</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by <hi>Vitruvius</hi> and some others, <hi>Architecture</hi> did not long remain in its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy;
the concurrence and emulation of the neighbouring people advanc'd its
growth, and made it soon arrive to its perfection. The <hi>Ionians</hi> were the first Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors
with the <hi>Dorics</hi> in this divine Art, which seem'd to be descended from the
<hi>Gods</hi> themselves to gratifie Mankind with more opportunity of honouring them; and
though these had neither the advantage nor the glory to be Inventors of it, they ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
yet to improve and raise it even above the very Authors. Considering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the figure of a Mans body, on which the <hi>Dorique Order</hi> had been form'd, was
of a shape too robust and massy to fit holy Places and become the representation of
<hi>Celestial</hi> things, they would needs compose an <hi>Order</hi> after their own Mode, and chose
a <hi>Model</hi> of a more elegant Proportion, wherein they had more regard to the Beauty
then to the Solidity of the Work, which gave the first occasion of calling it the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine
Order,</hi> as indeed degenerating towards an effeminate softness. And the truth is,
the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Caryatides</hi> quickly sprung up after it, which was an extraordinary
affront to this poor <hi>Sex,</hi> and a very shame to <hi>Architecture</hi> it self, for having so irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
employ'd a feeble and delicate thing to perform an office where strength and
solidity were the onely necessaries. <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> and divers of the <hi>Modern</hi> since him,
mention the Original of this <hi>Order,</hi> and tell us, that the Inhabitants of a certain <hi>City</hi>
of <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> named <hi>Carya,</hi> having made a league with the <hi>Persians</hi> against their own
Nation the <hi>Greeks,</hi> after the rout of the <hi>Persians,</hi> were afterwards besieged by the
Conquerours, and so barbarously saccag'd, that putting every man to the sword,
consuming the City to ashes, and carrying the Women away Captive, their venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
being not yet extinct, they resolv'd to eternise their resentment by causing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Edifices to be erected, wherein for a mark of the servitude of these Captives
they ingraved their <hi>Images</hi> in stead of <hi>Columns,</hi> that so they might overwhelm <hi>them</hi>
likewise under the weight of the punishment which they had merited by the guilt of
their Husbands, and leave an everlasting memory thereof to future Ages: This is
the Example which <hi>Vitruvius</hi> has made use of to prove how necessary it is that an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect</hi>
should be knowing in <hi>History,</hi> to the end he introduce nothing impertinently
in his works, and without good reason. The <hi>Gotique Order,</hi> which is the folly and very
<hi>Ape</hi> of <hi>Architecture,</hi> in imitation of the <hi>Caryatides</hi> has compos'd certain lame figur'd
<hi>Mutils</hi> or <hi>Corbells</hi> in stead of <hi>Cartouzes</hi> sustained by I know not what <hi>Chimera's</hi> and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
<hi>Monkeys,</hi> to be met with in every corner of our old <hi>Churches;</hi> but some of
the <hi>Modern</hi> having (with very good reason) found fault that such extravagances
should be seen in holy Places where reverence and modesty are so essential, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how much more decent it were to fit those places with some devout Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations,
without any respect at all to their Profession, or for want rather of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53015:30"/>
the propriety of the <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Architecture,</hi> have amused themselves to place
the figure of <hi>Angels</hi> and other <hi>Saints</hi> in stead of the <hi>Caryatides;</hi> making them like so
many <hi>Slaves</hi> to carry huge <hi>Cornices,</hi> and even entire <hi>Altars</hi> upon their shoulders, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
thereby how preposterously and without judgment they consulted <hi>Vitruvius</hi>
upon the occasion of the Original of the <hi>Caryatides:</hi> For they would otherwise have
understood that this Order cannot be employed or indifferently enter into all sorts of
Buildings, and that it requires no small discretion to be aptly and discreetly placed:
Above all, that it should never be used in <hi>Churches,</hi> which are the Houses of <hi>God,</hi> and
<hi>Asylum's</hi> of Mercy, where servitude and revenge ought never to appear. They
had proceeded much better to have onely used the plain <hi>Regular Order</hi> which we
are now going to describe according to an excellent <hi>Antique Example</hi> taken from the
Temple of <hi>Fortuna Virilis</hi> at present the Church of St. <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> the

great Antiquary <hi>Pyrro Ligorio;</hi> whose <hi>Manuscripts</hi> and <hi>Designs</hi> are conserved as a very
rare Treasure in the <hi>Bibliotheque</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which has furnished me with
a means to examine and verifie divers Measures that at present a man would hardly
know where to take; and to repair the <hi>Cornice</hi> with its proper Ornaments, which are
now so impaired through age, that it is extremely difficult to discern them. This is
then the <hi>Model</hi> I shall follow, and which shall here serve for the <hi>Rule</hi> of this <hi>Order,</hi>
having with mature consideration, and for divers reasons preferr'd it before that
which is in the <hi>Theater</hi> of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> from whence I have taken the <hi>Dorique;</hi> which
nevertheless I shall propose in what follows, remitting others who concurr not with
my opinion to their own affection and fancy.</p>
                     <p>But before I enter upon the retail of its proportions (for recommendation of this
<hi>Order,</hi> and the curiosity of the <hi>Reader</hi>) I will here recount to you the names of some
famous <hi>Temples</hi> built by the People of <hi>Ionia,</hi> whose antiquity is at the least of <hi>two
thousand</hi> years. The most memorable, though not most antient, is that renowned
<hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Diana,</hi> erected (as some think) by the <hi>Amazons</hi> in <hi>Ephesus.</hi> This was a work
of so stupendious a grandure, that there was spent above two hundred years in finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, all <hi>Asia</hi> contributing to this inestimable expense. <hi>Vitruvius</hi> in his third <hi>Book,
Chap. I.</hi> sayes, it was of the <hi>dipteryque</hi> figure; that is, inviron'd with a two-fold range
of <hi>Columns</hi> in form of a double <hi>Portico:</hi> It was in length four hundred and twenty
five foot upon two hundred and twenty. All these <hi>Columns</hi> were of <hi>Marble</hi> seventy
foot in height. The <hi>Architect</hi> of this proud Edifice, according to the same <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
was one named <hi>Ctesiphon,</hi> whom he mentions in his tenth Book, where he speaks
of an excellent <hi>Machine</hi> that he invented to transport the <hi>Columns</hi> of this <hi>Temple;</hi>
which for being of so prodigious a length, that no ordinary force was able to move
and bring from their quarries, had been all to no purpose, had not this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Genius</hi> discovered some artificial forces to supply the defect of others. This
Structure is esteemed for one of the <hi>Worlds seven Wonders:</hi> There were yet in the same
<hi>City</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> many other <hi>Temples</hi> of this <hi>Order;</hi> whereof two (one dedicated to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi>
the other to <hi>Bacchus</hi>) are principally remarkable, as having been in some sort
comparable to this <hi>first,</hi> had they received their ultimate perfection; but they were
left off unfinished, by reason of the warrs against the <hi>Persians,</hi> who were in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53015:31"/>
the utter ruine and subversion of this People: For <hi>Cyrus</hi> having subjugated
<hi>Asia</hi> plunder'd all this Country, faccag'd their <hi>Cities,</hi> demolish'd the <hi>Temple,</hi> and made
so universal and barbarous a devastation, that there hardly remain'd any thing of
such an infinity of stupendious Monuments which this noble <hi>Nation</hi> had erected
throughout all <hi>Greece:</hi> Notwithstanding this, he spared that of <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi>
whose astonishing beauty serv'd as a <hi>Bulwark</hi> to the fury and rage of this mighty
Conquerour. In <hi>Athens</hi> one of the most flourishing <hi>Cities</hi> of the World, there was
also of the same <hi>Ionique Order</hi> a very great number of <hi>Temples,</hi> amongst which, that of
the <hi>Delphic Apollo</hi> and his Son <hi>Esculapius</hi> were highly celebrated. There is yet to be seen
in the same place certain <hi>Vestigia's</hi> reduc'd to the form of a <hi>Citadel,</hi> which they report
to have been heretofore the <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Goddess Iuno Attica.</hi> I could enumerate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others like these, of which the <hi>Antiquaries</hi> we have cited report marvels; but
in general termes, and without any benefit to the <hi>studious</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> who stand in
need of some more essential remarks and instructions. I will therefore manage the
rest of this <hi>discourse</hi> in describing the <hi>Composition,</hi> and the parts of this <hi>Order,</hi> confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the <hi>Profile</hi> which I have chosen for our <hi>Model,</hi> and which is precisely taken
from the <hi>Antique.</hi>

<hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
Pirro Ligorio,</hi> of whom I have heretofore spoken, and from whom I have
borrowed this <hi>Profile,</hi> I may safely propose it for one of the most regular Examples
of the whole <hi>Ionique Order</hi> which is now extant of antient <hi>Architecture:</hi> Add to this
the instance which <hi>Palladio</hi> makes of it in his fourth Book and thirteenth Chapter,
being the onely one of this <hi>Order</hi> which he has inserted amongst the whole collection
of his Studies; so as these two great <hi>Masters</hi> approving the election and judgment I
have made thereof, it is not to be doubted for a <hi>Master-piece</hi> of supreme perfection.
I will therefore make the general description thereof, deducing the principal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and proportions in gross, without amusing my self with the smaller retail of
the measures of each particular part, which the <hi>Design</hi> ought to supply.</p>
                     <p>The entire <hi>Order</hi> from the Superficies of the <hi>Area</hi> to the <hi>Cornice,</hi> contains eleven
<hi>Diameters</hi> of the whole <hi>Column,</hi> which amounts to twenty two <hi>Models.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Column</hi> with the <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> has eighteen <hi>Modules.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Entablature</hi> (that is to say, <hi>Architrave, Freeze,</hi> and <hi>Cornice</hi>) contain four <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi>
lacking four <hi>Minutes,</hi> which are not considerable upon the total; and this height
making two <hi>nineths</hi> of the <hi>Column</hi> produces a proportionate mediocrity 'twixt that of
the <hi>Dorique Order</hi> before describ'd (whereof the <hi>Entablature</hi> composes one quarter)
and that of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> (as we shall see hereafter) to which the <hi>Moderns</hi> do ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
attribute a fifth part.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Voluta</hi> of the <hi>Capital</hi> is after an <hi>oval</hi> form, producing a very noble effect, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that none of our <hi>Architects</hi> have put it in practice; but the reason in my
opinion, is, the difficulty of tourning it with a grace, and for that they are generally
accustom'd to do all with the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Compass,</hi> which are here in a manner useless.

                     <p>SOME may imagine that I ought to have establish'd mine <hi>Ionique Order</hi> upon this
Example, being as 'twere the twin-Brother of the first <hi>Dorique</hi> with which I have
commenced this <hi>Collection</hi> of <hi>Architecture,</hi> being both of them extracted out of the same
Edifice, which is the <hi>Theater</hi> of <hi>Marcellus.</hi> And to speak truth, it was my first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
But second cogitations being ordinarily the more judicious; I have since con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
that the ampleness of the <hi>Entablature</hi> with its extraordinary plainness, was a
particular effect of the <hi>Architects</hi> discretion, who resolving to place this <hi>Order</hi> in an
exceeding large Building, and also upon an elevated place, where the fight could
hardly enjoy those Ornaments wherewithall it is usually enriched, had regard onely
to the reformation of <hi>that</hi> by a rule of the <hi>Opticks,</hi> which the Eye might possibly find
fault with in the grace of its general proportions from the distance of its Elevation;
so that we may affirm of this <hi>Profile,</hi> that it does excellently well in <hi>Work</hi> as 'tis placed
in the <hi>Original;</hi> but would not succeed so well in another of more mediocrity; and
above all in a work of <hi>one</hi> onely <hi>Order,</hi> unless it were of a <hi>Colossean</hi> magnitude; which
is yet in truth neither proper nor natural to its feminine kind: However I will here
present you with its Proportions as well as with the others.</p>
                     <p>The height of the entire <hi>Order</hi> is twenty two <hi>Models,</hi> and two thirds.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Column</hi> with her <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> hath but eighteen, and those precise enough;
so as the whole <hi>Entablature</hi> consisting of four and two thirds, it happens to be of an
extraordinary grandure, in as much as it exceeds a quarter of the <hi>Order,</hi> which is the
largest Proportion can justly be given even to the <hi>Dorique</hi> it self.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Projecture</hi> or <hi>Iette</hi> of the <hi>Cornice</hi> is also a little extravagant; but the <hi>Architect</hi>
has for all that shewed himself very judicious, having respect in that to the entire mass
of the Building, and to the eminence of the fire of this second <hi>Order:</hi> For the same
reason he afforded but very little diminution to the <hi>Column</hi> above.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Voluta's</hi> of the <hi>Capital</hi> are Oval, as in the precedent <hi>Order,</hi> and this shape of
the <hi>Voluta's</hi> was much practis'd by the <hi>Antients;</hi> but the method of tourning them with
the <hi>Compass</hi> is somewhat difficult, and has never as yet been demonstrated.

Baths of Dioclesian at Rome.</head>
                     <p>I Would needs make an Elevation in <hi>Perspective</hi> of this <hi>Profile,</hi> that so I might add
some variety to my designs, and for that likewise it is an advantageous means to
represent the <hi>Idea</hi> of an <hi>Order,</hi> and the effect which it produces being put in <hi>Work,</hi> for
their sakes who are not much practis'd in the Mystery. This piece stood in the <hi>Baths</hi>
of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> at the <hi>angle</hi> or <hi>coinage</hi> of a return of a Wall, as I have found out by a
<hi>Design</hi> of mine very antient and of a good hand, where the Proportions as well of
the <hi>Plan</hi> as of the <hi>Profile</hi> are exactly noted, even to the least particulars. I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
and accommodated them to the division of my ordinary <hi>Model,</hi> as you may
perceive them on the <hi>Profile</hi> which is under the <hi>Perspective Entablature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The height of the whole <hi>Order,</hi> from the <hi>Base</hi> to the top of the <hi>Cornice,</hi> amounts
to ten Diameters and a fourth; which, according to our manner of measuring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
twenty <hi>Models</hi> and an half; which being divided 'twixt the <hi>Column</hi> and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablature</hi>
takes up seventeen, and the three <hi>Models</hi> and half remaining make up the
height of the <hi>Entablature:</hi> Now though there be a considerable difference in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of our first <hi>Ionique</hi> Example, and this <hi>here,</hi> it rather yet consists in the total
quantity of the <hi>Order,</hi> then in the proportion of their parts; for I find here that the
<hi>Entablature</hi> compared to its <hi>Column</hi> has also the same relation of two ninths; which
is to say, that the height of the <hi>Column</hi> divided into nine parts, <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Entablature</hi>
comprehends two of them; which is a <hi>Symmetrie</hi> particularly affected to this <hi>Order,</hi>
as I have elsewhere shewed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Voluta's</hi> of the <hi>Capital</hi> were turn'd with the <hi>Compass,</hi> after the manner I shall

                     <p>THERE is so great a resemblance 'twixt the <hi>mouldings</hi> and the <hi>measures</hi> of these
two <hi>Profiles,</hi> that the difference is hardly considerable, unless it be in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the <hi>Capitals,</hi> which in truth is very different in shape, though sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
in proportion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Voluta</hi> of <hi>Scamozzi</hi> is particular, and by consequence hath less of the <hi>Antique</hi>
then <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Palladio:</hi> But <hi>Scamozzi</hi> has excogitated this expedient, that his <hi>Capital</hi>
might front on all sides, not liking (it may be) this variety of aspect which we find
in the ordinary <hi>Volutas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The altitude of the <hi>Column</hi> according to <hi>Palladio</hi> contains nine <hi>Diameters,</hi> which
make after our measure eighteen <hi>Models;</hi> of which he gives to the <hi>Entablature</hi> but
one fifth part, being the same proportion which hereafter he assigns to his <hi>Corinthian:</hi>
He had yet peradventure done better to have contriv'd for this here a more propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
<hi>Medium</hi> 'twixt the <hi>Dorique</hi> and the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> proceeding by a certain grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the <hi>solid</hi> kind to the more <hi>delicate.</hi> Moreover, I could have wish'd that the
<hi>Cornice</hi> had rather been <hi>tooth'd</hi> then <hi>Modilion'd,</hi> for the reason already rendred in the
general <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Ionique Order;</hi> which I mention onely to advertise (by the way
as 'twere) what does in my judgment seem worthy to be observ'd in this <hi>Profile,</hi>
which in the rest of the parts is exceedingly rare, and in this very particular not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
to be condemned; seeing things which may be improv'd, are not therefore
to be esteemed for ill.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Scamozzi,</hi> besides that the same observations which I have made on the
<hi>Profile</hi> of <hi>Palladius</hi> are repugnant to him, there is <hi>this</hi> yet worse, that the <hi>Capital</hi> being
a great deal more massy, in stead of giving a greater height to his <hi>Cornice,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it of more ample members, he has contrarily made it less, and cut off three
or four small <hi>Reglets</hi> which renders it very dry and trifling.

                     <p>THE inequality of these two <hi>Profiles</hi> is so wide, that 'tis almost impossible to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of them both, and yet nevertheless there is in a manner as little reason
to condemn either the one or the other; for having each of them their principles
sufficiently regular, together with their Authorities and Examples.</p>
                     <p>The first, which is <hi>Serlio,</hi> having made a handsome <hi>Collection</hi> of all the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<hi>Antiquities</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> from whence he should have taken a noble <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
is returned back to the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> whither the slenderness of his <hi>Genius</hi>
has recalled him.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>Vignola</hi> is fall'n with excess into the other manner that we
name the <hi>Grand,</hi> which though indeed more noble and advantageous, has yet for all
that its just limits, which being once exceeded becomes vitious and extravagant.</p>
                     <p>Now the great difference of these two <hi>Masters</hi> proceeds from <hi>Serlio</hi>'s making his
<hi>Column</hi> but of seven <hi>Diameters</hi> and an half, allowing onely a fifth part to the <hi>Entabla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
and <hi>Vignola</hi>'s composing <hi>his</hi> of nine <hi>Diameters,</hi> and his <hi>Entablature</hi> of a full
quarter.</p>
                     <p>That which I chiefly reprove in this last, is, that he makes use of the <hi>Base</hi> which
<hi>Vitruvius</hi> composed for his <hi>Ionique;</hi> a thing not to be excused but in those who follow
him likewise in all the rest: For others who have endeavoured to imitate the <hi>Antique,</hi>
have no reason to employ it, there being no president for it. And in truth also it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
has had the approbation of the ablest modern <hi>Masters,</hi> who upon examination
have greatly wondred that <hi>Vitruvius</hi> should impose so vast a <hi>Torus</hi> upon so small <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</hi>
charging the strong upon the weaker, which being totally repugnant to the
order of <hi>Nature,</hi> is very offensive to the eyes of the Curious.

                     <p>YOU have here very same style that <hi>Serlio</hi> has observed in the precedent
Chapter; And though there be much resemblance in the <hi>Profiles</hi> of all the three
<hi>Masters,</hi> nevertheless we must reckon that as to the meaning of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> (to whose
<hi>Doctrine</hi> they have universally endeavour'd to conform themselves) <hi>Daniel Barbaro</hi> is
the Captain and chief Conductor, as may easily be discern'd from the pattern of the
<hi>Contours</hi> onely belonging to the <hi>Voluta</hi> of the <hi>Capital,</hi> which is a most essential piece in
this <hi>Order,</hi> and whose true draught was never so much as known to our modern <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects</hi>
before <hi>Daniel Barbaro,</hi> to whom we are obliged for the recovery of this excellent
Master-piece of <hi>Antient Architecture,</hi> though he has had the goodness to divide the
glory of it with his Contemporary and intimate friend <hi>Palladio,</hi> by whose conference
and help he acknowledges to have been assisted in the delineation of all his designs.</p>
                     <p>I reserve it for the conclusion of the <hi>Ionique Order</hi> to make a Page apart of this
manner of <hi>Voluta,</hi> where I shall shew a way to trace it regularly according to our
<hi>Author</hi>'s intention. And since it is more compendious to paint then describe it, I
shall better give you the demonstration by <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Compass,</hi> then by employing a
tedious discourse about it.</p>
                     <p>I find nothing observable in these two <hi>Profiles</hi> besides a certain over-simplicity
and plainness: For the rest, the difference of the <hi>Entablature,</hi> as well in relation
to the height, as shape, is so small, that it is nothing at all considerable: What is
more worthy of remark in the design of <hi>Daniel Barbaro,</hi> is this; that he gives to every
face of the <hi>Architrave</hi> a certain <hi>slope</hi> or kind of downward and inclining stroke, as
tis expresly ordained in <hi>Vitruvius</hi>'s third Book, towards the period of the last <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
But I find that the Rule of <hi>Perspective</hi> upon which he grounds it, is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
and subtile for its discourse, then any way solid in the execution, and besides,
I never saw an example of it in any work whatsoever.

                     <p>THE conformity of these two <hi>Designs</hi> to those of <hi>Anderea Palladio</hi> and <hi>Scamozzi</hi>
is so conspicuous, that one may easily judge of their mutual assistance of
each other: <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Viola</hi> made bold with that of <hi>Palladio,</hi> as he did before in the
<hi>Dorique:</hi> and that <hi>Scamozzi</hi> has imitated <hi>L. B. Alberti</hi> who is his Senior above an
hundred years. For the rest, it were a difficult thing to decide which of these two
<hi>Profiles</hi> is to be preferred, in regard the <hi>Ionique Order</hi> has been so diversly treated of
by the <hi>Antients,</hi> as may appear in the Examples I have produc'd, of which there
are some enrich'd with <hi>Mouldings</hi> and <hi>Ornaments,</hi> others more naked and simple.
That which I should have wish'd for here as conducing to a greater and more exact
regularity, should have been to have cut the <hi>Dentelli</hi> upon the flat <hi>Band</hi> of <hi>L. B. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berti</hi>'s
design; since he has omitted <hi>Modilions</hi> there, which his Companion <hi>Viola</hi> for
observing may the better be excused of: Though for my part, I should have rather
employed <hi>Dentelli</hi> there, as an Ornament more particularly affected to the <hi>Ionique Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and have reserved the <hi>Modilions</hi> for the <hi>Order</hi> which follows next.</p>
                     <p>The Reader may remember, or else, looking back on some Pages, reflect upon
what I have there observed on the <hi>Profiles</hi> of <hi>Palladio</hi> and <hi>Scamozzi;</hi> because it so
much agrees with that of <hi>Viola</hi> here; To which I may yet superadd as a new charge, that
he has done ill to imploy another <hi>Base</hi> different from that of the <hi>Attique;</hi> since he saw
how his Master <hi>Palladio</hi> had preferr'd it before that of <hi>Vitruvius</hi>'s Composition: He
had also done much better to have followed precisely the <hi>Proportions</hi> of the <hi>Cornice</hi> in
the same design of <hi>Palladio;</hi> for in attempting to disguise his imitation, by adding of
some <hi>Members</hi> and changing of <hi>others,</hi> he has in fine rendred it but the more mean
and trifling.

                     <p>THIS first <hi>Profile</hi> is exactly after <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Serlio Cataneo,</hi> and
<hi>Daniel Barbaro</hi> which you have already seen: But there is in the other nothing
at all worthy of our imitation, as being neither conformable to any of the <hi>Antiques,</hi>
nor to <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> nor in the least regular in its parts: For first, the <hi>Cornice</hi> is <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse</hi>
and blunt, the principal <hi>Members, viz.</hi> the <hi>Cymatium</hi> and <hi>Cooping</hi> small and poor;
The <hi>Freeze</hi> is larger then the <hi>Cornice,</hi> and the <hi>Base</hi> of the <hi>Column</hi> changed both in
shape, and the proportion of its parts, as appears by the excessive dimensions of the
<hi>Tore,</hi> compared with the two <hi>Scotia's</hi> underneath; besides that extravagant repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the two <hi>Astragals</hi> upon the <hi>Plinth.</hi> The <hi>Voluta</hi> of the <hi>Capital</hi> is also too gross,
and so is the <hi>Collar</hi> of the <hi>Pillar</hi> together with its <hi>List:</hi> In a word, the entire <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
is deservedly ranged in this last place: But after all this, I cannot but admire
that a Person of this <hi>Authors</hi> Condition, who was so extremely industrious (as may
be easily deduced from what himself has publish'd in his Book of Observations made
at <hi>Rome</hi> upon the <hi>Antiquities</hi> there) who had so great a natural propensity to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,</hi>
and so many opportunities of studying at his ease, and of instructing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
Who proceeded by so direct a <hi>Method</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> and in fine, was Master of so
many handsome occasions of putting his studies into practice; That I say a man fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with so many advantages, should nevertheless emerge so ordinary an <hi>Artist:</hi>
But this shews us, that we are many times deceived by our own <hi>Genius,</hi> and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Things for which we have no manner of Talent.

                     <p>I Intend not here to repeat the <hi>History</hi> from whence this <hi>Order</hi> has deriv'd its <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>
having already so amply deduced it in the general Chapter of the <hi>Ionique Order,</hi>
whereof this is here but a <hi>Species;</hi> all the difference consisting in the sole alteration
of the <hi>Column</hi> metamorphos'd into the Figure of a <hi>Woman,</hi> which for appearing
sometimes incommodious to <hi>Architects</hi> from the extreme over-largeness of the Vests
and Garments cumbring and disordering the Passage and <hi>Symmetry</hi> of the <hi>Intercolumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
caused them to reduce it onely to the carving of <hi>Heads</hi> in place of the <hi>Capitals,</hi>
where they adjusted and composed the <hi>Dressing</hi> and <hi>Tyre</hi> to the resemblance of <hi>Voluta's,</hi>
without any alteration in the rest of the <hi>Column,</hi> unless where they cut <hi>Channels</hi> or <hi>Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi>
on it, to represent after a sort the <hi>plaitings</hi> and folds of these <hi>Matrons</hi> Garments;
since this Ornament is found to change neither the <hi>Diameter</hi> nor height of the <hi>Shaft,</hi>
which are the <hi>Bases,</hi> and as it were foundations of <hi>Architectonical</hi> Proportions.</p>
                     <p>That which I asserted before concerning the <hi>Caryatides</hi> in the general Chapter of
the <hi>Ionique Order,</hi> sufficiently discovers how few the occasions are where they can be
employed judiciously; notwithstanding so many of our modern <hi>Architects</hi> take so
great a liberty of introducing them indifferently into all sorts of works: For not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Palaces of</hi> great <hi>Princes</hi> without, and within; but even the <hi>Houses</hi> of private
<hi>Persons, Churches,</hi> and <hi>Sepulchres</hi> themselves are filled with them, without any regard
either to the reason of the <hi>History,</hi> or to just <hi>decorum:</hi> Nay oftentimes,
out of an insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
extravagance, in lieu of these poor and miserable <hi>Captives,</hi> they set the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
figures of the <hi>Vertues, Muses, Graces,</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> themselves; whereas they should
in truth rather chain and confine the <hi>Vices</hi> there.</p>
                     <p>But it is sufficient to have advertised you of this Abuse without any further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
against it.

which it seems they would generally express all those <hi>Orders</hi> where <hi>Figures</hi>
are introduc'd to supply the places of <hi>Columns;</hi> yet ought we not to follow the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
abuse, seeing <hi>Vitruvius</hi> has put a difference betwixt 'em in the same <hi>Chapter</hi>
where he speaks of the <hi>Caryatides:</hi> And in regard <hi>this</hi> here should be somewhat more
solid in reference to the <hi>Sex</hi> they ordinarily give him a <hi>Dorique Entablature,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
whereof I had once intended to have rang'd it at the end of the <hi>Dorique
Order,</hi> or plac'd him the first here; But considering since, that <hi>Vitruvius</hi> does not
treat of it till after the <hi>Caryatides,</hi> I thought it became me not to innovate any thing
in a matter of so small importance. I shall therefore satisfie my self in advertising
that the <hi>Romans</hi> very rarely made use of the <hi>Caryatides;</hi> and truly we do not meet
with so much as any <hi>Vestigia's</hi> of them, though <hi>Pliny</hi> in his thirty fifth <hi>Book</hi> and fifth
<hi>Chapter</hi> has mention'd those of the <hi>Rotunda</hi> to the amusing of so many of our modern
<hi>Antiquaries,</hi> who, though all that <hi>Temple</hi> (and which to this day remains so entire) can
by no diligence find any commodious place nor appearance where they should have
been well design'd: On the contrary, for these <hi>Captives</hi> after the <hi>Persian</hi> there are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
sundry Examples, some whereof are yet to be seen in the very places where they
were set in work, as particularly in the <hi>Arch</hi> of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and some others which
have been transported into <hi>Gardens</hi> and private <hi>Palaces,</hi> which were taken no body
knows from whence. What is here design'd is from an excellent <hi>Original</hi> extant yet

                     <p>THE body of this <hi>Capital</hi> without its <hi>Voluta</hi> or Scroul bears a great conformity
to that of the <hi>Dorique,</hi> as may be easily discerned by conferring their <hi>Profiles</hi>
the one with the other: For the diversity of their form which at first blush appears
so large to the eyes of such as have never examined the particulars of the <hi>Members</hi>
that compose it, consists altogether in the application of the <hi>Voluta</hi> upon the <hi>Abacus,</hi>
which gives a most advantageous variety to the <hi>Ionique;</hi> in as much as the draught
of its <hi>Contour</hi> does consist of the most industrious operation of the <hi>Compass</hi> which is
practised in the whole <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Architecture;</hi> So as who ever of our modern <hi>Masters</hi> he
were that retriv'd it (for 'twas a long time lost, and totally unknown to those of the
<hi>Profession</hi>) he has render'd doubtless a very considerable piece of service to the Art.</p>
                     <p>That famous Painter <hi>Salviati,</hi> contemporary with the <hi>R. Daniel Barbaro,</hi> and by
consequent also with <hi>Palladio,</hi> printed a small loose sheet which he dedicated to <hi>D.
Barbaro</hi> as to the most famous <hi>Arbiter</hi> of <hi>Architecture</hi> in his time, who also under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
it, and had communicated it with <hi>Palladio</hi> who accidentally and as it were by
chance had been the first Investigator of the practice of it whiles he met amongst
some antient <hi>Fragments</hi> a <hi>Capital</hi> of this <hi>Order,</hi> on whose imperfect and rough-hewn
<hi>Voluta</hi> he observed the thirteen <hi>Centers</hi> of this <hi>spiral line</hi> which gives it so noble and so
ingenious a <hi>Turn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will not here engage my self on a tedious discourse about its description, it being
so much a shorter and more demonstrative way to advance to the direct <hi>Method</hi> of its
<hi>delineation:</hi> Thus then in general you are to proceed.</p>
                     <p>The height of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> and partition of each Member being design'd, one must
regulate the extent and proportion of the <hi>Abacus</hi> conformable to the measure deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher'd

<hi>right angle</hi> by the co-incidence of another line proceeding from the middle of the
<hi>Collerine</hi> or <hi>Chaplet,</hi> the point of <hi>intersection</hi> give you the just <hi>Center</hi> of the <hi>Eye:</hi> Then
about this <hi>Center</hi> describing a <hi>Circle</hi> of the wideness of the <hi>Collerine</hi> (which <hi>Circle</hi> (as
was said) points the precise dimensions of the <hi>Eye,</hi> and its true place of position)
you shall from therein a small <hi>Square,</hi> through whose <hi>Angles</hi> having drawn two <hi>diagonals</hi>
(which cut it into four <hi>triangles</hi>) divide each moity of the <hi>diagonals</hi> into three equal
parts, and each of these points shall serve for consequutive <hi>Centers</hi> one after another
by which to form those several quarters of <hi>Circles</hi> which compose the <hi>spiral</hi> line of the

                     <p>THE highest degree of perfection to which <hi>Architecture</hi> did ever aspire, was
erected for it at <hi>Corinth,</hi> that most famous and formerly most opulent and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
<hi>City</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> although at present there hardly remains any footsteps of the
grandure which rendered it even formidable to the people of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, but which
was also the cause of her ruine: For this <hi>Nation</hi> impatient of Competitors, on pretence
that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had done some displeasure to the <hi>Ambassadors</hi> which she had sent,
took occasion of denouncing War against her; so as the Consul <hi>Lucius Mummius</hi> going
thither with a great Army reduced their <hi>City</hi> to Ashes, and in one day destroyed the
Work of more then nine <hi>Ages</hi> from the period of its firth foundation.</p>
                     <p>It was from thence that our <hi>Corinthian Order</hi> assumed its Original; and although
the Antiquity of it be not precisely known, nor under whose Reign that <hi>Callimachus</hi>
lived, to whom <hi>Vitruvius</hi> attributes the glory of this excellent Production; it is yet
easie to judge by the nobleness of its Ornament, that it was invented during the
magnificence and splendor of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and not long after the <hi>Ionique Order</hi> to which
it hath much resemblance, the <hi>Capital</hi> onely excepted; for there's no mention that
<hi>Callimachus</hi> added any thing of his own besides that stately Member.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vitruvius</hi> in the first <hi>Chapter</hi> of his fourth <hi>Book</hi> reports at large upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
this ingenious <hi>Architect</hi> form'd the <hi>Idea</hi> of this great Master-piece which hath
born away the Palm of all <hi>Architecture,</hi> and rendred the name of <hi>Corinth</hi> immortal:
And though the <hi>History</hi> which he there mentions may appear somewhat fabulous in
the opinion of <hi>Villalpandus,</hi> who treats also of this <hi>Capital</hi> in his second <hi>Tome Lib. V.
Chap. XXIII.</hi> nevertheless it were very unjust that the particular conceit of a modern
Writer should prevail above the Authority of so grave an <hi>Author.</hi> Let us see then
what <hi>Vitruvius</hi> sayes of it.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Virgin</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> being now grown up, fell sick and dyed: The day after her
Funeralls her <hi>Nurse</hi> having put into a <hi>Basket</hi> certain small vessels and trifles with
which she was wont to divertise her self whilst she lived, went out and set them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her <hi>Tomb,</hi> and least the air and weather should do them any injury, she covered
them with a <hi>Tyle:</hi> Now the <hi>Basket</hi> being accidentally placed upon the root of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canthus,</hi>
or great <hi>Dock,</hi> the herb beginning to sprout at the spring of the year and
put forth leaves, the stalks thereof creeping up along the sides of the <hi>Basket</hi> and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the edge of the <hi>Tyle</hi> (which jetted out beyond the margine of the <hi>Basket</hi>)
were found (being a little more ponderous at the extremes) to bend their tops
downwards, and form a prety kind of natural <hi>Voluta.</hi> At this very time it was that
the Sculptor <hi>Callimachus</hi> (who for the delicateness of his work upon Marble, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53015:43"/>
gentileness of his invention was by the <hi>Athenians</hi> surnamed <hi>Catatechnos,</hi> (that is to say,
<hi>Industrious</hi>) passing near this <hi>Monument,</hi> began to cast an eye upon this <hi>Basket,</hi> and
to consider the pretty tenderness of that ornamental <hi>foliage</hi> which grew about it, the
manner and form whereof so much pleased him for the novelty, that he shortly after
made <hi>Columns</hi> at <hi>Corinth</hi> resembling this <hi>Model,</hi> and ordained its <hi>Symmetries</hi> distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
afterwards in his Works proportions agreeable to each of its other Members
in conformity to this <hi>Corinthian</hi> Mode.</p>
                     <p>You see what <hi>Vitruvius</hi> reports: But <hi>Villalpandus</hi> who will needs give this <hi>Capital</hi>
a more illustrious and antient Original, pretends that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> took it first from
the Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> of which <hi>God</hi> himself had been the <hi>Architect;</hi> and the better
to elude what <hi>Vitruvious</hi> but now taught us, would make us believe, that the <hi>Capitals</hi>
of the <hi>Acanthus</hi> were rarely used by the <hi>Antients,</hi> who were wont ordinarily to carve
them with <hi>Olive-leaves;</hi> and proves in that which follows by <hi>Text</hi> out of the <hi>Bible,</hi>
and some other <hi>Historians</hi> who have given us the description of this divine <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture,</hi>
that the true Originals of the <hi>Temple</hi> were of <hi>Palm</hi>-branches bearing <hi>Fruit,</hi> to
which the leaves of the <hi>Olive</hi> have a nearer Correspondence. The <hi>Design</hi> which we
shall hereafter describe with the whole <hi>Entablature</hi> of the Order, drawn precisely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the measures which <hi>Villalpandus</hi> has collected, and which I have expresly
followed, without regarding the <hi>Profile</hi> which he has caused to be engraven, will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
discover that I know not how to decry the beauty of this composition: In the
mean time, to be constant and preserve my self within the terms of the <hi>Corinthian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture</hi>
which has been practised by those great <hi>Masters</hi> of Antiquity as well <hi>Greeks</hi>
as <hi>Romans,</hi> and of whom there yet remain such wonderful foot-steps and even entire
<hi>Temples</hi> which may serve as so many express and demonstrable Lectures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
of this <hi>Order;</hi> I have made choice of one of the most famous amongst them,
to which I totally conform my self without any respect to the opinion of the <hi>modern</hi>
Authors; seeing they ought to have pursud the same Paths, and regulated themselves
with me upon these <hi>Original</hi> Examples.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Rotunda</hi> (heretofore called the <hi>Pantheon</hi>) having ever obtained the universal
approbation of knowing persons, as being the most regular <hi>Corinthian</hi> Work, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the most famous among all the remainders of <hi>Antient Rome,</hi> appears to me to
be the very best <hi>Model</hi> which I could possibly make choice of, though there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
others to be found which are much richer in ornaments, and of a beauty more
elegant: But as our <hi>Gusts</hi> do generally differ, I have preferred mine own, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affects things <hi>solid</hi> and a little <hi>plain,</hi> for that indeed to me they appear fullest of
Majesty. Nevertheless, for as much as 'tis sometimes necessary that an <hi>Architect</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode
himself to the Persons <hi>humor</hi> which employs him; and for that one meets
with occasions where magnificence is proper, as in <hi>Triumphal Arches, Kings Palaces,
Temles,</hi> and publique <hi>Bathes</hi> which were much in use among the <hi>Antients,</hi> and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the like ample Structures, where splendour and profusion are chiefly consider'd,
I will produce some examples of the most renown'd of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> the first whereof
shall be that great Relique of the <hi>Frontispiece</hi> of the <hi>Torre di Nerone</hi> so call'd, which has
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53015:44"/>
been demolished within these late thirty years, to the great reproach of this Age, by
the avarice of some particular Persons.</p>
                     <p>This was one of the rarest pieces of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as well for the beauty and richness of
its ornaments, as for the composures of the members of the Order, which even in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
it self appears bold and terrible; the judicious <hi>Architect</hi> of this work very well
understanding how to introduce a <hi>Grandure</hi> of <hi>manner</hi> into his design, which should
equal that mass of stones he heap'd up and contriv'd into the structure of this <hi>Gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique</hi>
Edifice, whereof the <hi>Columns</hi> contained six foot diameter.</p>
                     <p>It is not precisely known who it was that caused it to be built, nor yet to what
purpose it served: Some imagine it was a <hi>Temple</hi> erected by the <hi>Emperor Aurelianus</hi>
and dedicated to the <hi>Sun:</hi> Others that 'twas onely a particular <hi>Palace.</hi> The vulgar
have a <hi>Tradition</hi> that <hi>Nero</hi> rais'd it of that height to behold the <hi>Conflagration</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which is very improbable, as being too great a work to have been accomplished in
so short a time: But whatever it were, certain it is, that it has been the most magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
and goodliest Order of <hi>Corinthian</hi> Work which all <hi>Rome</hi> could boast of, as one
may well perceive by the design which I shall present you of it after <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file</hi>
of the <hi>Portico</hi> belonging to the <hi>Rotunda,</hi> being the <hi>Model</hi> on which I regulate the
<hi>Proportions</hi> of the <hi>Corinthian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ensuing <hi>Design</hi> is a simple representation of the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Callimachus</hi> which I
but now reported, and is placed here onely for Ornament-sake.

                     <p>THE whole height of the <hi>Order</hi> from the <hi>Base</hi> to the <hi>Cornice</hi> amounts to three

who allow him but a fifth; yet we find, that the most famous of the <hi>Antique,</hi> for
example, this frontispiece of <hi>Nero,</hi> and the three Pillars of <hi>Campo Vaccino</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi>
which in the judgment of <hi>Architects</hi> pass for the noblest reliques of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge

safest to preserve our selves within the limits of our Example from the <hi>Rotunda,</hi> lest

                     <p>The entire height of the <hi>Order</hi> contains twenty three <hi>Models</hi> and two thirds, which

                     <p>Concerning the small divisions of each part, it would be too tedious and indeed

                     <p>I have towards the end of the second <hi>Chapter</hi> of this <hi>Book</hi> taught how one should

which may very well agree with this <hi>Corinthian Order:</hi> That is to say the <hi>Fourth,</hi> as in

Profile, which was in the Frontispiece of the Torre di

                     <p>ALthough this piece of <hi>Architecture</hi> were one of the most magnificent of all <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
as well for the excellency and the richness of its Ornaments, as for the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiousness
of the Work; yet could I never certainly learn what kind of Structure
this should have been, nor indeed under whose Reign it was built; Some reporting it
to have been a <hi>Temple</hi> dedicated to the <hi>Sun</hi> by the Emperor <hi>Aurelian;</hi> Others, that it was
onely a private <hi>Pallace</hi> built by <hi>Nero,</hi> in which he plac'd that extravagant <hi>Coloss</hi> of
<hi>Brass</hi> which fixt a <hi>non ultra</hi> to the folly of the <hi>Sculptors</hi> of that <hi>Age,</hi> who out of a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious
profanation of their Art would <hi>deifie</hi> the <hi>Emperors,</hi> by erecting <hi>Statues</hi> to them
of a prodigious grandure, as they did heretofore to the <hi>Gods</hi> to whom this honour was
of right to be reserv'd. <hi>Andrea Palladio</hi> conceiv'd it to have been a <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Iupiter;</hi>
some others conjectur'd that it might be a <hi>Palace</hi> of the <hi>Cornelia</hi>'s, thus every one had
his particular conceit: But since the truth of this question is very indifferent to our
<hi>Subject</hi> in hand which considers onely what relates to <hi>Architecture,</hi> I shall resign the
debate thereof to our <hi>Antiquaries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Columns</hi> were ten <hi>diameters</hi> in height, every <hi>diameter</hi> of six foot, which being of
so excessive a bigness as transcended whatsoever had been built at <hi>Rome</hi> either before or
since it, inclines me to believe it might indeed be some work of <hi>Nero</hi>'s. The Composition
of the <hi>Profile</hi> in general is of an excellent <hi>Idea,</hi> and each member sufficiently regular: For
the rest, I thought fit to present it in <hi>Perspective,</hi> to shew the stupendious effect of this
manner of <hi>design,</hi> which even upon <hi>paper</hi> it self, and without at all exceeding the limits
and proportions which the <hi>Art</hi> has prescrib'd, presents to the Eye a kind of astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>grandure,</hi> proceeding partly from the extraordinary projecture of the <hi>Entablature,</hi>
whose <hi>Corona</hi> carries its <hi>jette</hi> a great way beyond the <hi>Modilions,</hi> and which indeed makes
the <hi>Columns</hi> to appear a little weak and surcharg'd: But the <hi>Architects</hi> had provided
judiciously for it, by making use of that manner of <hi>Columniation</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> have
termed <hi>Pycnostylos,</hi> where the <hi>Pillars</hi> are set very near to one another.</p>
                     <p>Now for that those who have only made their studies of <hi>Architecture</hi> but from simple
<hi>Profiles,</hi> may wonder to see here some of the Members extraordinarily distant from their
accustom'd proportion; I advertise them that it proceeds from an effect of the <hi>Optiques,</hi>
which never presents things precisely to the Eye, but diversifies them according to
the various aspects and distances from whence they are beheld; and the parts which
thence receive a more sensible alteration, are such of them whose <hi>superficies</hi> is most <hi>fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xuous</hi>
and <hi>circulary,</hi> as the <hi>Gula</hi> or <hi>Ogee</hi> which composes the <hi>Crown</hi> of the <hi>Cornice,</hi> which
being seen from beneath, and more advanc'd upon the <hi>Plan,</hi> receives a considerable
access of height: The same reason also makes the <hi>Column</hi> to diminish, as being set
further within the <hi>Plan</hi> then any of the rest of the Members.

                     <p>AFTER this <hi>Corinthian</hi> Example we are no more to expect any thing rich in
<hi>Architecture,</hi> but it belongs to the judicious onely to put it in practise, for the

such goodly remainders, and from whence this <hi>Profile</hi> had been taken notice of and

though I dare not affirm to have been precisely the same <hi>Profile</hi> with that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon's
Temple</hi> (the <hi>Model</hi> which I propose to my self) yet as near as one can approach

mention'd in that great work of <hi>Villalpandus</hi> where all the ornaments and principal
proportions of each member are exactly specified, I conceive it to be sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable.
The composition is perfectly <hi>Corinthian,</hi> though the <hi>foliage</hi> of the <hi>Capital</hi>
and its <hi>Cauliculi</hi> or branches are of <hi>Palmes,</hi> and the <hi>Freeze</hi> of the <hi>Entablature</hi> have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
the <hi>Dorique</hi> Ornament which are the <hi>Triglyphs</hi> whose solidity bears but little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity

this <hi>Order</hi> (notwithstanding that <hi>Iosephus</hi> affirms it to have been the <hi>Corinthian</hi>) certain
it is, there was never any more perfect: and although the <hi>Corinthian</hi> be a very soft and
<hi>maidenly Order,</hi> which does not require the strength and <hi>virility</hi> of the <hi>Dorique,</hi> symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd

and reason, as will not onely render it excusable, but very judicious: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
suppose one were to build <hi>Churches</hi> or <hi>Altars</hi> in memory of those generous
<hi>Virgins</hi> who from their tender age vanquish'd the cruelty of <hi>Tyrants</hi> for the defence
of <hi>Christianity,</hi> surmounting all sorts of Torments by their Constancy, What could we
imagine more expressive and sutable to their Courage then this divine <hi>Order?</hi> It
may also be proper on some profane occasions, as in <hi>Triumphal Arches</hi> and the like
Structures. In a Word, since it gave <hi>Ornament</hi> to that famous <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>

                     <p>MEthinks I see here a <hi>Giant</hi> next a <hi>Pigmy,</hi> so monstrous is the disproportion
'twixt these two <hi>Masters;</hi> and the reason of this so extraordinary inequality
proceeds from two Causes; Whereof the first is, that <hi>Serlio</hi> allows to the <hi>Entablature</hi> of
his <hi>Profile</hi> but a fifth part of the <hi>Column,</hi> whereas <hi>Vignola</hi> makes his own of an entire
quarter, and exceeds even that by some <hi>Minutes:</hi> The second is, That <hi>Serlio</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Vitruvius,</hi> makes the altitude of his <hi>Column</hi> but of nine <hi>Diameters,</hi> and <hi>Vignola</hi> gives
<hi>his</hi> ten, the same which I formerly observ'd in the <hi>Ionique Order,</hi> where we met the
very same inconvenience. But albeit the difference of these two <hi>Profiles</hi> be in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
very considerable; yet coming to the particulars, what we find in their <hi>Capitals</hi> is
of greater consequence, since we must of necessity condemn that of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
in his fourth <hi>Book</hi> towards the end of the first <hi>Chapter;</hi> there being no reason
to preferr it alone to a number almost innumerable of most excellent <hi>Models</hi> which
remain of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> amongst which we meet with none in the same terms to which he
has reduc'd the height of his own; unless it be that out of respect to this grave <hi>Author,</hi>
who is indeed worthy the reverence of all those of the <hi>Profession,</hi> and to avoid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious
name of <hi>Critique,</hi> we should choose a gentler way, which is to elude the <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi>
after their examples, who having already observ'd the same mistake before us
(either in effect or out of modesty) believ'd the <hi>Text</hi> to have been corrupted in this
place as well as in divers others where the alteration is manifest; so as assisting the
sense a little one may suppose that <hi>Vitruvius</hi> designing the height of the <hi>Corinthian
Chapter</hi> by the largeness of the <hi>Diameter</hi> of its <hi>Column,</hi> he should not have compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the <hi>Abacus,</hi> which is the sole ambiguity of this Passage, and which indeed
deserves correction, or to be otherwise understood then <hi>Serlio</hi> comprehends it.

                     <head type="sub">Daniel Barbaro, and P. Cataneo upon the
Corinthian Order.</head>
                     <p>OF all the four <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Architecture</hi> describ'd by <hi>Vitruvius</hi> (for he speaks not a
Word of the <hi>Composita</hi> which is the <hi>fifth</hi>) This of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> appears to me
to be the most slightly handled, considering the nobleness and magnificence of its <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors,</hi>
who having spar'd no cost to render it rich and excellent beyond all the rest,
were not likely to borrow any thing from those amongst whom they were ranked. I
conceive that <hi>Vitruvius</hi> therefore at the beginning of his fourth Book had no reason
to affirm, that they used to employ the <hi>Entablature</hi> and the <hi>Ionique,</hi> and sometimes
even the <hi>Dorique Column</hi> also, without any other addition save the <hi>Capital</hi> of their own
invention; since by the antient Examples of this <hi>Order</hi> we find the contrary: But
the <hi>R. Daniel Barbaro</hi> his <hi>Commentator</hi> whose design is before us, is by no means to be
blamed for it, whose province was onely to express the meaning of the <hi>Master</hi> whom
he explained, and of which he has very worthily acquitted himself.</p>
                     <p>He has therefore fitted an <hi>Ionique Entablature</hi> to this <hi>Corinthian Profile,</hi> forming the
<hi>Capital</hi> of <hi>Acanthus-leaves</hi> conformable to the description and history of its original
mention'd by <hi>Vitruvius.</hi> I would not for all this advise any <hi>Workman</hi> to make use of
this <hi>Composition;</hi> without first considering the relative proportion which the <hi>Entabla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
ought to have with the <hi>whole</hi> of the <hi>Order,</hi> a thing that I find is here extremly
changed and a great deal less then it should be, by reason of the considerable height
which the <hi>Column</hi> has received by that of the <hi>Corinthian Chapter,</hi> which is two thirds
higher then the <hi>Ionique;</hi> but this is remedied by enlarging the <hi>Freeze,</hi> and by adding
some new <hi>Moulding</hi> to the <hi>Cornice</hi> 'twixt the <hi>Corona</hi> and the <hi>Dentelli,</hi> as a quarter of a
Circle of so, to carve the <hi>Eggs</hi> and <hi>Ankers</hi> in.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Design</hi> of <hi>Cataneo</hi> has nothing in it remarkable, unless it be the extravagant
<hi>Projecture</hi> which he allows to the <hi>fillet</hi> of his <hi>Dentelli,</hi> as we also find it in the <hi>Design</hi> of
<hi>D. Barbaro:</hi> They have both in this followed that <hi>Maxim</hi> which regulates the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture</hi>
of every member to its height, but this rule is not alwayes to be received.</p>
                     <p>What I have said in the precedent Page touching the height of the <hi>Capital</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Vitruvius</hi> would here be superfluous to repeat: It may therefore serve both
for this, and for all the rest that follow being of the same <hi>Species.</hi>

Corinthian Order.</head>
                     <p>I Shall here need onely to examine the <hi>design</hi> of <hi>Alberti,</hi> That of his Companion
<hi>Viola</hi> being but an imitation, or rather a perfect <hi>Copy</hi> after the <hi>Profile</hi> of <hi>Palladio,</hi>
which we have seen already, and to which I referr the <hi>Reader</hi> as to its Original.</p>
                     <p>As touching that of <hi>L. B. Alberti,</hi> I find two remarkable particulars in his <hi>design</hi>
which seem worthy of reprehension: The first is the low proportion of the <hi>Capital,</hi>
which is onely pardonable in the followers of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> for we find no Example of it
amongst the <hi>Antients</hi> since even he himself imitates a Manner both greater and more
noble then the <hi>Vitruvian:</hi> The other observable is in his <hi>Cornice,</hi> to which he has
given no <hi>Corona</hi> though it be a member so essential and one of the principal in the
<hi>Entablature:</hi> But though this liberty be somewhat bold, and perhaps blame-worthy,
yet remains there one considerable Example at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the <hi>Cornice</hi> of that famous
<hi>Temple of Peace</hi> built by the Emperour <hi>Vespasian,</hi> being one of the greatest and most
superb <hi>Reliques</hi> of <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>face</hi> likewise of the <hi>Modilions</hi> seems to me of the largest, and besides that the
<hi>Foliage</hi> which domineers in the <hi>Freeze</hi> holds not sufficient conformity with the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
as too simple and plain for so rich an Ornament: But the remedy is at hand by
adding a few <hi>Leaves</hi> or other <hi>Carvings</hi> on the <hi>Cymatium's</hi> of the <hi>Cornice</hi> and <hi>Architrave,</hi>
with <hi>Eggs</hi> upon the quarter round; unless it be that you would rather save that work
by abating somewhat of the Ornament of the <hi>Freeze:</hi> There will yet remain this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
still in the <hi>design;</hi> That the <hi>Author</hi> resolving rather to fix upon the <hi>Capital</hi> of
<hi>Vitruvius</hi> then on those of the <hi>Antients,</hi> he ought not to have carv'd them with <hi>Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves;</hi>
since <hi>Vitruvius</hi> does expresly order them of the <hi>Acanthus.</hi>

                     <p>I Should do an injury to one of our prime <hi>French Architects Iohn Bullant</hi> by name,
if by the Examen of this <hi>Prefile</hi> I should rank him with those of the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius,</hi>
since he has after this given us others of a nobler form, which he has co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
from the <hi>Antients;</hi> but not finding him so perfectly exact in the measures which
he assigns them, I therefore omit 'em: He appears in this <hi>design</hi> to have imitated
<hi>Serlio,</hi> and indeed the difference between them is very inconsiderable: notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I observe something in this of more refin'd, as the <hi>Projecture</hi> of the <hi>Dentelli</hi> (or
rather of the plain <hi>fillet</hi> on which they should have been cut) which is extremely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
whereas <hi>Serlio</hi>'s is excessive, besides the impertinent repetition of a small <hi>Ogee,</hi>
which is thrice within the space of the <hi>Cornice</hi> onely, but which <hi>Iean Bullant</hi> has had
the discretion to diversifie: He also gives his <hi>Capital</hi> more grace, the leaves and
branches whereof are better shaped.</p>
                     <p>I could have wish'd for conclusion of our <hi>Corinthian Order,</hi> that <hi>De Lorme</hi> had left
us a more regular <hi>Design,</hi> and of a better relish: But the good man, though very stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and a lover of the <hi>Antique Architecture,</hi> had yet a modern <hi>Genius,</hi> which made
him look upon those excellent things of <hi>Rome</hi> as it were with <hi>Gothique Eyes;</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
plainly in this <hi>Profile,</hi> which he pretends to be conformable to those of the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels</hi>
of the <hi>Rotunda.</hi> For the rest, his <hi>style</hi> is so exceedingly perplex'd, that it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
very difficult to comprechend his meaning: The <hi>Reader</hi> will smile to see how
he explains himself on the subject of this <hi>Cornice</hi> ('tis in the fourth <hi>Chapter</hi> of his sixth
<hi>Book</hi>) For having cited all the measures of each part, piece by piece, he sayes, that
as to the height of the <hi>Architrave,</hi> he had divided it into three and forty parts and an
half, to give every thing its proportion, but that not falling out as it ought, hes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d
to speak no more of it; and these are his very <hi>termes:</hi> As to the <hi>Base</hi> of this
<hi>Profile,</hi> I have taken it from the end of the second <hi>Chapter</hi> of the same <hi>Book:</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
its proportion be very extraordinary, he affirms yet to have design'd and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
it from certain <hi>Vestigia's</hi> very <hi>antique</hi> (these are again his own expressions:)
You may likewise take notice that the stalks or <hi>Cauliculi</hi> under the <hi>roses</hi> of the <hi>Abacus</hi>
rise too high in this <hi>Capital:</hi> In summ, the Talent of this <hi>Architect,</hi> who has for all
this acquir'd a great deal of reputation, consisted chiefly in the contriving and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
of a <hi>Building;</hi> And intruth his chief perfection lay more in the art of <hi>squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
stones</hi> then in the <hi>Composition</hi> of <hi>Orders;</hi> and of this he has indeed written with
most advantage and at large: But since him, and that very lately, the <hi>Sieur Desargues</hi>
of <hi>Lyens</hi> one of the most exquisite and subtile <hi>Geometricians</hi> of this Age, whose <hi>Genius</hi>
delights to render familiar and useful the most excellent <hi>speculations</hi> of that <hi>Science,</hi>
has exalted that <hi>Art</hi> to a much higher perfection.

to this noble and perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Art</hi> which I have still been proposing to
him in my fixd discourse before every <hi>Order</hi> by the like <hi>Examples;</hi> upon which, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that the <hi>Design</hi> which I here propose is too little for the precisely measuring of each

nothing fine, but what is fill'd and surcharged with all sorts of <hi>Ornaments,</hi> without

with two or three accumulations of <hi>Mouldings</hi> in the <hi>Cornice</hi> to break the Order and
exact evenness of the <hi>Members,</hi> whose regularity is anxious to them: One <hi>Fronton</hi>
would be likewise too few for them, they add frequently <hi>two</hi> and sometimes <hi>three,</hi> and
that one within the other; nor do they think it fine unless it be <hi>broken, carv'd</hi> and <hi>frett</hi>

at the general inadvertency of so many <hi>Authors,</hi> as treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

have so dispos'd of them as plainly discovers how ignorant they

which it is so very difficult to make use of them judiciously.</p>
                     <p>I had already hinted something in the <hi>Preface</hi> of the First Part of this <hi>Treatise,</hi> to
prepare the <hi>Reader</hi> for the new <hi>Order</hi> which I am here observing; but which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the vulgar Opinion and current <hi>Practice</hi> will have much ado to establish it
self, and doubtless provoke many Adversaries. But since the foundations of this <hi>Art</hi>
are principally fixt upon such <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>Antiquity</hi> as are yet remaining, I hope,
that in time my opinion may prevail, seeing I tread but upon their footsteps, and
rather <hi>demonstrate</hi> the thing then <hi>discourse</hi> of it.</p>

                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:53015:56"/>Hitherto all our <hi>Architects</hi> have generally held that the <hi>Tuscan Order</hi> was a kind
of <hi>Building</hi> which differ'd from the others but in the plainness of its <hi>Mouldings,</hi> and
solidity of its parts; but in the rest, consisting of the same <hi>Members,</hi> and of like
usage: And truly I should be injurious to condemn it, since <hi>Vitruvius</hi> has in his
fourth <hi>Book</hi> made a particular <hi>Chapter</hi> of the manner how to build <hi>Temples</hi> after the
<hi>Tuscan Order.</hi> Notwithstanding, however one might interpret what he there sayes,
it will be found very difficult to invent an handsome <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Entablature</hi> fit to
place upon those <hi>Columns:</hi> And therefore I conceive that the onely piece of this
<hi>Order</hi> which deserves to be put in work, and that can properly recommend it to
us, is the simple <hi>Column</hi> it self without any <hi>Architrave</hi> at all, as we find it employ'd by
the <hi>Antients:</hi> For whereas by the ordinary usage of it, 'tis ever rang'd in the last place,
These great <hi>Masters</hi> have assign'd it <hi>one</hi> wholly independent from the others, and
treated it so advantageously, that it may for its beauty and nobleness stand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with all the rest of the <hi>Orders:</hi> Nor will this I presume be denyed, when
they shall well have considered that renowned <hi>Example</hi> which I am producing of the
<hi>Column</hi> of <hi>Trajan,</hi> one of the most superb remainders of the <hi>Roman</hi> magnificence to
be now seen standing, and which has more immortaliz'd the Emperiour <hi>Trajan</hi> then
all the <hi>Penns</hi> of <hi>Historians.</hi> This <hi>Mausoleum,</hi> if so we may call it, was erected to him
by the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in recognition of those great Services he had rendred
the <hi>Countrey;</hi> and to the end the memory of it might remain to all succeeding Ages,
and continue as long as the very <hi>Empire</hi> it self, they order'd them to be engraven on
<hi>Marble,</hi> and that by the richest touch that was ever yet employ'd. It was <hi>Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
her self which was here the <hi>Historiograph</hi> of this new kind of <hi>History,</hi> and who since
it was to celebrate a <hi>Roman,</hi> chose none of the <hi>Greek Orders,</hi> (though they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably

present so <hi>ruinous</hi> and <hi>dilapidated,</hi> that its hard even to divine what their original
forms were; whiles yet this <hi>Column</hi> of <hi>Trajan</hi> (whose Structure seemed much less
durable) remains extant and entire, by a secret of <hi>Providence</hi> which has destin'd this stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
<hi>Obelisk</hi> to the greatest <hi>Monarch</hi> that ever <hi>Rome</hi> enjoy'd, the <hi>Chief</hi> of the <hi>Church
St. Peter,</hi> who possesses now the <hi>Seat</hi> of that <hi>Emperour</hi> to whom it had been erected.
But to preserve my self within the limits of my subject, which is onely to give you
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53015:56"/>
its description according to the <hi>design</hi> of the <hi>Architect</hi> who was the <hi>Author</hi> of it, I shall
leave to such as are contemplative the <hi>moralizing</hi> on this so wonderful <hi>Vicissitude;</hi> since
it would be here from our purpose, and very impertinent to the <hi>Art</hi> we are illustrating.</p>
                     <p>Let us then again return to our <hi>Column,</hi> and its singular use among all the <hi>Orders</hi> of
<hi>Architecture,</hi> where the rest of the <hi>Pillars</hi> do in comparison to <hi>this</hi> appear but as so
many <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Slaves</hi> of the <hi>Edifices</hi> which they support, whiles ours is a <hi>Queen</hi> of
that <hi>Majesty,</hi> that reigning as it were alone she is exalted on the Throne of her <hi>Piedestal</hi>
deck'd with all the treasures of glory, and from whence she as freely imparts her mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
to all those whom she vouchsafes to look upon: The first and most illustrious
of her Favourites was <hi>Trajan,</hi> upon whose <hi>Monument</hi> I am now forming an <hi>Idea</hi> of the
<hi>Order</hi> which I would call <hi>Tuscan,</hi> without troubling my self with what all the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns</hi>
have written of it, who making no difference 'twixt <hi>it</hi> and the <hi>Rustique</hi> do no great
honour to the <hi>Tuscan</hi> while they gratifie him with so poor an Invention: But lest our
<hi>Criticks</hi> take it ill we should name <hi>that</hi> a <hi>Tuscan Order</hi> which had its first Original in
<hi>Rome,</hi> let them if they please call it the <hi>Roman Order;</hi> since they may with much
more reason do it then those who so name the <hi>Composita</hi> of which we shall speak
hereafter. For my part I regulate my self upon the <hi>Profiles</hi> of the <hi>Capital</hi> and <hi>Base,</hi>
which I here find to be the same <hi>Vitruvius</hi> attributes to the <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>scan Column:</hi> The most
important difficulty in my opinion would be how our <hi>Column</hi> having no <hi>Entablature,</hi>
could be properly reckon'd in the Catalogue of <hi>Orders, that</hi> being so principal a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
and in some degree the very <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Order.</hi> But the <hi>Architect</hi> of this our
<hi>Model</hi> well foresaw that something was to be substituted in its place, and <hi>so</hi> contriv'd
it after a most excellent manner: He propos'd doubtless to himself the imitation of
those miraculous <hi>Memphitic Pyramides</hi> which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (those divine Wits to whom
we are so much oblig'd for many excellent Arts) had formerly erected to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
and <hi>Ashes</hi> of their <hi>Kings,</hi> who from the immense and prodigious greatness
of their <hi>Tombs</hi> one would believe had been <hi>Giants,</hi> and as it were <hi>Gods</hi> amongst <hi>Men:</hi>
Their <hi>Vrns</hi> and <hi>Statues</hi> crowned the <hi>summities</hi> of these artificial <hi>Mountains,</hi> from
whence, as from some august and terrible <hi>Throne,</hi> they seemed to the people reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after their death, and that with more Majesty then when they liv'd: Our pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>Architect</hi> being to render the same honour to <hi>Trajan,</hi> the worthiest <hi>Prince</hi> that
till then had born the Title of <hi>Emperour,</hi> and whom the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did strive to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalize,
reflected seriously upon these stupendious Works, whence he drew this
high and sublime imitation which we so admire, and which has since become a <hi>Rule,</hi>
and been follow'd on sundry other occasions: Two most renowned <hi>Example</hi> of this
are yet remaining; The <hi>Column</hi> of <hi>Antoninus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> also, and that of <hi>Constantinople</hi>
erected to the <hi>Emperor Theodosius</hi> after his <hi>Victory</hi> against the <hi>Scythians;</hi> which suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
testifie by their resemblance to that of our <hi>Trajan,</hi> that this kind of <hi>Architecture</hi>
pass'd currently for an <hi>Order</hi> amongst the <hi>Masters</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> seeing they always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
it ever since upon the same occasions, together with <hi>Tuscan Profilures</hi> both at
the <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Capital:</hi> This established, the rest will easily follow, so as not to subject
it henceforward to the opinion and diversity of the <hi>Gus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

since we have the <hi>Original</hi> for our <hi>Model</hi> to which we ought of necessity conform
lest we transgress the terms and regularity of the <hi>Order:</hi> Now suppose an <hi>Architect</hi>
be on some occasion obliged to introduce, or change any thing in it, as the time and
the quality of his design may require; he is yet to proceed with extraordinary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection,
and without in the least altering the <hi>form</hi> of the principal <hi>Members;</hi> in
which one shall perceive the address of his spirit, and the gallantry of his invention:
This is a <hi>Maxim</hi> so universal through all the <hi>Orders,</hi> that without it one should never
pretend to give Rules, nor propose indeed any Example for imitation; so naturally
obnoxious are our inclinations to novelty, and so blind in our own Productions: See
then from what sourse the confusion of that <hi>Order</hi> sprung which they name the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posita,</hi>
and which the presumption and ignorance of <hi>Workmen</hi> has begotten like an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
<hi>Monster</hi> blended with so many natures, and sometimes so averse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
that tis impossible to distinguish their <hi>Species:</hi> I have reserved their full <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
for the conclusion of this <hi>Treatise,</hi> where I shall make choice of what I meet with
of most conformity to the rules of <hi>Art</hi> and of good <hi>Architecture,</hi> and where I shall
produce some of the most famous <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that at least men may have
faithful Guides through this <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of Confusion.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trajan Column</hi> which we here substitute in stead of the <hi>Tuscan Order,</hi> by the
Prerogative of its excellent composition has this advantage above the other <hi>Orders,</hi>
that there seldom happning occasions worthy of it; that is to say, such as are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and noble enough to merit the putting it in practice; Our <hi>small Masters</hi> inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of so high an imployment, have spoken nothing of it, and by this means she has
remained in her original purity: But the first which was ever made in imitation of it,
and that has exceedingly confirm'd the establishment of this new <hi>Order,</hi> was the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn</hi>
of <hi>Antoninus</hi> which is yet very entire, and the onely <hi>Paragon</hi> to ours, though it
concede somewhat to it in the execution and <hi>magisterial</hi> handling; but in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of this it surpasses it in the greatness of its <hi>Mass,</hi> a thing very considerable in
this <hi>Order,</hi> whose <hi>specifique</hi> beauty consists in being vast, and of a manner <hi>Colossale:</hi>
for the rest, the <hi>Composition</hi> and <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the whole design are very alike.</p>
                     <p>I will now shew in general the effect and form of the principal members, and of
what one ought to be careful in the application of <hi>Ornaments,</hi> which are to be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with great discretion, as being of the very <hi>Essence</hi> and body of the <hi>Order:</hi> The first,
and as it were the foundation of the whole Structure is the <hi>Piedestal,</hi> which is here no
less necessary then is the <hi>Cornice</hi> to the <hi>Columns</hi> of the other <hi>Orders;</hi> and its proportion
though square and solid requires an enrichment of handsome <hi>Modenatures,</hi> and of all
other sorts of ornaments at the <hi>Plinth</hi> and <hi>Cymatium,</hi> but above all in its four <hi>faces,</hi>
which are as it were the <hi>Tables</hi> of <hi>Renown</hi> where she paints the <hi>Victories</hi> of those <hi>Heroes</hi> to
whom she erects such glorious <hi>Trophies:</hi> It is <hi>there</hi> that we behold all the <hi>Military
Spoils</hi> of the vanquish'd, their <hi>Arms,</hi> the <hi>Machins</hi> they made use of in fight, their <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
Shields, Cy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>neterrs,</hi> the <hi>harness</hi> of their <hi>Horses</hi> and of their <hi>Chariots,;</hi> their <hi>Habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of <hi>Warr,</hi> the marks of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and in a word what ever could contribute
to the pomp and magnificence of a <hi>Triumph:</hi> Upon this glorious <hi>Booty</hi> our <hi>Column</hi>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:53015:57"/>
as on a <hi>Throne</hi> is erected and revested with the most rich and splendid Apparel which
<hi>Art</hi> can invent; and indeed provided the <hi>Architect</hi> be a judicious person it cannot be
too glorious: I repeat it again that this ought in no sort to alter or in the least confound
the <hi>Proportions</hi> and <hi>Tuscan</hi> Profiles of the <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Capital,</hi> as being the very keys of
the Consort and harmony of the whole <hi>Order.</hi> The last but principal thing, because
is sets the <hi>Crown</hi> upon the whole Work, is the <hi>Statue</hi> of the <hi>Person</hi> to whom we erect
this superb and magnificent Structure; This hath an <hi>Vrn</hi> under his feet, as intimating
a <hi>renascency</hi> from his own <hi>Ashes</hi> like the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> and that the <hi>Vertue</hi> of great men tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
over <hi>Destiny</hi> which has power onely over the vulgar.</p>
                     <p>As to what concerns the regular <hi>Proportion</hi> of this <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Vrn</hi> with the alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the <hi>Column,</hi> I can here conclude nothing precisely, this part being repair'd in
the <hi>Original,</hi> and that in a manner too modern and wide of the first intention of the
<hi>Architect</hi> to derive any advantage thence for our subject. It may yet be said with
likelihood enough, that since 'tis as 'twere the <hi>Entablature</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> one should
allow it a fourth part of the <hi>Column</hi> as to the <hi>Trabeation</hi> of the <hi>Dorique Order</hi> to which
this bears a very great resemblance: I conceive also that the <hi>Figure</hi> ought so to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
by the rules of the <hi>Optiques,</hi> that it may appear of a size somewhat exceeding
the <hi>Natural,</hi> and of an elegant <hi>Symmetry,</hi> that so it may be taken notice of above all the
rest; but with this discretion yet, that being of necessity to stand on its feet, it appear
of a firm position, and that the <hi>mass</hi> of the <hi>Vrn</hi> which serves it for <hi>Piedestal</hi> have a
solidness agreeable to this effect: For 'tis a thing greatly obliging in <hi>Architecture,</hi> to
make every thing not only <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>durable,</hi> but that it likewise so appear and thereby
avoid that <hi>Gotique</hi> indecorum which affects it as a beauty, the making of their works
seem as 'twere hanging in the <hi>air</hi> and ready to fall upon ones head, which is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance
too visible for us to spend any time in confuting.</p>
                     <p>By this time I think I have left nothing unsaid which concerns the general <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
of our <hi>Column;</hi> As for the lesser retail of the <hi>Proportions</hi> and <hi>Profiles</hi> of each
<hi>Member,</hi> the <hi>Design</hi> shews them so perspicuously that 'twere but a childish and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
labour to name them over by the piece, as those first Inventors of <hi>Painting</hi>
did, who to supply the weakness of the <hi>Art,</hi> not yet arriv'd to so natural a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of the things they imitated, were forc'd to write under them, This is an
<hi>Ox,</hi> a <hi>Tree,</hi> a <hi>Horse,</hi> and a <hi>Mountain:</hi> There will be no need of this here, the effect
of the <hi>Design</hi> having so far exceeded the expression of all words, that it shews us more
things in an instant, and that with infinite more preciseness, then could have been
described by discourse in a very long time. I will therefore conclude by this rare kind
of <hi>Language</hi> which has neither need of <hi>Ears</hi> nor of <hi>Tongue,</hi> and which is indeed the
most divine <hi>Invention</hi> that was ever yet found out by man.</p>
                     <p>For the rest, you will in my <hi>Profile</hi> of the <hi>Trajan Column</hi> perceive with what
diligence and exactitude all these things conform to the Original, even to the
very least Ornaments, and thereby judge how exceedingly careful I have been in
other things of greater consequence. If the <hi>Reader</hi> be intelligent, and that he
have attentively view'd and with a Masterly Eye this rich and incomparable <hi>Piece</hi>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:53015:58"/>
which I describe, the satisfaction he will derive from the accurate Observations
I have made and here present him will be proportioned to his ability: For in these
particulars our eyes do see no further then our understanding purges them, nor do
their admirable beauties reveal themselves at once, nor to all the World in general;
They will be curiously observed and discovered with Industry: There are likewise
several <hi>kinds</hi> which every one considers according to the force of his Wit, and as they
conform to his <hi>Genius:</hi> Some there are who seek onely the grace and neatness of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments;</hi>
Others consider the nobleness of the <hi>Work</hi> and novelty of the <hi>Invention;</hi> The
most knowing having regard to the <hi>Proportions</hi> chiefly, and the regularity of the <hi>Whole</hi>
with its <hi>Parts,</hi> to the judicious Composition, the <hi>greatness</hi> and <hi>solidity</hi> of the <hi>Design,</hi>
and such essential beauties as are onely visible to the eyes of the most intelligent <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects;</hi>
from whence it often falls out, that the same <hi>Work</hi> in which all these parts are
not equally perfect, is very variously esteemed by those of the <hi>Profession</hi> (for there are
but few like this of ours so qualified as to merit an universal approbation,) and the
misery of it is, that the <hi>best things</hi> have for the most part many fewer <hi>Admirers</hi> then
the <hi>indifferent,</hi> because there are more <hi>Dunces</hi> then <hi>able Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Modul of the following <hi>Design,</hi> and the Method of <hi>deciphering</hi> it is the same
with what went before; <hi>viz.</hi> That passing a <hi>Perpendicular</hi> through the <hi>Center</hi> of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn</hi>
the whole height of the <hi>Order,</hi> I divide the <hi>Semidiameter</hi> of the <hi>Pillar</hi> at the
foot in thirty <hi>Minutes</hi> which compose the <hi>Modul</hi> upon which afterward I regulate all
the <hi>Members</hi> as well for their <hi>height</hi> as <hi>sailings</hi> over and <hi>projectures</hi> of their <hi>Profiles,</hi> still
beginning by this <hi>Central</hi> line of the <hi>Column,</hi> that so the position of each individual
part be exactly adjusted and precisely in its place. This is so perspicuous, and has
been so oft repeated, that there can remain no possible difticulty.</p>
                     <p>As to what now concerns the whole <hi>Mass,</hi> the <hi>Column</hi> contains seventeen <hi>Moduls,</hi>
comprehending the <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Capital.</hi> The <hi>Pidestal</hi> with its entire <hi>Bassament, Cymatium,</hi>
and that <hi>Zocolo</hi> or <hi>Plinth</hi> above wrought with a <hi>festoon</hi> (which in my judgment makes
a part of it, as rendring it a perfect <hi>Cube,</hi> of all <hi>Geometrical</hi> proportions the most
regular and solid and consequently most agreeable to this Structure) has in height
three <hi>Moduls,</hi> a very little less: The <hi>Base</hi> of the <hi>Column</hi> contains precisely one, and
the <hi>Capital</hi> two thirds of a <hi>Modul.</hi>

                     <p>HAving declar'd my opinion touching the use and form of the <hi>Tuscan Order</hi> after
the manner of the <hi>Antients;</hi> I will now describe to you after what fashion our
<hi>Modern Masters</hi> have handled it, and in what reputation it is at present amongst all
our <hi>Workmen,</hi> who in regard of the meanness of so poor a <hi>Composition</hi> surname it the
<hi>Rustique Order,</hi> and that with reason, there being so little probability that the <hi>Tuscans</hi>
would ever own or acknowledge it in so wretched a condition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Andrew Palladio,</hi> of all the <hi>Moderns</hi> the most judicious, and to whom in this <hi>Collection</hi>
we have assign'd the most eminent place, presents us with two <hi>Profiles;</hi> One whereof
is so plain, that it has onely a <hi>Summer</hi> of <hi>Timber</hi> covered with another piece in stead of
a <hi>Coping</hi> and <hi>Corona</hi> for the <hi>Entablature</hi> of the <hi>Column;</hi> and I conceive he imagined
it should have no other from what <hi>Vitruvius</hi> has written of it. But finding this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
too meanly handled to merit the honour of an <hi>Order,</hi> this industrious <hi>Architect</hi>
went and search'd amongst the old reliques of <hi>Amphitheaters,</hi> which are those enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
masses of <hi>Architecture</hi> where the solidity of the building was more requisite then
the spruceness and curiosity of the <hi>Orders;</hi> till in fine he discover'd in the <hi>Arena's</hi>
of <hi>Verona,</hi> that of <hi>Polo,</hi> and other places, a certain <hi>Order</hi> which he conceived one
might call the <hi>Tuscan,</hi> in imitation whereof he composed <hi>this:</hi> For he did not tye
himself precisely to follow <hi>one</hi> rather then another; but from <hi>many</hi> he form'd and
ordain'd <hi>this,</hi> which I have rather chosen then any of the other <hi>Masters.</hi> That of his
Companion <hi>Scamozzi</hi> might pass tolerably well had he not assign'd him a too great
conformity with the <hi>Dorique,</hi> and so much as once mention'd where he had seen any
like it; so as being altogether <hi>Modern,</hi> and neer as rich in <hi>Mouldings</hi> as the <hi>Dorique</hi> it
self, it were much better to make use of the <hi>Antique;</hi> this being in nothing conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for a building but for its cheapness and the saving of time.</p>
                     <p>The height of the <hi>Column</hi> with its <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Capital</hi> is of seven <hi>Diameters</hi> only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Palladio: Scamozzi</hi> allows to <hi>his</hi> seven and an half.</p>

in quest of this <hi>Order</hi> after other <hi>Architects</hi> besides those <hi>four</hi> whose <hi>Designs</hi> I
have lately produc'd: I am therefore resolv'd to proceed no farther; considering
withall, that those who remain, are (for the most part) of <hi>Vitruvius's</hi> School, from
whence it is exceedingly difficult to collect any thing more essential to the <hi>Tuscan Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
then the meer simple form of the <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Capital</hi> which are already describ'd

what concerns the <hi>Entablature,</hi> since there remains extant no antient, well-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
and positive <hi>Example,</hi> nor indeed so much as any intelligible description of
it in the writings of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> I shall make no great reckoning of their <hi>Inventions.</hi>
I have likewise observ'd, that <hi>Leon Baptista Alberti</hi> (the very best of those which
remain after <hi>Daniel Barbaro</hi>) has spoken of it but cursorily onely, as in truth making
no account of it, and without giving us so much as a <hi>Profile.</hi> As little does he
esteem of the <hi>Composita,</hi> of which <hi>Vitruvius</hi> too has been altogether silent.

                     <head type="sub">Of the Compounded Order.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Compounded Order</hi> which has hitherto obtain'd the first rank amongst the
<hi>Moderns,</hi> will find it self extremely debas'd in this severe and exact review which
I have made upon the five <hi>Orders;</hi> and where (without at all regarding the opinion
of the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and the judgment of others that have written before me) I value no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
unless it be conformable to some famous and antient <hi>Example,</hi> or to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> that <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Architects;</hi> that so (if possible) I may at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish
the <hi>Art</hi> on its genuine <hi>Principles,</hi> and original purity from whence those li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
<hi>Compositions</hi> of our late <hi>Workmen</hi> have so exceedingly perverted it (under the
pretext, forsooth, of this <hi>fain'd</hi> Name of the <hi>Compounded Order</hi>) that there hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
so much as the least <hi>Idea</hi> of regular <hi>Architecture</hi> in it, so strangely have those
<hi>Orders</hi> which contributed to it degenerated into confusion, becoming even <hi>barbarous</hi>
themselves by this their extravagant mixture. But as 'tis a thing very difficult to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
and reduce some spirits to their devoire when once they have taken a bent and
are abandon'd to <hi>libertinism;</hi> so nor do I pretend to gain any <hi>Disciples,</hi> or be so much
as heard by those who have thus presumptuously taken upon them to be <hi>Masters,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are either grown too old in their deprav'd <hi>gusto,</hi> or ashamed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their mistake; resolving rather to perish in their <hi>opinion</hi> by obstinately defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it, then be so ingenuous as to reform it. I address my discourse then to those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
onely, who having not as yet their imaginations preposses'd preserve their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more entire, and are better dispos'd to discern those charming beauties and
originals of the Antient <hi>Architecture,</hi> acknowledg'd for so many <hi>Ages,</hi> confirm'd by
such a multitude of <hi>Examples</hi> and so universally admired. Now for as much then
as it is a thing of main importance that we season our young spirits with an early tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
and begin betimes to settle in them these <hi>Idea's,</hi> I do ever at first propose to
them the same <hi>Models</hi> that have been left us by those great <hi>Genius's,</hi> as so many <hi>Pilots</hi> and
<hi>Compasses</hi> steering the direct <hi>Course</hi> to the <hi>Art,</hi> and saving them from that propension
which they naturally have to <hi>novelty,</hi> the very <hi>rock</hi> and <hi>precipice</hi> of the first inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>French,</hi> which being once over-pass'd, reason does then begin to take the
<hi>helm,</hi> to conduct and let them see <hi>Things</hi> such as they ought to be, that is to say, in
their <hi>Principles,</hi> without which it will be altogether impossible to acquire more then a
very ordinary and superficial comprehension of them; and those who travel by any
other path grope like blind men in the dark, and walk insecurely, without ever find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any real satisfaction in their <hi>Work:</hi> For the vain complacence of ignorant men,
be it that they take it from themselves (as commonly they do) or that it be deriv'd
to them from such as are like them, 'tis so empty and false a joy as it oftentimes turns
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53015:62"/>
to shame and confusion; whiles the true and solid praise which is attributed to the
merit of knowing <hi>Masters,</hi> and the excellency of their <hi>Workmanship,</hi> is never obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to this self-deception. Now how little soever it be a man possesses of the <hi>Idea</hi> of
this high <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Antients</hi> and the greatness of their thoughts, he shall soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the meanness and impertinency of our <hi>Modern Compositions,</hi> when in the midst of so
many <hi>Examples</hi> of the incomparable and onely <hi>Architecture</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which was the
ornament and splendour of the Antient <hi>Rome</hi> (whose very <hi>Ruines</hi> and <hi>Vestigia's</hi> render
her yet <hi>august</hi> above all the <hi>Cities</hi> of the <hi>World</hi>) these wretched and trifling spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent
in the midst of so great abundance, depart from the right way which these great
<hi>Masters</hi> have opened to them, taking a devious path to pursue an abortive of <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture,</hi>
or the evil <hi>Genius</hi> of the Art rather, which has introduc'd it self amongst the
<hi>Order</hi> under the Title of <hi>Composita,</hi> the favour of mens ignorance, and the indiscrect
presumption of I know not what pittiful new <hi>Architects,</hi> who have made it their <hi>Fools<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauble,</hi>

would be altogether labour in vain, an idle and folish enterprise for us to search
after it <hi>here</hi> through all its wild and unlimited extent, since it has neither <hi>Rules</hi> nor
<hi>Measures, Principles, Species,</hi> nor particular <hi>Propriety,</hi> and so by consequence not to be
comprehended under the name of an <hi>Order.</hi> It would in truth (in my opinion) be
necessary for the good of the <hi>Art,</hi> and the reputation of <hi>Architecture,</hi> that this <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
were altogether smother'd, and that some more pertinent and <hi>specifique</hi> name were
given to those excellent <hi>Profiles</hi> which we encounter amongst some <hi>Antiquities</hi> of the
<hi>grand Design</hi> which (from I know not what <hi>Tradition</hi>) are called of the <hi>Compounded Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi>
a Name altogether novel, not so much as once mentioned by <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> and
which is in earnest too general and uncertain to sute with a regular <hi>Order:</hi> and that
since they referr the glory of its invention to the <hi>Romans,</hi> it were much more proper
to call it the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Latine Order,</hi> as <hi>Scamozzi</hi> has judiciously enough done, and
moreover observ'd, that its <hi>Capital</hi> (by which alone it differs fome the <hi>Corinthian</hi>)
is of a more massy and less elegant <hi>Composition,</hi> whence he conceives this <hi>Order</hi> should
not be plac'd upon the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> left the weak be burthened with the stronger: to
which he might also add, that they can never consist well in the same work together, as
I have elsewhere demonstrated, and this is so perspicuous that it admits of no possible
extenuation: however those who would take advantage of this evil practice and abuse
of the <hi>Moderns</hi> to do the contrary, might have a way to escape by this <hi>Asinine-bridge:</hi>
For the importance is very inconsiderable in comparision to that unbridl'd licence
which now-a-days reigns amongst our <hi>Compositers</hi> of the <hi>Composita,</hi> who not onely
change the rank of the <hi>Orders,</hi> but reverse and overturn even all their <hi>Principles,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
the foundations of true <hi>Architecture</hi> to introduce a new <hi>Tramontance</hi> more
barbarous and unsightly then even the <hi>Gothique</hi> it self. But to all this let us reply
(in confusion of its <hi>Inventors</hi>) That an <hi>Architect</hi> should no more employ his industry
and study in finding out new <hi>Orders,</hi> to set a value upon his <hi>Works,</hi> and render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
an able man; then should an <hi>Orator,</hi> to acquire the reputation of being <hi>Eloquent,</hi>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:53015:62"/>
invent and mint new <hi>Words</hi> that were never yet spoken; or a <hi>Poet</hi> compose Verse of
another <hi>cadence</hi> and measure then what are prescrib'd and are in use; this affectation
being altogether <hi>puerile</hi> and impertinent: Or, admit one would upon some occasion
take any such liberty, it ought to be with that discretion, and <hi>so</hi> to the purpose, that the
reason thereof should to any one appear immediately: Thus it was the <hi>Antients</hi> made
use of it, but with so great <hi>caution,</hi> as that they have confin'd their entire licence to the
sole form of the <hi>Capital,</hi> of which they have devised an hundred gentile <hi>Compositions,</hi> and
to some subjects <hi>peculiar,</hi> where they succeeded incomparably, and out of whose <hi>limits</hi>
one cannot (without manifest impertinency) employ it in any work whatsoever. I
will therefore choose two or three <hi>Examples</hi> amongst a good number of <hi>Designs</hi> which
lye by me of that most famous <hi>Pyrro Ligorio,</hi> found out and observ'd by him in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places of <hi>Italy</hi> with a diligence inestimable. But let us first conclude our prime
<hi>Subject,</hi> which is to form the <hi>Roman Composita,</hi> and make of it here as regular and
precise an <hi>Order,</hi> as any of the former <hi>Four.</hi> I propose (for this effect) two antique
<hi>Profiles,</hi> both of them excellent in their kinds; <hi>one</hi> very rich and full of ornament
taken from the <hi>Arch</hi> of <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> much plainer indeed, but great
and proud, being <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Arco de Leoni</hi> at <hi>Verona.</hi>

                     <p>BEfore I propose this <hi>Composita</hi> for <hi>Model,</hi> I shall first endeavour to prevent
and elude certain Objections which our <hi>Critiques</hi> may possibly raise, lest they
impute it to my inadvertency should I pass them by in silence. The first is, That
the <hi>Cornice</hi> is defective, for want of the <hi>Corona:</hi> The other is the naked placing of
the <hi>Dentelli,</hi> without any separation on the <hi>Freeze:</hi> Thirdly, the excessive height
of the <hi>Freeze:</hi> And lastly, that the three <hi>Faces</hi> of the <hi>Architrave</hi> are all <hi>inverted</hi>
from the ordinary position: And finally, that the <hi>Plinth</hi> of the <hi>Base</hi> is a great
deal too high being compared with the rest. To all these <hi>Objections</hi> I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
in a word, that in a business of <hi>Architecture</hi> the reason is allowable since I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an antique Example, universally approv'd and such as this is: Besides I add,
that the very name of <hi>Compounded</hi> seems to inferr a kind of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an <hi>Architect</hi> might sometime justly be permitted to take it, as occasion may sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,
either by introducing into the <hi>Order</hi> or retrenching from it what he thinks most
conducible and proper to his <hi>Design;</hi> provided it be discreetly manag'd, as it has
been judiciously observ'd in this <hi>Profile,</hi> where the <hi>Author</hi> being to make an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
large <hi>Freeze</hi> for the more commodious placing of many <hi>Figures</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernd
his subject, would spare from the <hi>Cornice</hi> what he had usurped of more then
the regular proportion of the <hi>Freeze</hi> did permit him. To this purpose it was he cut
off and abated the <hi>Corona,</hi> though in truth a considerable Member, but which is
yet (as far as I can collect from other Instances) not absolutely necessary; since in
the <hi>Temple of Peace</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> (one of the most stupendious works of <hi>Antiquity</hi>) the
<hi>Cornice</hi> though <hi>Corinthian</hi> has no <hi>Corona</hi> at all notwithstanding that the <hi>Architect</hi> had
the field so open before him. And <hi>L. Baptista Alberti</hi> (whose authority is greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
amongst our modern Masters) without other reason for it then that of his own
<hi>gusto,</hi> has given none to his <hi>Corinthian Order.</hi> Now as concerning the <hi>Compartiment</hi>
of the <hi>Swaths</hi> and <hi>Fascie</hi> of the <hi>Architrave,</hi> whose position here seems somewhat prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous,
'tis (to speak seriously) a little extraordinary, however I well remember to
have seen others which were like it, and <hi>Palladio</hi> produces us one <hi>Example</hi> of it
towards the end of his fourth <hi>Book</hi> taken from a <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Polo</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> of the
<hi>Corinthian Order,</hi> the <hi>Architecture</hi> whereof is exceedingly rare and antique; and there
I also find that the <hi>Base</hi> of the <hi>Column</hi> hath a <hi>Plinth</hi> likewife of an excessive thickness,
as indeed ours has, which supplied the place of a <hi>Zocolo.</hi> Thus you have both <hi>reason</hi>
and <hi>example</hi> sufficient for the answer of every objection. But from hence one may also
judge, that this <hi>Profile</hi> should not be employ'd in work without extraordinary discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and indeed some kind of necessity. That which I shall produce in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
instance is more regular to particulars, and by consequent more agreeable to all
forts of <hi>Works:</hi> But the general <hi>Proportion</hi> both of the one and other is sufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.
The <hi>Column</hi> it self has ten <hi>Diameters,</hi> and the altitude of the <hi>Entablature</hi> amounts

                     <p>THE incomparable <hi>Idea</hi> of this <hi>Composita,</hi> and the richness of its <hi>Ornaments</hi> makes
me conjecture that the <hi>Inventor</hi> thereof might possibly accompany <hi>Titus</hi> at the
<hi>expedition</hi> and <hi>siege</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and that it was <hi>there</hi> he had contemplated the divine

(though in a very slender
<hi>Copy,</hi> compar'd to that miraculous <hi>Edifice,</hi> and especially in a different <hi>Order</hi>) he
would shew how studiously he had consider'd it. This conjecture of mine has for
its foundation that the <hi>Triumphal Arch</hi> from whence I have drawn it is the very same
which they erected to the glory of that <hi>Emperour</hi> at his return from that famous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize:
And the <hi>Architect</hi> who happly contriv'd the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and the whole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of the Day of <hi>Triumph,</hi> judiciously introduc'd into his work (which was to

and the <hi>Golden Table</hi> upon which was set the <hi>bread</hi> of <hi>Proposition</hi> together with
some other Utensils to this day extant in the Work.</p>
                     <p>Moreover the <hi>Arch</hi> has this considerable amongst others yet remaining of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,</hi> That 'twas the first and very <hi>Original</hi> of this kind of Structure; and albeit there
have been since made some more sumptuous for greatness of bulk and magnificence,
this is yet of a better hand, and more exquisite <hi>Workmanship</hi> then any of them.</p>

Curiosity of those who
affect this <hi>Art,</hi> as that I may also contribute something to the beauty of the <hi>Design;</hi>

                        <hi>ANdrea Palladio</hi> proposing this <hi>Profile</hi> of the <hi>Composita,</hi> which he also names the
<hi>Latine Order</hi> (to make it <hi>specifically</hi> differ from some others which bear the same
appellation) gives us a general <hi>Maxim</hi> for its <hi>proportion,</hi> which is to make it resemble
the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> the form onely of the <hi>Capital</hi> excepted. And though he add that this
<hi>Order</hi> ought to be somewhat more deck'd and gay then the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> 'tis to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in reference onely to those who allow the <hi>Corinthian Column</hi> but nine <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
(as himself does) whereas <hi>this</hi> should ever have ten.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scamozzi</hi>'s Profile has not so good a grace as that of <hi>Palladio,</hi> nor is it indeed so
exact in the regularity of its <hi>Entablature</hi> with the <hi>Column,</hi> where it wants but three <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes</hi>
upon the total to make it precisely a fifth; for though this be a very small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yet since it had been better to have a little exceeded then come short (the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi>
commonly allowing a whole fourth, or at least two ninths) the defect is the more
easily perceiv'd. But what is yet worse, is, that in the composition of the <hi>Cornice</hi> he
has accumulated so many small members one upon the other, as renders it trifling
and a little confused.

                     <head type="sub">Serlio, and Vignola upon the Composita.</head>
                     <p>I Am astonished at this last production of poor <hi>Serlio,</hi> who having till now reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
well conducted the first <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Architecture</hi> under the direction and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> fails miserably at the very Port just as his <hi>Pilot</hi> has deserted him:
And what does most of all surprize me, is, that the man's <hi>Genius</hi> (which was to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
a mean and trifling Manner) should revolt in such an instant and change into
so strange an Excess. I was at first resolv'd to have suppress'd this <hi>Profile</hi> (for
the Credit of the person) had it not been to wrong his Competitor <hi>Vignola,</hi> and so
frustrate him of the great advantage which upon this occasion he has over him, since
in the precedent <hi>Orders</hi> I have sometimes conceived him his inferiour. I shall not
dwell long upon the particulars which in this <hi>Composition</hi> to me seem defective; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I shall sooner have finish'd in saying once for all, that there is nothing as it
should be, though the <hi>Cornice</hi> be taken from, and (as the <hi>Author</hi> pretends) follow'd
stroak for stroak after that of the fourth <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Colosseum,</hi> which is indeed one of
the most renowned <hi>Vestigia</hi>'s of <hi>Antiquity</hi> and an admirable piece of <hi>Architecture.</hi> But
one had need of a very steddy head to be able to climb such an height without shaking
ones judgment. He should have considered that this <hi>Colossean</hi> Structure being a <hi>Mass</hi>
of a prodigious altitude had need of some <hi>Sophistications</hi> from the <hi>Optiques</hi> to make it
appear regular to the eye; and that therefore there would be an errour and mistake
in summing up the dimensions and <hi>aequipondium</hi> of its members at a more moderate
distance with the same measures and proportions. This inadvertency had made him
slip into another fault much more gross and unpardonable; for he places upon a
small and pittiful <hi>Capital</hi> (after his own mode) the whole weight of the <hi>Colosseum,</hi> that
is to say, a <hi>Gigantine Entablature</hi> which composes the <hi>Corona</hi> of this prodigious Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
This so monstrous medley appears more <hi>here</hi> then in the <hi>Author;</hi> because he
has design'd it very slightly, and in so small a Volume (in his fourth <hi>Book</hi> and ninth
<hi>Chapter</hi> where he explains this last <hi>Order</hi>) that one can hardly discern the form of the
principal Members.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vignola</hi> has proceeded with a great deal more exactness and judgment in his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,</hi>
which he has also <hi>Profil'd</hi> very neatly, and in a large <hi>Volume</hi> that renders it
commendable and of use to <hi>Workmen:</hi> He allows in this <hi>Composition</hi> the same measures
and proportions that he does to the <hi>Corinthian.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>ARchitecture</hi> is in all this <hi>Treatise</hi> so extremely jealous of those <hi>Libertines</hi> that have
the rashness of daring to corrupt the forms of her <hi>Profiles</hi> by their capricious
<hi>Inventions,</hi> that she even refuses entrance to all kind of <hi>Novelty</hi> whatsoever: This it
is which has put me in mind of the promise I made to present you here with some
extraordinary <hi>Designs</hi> of <hi>Capitals</hi> drawn from the <hi>Antiques:</hi> But considering that they
can serve for no use in any sort of Structure at present, as being onely proper to the
<hi>Pagan Deities,</hi> and that we have now no more <hi>Iupiters, Neptunes,</hi> or other <hi>Gods</hi> of that
age, for whose <hi>Temples</hi> these kind of <hi>Capitals</hi> were singularly appropriated, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
<hi>specifical</hi> to every <hi>Subject;</hi> I conceiv'd it better to remove those <hi>baits</hi> which
serv'd likewise but to awaken the ill <hi>Genius</hi> of our <hi>Workmen</hi> to imitate and copy after
them. To supply then their places with some other thing which should be profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and without reproach, I have made a very curious and rare Collection of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Ornament</hi> which they call the <hi>Fret,</hi> and of which the <hi>Antients</hi> made great use, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
infinite delight in composing variety of sorts, as this Design will shew you.
This <hi>Ornament</hi> consists in a certain <hi>interlacing</hi> of two <hi>Lists</hi> of small <hi>Fillets,</hi> which run
always in <hi>parallel</hi> distances equal to their breadth, with this necessary condition,
that at every return and <hi>intersection</hi> they do always fall into <hi>right angles;</hi> this is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable
that they have no <hi>grace</hi> without it, but become altogether <hi>Gotique.</hi> There
is <hi>one</hi> (amongst the <hi>ten</hi> I here present you) that consists but of a single <hi>fillet,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
fills its space exceedingly well, and makes a very handsome shew. The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients</hi>
did ordinarily apply them upon <hi>even</hi> and <hi>flat Members,</hi> as upon the face of the
<hi>Corona</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> of a <hi>Cornice,</hi> under the <hi>Roofs, Planceres</hi> and <hi>Cielings</hi> of <hi>Architraves;</hi>
also about <hi>Doors,</hi> and on the <hi>Plinths</hi> of <hi>Bases,</hi> when their <hi>Torus</hi> and <hi>Scotia</hi>'s were carv'd;
also they do rarely well about <hi>Platfonds</hi> and upon <hi>Ground-works.</hi>

to explain a few of the hard Words, <hi>Technical tearms</hi> belonging
to this <hi>Art,</hi> the <hi>Etymologies</hi> whereof he thought necessary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret:
And as I sayd they are but a few indeed, compared to
those which remain, about a <hi>dozen</hi> at the most; nor was it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
he should exceed that number in a <hi>Country</hi> where <hi>Workmen</hi> are generally more
intelligent in the proper expressions of the <hi>tearms</hi> of the <hi>Arts</hi> unto which they addict
themselves, than ours for the most part are; and therefore if waving the formal tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of that <hi>Page</hi> (for it exceeds very little more) I have in lieu thereof consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
enlarg'd upon this Occasion by a more finish'd and compleat enumeration of the

pardon and acceptance. Not let any man imagine we do at all obscure this design by
adorning it with now and then a refin'd and <hi>Philological</hi> research; since whilest I
seek to gratifie the politer <hi>Students</hi> of this magnificent <hi>Art,</hi> I am not in the least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful
of the lowest condescentions to the capacities of the most vulgar understandings;
as far at least as the defects and narrowness of our <hi>Language</hi> will extend, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grows and abounds in complemental and impertinent <hi>Phrases,</hi> and such forth
(as Sir <hi>H. Wotton</hi> well observes from <hi>Gualterus Rivius</hi>'s incomparable Version of
<hi>Vitruvius</hi> in the <hi>Germane-tongue</hi>) than in the solid improvements of it, by either
preserving or introducing what were truely needful: and really, that very final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
I have had in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Writers, shews me cleerly by what I find innovated
or now grown obsolete, that we have lost more than we have gain'd, and as to <hi>tearms</hi> of
useful <hi>Arts</hi> in particular, forgotten and lost a world of most apt and proper expressions
which our Forefathers made use of without being oblig'd to other <hi>Nations:</hi> And what
care the <hi>French</hi> have taken upon this account onely, may in part be judged from that
pretty, though brief <hi>Essay des Merveilles de Nature, &amp; des plus nobles Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
&amp;c. wherein the proper <hi>tearms</hi> of the most <hi>vulgar,</hi> as well as more <hi>Polish'd</hi> Arts
are most industriously delivered; whilest (to speak ingenuously) I find very little
improvement in the most pretending of our <hi>Lexicons</hi> and <hi>Nomenclators</hi> yet extant,

that of <hi>Bernardinus Baldus</hi> onely upon <hi>Vitruvius</hi> excepted, which yet is neither

that those industrious <hi>Compilers</hi> did make it no more their business to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the World with the Interpretation of the <hi>Tearms</hi> of so many useful <hi>Arts,</hi> I mean
the <hi>Mechanical: Adrianus Junius</hi> has deserved well on this Occasion, to his great

his reasons for all this, you will be both satisfied with them, and justifie
his curiosity. Not that an <hi>Architect</hi> is obliged to be an accurate <hi>Aristarchus</hi>
in <hi>Grammer,</hi> or an <hi>Aristoxenus</hi> in <hi>Musick,</hi> an <hi>Apelles,</hi> or a <hi>Raphael</hi> for <hi>Designing;</hi>

he arrives to the knowledg of <hi>natural things,</hi> and is able to discern the quality of
the <hi>Elements,</hi> and the <hi>materials</hi> which he makes use of: From some insight in

<hi>Celestial bodies,</hi> the <hi>Days, Winds, Weather, Equinoxes</hi> and course of the Heavenly
<hi>Orbs</hi> (like Bruits) pass over without observation, benefit, or prevention of their
effects. To this purpose (though much more at large) <hi>Vitruvius:</hi> But by this
you may see how necessary it is, that an accomplish'd <hi>Master-builder</hi> should
be furnish'd beyond the Vulgar, and I have been the longer in the repetition,
not only that I may advance his reputation, and for encouragement; but to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53015:70"/>
shew that in the proper notion, and as the great <hi>Plato</hi> has somewhere defin'd
him, <hi>Nullus Architectus utitur manuum operâ, sed utentibus praeest.</hi> No Architect is
to be presum'd for the commonly illiterate <hi>Mechanick</hi> (which may bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
contempt) but for the Person who <hi>Superintends</hi> and <hi>Presides</hi> over him with so
many advantages: Yet neither is this to the dishonour of the meanest of those
excellent <hi>Workmen</hi> who make use of their <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>tooles</hi> in the grosser materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
since <hi>God</hi> himself and <hi>Nature</hi> the universal Builders, are by <hi>translation</hi> true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
styl'd <hi>Architects,</hi> both as to what they have excogitated so wisely, and
wrought so artificially.</p>
                  <p>Be this then spoken of the <hi>Superintendent</hi> in particular, whom for distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sake and the Character assign'd him we may name <hi>Architectus Ingenio:</hi>
For since to the perfection of an accomplish'd Building there were three <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendencies</hi>
required: 1. <hi>Strength, 2. Vtility,</hi> and 3. <hi>Beauty,</hi> for the apt <hi>Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
Decor</hi> and fitness, <hi>Symmetrie</hi> and Proportion, there was likewise necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as many capacities, and that besides the judicious <hi>head</hi> there should be a
skilful <hi>hand,</hi> to which let us add <hi>Architectus Sumptuarius,</hi> a full and overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Purse:</hi> Since he who bears <hi>this</hi> may justly be also styled a <hi>Builder,</hi> and that
a <hi>master one</hi> too, as being the Person at whose Charge, and for whose benefit
the <hi>Fabrick</hi> is erected, and it is indeed the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> which both begins
and consummates all designs of this nature; for if that ingredient come once to
fall short, Men build their <hi>Monuments,</hi> instead of their <hi>Houses,</hi>

This man began to build, and was not able to finish. Yet thus have I known
some excellent Persons abus'd, who trusting to the Computation of either
dishonest, or unskilful <hi>Artists,</hi> have been forc'd to desist, sit down by the loss,

men) ordain'd it for a <hi>Law,</hi> That if a <hi>Clerk</hi> undertook a <hi>Work,</hi> and spent
more then his Calculation amounted to, he should be obliged to make it good
out of his own Estate, whilest, they most liberally and honourably rewarded
him if either he came within what was first design'd, or did not much exceed
it. And this was esteem'd so reasonable (upon consideration how many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Persons had been undon, and magnificent <hi>Structures</hi> left imperfect) that
<hi>Vitruvius</hi> writing to the great <hi>Augustus</hi> concerning this subject,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 22. 7.</note> wishes the same

<hi>Building,</hi> had attained to some degree of competent knowledg in the

for our <hi>Climat;</hi> it were I say, becoming our great needs that some ingenious Person
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53015:71"/>
did take this in hand, and advance upon the <hi>Principles</hi> already establish'd,
and not so acquiesce in them as if there were a <hi>Non Vltra</hi> Engraven upon
our <hi>Columns</hi> like those of <hi>Hercules,</hi> after which there remained no more to be
discovered; at least in the apprehension of our vulgar Workmen, who for
want of some more solid directions, faithfull and easy rules in this nature, fill
as well whole <hi>Cities</hi> as <hi>private dwellings</hi> with rubbage and a thousand infirmities,
as by their want of skill in the profession, with the most shameful incongruities
and inconveniencies in all they take in hand; and all this for want of <hi>Canons</hi>
to proceed by, and <hi>humility</hi> to learn, there being hardly a Nation under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
more conceited of their understanding and abilities, and more impatient
of direction than our ordinary <hi>Mechanicks:</hi> For let one find never so just a
fault with a <hi>Workman,</hi> be the same of what <hi>Mystery</hi> soever, immediately he shall
reply, <hi>Sir,</hi> I do not come hither to be taught my <hi>Trade,</hi> I have serv'd an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeship,</hi>
and have wrought ere now with <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that have been satisfied
with my work, and sometimes not without language of reproach, or casting
down his Tools, and going away in wroth; for such I have frequently met
withal. I do not speak this to diminish in the least from the capacitie and
apprehension of our <hi>Nation</hi> who addict themselves to any of the most polite
and ingenious <hi>Professions,</hi> but to court them to more civility, and to humble
the ignorant: For we daily find that when once they arrive to a through-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
and address in their <hi>Trades,</hi> they paragon, if not exceed even the most
exquisite of other Countries; as we may see in that late reformation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of our <hi>Lock-Smiths,</hi> work, <hi>Ioyners, Cabbinet-makers</hi> and the like, who
from very vulgar and pittiful <hi>Artists,</hi> are now come to produce <hi>works</hi> as curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for their <hi>filing,</hi> and admirable for their dexterity in <hi>contriving,</hi> as any we
meet with abroad, and in particular for our <hi>Ioyners,</hi> they excell all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>But as little supportable are another sort of <hi>Workmen,</hi> who from a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of their abilities, and some lucky <hi>jobb</hi> (as they call it) do generally ingrosse
all the work they can hear of, while in the mean time they disdain almost to
put their own hands to the <hi>Toole,</hi> but for the most part employ their <hi>Apprentices,</hi>
of some other ignorant <hi>Iourney-men;</hi> as if the same of their <hi>Masters</hi> abilities
did any thing contribute to the well performance of Work undertaken,
whilest in the interim <hi>he</hi> hardly appears himself till all the faults be slubber'd
over, the remedy either impossible or expensive, and our <hi>Master</hi> ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his <hi>Money,</hi> which such <hi>Gentlemen-Mechanicks</hi> commonly consume on
ease and bravery, being puffed up with an empty conceit of their own abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which (<hi>God</hi> knows) is very indifferent, and the less for want of exercise
and humility: a practcie so contrary to the usage of all other <hi>Nations,</hi> that
even such as by their knowledg in this kind, have meritoriously attained to
the Titles of <hi>Military</hi> Dignity, have notwithstanding pursued their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Callings in personal cares and assiduous labours, to their eternal
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53015:72"/>
same so long as one Stone shall lie upon another in this World; as I could
abundantly exemplifie in the works of <hi>Cavalieri Fontane, Bramanti, Sanso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,
Baglione, Bernini, Fiamingo,</hi> &amp;c. whose egregious labours, both before,
and since the accumulation of their honours, do sufficiently justify what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
concerning them. And that all such may know I reproach no man out
<hi>of spleen</hi> or the least animosity to their Persons (for such as are not guilty will
never be offended at my plainness, or take this for a <hi>Satyre</hi>) I cannot but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
redargue the want of more acquaintance in these so necessary and
becoming <hi>Arts</hi> even in most of our <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> who either imagine the
Study of <hi>Architecture</hi> an absolute <hi>non-necessary,</hi> or forsooth a diminution to
the rest of their <hi>Education,</hi> from whence proceeds that miserable of loss of so
many irrecoverable advantages during their <hi>Travels</hi> in other <hi>Countries,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
at their return; whereas if it were truly consider'd, there is nothing
which does more properly concern them, as it contributes to their external
honour, then the effects of this illustrious <hi>Art:</hi> Besides, these being Persons of
better parts, are most likely to be furnish'd with the best abilities to learn,
and so consequently enabl'd to examine, and direct such as they shall set on
Work, without reproch either to their conveniency or expence when they at
any time Build, not forgetting the Ornament and Lustre which by this means
rich and opulent Structures do add to the <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> their remaining at
this day no one particular, for which <hi>Egypt, Syria, Greece,</hi> nay <hi>Rome</hi> her self
(beheld in all there <hi>State, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Splendor</hi>) have been more admir'd and
celebrated, then for the <hi>Glory, Strength,</hi> and <hi>Magnificence</hi> of their incomparable
<hi>Buildings;</hi> and even at present, the most noble <hi>Youth</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> are generally
so well furnish'd with instructions touching this laudable <hi>Art,</hi> that the knowledg
of <hi>Architecture</hi> (and to speak properly in its <hi>tearms &amp;c.</hi>) is universal, and so
cherish'd, even in men of obscure extraction, that (as is already instanc'd)
<hi>Architects</hi> (I mean the <hi>Manuary</hi> as well as <hi>Ingeniary</hi>) have been, and are yet
often rewarded with <hi>Knighthood,</hi> and the <hi>Art</hi> profess'd as a most becomming
and necessary accomplishment in divers of their <hi>Academies:</hi> Add to this the
<hi>Examples</hi> of so many great and illustrious Persons as (without the numeration of
those our <hi>Master</hi> has recorded in the <hi>Preface</hi> to his seventh Book) I might here
bring upon this <hi>Theater</hi> famous for their skill and encouragement of this sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Art: <hi>Emperours, Kings, Popes, Cardinals</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> innumerable, who have
all of them left us the permanent Monuments of it in the several places of their
Dominions, besides the infinite advantage of well managing of great and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
expences, as well as the most private and <hi>Oeconomical,</hi> an handsome and
well contriv'd house being built at a far less charge, than commonly those
irregular <hi>congestions,</hi> rude and brutish inventions, which generally so deform
and incommode the several habitations of our <hi>Gentry</hi> both in <hi>City</hi> and
<hi>Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I have done, and I hope all that love and cherish these <hi>Arts,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53015:72"/>
that of <hi>Architecture,</hi> will not be offended at this <hi>Zeal</hi> of mine in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaking
their esteem of it, since if I have said any thing in reproof of the
<hi>errours</hi> either of the <hi>Persons</hi> who pretend to it, or of the <hi>Works</hi> which they do
to its disgrace; I have only spoken it that both may be reformed and
made the better. But least whilest I thus discourse of the <hi>Accomplishments</hi>
of our <hi>Artists,</hi> and defects of the <hi>Pretenders,</hi> I my self be found <hi>Logodaedalus,</hi>
and as they say, <hi>Architectus Verborum</hi> only, I proceed from the <hi>Person</hi> to the
<hi>Thing.</hi>

which is by some taken for the <hi>Art</hi> it self, by others for the Work, <hi>aedificio
ipso &amp; opera,</hi> by us for both, is thus defin'd; <hi>Scientia pluribus disciplinis, &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis
eruditionibus ornata, cujus judicio probantur omnia quae à caeteris artibus perficiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
opera. Architecture</hi> (says our Master <hi>Vitruvius</hi>) is a <hi>Science</hi> qualified with
sundry other <hi>Arts,</hi> and adorn'd with variety of <hi>Learning,</hi> to whose judgment
and approbation all other Works of <hi>Art</hi> submit themselves. Or rather
in short and as effectual, <hi>cujus praeceptis diriguntur, &amp; judicio probantur,</hi> &amp;c.
for so it seems to be more explicite, since in a <hi>Geometrical</hi> Problem there are
both the <hi>Construction,</hi> or Direction <hi>Operis faciendi,</hi> which these <hi>Praecepta</hi> define;
and also, the <hi>Demonstration</hi> or Probation <hi>Operis jam facti,</hi> which is specified by
the <hi>Iudicium</hi> in the <hi>Vitruvian</hi> definition. I conceive therefore the <hi>first</hi> part to be
the more Essential and inseparable; the <hi>latter</hi> to be but the result of the <hi>former,</hi>
and no more ingredient into the <hi>Art</hi> then the image of a Mans face in a <hi>Glass</hi> is
constitutive of him.</p>
                  <p>But to forbear any farther <hi>gloss,</hi> you see what a large dominion it has, and I
might go on: <hi>Ea nascitur ex fabrica &amp; ratiocinatione,</hi> to shew that she is the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Building,</hi> and <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Demonstratio.</note> Then, (for so I affect to render it) that <hi>Building
is the result of an assiduous and manual practice upon apt materials according to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
propounded;</hi> and lastly, that our <hi>Ratiocination is an ability of explicating what we
have done by an account of the just proportions;</hi> In a word, it is the <hi>Art of Building well,</hi>
that is, <hi>handsomly, solidly,</hi> and <hi>usefully;</hi> for so (to omit many other <hi>Elogies</hi> and <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions</hi>)
I find it established; and therefore the <hi>learning</hi> of our <hi>Architect</hi> without
the <hi>diligence</hi> of our <hi>Workman, umbram, non rem consecuta videtur,</hi> may serve to
rear a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> not build a <hi>Temple,</hi> there being as much difference between
<hi>speculation</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> in this <hi>Art,</hi> as there is between a <hi>Shadow</hi> and a <hi>Substance;</hi>
but with what advantages those persons proceed who both know, and can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
I have already demonstrated; and when we consider that the whole <hi>Art</hi>
consists in the most exact and elegant order imaginable, it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
there have been so few able men of the <hi>Profession:</hi> Sir <hi>H. Wotton,</hi> who rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
those two parts for one, that is, the fixing of the <hi>Model</hi> to a full expression
of the first <hi>Idea,</hi> passes (with our <hi>Master</hi>) to the <hi>species</hi> or kinds of this <hi>disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
whose learned names since our politer <hi>Workmen</hi> do commonly retain,
I think meet to interpret for the benefit of the less knowing. The first is,</p>

of the future Work, which our <hi>Ground-plot</hi> does fully interpret. This
is properly the Talent and Work of the chief <hi>Architect</hi> or <hi>Surveyor</hi> himself
(and indeed the most abstruse and difficult) by which he expresses his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
and <hi>Idea</hi> for the judicious collocation, idoneous and apt disposition,
right casting and contrivement of the several <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>Rooms</hi> according to
their distinct <hi>offices,</hi> and <hi>uses;</hi> for as <hi>Ordination</hi> imports the <hi>quantity,</hi> so does
<hi>this</hi> the <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>Building.</hi> To this succeeds</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Orthography,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Orthogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> or the erect elevation of the same in <hi>face</hi> or <hi>front</hi> describ'd in
measure upon the former <hi>Idea:</hi> Some do by this comprehend the <hi>sides</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
(but so will not I) to be seen as well within as without the <hi>Model.</hi> It
is in truth but the simple representation of that part opposite to the eye of the
beholder, and thence by <hi>Italians l' Alzato</hi> or <hi>l' impiedi, facciata</hi> and Frontis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
without <hi>shadows</hi> or other deceptions, and the second <hi>species</hi> of <hi>disposition.</hi>
The last is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scenography,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Scenogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> or (as some) <hi>Sciagraphy,</hi> which is the same <hi>object</hi> elevated upon

together with a fore-shortning of a <hi>third</hi> side, so as the whole <hi>Solid</hi> of the <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
become visible in <hi>Perspective</hi> (as they say) because composed of the <hi>three</hi>
principal <hi>lines</hi> used in that Art, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Plan</hi> or <hi>Plot,</hi> belonging to the

                     <note place="margin">Eurythmia.</note> and <hi>Venusta species Aedificii</hi> does result
which creates that agreeble harmony between the several dimensions, so as

thereof, become the <hi>station,</hi> and <hi>occasion,</hi> as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> expresly shews
in appropriating the several <hi>Orders</hi> to their natural affections; so as he would
not have set a <hi>Corinthian Column</hi> at the Entrance of a <hi>Prison,</hi> nor a <hi>Tuscan</hi> before
the <hi>Portico</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> as some have done among us with no great regard to
the <hi>decorum:</hi> Here therefore it is, that the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of an <hi>Architect</hi> ought to
be consulted, since even in the disposition of the <hi>Offices</hi> of our most private
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53015:73"/>
houses, we find no where greater absurdities committed, whilest we many times,
find the <hi>Kitchin</hi> where the <hi>Parlour</hi> should have been, and <hi>that</hi> in the first and

&amp;c. for so (saies he) future <hi>errors</hi> may be timely prevented, with little cost, and
without any trouble before the remedy prove incorrigible. There is nothing
certainly spar'd to less purpose, and more to the detriment of Builders then
the small expence of making this <hi>Prototype,</hi> which I would have fram'd with
all its <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>Dimensions,</hi> by the assistance of some skillful <hi>Ioyner,</hi> or other
ingenious <hi>Artist</hi> in some slight material, which may be to remove, uncover
and take in pieces, for the intuition of every <hi>Contignation, Partition, Passage,</hi>
and <hi>Aperture</hi> without other adulteration by <hi>Painting</hi> or Gaudy artifice, but in
the most simple manner as Sir <hi>H. Wotton</hi> prudently advises, for reasons most
material and unanswerable; but from all which we may deduce how abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary it is, that an <hi>Architect</hi> have more than a vulgar dexterity in the
Art of <hi>Designing</hi> and Drawing, <hi>Quae autem conferant, imo, quae sint Architecto

of the former (for so we name those dry <hi>Materials</hi> upon the Surface) to
be the <hi>Bases</hi> of the whole <hi>Edifice:</hi> I am not ignorant that some contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this <hi>Office,</hi> confounding it with the <hi>Stylobata</hi> and <hi>Pedistals</hi> of <hi>Columns,</hi>
assigning them a regular thickness of halfe as much more as the <hi>Orders</hi> they
support; and then the <hi>Italians</hi> call it the <hi>Zoccolo, Pillow</hi> or <hi>Die</hi> (because of its
<hi>Cubique</hi> and solid figure:) But I rather take it for the <hi>Basamento</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi>

The Reverend <hi>Daniel Barbaro,</hi> c. 8. l. 2. describes us all the kinds of
them, and calls this in particular (and which confirmes this division) the
conceiled part, or <hi>fondatio in imo:</hi> And then by this elegant <hi>distinction</hi> defines
<hi>Structura</hi> to be that of <hi>Fronts; Instruction,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Structura. Instructio. Substructio.</note> that of the <hi>middle</hi> parts; and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi>
of the <hi>lower;</hi> though this last notion does likewise many times im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
some vast and magnificent Building, for so <hi>Baldus</hi> has cited that passage
in <hi>Liu.</hi> l. 6. where he names the stately <hi>Capital</hi> a <hi>Substruction</hi> only, and other
Authors <hi>Substructiones insanas,</hi> for such vast and enormous Fabricks: But that
we may not omit the <hi>Pedistal</hi> (though of rarer use amongst the <hi>Antients</hi>) I come

(that touches the midst of the <hi>Arch</hi> where (as we said) it puts forth a <hi>flower</hi>

accurate as may be in so nice and florid an <hi>Ornament,</hi> these <hi>Leaves</hi> did of old
resemble either the <hi>Acanthus</hi> (though a little more indented and disguised) from
the inventor <hi>Callimachus,</hi> or (as some) the <hi>Olive</hi> and <hi>Palmes,</hi> for so it is warranted
by <hi>Villalpandus</hi> from that <hi>Capitel</hi> of his description standing in the <hi>Temple</hi> of
<hi>Solomon.</hi> At the extreams of these leaves do issue the <hi>Caules,</hi> and <hi>Codds</hi> break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and tender foliage by the discretion and invention of the ingenious <hi>Carver.</hi>
But the domineering <hi>Tendrells</hi> and <hi>Flexures</hi> consist of greater, or smaller <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutas,</hi>
emerging from between the <hi>Abacus</hi> and <hi>Echinus</hi> in <hi>smaller</hi> Leaves and
Stalkes, <hi>middling,</hi> and <hi>inferior</hi> foliage, as they are distinguish'd by Workmen in

at our <hi>Corinthian</hi> hornes, the <hi>Composita</hi> has her <hi>Voluta</hi> much more resembling

these vacuities were the passages for the ends of the <hi>Ioysts, Timbers</hi> and <hi>Rafters</hi>
which rested upon the <hi>Architrave,</hi> and where to fill up that deformity, they
usually made it up with some such ornaments, suppose of <hi>Skulls, Disbes,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and not preposterously filled them as our Workmen too often do, without any
relation to the subject; so as I have frequently seen <hi>Oxes heads</hi> Carv'd on the
<hi>Freeze</hi> of an <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Pleasure</hi> in a <hi>Garden,</hi> where <hi>Roses</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> would have

                  </p>

the <hi>Corona, 6. Sima recta</hi> and <hi>inversa</hi> (rarely a <hi>Cavetto</hi>) 7. and lastly another
<hi>Regula</hi> which concludes the whole <hi>Order.</hi> We will begin with the <hi>first,</hi> being
sometimes a small <hi>Scotia</hi> consisting of an half or quarter round, that now
and then also both in the <hi>Tuscan</hi> and <hi>Dorica</hi> divides the <hi>Freeze</hi> from the <hi>Cornice</hi>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:53015:80"/>
in place of the <hi>Taenia,</hi> as does the <hi>Cymatium</hi> in the rest of the <hi>Orders.</hi> The
<hi>Ovolo</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ovolo.</note> is next in the plainer <hi>Orders,</hi> but it is inrich'd in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> like
the <hi>Echinus,</hi> which (if you please) you may take for the same thing in an <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
dress: In the <hi>Tuscan</hi> and <hi>Doric</hi> 'tis turn'd like a <hi>Scima</hi> or <hi>Cymatium,</hi> and is
substituted for support of the <hi>Corona,</hi> but in the <hi>last</hi> 'tis usually accompanied
with a slender <hi>Regula</hi> above it, and in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> both above and beneath,
where it is likewise frequently Carv'd and adorn'd with a broad <hi>Welt</hi> like a
<hi>Plinth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dentelli,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dentelli.</note> are the <hi>Teeth</hi> immediately above the <hi>Cymatium</hi> of the <hi>Freeze,</hi> by some
named also <hi>Asseri</hi> from their square form; I say in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> and <hi>Ionic,</hi> &amp;c.
for in the <hi>Doric Order</hi> they were not antiently admitted, or rather <hi>not properly,</hi>
according to the opinion of our <hi>Master,</hi> though we must needs acknowledg
to have found them in the most authentical pieces extant: As for their <hi>Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
they kept to no certain rule, but made them sometimes thicker, sometimes
thinner, square, or long, and more in number, but commonly the <hi>spaces</hi> less
by an half, sometimes by a third part then the <hi>Teeth,</hi> which were themselves
twice as <hi>high</hi> as their <hi>breadth,</hi> and frequently (especially in the more polite <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>)
beginning with the <hi>Cone</hi> of a <hi>Pine,</hi> pendent at the very point over the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<hi>Column: Lomatius</hi> is yet more precise in this particular, and gives them
as much height as the middle <hi>Fascia</hi> of the <hi>Architrave, Projecture</hi> equal, <hi>Front</hi>
twice the bredth of their height, and a third part less than their bredth for <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity.</hi>
The <hi>Dentelli</hi> have oftentimes a small <hi>Regula,</hi> and now and then more
then one, as usually in the <hi>Ionica,</hi> where it has likewise an <hi>Ovolo</hi> or <hi>Echinus</hi> for
the bedding of the <hi>Corona;</hi> but if inriched, and that <hi>two</hi> of them encounter, <hi>one</hi>
should be simple and plain, as where it happens to be inserted beneath it: Next
to this superior <hi>Echinus</hi> are the <hi>Modilions,</hi> but instead of them <hi>Dentelli</hi> are
thought to have been first instituted, and for that reason superfluously joyn'd
where <hi>Mutules</hi> are; and therefore where we find <hi>Taenia</hi> under <hi>Modilions</hi> it is not
properly divided into <hi>Teeth,</hi> nor is it rashly to be imitated, though we have
some great examples to countenance it. That of the <hi>Pantheon</hi> may safely guide
us herein, where it is left <hi>plain</hi> for this very cause, and that the reason of the
thing does not in truth allow it: However, it must be acknowledged, nothing
has been more grosely abused even amongst our most renown'd <hi>Masters.</hi>

the part of the <hi>Bedding-moulding</hi> as our Workmen style the <hi>Ovolo</hi> in this place,
for so they frequently do in the <hi>Doric</hi> and <hi>Ionic,</hi> but then without any other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
than a slight <hi>Cymatium</hi> to edg them, and to be alwaies placed over the
<hi>Triglyphs:</hi> In the <hi>Corinthian</hi> and <hi>Composita</hi> they are enrich'd with all the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateness
and curiosity imaginable, capp'd, as I said, with a curiously Carv'd
small <hi>Cymatium</hi> where they are contiguous to the <hi>Planceere</hi> of Roof of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona.</hi>
Our ordinary <hi>Workmen</hi> make some distinction between <hi>Modilions</hi> and

those other sorts of <hi>Bragets</hi> which they call <hi>Cartells</hi> and <hi>Mutules,</hi> usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Carv'd like the handles of Vessels Scroul'd, Flower'd and sometimes
Sculptur'd with the <hi>Triglyph;</hi> and such were the <hi>Ancones</hi> amongst the <hi>Greeks:</hi>
That there should be no <hi>Guttae</hi> under <hi>Mutules</hi> is the opinion of divers learn'd
<hi>Architects,</hi> though (as was said) we frequently find them <hi>Chanell'd</hi> like the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyph,</hi>

to defend all the rest of the <hi>Edifice</hi> from the <hi>Rain</hi> and injuries of the <hi>Weather,</hi>
and therefore has its <hi>Projectures</hi> accordingly. It is sometimes taken for the

it carries off the Wet from falling on the rest of the <hi>Entablature,</hi> as the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency

                  <p>The under part of the <hi>Roofs</hi> of these <hi>Corona</hi>'s (which are commonly wrought

vogue: But I refer the Reader who thirsts after more of this, to the learned
<hi>Salmasius</hi> on <hi>Solinus</hi> p. 1215. Nor is yet the <hi>Corona</hi> perpetually plain as

this <hi>Member</hi> in stead of <hi>Cymatium,</hi> but not so frequently; and that the <hi>Tuscan

being those two Lists commonly including <hi>Scotia,</hi> as we finde it in the <hi>Ionic

<hi>Pedistal:</hi> Therefore I distinguish them, though yet they may be accounted
the same, seeing they usually import any small plain <hi>Fillet</hi> dividing greater
Members; for so <hi>Philander</hi> calls almost all simple parts broader or narrower,
which like <hi>Fillets</hi> encompass the rest; as in the <hi>Doric-Trabeation, Regula, Sima,
Cymatium,</hi> &amp;c. In the <hi>Capitel, Regula, Cymatium, Plinthus:</hi> In the <hi>Cornice</hi>
of the <hi>Stylobata</hi> also <hi>Regula, Cymatium, Astragalus:</hi> But where it is no less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous,

to the Antient <hi>Tearmes</hi> than by mixing them with such <hi>barbarous</hi> ones as were
afterwards introduc'd, indanger the confusion of Young <hi>Students</hi> and such as
applied themselves to the Art. Finally, to reform another mistake, I think
good to note that where we finde <hi>Coronix</hi> in our Authors, it is rather meant for
all that <hi>Moulding</hi> projecting over the <hi>Dye</hi> or square of the <hi>Pedistal</hi> (by some cal'd

all that may be farther desir'd for the rendering of this undertaking more useful
and instructive, I will in brief proceed to what is used to appear further in
<hi>Buildings,</hi> where they did not flatten the <hi>Roofs</hi> and Cover of <hi>Edifices,</hi> and which
is certainly of all other the most graceful.</p>
                  <p>Those <hi>Roofs</hi> which exalted themselves above the <hi>Cornices</hi> had usually in <hi>face</hi>

that you, who are so universally accomplish'd, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,

as being to a <hi>Person</hi> so well able to judg of that rare fancy, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
worth of the said <hi>Leon Baptista,</hi> who in a time wherein little or nothing of
<hi>Sculpture</hi> was known (all good <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> being then in a manner annihil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated

<hi>Youth,</hi> who though unexperienc'd themselves, delighted in this most noble <hi>Art;</hi> and
to incite them to joyn diligent practice, with the observation of sure and unerring <hi>Rules.</hi>
No wonder therefore, if from that time forward such wonderful Progress has been made
in this <hi>Art,</hi> as has brought it to that perfection wherein it is seen flourishing at this
day: So as in this Age of ours, we have no need to envy those so much admired <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>
of the most celebrated <hi>Sculptors</hi> of the Antient <hi>Romans,</hi> when we shall well
consider what has been perform'd by our Countryman <hi>Donato,</hi> and not many years since,
the Divine <hi>Michael Angelo Buonaroti,</hi> as after him, by <hi>Baccio Bandinelli,
Benuenuto Cellini,</hi> and lastly, by <hi>Your Self;</hi> whereof, that I may produce some <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
(besides those many <hi>Statues</hi> which are extant of all your hands) proclaiming
your singular Merits to the admiration of all men, there are to be seen in the <hi>Piazza</hi> of

all the rest, <hi>Your</hi> own <hi>Neptune,</hi> with the other three <hi>Statues</hi> accompanying it, cut our
of <hi>one</hi> intire piece of <hi>Marble,</hi> and frain'd with so magisterial a height of Art, as not only
produces wonder in all that attentively behold it; but does as it were wholly astonish
then to contemplate the <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> the <hi>Science,</hi> the <hi>Industry,</hi> the <hi>Diligence,</hi> the
<hi>Affection,</hi> and in fine the never to be sufficiently celebrated <hi>Skill</hi> of the <hi>Artists.</hi>
Vouchsafe therefore that these (however impolish'd) <hi>Instructions,</hi> so much conducing to
the information of unexperienc'd Youth, be recommended to the publick view under
Your <hi>Name</hi> and Protection: And as it has ever been Your Custom heretofore, Love

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have often thought with my self that the several Arts, whereby men at
first Industriously set themselves to express, and represent by Work of
hand, the shapes and similitudes of bodies, springing from natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
took their beginning from the accidental observation of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Lineaments either in <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> or some other sorts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
by Nature so dispos'd, that by altering or inverting some thing
or other in their form, they appear'd capable of being made to resemble the Figures
and Shapes of living Creatures; and thereupon, having seriously consider'd and
examin'd what course was best to take, they began with utmost Diligence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
to try and make experiment, what was necessary to be added, or taken away,
or in any other kind perform'd, for the bringing of their Work to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
as might cause it exactly to resemble the intended form, appearing, as it
were, the very same thing; ever marking as they wrought, to see if they had fail'd in
any thing, and still mending as they found occasion, sometimes the <hi>Lines,</hi> sometimes
the <hi>Superficies, Polishing</hi> and <hi>Repolishing,</hi> till at length (not without much pleasure and
satisfaction) they had accomplish'd their desire: So that it is not a thing so much to
be admir'd, that by frequent practice in Works of this nature, the <hi>fancies</hi> and <hi>ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities</hi>
of men have been from time to time improv'd, and advanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to that height, that
at last (without taking notice of any rude <hi>Draughts</hi> in the Material they wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to help them in their intended <hi>Designs,</hi>) they became able by their skill to <hi>Design</hi>
and express upon it whatsoever form they pleased, though in a different manner,
some one way, some another; for as much as all were not taught, or apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to proceed by the same rule or Method. The course that many take to bring
their intended <hi>Figures</hi> to perfection, is both by adding to, and taking from the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial;
and this is the way of those that work in <hi>Wax, Plaister</hi> or <hi>Clay,</hi> who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tearm'd <hi>Maestri de stucco,</hi> others proceed by taking away, and carving out of the
Material that which is superfluous, whereby it comes to pass that they produce out
of whatsoever Mass of <hi>Marble,</hi> the perfect shape and figure of a Man which was there
hiddenly but potentially before; and those that work this way, we call <hi>Sculptors:</hi>
next of kin to whom are they that grave in <hi>Seals</hi> the proportions of Faces,
that before lay hid in the Matter out of which they were raised. The third sort is
of those that perform their Work by only adding to the Material; as <hi>Silver-Smithes,</hi>
who beating the <hi>Silver</hi> with Mallets, and distending it into thin <hi>Plates</hi> of what fashion
or size they think fit, lay thereupon their <hi>Superstructure,</hi> adding and inlarging till they
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53015:85"/>
have fashion'd and brought to perfection their intended <hi>Design.</hi> And here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
some may imagine, that in the number of this last sort of Artists <hi>Painters</hi> are to
be reckon'd, as those who proceed by way of adding, namely by laying on of <hi>Colours;</hi>
but to this they answer, that they do not strive so much to imitate those <hi>lights</hi> and
<hi>shadows</hi> in Bodies which they discerne by the Eye, by the adding or taking away of
any thing, as by some other <hi>Artifice</hi> proper and peculiar to their way of Working:
But of the <hi>Painter</hi> and his Art we shall take occasion to speak elsewhere. Now, as to
those several kinds of <hi>Designers</hi> which we have here before mention'd, though they go
several ways to work, nevertheless they all direct their aims to this end, namely,
that their labours may appear to him that shall well observe them, as Natural, and as
like the life as may be; for the bringing of which to effect, it is most evident, that by
how much the more exquisitely they follow some certain determin'd rule or method
(which <hi>Rule</hi> we shall afterwards describe) so much the sewer <hi>defects</hi> will they be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of, so much the fewer <hi>errors</hi> commit, and in all manner of accounts their
Works will succeed and come off with the greater advantage: What shall we say of
<hi>Carpenters?</hi> What would they perform to any purpose, if it were not for the <hi>Square,</hi>
the <hi>Plummet,</hi> the <hi>Line,</hi> the <hi>Perpendicular,</hi> and the <hi>Compasses</hi> for the making of <hi>Circles,</hi> and
by the means of which Instruments they Design their <hi>Angles,</hi> their <hi>Streight-Lines,</hi> their
<hi>Levells,</hi> and other their Proportions, thereby finishing and compleating all they take
in hand with the greater exactness, and without which they would be able to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
substantially? Or can we rationally imagine, that the <hi>Statuarie</hi> could perform
such excellent and admirable Works by chance, rather then by the help of some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and Infallible <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>guide,</hi> drawn from <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>experience?</hi> Wherefore this
we shall lay down for a <hi>Maxim;</hi> That from all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> whatsoever, there
are Drawn certain <hi>Principles, Rules,</hi> or natural <hi>Conclusions,</hi> which if we shall apply our
selves with all care and diligence to examine and make use of, we shall undoubtedly
find the benefit of, by the perfect accomplishment of whatsover we take in hand:
For as we were first instructed by Nature, that from those lineaments which are found
in pieces of Wood, Earth, Stone or other Materials, may be drawn (as we said before)
the forms of whatsoever Body or Creature the concourses of those Lines resemble;
so also the same nature hath taught us certain helps and meanes, by which we are
guided to proceed securely and regularly in what we undertake, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
observing and use whereof, we shall most easily, and with the greatest advantage,
arrive at the utmost perfection of the Art or faculty we strive to attain. It now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
that we declare what those helps are which Statuaries are chiefly to make use
of; and because their principal part is to make one thing to imitate and resemble
another, it will be requisite to speak first of <hi>Resemblance,</hi> a subject our discourse
might be abundantly ample in, since Resemblance is a thing so natural and obvious,
that it offers it self to our view and observation in each visible object; not only every
Animal, but even all things whatsoever that are of the same Species, being in some
respect or other correspondent and alike: On the other side, there are not in the
whole race of Mankind any two to be found so exquisitely resembling each other, as
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53015:85"/>
not to differ some one tittle in the tone of the Voice, or the fashion of the Nose, or of
some other part; to which we may add, that those Persons whom, having first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
Infants, we come to see Children of some growth, and afterwards at the age of
Manhood, if at length we meet them when grown Old, we shall find them so chang'd
and alter'd by time, that we shall not be able to know them; for as much as the apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and position of those numerous Lines and Features in the Countenance still al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and vary's from time to time, as Age comes on; nevertheless in the same Visage
there remains a certain natural and peculiar form, which maintains and keeps up the
resemblance inhaerent to the Species: But we shall wave these things, as belonging
rather to a particular discourse, and return to persue what we first took in hand to
treat of.</p>
                  <p>The Design and Intention of making resemblances among <hi>Statuaries,</hi> I take to be
twofold; the first is, that the Design or Work intended for the resemblance of any
sort of Creature (for example, suppose it a man) be so fram'd, that it come as near in
similitude as may be to the said Species, without regarding whether it represent the
Image of <hi>Socrates</hi> more then that of <hi>Plato,</hi> or any other known individual Person, since
it is enough that the Work resembles a man in general. The other Intention proceeds
farther, and aims not only at the representing the likeness of Man in general, but of
this or that particular Man; as namely, of <hi>Caesar,</hi> or <hi>Cato,</hi> not omitting to describe
the very Habit he wore, the Posture he affected, and the Action he used; whether
sitting in his Tribunal, or making Speeches to the People: It being the proper busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of those who addict themselves to this last way of representation, to imitate and
express every Habit, Posture and Ayr, peculiar to the Body of that known Person
whom we intend to represent. Answerable to these two Intentions, (that we may
handle the matter as briefly as is possible) there are especially required two things;
that is to say, Proportion, and Limitation. In treating therefore of these two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
that which we have to do, is to declare. First, what they are: Next, to what use
they serve for the bringing of our Design to perfection: Besides which, I cannot
but by the way, take notice of the great benefit that is to be made of them in respect
of the wonderful and almost incredible effects which they produce; insomuch that
whosoever shall be well instructed in them, shall be able by the help of some certain
infallible marks, exactly to observe and point out the lineaments, situation and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the parts of any Body, though it were a thousand years after, so as not to faile
to place it exactly at his pleasure, in the very same direction and posture it should
have hapned to have stood in before; and in such sort, as there should not be the least
part of the said Body, which should not be reduc'd and resituated toward the very
same point of <hi>Heaven</hi> against which it was originally directed: As if, for example,
You would point out the place with your finger where the Star of <hi>Mercury</hi> or the new
<hi>Moon</hi> would rise, and it should happen to rise in a direct angle over against the point
of the <hi>Knee, Elbow, Finger,</hi> or any other part; most certain it is, that by these means
and helps all this may be done, and that so precisely that there should not follow the
least failing or errour imaginable; nor need there any doubt be made of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53015:86"/>
hereof. Besides this, suppose I should take one of the Statues of <hi>Phidias,</hi> and so
cover it over with <hi>Wax</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> that none of the Work could be discern'd, and that
it should appear to be only a meer shapeless trunck, You might by these rules and
helps certainly know how to find out in one place, by boaring with a Wimble, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil
of the <hi>Eye,</hi> without doing it any harm by touching it; and in another place the
<hi>Novel,</hi> and finaly in another the great <hi>Toe,</hi> and so other parts in like manner; by
which means you will gain a perfect knowledge of all the Angles and Lines, whether
far distant one from another, or nearly concurring together: You may also, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which way you will, and whether following the Original, or the Copy, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Draw</hi> or <hi>Paint,</hi> but also put down in <hi>Writing,</hi> the various course of the Lines, the
circumferences of the Circles, the positions of the parts, in such sort that by the
aforesaid helps and means you need not doubt the being able to produce with ease
such another figure perfectly resembling, and of what size you please, either less, or
just of the same magnitude, or of an hundred Fathomes in length; may, I dare be bold
to say, that were there but Instruments to be had answerable to so great a Design, it
were not only not impossible, but even no hard matter, to make one as big as the
Mountain <hi>Caucasus;</hi> and that which perhaps you may most wonder at, is, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the matter might be order'd, one half of this Statue may be made in the
Island of <hi>Pharos,</hi> and the other half wrought and finish'd in the Mountains of
<hi>Carrara;</hi> and that with such exact correspondence, that the joyntures and commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of both parts perfectly sitting each other, they may be united into one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
statue resembling either the Life, or the Copy after which it shall have been
figur'd: And for the performing of this so stupendious a Work, the manner and
method will appear so easy, so perspicuous and expedite, that for my part I conceive
it almost impossible for any to err but those that shall Industriously, to make tryal of
the proof of this assertion, work contrary to the rules and method enjoyn'd. We do
not hereby undertake to teach the way of making all kind of resemblances in Bodies,
or the expressing of all those various aspects which result from several differing and
contrary passions and affections; since it is not the thing which we profess to shew,
how to represent the Countenance of <hi>Hercules</hi> when he combats with <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>us,</hi> with all
the height of Magnanimity and fierceness which would be requisite upon such an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
or casting an obliging, chearful and Smiling air, when he Courts his <hi>Deia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nira;</hi>
so as that the Countenance of the same <hi>Hercules</hi> should upon several occasions
be represented with as various aspects: But our purpose is rather to take notice of
all the different figures and postures that are incident to a Body from the divers situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
Gestures or Motions of the several members or parts thereof; for as much as
the proportions and outward lines are one way terminated in a Body that stands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
another way in him that sits, another way in one that is lying down, another
way in those that turn or incline themselves toward this or that side; and so, in like
manner, in all other gestures and motions of the Body, of which way of representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our intention is at this time; that is to say, in what manner, and by what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and infallible rules, these gestures and various dispositions of the Body may be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53015:86"/>
imitated and represented; which rules, as we said before, are reduc'd to two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
heads, namely, <hi>Proportion,</hi> and <hi>Limitation:</hi> And first we shall treat of <hi>Proportion,</hi>
which is indeed no other then a constant and certain Observation, by examining the
just number and measures, what habitude, symmet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie and correspondence all the parts
of the Body have one towards another, and that in respect of every dimension of the
Body, both as to <hi>length, breadth</hi> and <hi>thickness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Observation is made by two sorts of Instruments, a large Ruler, and two
moveable Squares; with the Ruler we take the lengths of the parts, and with the
Squares we take their diameters and all the other proportions of the said measures.
Upon this Ruler then let there be a line drawn of the length of the Body which you
would measure, that is to say, from the crown of the Head to the sole of the Foot:
Whence note by the way, that to measure a Man of a short stature, you are to use
a shorter Ruler, and for one of a longer stature, a longer Ruler: But whatsoever the
length of the Ruler be, it is to be divided into fix equal parts, which parts we
will name Feet, from whence we will call it the Foot-measure; and each of
these Feet shall again be divided into ten equal parts, which we may tearm
Inches.</p>
                  <p>The whole length therefore of this Model or Foot-measure will consist of 60. Inches;
every one of which is again to be sub-divided into 10. equal parts, which lesser
parts I call Minutes; so that through this division of our Measure into Feet, Inches,
and Minutes, the total of the Minutes will amount to the number of 600. there being
in each of the 6. Feet 100. Now, for the measuring of a mans Body by this Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we are thus to proceed: Having divided our Ruler according to the foresaid
manner, we are to measure and observe by the application thereof, the distances of
the parts of the said Body; as for instance, how high it may be from the sole of the
Foot to the crown of the Head, or how far distant any one member is from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
As, how many Inches and Minutes it may be from the Knee to the Navel, or
to the cannel bone of the Throat, and so in like manner any other parts; Nor is this
course to be at all slighted or derided either by <hi>Sculptors</hi> or <hi>Painters,</hi> since it is a
thing most profitable, and absolutely necessary; for as much as the certain measure
of all the parts being once known, we shall have gain'd a most easy and speedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
how to proceed in our work with any of the said parts or members
without committing the least error: Never think it a matter worth regard or notice,
if any capricious humorist shall peradventure find fault that this member is too long,
or that too short; since your Model or Foot-measure (which is the rule that must
always direct and govern your work, and then which you cannot go by a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
guide) will soon determine whether you have proceeded well or ill; and
doubtless when you shall have maturely consider'd and examin'd these things, you
will not be to seek in those infinite other advantages wherein this Foot-measure will
prove serviceable, especially in knowing how with absolute certainty to limit and
determine the longitude of the parts in a Statue of a greater magnitude, as well as in
one of a lesser.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:53015:87"/>So as if it should happen that you were to make a Statue of 10. Cubits, or what
ever other dimension, it would be requisite to have your Ruler, Model, or Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measure
likewise of 10. Cubits, and divided into six equal parts, which should have
the same correspondence one with another, as those of the lesser Ruler: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
should the Inches and Minutes be proportion'd, whence also the use and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of working would be the same with the other; since half the numbers of the
greater have the same proportion to the whole intire, as half the numbers of the lesser
have to the whole Intire of the lesser. Wherefore according as the size of your work
happens to fall out, your Ruler is to be made proportionably.</p>
                  <p>We come next to treat of the Squares, which are to be two; the first of which
shall be made after this manner: Let two Rulers, in the nature of streight lines, <hi>i. e.</hi>
A. B. and B. C. be joyn'd together so as to make a right angle; the first Ruler A. B.
falling perpendicular, the other B. C. serving for the Base: The bigness of these
Squares is to be so order'd, that their Bases consist of at least 15. Inches, according
to the proportion of your main Ruler, which, as we have said before, is to be made
bigger, or lesser answerable to the proportion of the Body you would measure:
These Inches therefore with their points and Minutes (however they may fall out) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken exactly from the said Ruler, you must set down upon your Base, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to rockon from the point of the Angle B. and so Proceeding on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards C.</p>
                  <p>The Square being thus mark'd and divided, as is to be seen in the example A. B.
C. there is to be adjoyn'd unto it another Square made after the same manner, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as it is demonstrated by the letters D. F. G. so as that G. F. may serve both for
streight Line and Base to both. Now to shew the use of these instruments, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to measure the Diameter of the thickest part of the Head H. I. K. by bringing the
two streight Rulers A. B. and D. F. of each Square exactly opposite to each other, to
touch the two opposite points of the thickest part of the Head, and by applying inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
to one and the same Level, the Base-lines of the said squares; by which
means from the points H. I. which are touch'd by the streight Rulers of the said
Squares, we shall discover the exact Diameter of the Head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:53015:87"/>
                     <figure/>
And after this manner, the thickness and bigness of any part of the Body whatsoever
may with great ease and accurateness be found out: Many uses and advantages we
could reckon up, which might be made of this Ruler and these Squares, were it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to insist now upon them; there being several other waies, much after the same
manner, which the meanest capacity may of himself find out, for the measuring of
the Diameter of any part; as for example, suppose one would know how much the
Diameter is from one Ear to the other, and where abouts it intersects the other Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
which passes from the Head to the Nuca, or the like. Lastly our Workman
may safely make use of this Ruler and these Squares as most faithful guides and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours,
not only for the performing of any part of his Work, but also at the very
first, and before he sets upon it, he will receive much light by the help of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
how to begin and go about it; in so much that there will not be the least
part of the Statue he is to make, which he will not before have examin'd and consider'd
and render'd most easy and familiar to him; For Example. Who but a very arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
person would take upon him to be a Master-Ship-wright that had not the perfect
knowledg of all the several parts of a Ship, and how one kind of Ship differs from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and what those particular parts are which belong to one Ship more then to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
And yet who is there of our Sculptors, let him be a man never so subtile and
experienc'd in his Art, who if it should be demanded of him, upon what ground or
consideration he has made this Member after this manner, or what may be the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this or that Member to the whole structure of the Body? I say, who is there so
diligent and accurate as to have well consider'd and observ'd all that is requisite, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53015:88"/>
which becomes that Person to know who would perform as he should do the Art where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he makes profession? whereas doubtlesly all Arts and faculties are most advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
learn'd by rule and method, and by the knowledg of some demonstrable ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that is to be perform'd; nor shall any one attain to the perfection of any Art
whatsoever, who hath not first comprehended every several part and branch of the
said Art. But thus having sufficiently treated of <hi>Measure</hi> and <hi>Proportion,</hi> and after
what manner it is to be found out by the Ruler and Squares; it remains that we
speak next of <hi>Limitation</hi> or the prescribing of <hi>Bounds:</hi> This prescription of <hi>Limits</hi> is
the determining or fixing of a certain period in the drawing of all our Lines, so as
to direct to what point they are to be continu'd, whether extended out in length,
or reversed; how Angles are to be fix'd, how parts are to be raised, or depress'd by
<hi>Alto, or Basso Relievo,</hi> as Artists tearm it; each <hi>Line, Angle</hi> and <hi>Reliev</hi> having their
due and certain places assign'd them by the conduct of a sure and perfect rule: And
the best way to put this rule of <hi>Limitation</hi> in practice, will be by a Line and Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
falling from a certain determinate Center plac'd in the middle, whereby the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
and extremities of all the lines may be mark'd out and taken notice of, as far
as the utmost bounds every way of the said Body extends: But between the measure
describ'd above, and this assignation of <hi>Limits,</hi> there is this difference, namely, that
that Measure looks farther backward, and springs from a more native and original
consideration, as grounded upon more common and universal principles, which are
by Nature more firmly and substantially inhaerent in all Bodies; as the <hi>lenght, large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>thickness</hi> of the parts; whereas the prescribing of <hi>Bounds</hi> is grounded upon
the present and accidental variety of postures, resulting from the different dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
and motions of the several parts of the Body, shewing the manner how to
limit and fashion those postures, according to the <hi>maxims</hi> of Rule and Art.</p>
                  <p>Now, for the better performance of this last part of Regular Operation, we shall
recommend this following Instrument, which is to consist of three parts or
branches; that is to say, an <hi>Horizon,</hi> a <hi>Style,</hi> and a <hi>Plumb:</hi> The <hi>Horizon</hi> is a <hi>Plane</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
upon a Circle, which Circle is to be divided into equal parts mark'd with their
several members, and their subdivisions set over against each part: The <hi>Style</hi> is a
streight Ruler, one end whereof is fixt in the center of the said Circle, the other end
moves about at pleasure, so as that it may be easily transfer'd and directed from one
division of the Circle to another: The <hi>Plumb</hi> or <hi>Plummet</hi> is a line or thread which
falls parallel from the top of the <hi>Style</hi> down to the Floor or Plane, upon which the
Statue or Figure stands whose members and lineatures are to be measur'd and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
For the manner of making this Instrument, let it be thus; Take a Board well
plan'd and smooth'd, upon which let a Circle be drawn having three Foot diameter,
and let the extremity of the said Circle's circumference be divided into equal parts,
according as <hi>Astrologers</hi> divide their <hi>Astrolabes,</hi> which parts we will call Degrees; and
let every of these Degrees be subdivided again into as many other parts as shall be
thought fit; as for example, suppose every Degree be subdivided into six lesser
parts, which we may call Minutes; to all which degrees adjoyn the several numbers,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53015:88"/>
                     <hi>viz.</hi> 1. 2. 3. 4. with the rest in order, till the numbers belonging to all the degrees
be set down. This Circle, thus made and order'd, we call'd the <hi>Horizon,</hi> to which
we are to fit our moveable <hi>Style,</hi> being also to be made after this manner; Take a
thin streight Ruler, three Foot in length, and fasten one of the ends thereof (with a
pegg) to the center of its <hi>Horizon</hi> or Circle, in such a manner, that though the said
end is not to be mov'd from the Center, yet the pegg that fastens it is so far to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax'd,
that the whole Ruler may have liberty to move and play about from one part
of the Circle to another, whilest the other extream extends it self a good way beyond
the circumference of the said Circle about which it is to be mov'd: Upon this
Ruler or <hi>Style,</hi> mark out the Inches it is to contain, distinguishing them with several
points between, after the manner of the Module or Foot-measure above mention'd;
and these Inches must also be subdivided into lesser equal parts, as was likewise done
in the foresaid Foot-measure; and then beginning from the Center, adjoyn to the
Inches also their several numbers, <hi>viz. 1. 2. 3. 4. &amp;c.</hi> Lastly, to this <hi>Style</hi> annex a
line and <hi>Plummet.</hi> This whole Instrument thus describ'd consisting of <hi>Horizon,
Ruler,</hi> and <hi>Plummet</hi> we shall call our <hi>Definitor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Definitor</hi> is to be made use of in this manner: Suppose the <hi>Original,</hi> or
<hi>Copie,</hi> the limits of whose parts we would determine, were a Statue of <hi>Phidias,</hi> holding
with the left hand, on one side of a <hi>Chariot,</hi> the Raines of a Horses Bridle: This
<hi>Definitor</hi> is to be set upon the head of the Statue in such sort, that it may lye exactly
level upon the plane of the Center, being plac'd just upon the very midst of the head
of the Statue, where it is to be made fast with a pegg: Then note that point where
it is fastned upon the head of the Statue, and mark it by setting up a needle or pin
for the Center of the Circle: Next, by turning the Instrument about from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
place in the <hi>Horizon,</hi> make out the first design'd degree, so as you may know
from whence it is mov'd; which may best be done after this following manner:
Bring about the moveable Ruler, which is the <hi>Style,</hi> upon which the thread and
<hi>Plummet</hi> hangs, till it arrive at that place of the <hi>Horizon</hi> where the first degree of the
<hi>Horizon</hi> is to be set down; and holding it fast there, turn it about together with the
whole Circle thereof, until the line of the <hi>Plummet</hi> touch some principal part of the
Statue, that is to say, some member particularly noted above all the rest, as the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the right Hand or so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:53015:89"/>
                     <figure/>
Which may serve as the appointed place from whence upon every new occasion
the whole <hi>Definitor</hi> may be mov'd, and afterwards brought back again to the same
place where it stood at first upon the said Statue; yet so, that by the turning of the
<hi>Style</hi> about the Pin, which pierceth from the top of the head of the Statue, through
the Center of the <hi>Definitor,</hi> the <hi>Plummet</hi> which before fell from the first degree of the
<hi>Horizon,</hi> may return to touch the foresaid Finger of the right Hand. These things
thus order'd and design'd, suppose that we would take the angle of the right Elbow,
so as to keep the knowledg of it in mind, or to write it down; the way is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
Fix the <hi>Definitor</hi> with its Center which is upon the head of the Statue, in the
place and manner aforesaid, in such sort, that the Plane whereon the <hi>Horizon</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd,
may stand firme and immoveable; then turn about the moveable <hi>Style,</hi> till
the line of the <hi>Plummet</hi> come to touch the left Elbow of the Statue which we would
measure: But in the performing of this sort of Operation there are three things to be
observ'd, which will much conduce to our purpose: The first is, That we mark how
far the <hi>Style</hi> in the <hi>Horizon</hi> comes to be distant from the place where it shall have
been first mov'd, taking notice upon what degree of the <hi>Horizon</hi> the <hi>Style</hi> lies, whether
on the twentieth, thirtyeth or whatsoever other: Secondly, Observe by the Inches,
and Minutes mark'd in the <hi>Style,</hi> how far distant the Elbow shall be from the Center
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53015:89"/>
of the Circle: Lastly, take notice by placing the Module or Foot-measure perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
upon the Plane whereon the Statue stands, how many Inches and Minutes the
said Elbow is raised above the said Plane, and write down these measures in a Book
or piece of paper: For example, thus, the angle of the left Elbow is found in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon</hi>
to be 10. Degrees and 5. Minutes; in the <hi>Style</hi> or Ruler 7. Degrees and 3.
Minutes; that of the Plane in the Module amounts to 40. Degrees and 4. Minutes;
and thus by the same rule may be measur'd and computed all the rest of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
parts of the said Statue or Copy; as for instance: The angles of the Knees, and
of the Shoulders and other such like parts that are to be reckoned among the <hi>Relievi:</hi>
But if you would measure Concavities, or those parts which recede inward, and are
so remov'd out of the reach of sight and easy access, that the <hi>Plummet</hi>-line cannot
come to touch them (as it happens in the Concavities beneath the Shoulders, in the
regions of the reins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) the best way to find them is as follows: Add to the <hi>Style</hi>
or Ruler another <hi>Plummet</hi>-line which may reach as far as the said Concavitie; how
far distant it be from the first, it is not material, since by these two <hi>Plummet</hi>-lines
falling perpendicularly, and being intersected by the <hi>Gnomon</hi> of the plain Superficies
above to which they are fastned, and which extends it self as far as the Center of the
Statue, it will appear how much the second <hi>Plummet</hi>-line is nearer then the first to the
Center of the <hi>Definitor,</hi> which is therefore call'd the middle perpendicular.</p>
                  <p>These things thus demonstrated, being once sufficiently understood, it will be an
easy matter to comprehend what we before commended to your Observation; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that if the said Statue should chance to have been cover'd over to a certain thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with <hi>Wax</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> you might yet by a Piercer, with great ease, readyness, and
certainty come to find out whatsoever point or tearm you would desire to find in
the said Statue; for as much as it may be clearly demonstrated, that by the turning
about of this <hi>Gnomon,</hi> the Level makes a circular Line like the Superficies of a <hi>Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
with which sort of figure the Statue so superinduc'd as aforesaid, seems to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
and incircled: This Position establish'd, you may safely inferr, that as by
making way through the Ayr (the Statue not being cover'd with <hi>Wax</hi> or <hi>Earth</hi>) you
guide your Piercer directly towards the Point T. (which for example's sake we will
suppose to be the <hi>Relievo</hi> of the Chin) by the same reason, if the Statue were cover'd
over with <hi>Wax</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> might you by boaring through the said <hi>Wax</hi> or <hi>Earth</hi> attain
the point aim'd at, the <hi>Wax</hi> or <hi>Earth</hi> possessing but the same place which otherwise
the Ayr would have done: From what hath been thus discours'd concerning these
things, it may be concluded, that the effect we mention'd before concerning the
making of one half of the Statue in the Isle of <hi>Pharos,</hi> and finishing the other half in
the Mountains of <hi>Carrara,</hi> is a thing not only not impossible but very easy to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;
For let the said Statue or Model of <hi>Phidias</hi> be divided into two segments,
and suppose, for example, this Section of a plain Superficies be made in the Wast or
Girdling place, doubtless by the only assistance of our <hi>Definitor</hi> it will be easy to mark
out in the Circle of the Instrument whatsoever points shall be thought fit, belonging
to the divided Superficies: These things granted to be feasible, you shall not need to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53015:90"/>
make any question of being able to find out at pleasure in the Model, any part what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
you shall desire to find; and that only by drawing a small red line in the
Model, which serves in stead of an interfection of the <hi>Horizon,</hi> in the place where this
segment should terminate, if the Statue were divided; and the points so mark'd will
direct you the way how the work may be finished: And in like manner may other
things be done, as hath been said before. Finally, by the whole discourse here made
concerning all these particulars, it is sufficiently evident, that all Measures, Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Limitations are to be taken, whether in the Life, or Copie, by a most certain
and infallible rule for the bringing of any work to perfection in this Art; and we
could wish that this way of proceeding were more seriously intended by all our
<hi>Painters,</hi> and <hi>Sculptors,</hi> since, if it were, they would soon come to find the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
benefit of it: But because all things are most illustrated by example, and that
the paines we have already taken in this matter may conduce to the greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
we have thought fit to bestow yet a little farther labour in describing the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of all the principal parts in mans Body; and not only the parts of this or that
particular man, but as far as was possible, even the very perfection of all beautiful
and excellent proportions; the several parts whereof having observ'd in several hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
bodies, some excelling chiefly in this, some in that external gift of Nature, we
have thought material to set down in writing; following the example of him, who
being imploy'd by the <hi>Crotoniati</hi> to make the Statue of their <hi>Goddess,</hi> went about col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
from the most beautiful Virgins (whom, among many, he with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
search'd out) those proportions and handsome Features wherein each of them
principally excell'd, and apply'd them to his own Statue. Since much after the
same manner we, having taken the Draught from those Bodies, that of divers others
were judg'd, by the most sagacious in this inquiry, to be the most exactly built and
compos'd, with all their several measures and proportions; and comparing them
exactly together, to observe wherein they excell'd, or were excell'd each by the other,
have made choice out of this variety of models and examples, of those middle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
which seem'd to us most agreeable, and which we have here set down by
the lengths, bignesses and thicknesses of all the principal and most noted parts;
and in the first place the lengths are these following.

                  <p>By means of these measures it may easily be computed what proportions all the
parts and members of the Body have one by one to the whole length of the Body;
and what agreement and symmetric they have among themselves, as also how they
vary or differ one from another; which things we certainly conclude most profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and fit to be known: Nor were it from the purpose to particularize how the
parts vary and alter, according to the several gestures incident to humane Bodies, as,
whether they by Sitting, or Inclining to this, or that side: But we shall leave the
more curious disquisition into these things, to the diligence and industry of our <hi>Artist.</hi>
It would also be of very much conducement, to be well inform'd of the number of the
Bones, the Muscles, and risings of the Nerves; and especially to know how, by certain
rules, to take the circumferences of particular divisions of Bodies, separately consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
from the rest, by an inspection into those parts which are not outwardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to sight: In like manner as if a Cylinder should be cut down right through
the middle, so as out of that part of the Cylinder which is visible throughout, there
should be separated, by a circular section through the whole length of the figure, an
inward consimilar part which was before unseen, so as to make of the same Cylinder
two Bodies, whose Bases should be alike, and of the same form, as being indeed
wholly compriz'd within the same lines and circles throughout: By the observation
of which sort of Section is to be understood the manner of separation of the parts
and Bodies before intimated; for as much as the designe of the line by which the

that whichlies hid from the sight, is to be drawn just in the same manner; and this
design being delineated on a Wall, would represent such a Figure as would be much
like a Shadow projected thereupon from some interposing light, and which should
Illuminate it from the same point of the <hi>Ayr,</hi> where at first the beholders Eye was
plac'd: But this kind of division or separation, and the way of designing things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner, belongs more properly to the <hi>Painter</hi> then the <hi>Sculptor,</hi> and in that
capacity we shall treat of them more largely elsewhere. Moreover, it is of main
