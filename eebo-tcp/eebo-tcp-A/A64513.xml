            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Firſt day of the Seſſions, being the 11th. of the ſixth Moneth, eleven of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> were fetched out of Priſon, and led before the Judgement Seat at <hi>Old Baley,</hi> and immediately were called by Name and ſet to the Bar, and the Indictment was read againſt them on this wiſe <hi>(viz.) For being at an unlawful Tumultuous meeting, with force and Arms, to the Diſturbance of the Peace of the King, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to him, and to the terrour of the People, and to the evil exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all others in the li<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ly to Anſwer, Guilty or not guilty; and one <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, that he was taken up in the Street, and not g<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

               </gap> to Anſwer, demanded a Copy of his Indictment, which was denyed him, except ſo much money were given for it; And <hi>D. Baker</hi> anſwered, that he was both innocent and guiltleſs of the Manner or Tennor of the Indictment, and his innocent Soul and Life did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt the ſame; and furthermore he ſaid, That they expected Juſtice and Equity, and for them to give Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgement, they being Innocent People; But Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Brown</hi> upon the Bench, mocked with a whining voice, as if it were the ſound of a Dog or Cat, and not like a man, eſpecially one that is ſet to Rule over men, who ſhould be as men of God; and <hi>D. B.</hi> ſaid, It becomes not a Magiſtrate to ſcoff or mock at the Priſoners; and <hi>R. B.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, and ſaid he did not mock, but ſurely he did ſo, for thereby the Multitude were provoked to lift up their voices in laughter at his Lightneſs and Folly, in which he ſported himſelf as his manner is, and he ſaid, <hi>D. Baker</hi> did Cant, and ſuch like ſcoffing words; But he anſwered, ſaying, <hi>I ſpake in the Fear of the Lord, and I would that the ſame were ſet up, not onely in the Hearts of the Magistrates but alſo in the hearts
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41806:3"/>
of all here preſent this day;</hi> And it was demanded of him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were ready to receive his Tryal, and he ſaid, he was ready to receive Juſtice and Judgement, and they ſeemed to be diſpleaſed at his Reply; and it was put to him by the Court, whether he would be Tryed by a Jury, and he ſaid on this wiſe; He ſuppoſed there were men upon the Bench that might be ſufficient to hear and determine the matter without a Jury, as to the Particulars in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and they therefore turned him by, and others of the Priſoners did give their anſwer accordingly, and one ſaid, That he was guilty of what was Truth, and not guilty of the contrary in the Indictment; And the Court ſaid, That if the Priſoners were guilty of one part, they were guilty of the whole; To which was replyed, Not ſo, for as it was Matter of Conſcience to them to bear witneſs for the Truth, ſo it was Matter of Conſcience to bear witneſs againſt the contrary; and it was ſaid p<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ure, there might be ſome words in the Indictment <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> themſelves might be true; and others of the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>eas to the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they accepted of, for not <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and others becauſe they did not plead ſo in their Form and manner of Tearms, they would not allow of their pleas for not guilty. Albeit, one was nothing at all concerned in the matter, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up as an innocent man in the ſtreet, without the breach of any Law, either of God or Man, and had then ſuffered more then thirty dayes Impriſonment, and been before the Judgement Seat twice, at two ſeveral Seſſions, and not tryed, nor his Innocent cauſe pleaded, nor he ſet at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but with many more have been thus taken too and fro, and hurried to Priſon and from Priſon, to the Judgement Seat, and from Judgement to Priſon again, but the Lord God of Judgement will be eaſed of his Adverſaries, &amp; plead the Cauſe of Innocency, and Recompence Vengeance in his ſore diſpleaſure upon the Head of his Enemies in one day; Behold, behold, it haſteneth and cometh to paſs.</p>
            <p>And ſo becauſe they could not try them all, they ſaid they would try none of them till next Seſſions, and ſo ſent them all to Priſon again, but as the Jaylors was hurrying of them away, <hi>D. Baker</hi> ſpake the words of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41806:3"/>
ſacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the next Morning he wrote a few Lines to Alderman <hi>Adams,</hi> to the end he might move it to the reſt of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates upon the Bench, that they might be called to a Tryal, ſeeing they had dealt ſo with them the day before; and forthwith the Marſhal of the City was ſent, to demand of them or move them to it, <hi>(viz.) If that they wovld con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to him that they were at a Meeting, and at ſuch a Meeting as was mentioned in the Indictment, they ſhould go and be Tryed, and favoured it may be, with a ſmall Fine,</hi> he ſaid; But in the Fear and Name of the Living God he was withſtood, and the Priſoners kept out of the ſnare, and they let him know that his Meſſage did tend to ſo much, as if he ſhould come to perſwade innocent men that they were thieves, and confeſs it to him when they were guiltleſs; And he ſaid, <hi>What Anſwer ſhall I return the Court?</hi> After we had debated the Matter, we ſaid again and again, That if we ſhould confeſs that we were not at all at a Meeting, then we ſhould not confeſs to, but deny the Truth; for its true, we were at a Meeting, and it was a Meeting of the Innocent, Harmleſs People of God, to Worſhip Him; But we denyed and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed againſt ſuch a Meeting ſpoken of in the Indictment, of which we were wholly Innocent and Guiltleſs, after this manner we ſpoke to him, and he went his way, ſaying, <hi>Its in vain, then all would be to no purpoſe,</hi> and ſuch like words; and nothing further was done in that matter.</p>
            <p>The twelfth day of the Moneth, being the third day of the week, firſt about twenty of the Priſoners were fetched out of <hi>New-gate</hi> by their Keepers, and led to the Seſſions Houſe, where were ſitting on the Bench, the Mayor of the City, Alderman <hi>Adams,</hi> Alderman <hi>Brown,</hi> and Counſellor <hi>Howel,</hi> who ſat Judge at Law of the Court, as Deputy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder; And <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> was preſently called by Name to the Bar, with about eight perſons more of them called <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts;</hi> and being ſet at the Bar, the Jury men were called and Sworn, the ſame who had ſerved the day before, and at the ſecond perſon laying his hand upon the Book, <hi>E. B.</hi> moved the Court in theſe words; Deſiring to know what priviledge the Law of the Land allowed the Priſoners in making exceptions againſt the Jury men, this he deſired
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41806:4"/>
to know of the Bench he ſaid, becauſe he did not know the particular points of the Law in that caſe; To which the Deputy Recorder anſwered, they might make exceptions if they had good reaſons for it; but the Perſons being ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to all the Priſoners, they made no exceptions, having no knowledge of the men, and ſo could not well except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any of them. The Jury been ſworn, the ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments were read in the Court, <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> the firſt of all, according as the Priſoners ſtood Indicted at the Seſſions about five weeks before, a Relation of which Proceedings, with the Indictment Verbatim, ye have in our <hi>Second part of the Cry of the Innocent for Juſtice,</hi> lately publiſhed, though for our more orderly manifeſting the Truth to the perfect knowledge of all men, tis neceſſary that we inſert again in this place, the ſaid Indictment, which is as followeth, <hi>(viz.)</hi>

in the Form of the Indictment they had heard, and had pleaded not guilty of the ſaid Indictment; Therefore according to their Oaths, they were to make true inquiry between our Lord the King, &amp; the Priſoner at the Bar, in the caſe for which he ſtood Indicted, and without favour or affection to try the matter, and give their verdict according to their evidence, whether the Priſoner were guilty in Form and Matter as he ſtood Indicted.</hi> This was the ſum of the Charge given to the Jury.

Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> in particular was ſet to the Bar, and three men cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Name for to give evidence (to wit) <hi>William Branch, Thomas Glover,</hi> and <hi>Henry Walker,</hi> all of them of the Pariſh of <hi>Mary Maudlyn</hi>'s <hi>Old Fiſhſtreet,</hi> all of whom took their Oath according to form, <hi>That they ſhould ſpeak the Truth, and nothing but the Truth concerning the matter inquired of them, as God ſhould help them;</hi> And having taken their Oaths, they were bid to look upon the Priſoner, and ſpeak what they could ſay concerning him as to the matter for which he ſtood there Indicted; Accordingly the firſt began to ſpeak on this wiſe, That whereas he being an Officer in Captain <hi>Coulcheſter</hi>'s Company, was commanded by his Captain on a certain day (being the Sabbath day as he ſaid) to go with three files of Muſqueteers to the <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi> where the <hi>Quakers</hi> were met, in Order to break their Meeting as he was commanded; and then and there he found the ſaid people met together, to the number of about three or four hundred, as he might ſuppoſe, but juſtly he could not tell how many, and amongſt them this ſame Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> (ſaid he) now at the Bar, this ſame perſon was ſtanding upon a place, and ſpeaking amongſt them, ſpeaking, yes, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them in their way, (ſaid he;) and further, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his party to martch up the Meeting to the place where this Perſon (now at the Bar) ſtood, and he bad him come down and ceaſe ſpeaking, but he would not, but made ſome reſiſtance; whereupon he commanded his men to pull him down by force, which accordingly they did, and then took him out of the Meeting, and he and his men guarded him to <hi>Pauls</hi> where their main guard was, and he delivered him (this ſame perſon now at the Bar) to his Captain, and this I teſtifie upon my Oath, ſaid he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This done, the ſecond perſon was called to ſpeak what he could ſay in that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41806:5"/>
caſe concerning the Priſoner at the Bar; to which he ſaid, he could ſay to the ſame purpoſe that the perſon before had teſtified, That whereas he was one of that partie command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go to the Bull and Mouth where the <hi>Quakers</hi> were met together, and there they found this ſame <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> now at the Bar, Preaching amongſt the People, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to command they pulled him down, and took him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to their Captain, and this was all he could ſay. Then the third evidence was called, and he was asked by the Court what he could ſay in the Caſe concerning the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, his anſwer was, That he had onely to ſay what the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two before him had ſaid; That whereas he was one of the party of Souldiers commanded to go to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meeting, and there was this man (now at the Bar) ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and Preaching amongſt them, and they pulled him down, and took him away to their Captain, and he had no more to ſay; Thus the evidences gave witneſs, and this was the ſum of what was ſaid by them all. Then the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Recorder asked of them, if they were certain this Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was the ſelf ſame man, and how many people they thought were at the Meeting; to which they all anſwered yes, they were ſure this ſame perſon was the man, and there might be ſome hundreds at the Meeting, but how many they could not juſtly tell.</p>
            <p>Then the Court ſpoke to <hi>E. Burroughs,</hi> and asked him, <hi>What he had to ſay for himſelf in this matter he ſtood there Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and had pleaded not guilty, and he had heard the Witneſſes againſt him, and if he had ought to ſay he might now ſpeak.</hi> To which he began to ſpeak on this wiſe, That he was glad he was permitted to ſpeak in defence of his Cauſe, and he hoped they would fully hear him in what he had to ſay; He was no Lawyer, and therefore unskilled in the particular points of the Law, and ſhould not take in hand to proceed as ſuch a one, but in as much as God had given him a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Reaſon, and a property of Juſtice, and a principle of Equity, to diſcern of different things, he ſhould make uſe of the ſame, to defend the Innocency of his Cauſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Charges falſly laid againſt him in the Indictment; and therefore he deſired their patience to hear—but while going on in this Diſcourſe, to moderate the Court,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41806:5"/>
and to prepare their minds for Audience, and that he might come diſcreetly to the matter; the Judge of the Court ſtopped him, and interrupted his Speech, and told the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, <hi>That he muſt be pertinent and brief, for they had much to do, and could not be held in long diſcourſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which the Priſoner replyed, his Cauſe was weighty, and deſired time of deliberate hearing, in order to ſound Judgement; and he now was to plead on the behalf of his Life and Liberty, for ought he knew, it might prove ſo; but he ſhould (God willing) be as brief and pertinent in what he ſhould ſay, as the Caſe in hand would permit; yet could he not be bound up to ſo many words, nor to ſuch a moment of time; but now he would proceed to make his exceptions, which was as to the Witneſſes, that they were not competent Witneſſes, for—About this time the <hi>Judge</hi> interrupted again, and asked the Priſoner, <hi>What Countrey man he was;</hi> To which was replyed by the Priſoner, Let the Court take notice (ſaid he) how that but a very little before, thou deſired me to keep cloſe to the matter, and to be pertinent to the purpoſe, and now thou haſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed a queſtion altogether by the buſineſſe, to lead me from the occaſion in hand, and as it were, to pervert my ſpeech from what I was going upon, and this is not very fair; at which words the Judge ſeemed highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, to be ſo taxed in the Face of the Court by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; and told him, <hi>It was not fit for a Priſoner to give ſuch words at the Bar, and the reaſon why he asked him his Name, was becauſe he had ſaid, he knew not the Laws of</hi> England, <hi>and therefore could not tell whether he was an</hi> Engliſh <hi>man, for every</hi> Engliſh <hi>man muſt needs know the Law of the Land;</hi> To which <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> replyed, he onely ſaid, he knew not the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular points, or every particular point of the Law, and not that he knew nothing at all of the Laws; and as to his Countrey, he had been for the moſt part at <hi>London</hi> for this divers years, and did pertain to this City; and deſired he might be permitted to go on in his defence of his cauſe, and to ſhew his exceptions againſt the Witneſſes, which the Court gave him leave to do: And then he did aſſert, that the ſaid perſons were not competent Witneſſes in this Caſe, and therefore their evidence ought not to be taken, againſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41806:6"/>
him, for they were a party againſt him, and not indifferent men, and they could not Juſtly and according to right, be both Party, Proſecutors and Witneſſes againſt him; That they were a party, it was manifeſt by their own words; in as much as they had teſtified, they took him ſo and ſo, in the capacity of Souldiers, by force of Arms, which was not by due proſecution of the Law of the Land by civil Officers, by Warrant from ſome Civil Magiſtrate, or by Conſtable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Priſoner further teſtified in theſe Words, That theſe men who now appeared againſt him as Witneſſes had themſelves violated the Law of the Land, and done vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence unto the Laws and Government of <hi>England,</hi> in that by force of Arms, and not by due proceſſe at Law, they had ſeized upon his perſon, contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>No man ſhall be taken, or impriſoned, or diſceized of his freehold, but by the Law of the Land;</hi> And alſo the Kings late Proclamation, of the eleventh of <hi>January,</hi> 1660. (which then he held in his hand at the Bar) wholly prohibiting ſuch manner of ſeizing upon mens perſons as he would ſhew them, by reading the very words of the Proclamation if they would permit him; and therefore, in as much as theſe three Perſons now witneſſes againſt him; had done thus contrary to the Law of the Land, and againſt the very form and force of the Kings Proclamation, in apprehending and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him by force of Arms, by reaſon of which they were liable to an Action at Law, if he pleaſed to bring it againſt them, for ſuch their illegal ſeizing upon him, and this both the Court and Witneſſes themſelves knew might be done, and therefore to Juſtifie themſelves in ſuch their unjuſt Action, and to ſave themſelves from what danger they were liable to for the ſame; they did now come witneſſes againſt him, and their now giving Teſtimony againſt him was to their own advantage, and to juſtifie themſelves in wrong doing, and to preſerve themſelves from that danger which might juſtly come upon them; And upon this reaſon he did except againſt them as not indifferent men, nor competent Witneſſes againſt him in this Caſe,—Hereabout the Judge ſpoke to him, and told him this was not to the buſineſſe, and he muſt be ſhort, for they would not ſuffer him to make ſuch a flouriſh before them, nor to Preach and Prate to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41806:6"/>
them in the Court, and he muſt prove, <hi>That theſe men had ſeized upon him contrary to Law;</hi> to this purpoſe he ſpoke, and ſeem'd to be much offended at what the <hi>Priſoner</hi> had ſpoken.</p>
            <p>To which <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> again replyed, That theſe three perſons themſelves had out of their own mouths proved what he ſaid, they had told the Court, how they were ſent in files of Armed men, and how they ſeized upon him by force thereof, and led him away Priſoner; and they had neither lawful Warrant from any Juſtice of the Peace, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any Conſtable came with them, which he did aſſert was an illegal apprehending of him, and contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and he would but read the words of the Kings Proclamation to them (which he ſtill held in his hand for that purpoſe) and that would make it more plain,—Hereabout the Court ſtopped him again, and denyed him Liberty to read the Proclamation, ſaying, that was nothing to the purpoſe, and the Judge ſaid, <hi>He ſhould not over-rule the Court, and do not ye ſee</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>how he flouriſhes, and he would delude all the people, take him away Goaler, he muſt not be ſuffered to ſpeak thus;</hi> Then ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was to take him away by force, but it was not then done; But the Priſoner kept cloſe to his matter ſtill, telling the Court and Jury, that theſe men were not fit perſons to witneſſe againſt him, in as much as they had ſo unjuſtly and illegally taken him, &amp;c. without any warrant from any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the peace, or due proceſs of the Law of the Land, &amp;c. Hereupon Alderman <hi>Brown</hi> ſtood up, and ſaid, <hi>He would juſtifie their taking of him, and ſome ſay, he was heard to ſay on the Bench, he ſent them to the Meeting to take him, and it was lawful enough,</hi> &amp;c. And Alderman <hi>Adams</hi> ſaid, that ſeeing Sir <hi>Richard Brown</hi> had ſent him to Priſon, and ſent his men to take him, it was Lawful; for, Sir <hi>Richard Brown</hi> was a Juſtice of the Peace; To which the Priſoner replyed, That though Alderman <hi>Brown</hi> was a Juſtice of the Peace, yet in the capacitie of Major General of the City Regiments, he ſent his Officers and Souldiers to take Friends at their Meetings, and not in the place as he was a Civil Magiſtrate, for then he might and ſhould have ſent his Conſtables, or ſuch Perſons, by Warrant under his hand, and not rude Souldiers in ſuch a war like poſture; and therefore his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41806:7"/>
apprehended by theſe perſons that had witneſſed againſt him in the capacity of Souldiers, ſtill made it appear, they were not competent witneſſes in this Caſe againſt him, for they were a party, and violaters of the Law themſelves, &amp;c. Here again the Court interrupted him, and the Judge told him, <hi>That their evidence was good enough, and that if they had wronged him, he had his liberty of the Law againſt them, and might do what he would in that caſe, but their evidence the Jury might take;</hi> To which was replyed again by the Priſoner, that if their evidence was taken, and he thereupon brought in guilty, and ſo condemned, and upon that caſt into cloſe Priſon there remaining, how ſhould he be capable to help himſelf in any proſecution of the ſaid men, if he had a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thereunto, and alſo the Judgement of the Court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him upon their evidence, would juſtifie them in what violence they had done againſt him, and therefore now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was the time for him to except againſt the inſufficiency of the men and their evidence, or elſe never; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſired the Court and Jury to conſider the matter well ere they determined it, and alſo affirmed that he had Law and Reaſon and Truth of his ſide, and if they brought him in guilty it was not juſtly done,—Here again the Judge interupted and ſaid, <hi>He was not to be ſuffered to prate in that manner at the Bar, and cryed take him away, we will not hear him; and he would delude all the People, and he ſhould not over-rule the Court, &amp;c.</hi> And hereupon he was taken by force from the Bar, and then he cryed out he ſhould appeal to the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> for fair dealing in his Tryal; and will not the Court hear, will they not hear me in defence of Truth? whereupon the Mayor ſtood up, and called to <hi>E. Burroughs, and deſired him to ſpeak moderately and not offend the Court;</hi> To which he made anſwer, he was never yet reputed an immoderate perſon, and he ſpoke as moderately as his Cauſe would permit, and deſired not to offend any; now the reaſon of the Court being offended, was at the manner of the Priſoners diſcourſe; which was with a force over them undauntedly and confidently, and ſo boldly as if he had not been in the capacity of a Priſoner at a Bar, and ſometime acting with his hands ſtretched out, and his arms abroad, appealing to the whole people to juſtifie the truth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41806:7"/>
of what he ſpoke, and tis ſuppoſed that for ſuch cauſe, the Judge and Court took offence at him, for they ſaid often, he was peremptory, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>But after a little ſtop, the Priſoner began to ſpeak to the matter again, ſtill urging the Court and Jury, that the Witneſſes were altogether inſufficient perſons, and told them, he would once more lay it before them, and then leave it to their conſiderations; Then the Judge interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſaid on this wiſe, telling the Priſoner that he had nothing to ſay, but to theſe two things; Firſt, <hi>Whether he could prove by Witneſſes upon Oath, that he was at any other place that day and time mentioned in the Indictment, if he could do this, his Witneſſes ſhould be heard; Or ſecondly, If he was at that Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then to ſhew ſome lawful Warrant, by the Authority of the Land, for his ſo being, if he could do either of theſe, it would be heard, and might avail him, elſe he had nothing to ſay, and the Court would hear no other matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> replyed, He ſhould now ceaſe his Plea of the inſufficiency of the Witneſſes, and leave what he had ſaid to the Jury, and commit it to their Conſciences, and alſo ſhould now proceed to the Matter contained in the Indictment, for he had not yet ſpoken to that, and he had much to ſay, to ſhew the falcity of almoſt every line in it, and he had a Copy of it there in his hand for that purpoſe, to plead to it; And firſt of all he ſhould move this to the Jury, as to ſtate the point directly to them, whereupon the iſſue of the Caſe lyeth, as thus; The Caſe to be ſought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and determined by the Jury is not (ſaith he) whether I was at a Meeting at all; but whether I was at ſuch a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for which I now ſtand indicted (that is to ſay) <hi>Such a Tumultuous, Riotous Meeting, by force of Arms,</hi> &amp;c. This is the point determinable, for (ſaid he) I confeſs in my judgement, I own this Practiſe of Meeting together for the Worſhip of God, and I my ſelf have been at hundreds of ſuch Meetings,—To which <hi>Richard Brown</hi> quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>So ſhall you never be at any more;</hi> but ſaid the Priſoner, I never was in all my dayes at any ſuch Meeting as is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Indictment, and for which I am now upon my Tryal, and therefore (ſaid he) I deſire that the Jury would obſerve this very thing; and in Conſcience upon their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41806:8"/>
Oaths Judge upon this point, whether they find not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was at a Meeting, but whether I was at ſuch a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for which I now ſtand upon my Tryal, ſpecified in my Indictment; and this I ſhall leave with the Jury, ſaid the Priſoner.</p>
            <p>To which the Judge replyed, That he had ſaid lately, he knew not the Points of the Law, but now he had found out a ſtrange Point, but it ſhould do him no good, for the iſſue lay not there, but if he was at a Meeting, it was ſufficient; and <hi>Richard Brown</hi> alſo ſaid the ſame; and therefore ſaid the Judge, If ye have any thing as to the two particulars I have mentioned, ye ſhall be heard, but nothing elſe will we hear.</p>
            <p>After a little ſtop, <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> ſpoke again to the Court, and told them, That this common Law (which they had ſaid was not written) but lay in the Breaſts of the Judges (this was ſaid both then and the Seſſions before) he was not well knowing in, neither the extent of it, nor the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it; but the Parliament had lately made a Law in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular on purpoſe againſt Meetings, and it might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that their intent was by that Law, to abate the force of all other Laws, which might any wayes take hold upon any for Meeting together; and the occaſion of that Law lately made was on this wiſe; The King at and ſince his late coming into the Land, had made divers promiſes to us for the tolleration and allowance of Liberty of Conſcience, which promiſes they might expect the fulfilling of,—Here the Judge again interrupted and told him, He ſhould not be permitted to ſpeak on that wiſe, nor to over-rule the Court, and they could have no longer patience; and he ſpoke ſomewhat to the Jury, telling them, they had heard the Witneſſes againſt the Priſoner, and they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and cryed, <hi>Take him away Goaler,</hi> which accordingly was done, and they pulled and haled him by force from the Bar, though the Priſoner kept on ſpeaking, and deſired that the Court would hear him yet a little further, for he had not done, and he ſhould offer both Law and Reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Indictment, and he ſuppoſed it was his right by the Law, to ſpeak the laſt words to the Jury (in the mean time of this Diſcourſe, the Keepers were haling of him
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41806:8"/>
from the Bar) and it was a hard matter (ſaid he) not to be permitted to ſpeak for himſelf in his Cauſe, now when his Liberty was at the ſtake, and his Life too it might be, for Alderman <hi>Brown</hi> had threatened him ſo and ſo as they had heard, and he knew not but that it was to deſtroy him, and therefore of right he claimed liberty to plead his Cauſe to the Jury, who were his onely Judges in matter of Fact, and not the Court,—At which the Court ſeemed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; but by this time the Priſoner was haled quite away from the Court, and ſet by, and not ſuffered to ſpeak one word more to them in defence of his Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Then next of all were ſet to the Bar ſome perſons more of them People called <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and their Indictment was read to the Jury, and a Perſon was called to Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, who teſtified upon Oath, that the Perſons there Priſoners at the Bar, were at ſuch a day and in ſuch a place met together, and he was one of the Party ſent to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, which accordingly was done, and theſe were the very Perſons; and this was the ſum of the Evidence given againſt them. Then they were asked one by one, what they had to ſay for themſelves? To which one of them anſwered, He had little to ſay but what had been ſaid by the perſon laſt at the Bar; and he for his part ſaw that they would not hear Reaſon, and he thought they were purpoſed already to do what they would, whatſoever could be ſaid; which the Court took as ſome reflection upon them, though by the effect it was proved true, That they intended to keep them in Priſon, whatſoever their Cauſe ſhould appear to be in the Trial: Another of them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, As for meeting together to Worſhip God, it was his judgement ſo to do; yet their Meetings were peaceable, and not unlawful nor tumultuous; and to this purpoſe moſt of them anſwered, onely one Perſon told the Court, he confeſſed he <hi>was at their peaceable Meeting, and it was his judgement and Conſcience to meet together among his Friends ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from that Publick way of Idolatrous Worſhip ſet up;</hi> at which words the Court took great notice, and was much offended, and Alderman <hi>Brown</hi> cryed to the Goalers, Take him away and lay him up, for he ſhall be tryed for his life for thoſe words; they are ſeditious words, and he ſhall be tryed for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41806:9"/>
his life for them; and the Court cryed, Take him away, which accordingly was done, and he ſent into the Goal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: This is the ſubſtance of what is remembred concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, onely they pleaded much there was but one Witneſſe againſt them, and they ought not to be Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by one Witneſſe; and thus much ſhall ſuffice, for 'tis ſuppoſed ſome of themſelves may make a more exact Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the particulars concerning themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Court and Jury having heard their Defence, or at leaſt a little of what they had to ſay for themſelves, they were ſet by; and next were called about twelve Perſons more of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſet to the Bar, and their Indictments read to the Jury; Then a Perſon was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to give Evidence, who when he had ſworn, ſaid, I am now upon my Oath, and do teſtifie that I ſaw all theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at a Meeting at a Houſe in Tower-ſtreet on ſuch a day, we being ſent (ſaid he) by our Captain to that place, a party of Muſqueteers went to that Houſe, and we found them met together, and one Preaching among them, and we ſeized upon them and brought them away, and theſe are the Perſons, and this is all that I can ſay, ſaid the witneſſe; Then the Judge ſaid he muſt mention in particular by poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at each man in particular, and ſay that he ſaw him there; to which the Witneſſe ſaid, he had their Names in a Paper, and he would look upon that, for he might not know all their Faces, and theſe mens Names he thought he had there, and looking upon his Paper, he ſaid, The 27th day of <hi>May</hi> theſe perſons were taken out of a Meeting, and he himſelf was one that took them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon which one of the Priſoners, an antient man, <hi>Robert Craven</hi> by name, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Witneſſe, and asked him in theſe words, <hi>Didſt thou ſee me there at that Meeting?</hi> and the Witneſſe being a little ſtruck in his Conſcience, ſaid Nay, I did not ſee you there, though before he had ſaid upon Oath he ſaw them all there: Alſo one <hi>William Newill</hi> asked him alſo if he ſaw him there that day; and the Witneſſe ſaid Nay, he did not ſee him there; yet preſently afterwards ſaid he did ſee him there; which put a damp upon the Court, perceiving the Witneſſe ſo to contradict himſelf, in ſaying and unſaying, and ſtammering as he did very confuſedly; and the Auditors
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41806:9"/>
hiſſed at him, and ſome whiſpered <hi>ſhame that ſuch a mans Evidence ſhould be taken againſt honeſt men.</hi> And another of the Priſoners moved the Court to take notice of the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Evidence in this particular, whereas he had ſaid it was the 27th day of <hi>May</hi> that the Meeting was at which they were taken, and the Indictment ſignified the 25th day of the Month, and here was a contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Indictment and the Evidence, and deſired the Court and Jury that they would take notice of it; To which the Judge replied, ſpeaking to the Jury, There was ſeemingly ſome colour of Exception againſt the Witneſſe to make void his Evidence from that mans Exception, yet there was little in it for them to take notice of, for if it was the five and twentieth day of the Month as ſpecified in the Indictment, then it muſt needs be the ſeven and twentieth day, for the Law (ſaid he) ſuppoſes the Fact to be done the 25 day, and every day ſince, and ſo the 27th day; and thus the Judge of the Court <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Deputy Recorder in divers other words to this effect, ſeemed to juſtifie the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that was ſo falſe and contradictory and unſound, as was manifeſtly apparent to the whole Company that were then preſent, who did many of them well obſerve how Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and true Judgment were turned backward, and Truth and Equity could not enter, but whatſoever poor mens Caſe appeared to be in Trial, and how innocent ſoever they were found, yet it appeared the Court was reſolved to go on againſt the Priſoners, and to ſend all back to Priſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Another of the Priſoners being asked by the Court what he had to ſay? He anſwered, that the Witneſſe had ſworn falſly, 1. In that he had ſaid he ſaw all the Perſons named in the Indictment at that Meeting. 2. After he had ſo ſaid upon his Oath, yet he confeſſed that two of them he ſaw not there. 3. In that he had ſaid there was one Preaching among them when they were taken in the Meeting, this was a Lye. The Mayor ſpoke to the Priſoner, and bad him Confeſſe he was at the Meeting, and he ſhould be dealt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably withal: To which the Priſoner replyed, I am not guilty of being at ſuch a Meeting as is mentioned in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, but meeting together in the fear of God for his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41806:10"/>
Worſhip, I own and am content to ſuffer for, if it be the loſſe of my natural life; but the Witneſſe (ſaid the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner) hath ſworn falſly, and he that will ſwear will lye, according to the proverb; and he bad the Jury do in the caſe with him, as they would be done unto.</p>
            <p>Another of the Priſoners looked upon the perſon, who Witneſſed againſt them, and he asked him, Art thou ſure thou ſaw me at the day and place at that Meeting; The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe anſwered, Yes, I am ſure I ſaw you there; and ſaid the Priſoner again to him, And didſt not thou then ſee alſo how <hi>Richard Brown</hi> did beat me, and kick me, and ſtrike me under the Chin when I was before him at his Houſe the ſame time I was ſent to priſon, which was a ſhame to any Magiſtrate to do ſo with any if never ſo great a malefactor; Well, but ſaid the Priſoner further, <hi>I confeſſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I was at that Meeting, as my duty to God it was ſo to be; and I am perſwaded the time will come, and that I ſhall live to ſee it with theſe ſame bodily eyes, that we ſhall meet together at that place, when you will not be there to diſturbe us.</hi> At which words the Court ſeemed not to take much notice, onely the Judge told the Priſoners, and partly directing his ſpeech alſo to the Jury, That there was nothing to be ſaid by the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that the Court or Jury could regard, as matter of weight on the Priſoners behalf, ſaving the two things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, (to wit) Firſt, Whether they could prove by good evidence, that they were at any other place that day and time mentioned in the Indictment, if this could be done, they ſhould be heard. Or, Secondly, if they were ſo met together, then to ſhew ſome lawful war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for ſo doing, by the Authority of the Land; to either of theſe two things they ſhould be heard, elſe not to ſay any more, for they would not hear them; to which ſome of the Priſoners began to ſay ſomewhat, but were not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Court, and then the Goalers took them away and ſet that Company by.</p>
            <p>Then was called to the Bar about 8 or 10 Perſons more of them called <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and their Indictments were read to the Jury, and a Perſon called and Sworn to give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt them; who gave his witneſſe on this wiſe, That whereas he was Commanded by his Captain to go
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41806:10"/>
with a party of men to <hi>Beech-lane,</hi> where they were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe People were met together; accordingly he and his Party marched to that place, where he found theſe Perſons now at the Bar in a Meeting, and ſuch a one of them Preaching, and he and his Souldiers did take theſe men out of the Meeting, and brought them away to the Guard; and this was the ſumme of his Evidence: Then the Priſoners were asked by the Court, what they had to ſay for themſelves. To which ſome anſwered, the Indictment was falſe every line of it, and as many lies in it as lines, which the Court ſeemed offended at; Another of them ſaid, that for his part he ſaw it was to no purpoſe to ſay any thing, for they would not hear Reaſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould be ſilent; Another ſaid, That whereas it was ſaid in the Indictment, they were met together by force and Arms, This was falſe, for they were neither in force nor arms, to which the Judge replyed on this wiſe, <hi>That was onely matter of form in Law,</hi> in that it was ſaid, <hi>by force and Arms,</hi> and the Law ſuppoſed, that whatſoever act or thing was done contrary to the Law of the Land, it muſt be concluded by the Judges of the Law, that that Act and thing was done by force and Arms, becauſe contrary to the Law; Thus the Deputy Recorder <hi>Howel,</hi> the preſent Judge of the Court, ſpoke to ſatisfie the Jury, as if that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding every word in the Indictment was not abſolute true in the plaineſt ſence, yet one way or other by ſuch gloſs and interpretation it might ſtand true; but how this could ſatisfie the Jury-mens Conſciences, I know not, for I perfectly obſerved, that the charge to the Jury was in theſe words, <hi>to make true enquiery whether the Priſoners were guilty in form and matter of the Indictment;</hi> but in the proceedings, the <hi>form</hi> is made nothing; for <hi>Richard Brown</hi> divers times ſaid, If they were at a Meeting, if this was proved it was enough; and it appeared to be the Judgement of the Court alſo, that if the Priſoners were proved to be at a Meeting, and a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under pretence of the Worſhip of God, whether ſuch Meeting was peaceable or with force of Arms, it was not material; if they were Meetings either under pretence or really for the <hi>Worſhip of God;</hi> Tavern Meetings, and Play-Houſe Meetings, and Whore-Houſe Meetings were not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41806:11"/>
at leaſt no mention was made againſt the evil of ſuch Meetings at that time, but onely where they met under pretence of the Worſhip of God; if ſo, and that this was ſeemingly proved, it was enough for the Jury to find guilty, and the Court to Sentence; Well, but to return again to the preſent matter, The Judge ſpoke to the Witneſs, and asked him if he was ſure that theſe were the perſons that were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at the Meeting, and he might point to them particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſay, <hi>He ſaw this man, and this man there;</hi> To which the Witneſs replyed to the Mayor and Court, My Lord (ſaid he) I do not remember the faces of all of them, nor do I know them by Faces, but I have a liſt of theſe mens names, (and looked upon it) ſaid, theſe mens names I have which were taken at that Meeting, &amp;c. The Court made a little ſtop, thinking this was not a very perfect evidence, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people were ſeen to wag their heads in contempt of ſuch doings, and that ſuch evidence ſhould paſſe; for it may be truly conſidered, that though he had ſuch Names in a liſt, yet there are many and divers men in this great City of one and the ſame name, and what evidence could that be againſt perſons whoſe faces he did not know nor remember, as himſelf ſaid, let honeſt men judge in the Fear of the Lord; Well, but the Priſoners excepted againſt the Witneſs, and becauſe but one Witneſs; mentioning that Text, ſome of them, <hi>that under the mouth of two or three Witneſſes every thing ſhould be eſtabliſhed,</hi> much objecting againſt the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of one Witneſs, but that had no entertainment with them, onely the Deputy Recorder, ſpoke to them, as he had done to others before them, <hi>That</hi> they had nothing to ſay, ſaving to the two things before mentioned; Firſt, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they could prove they were at any other place that day, and not at that Meeting for which they ſtood Indicted;</hi> Or Secondly, <hi>If they were at that Meeting, then what Warrant by the Authority of the Land they could ſhew for their ſo Aſſembling together; If they could ſay any thing on this behalf, they ſhould be heard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which one of the Priſoners replyed to this purpoſe, that the King had promiſed Liberty to tender Conſciences, and to him in particular he did promiſe at ſuch a time that they ſhould have their Meetings quietly, if they would live peaceably; The Court took little notice of what he ſaid,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41806:11"/>
onely asked if he had any Witneſs of it, the Priſoner then ſaid, not preſent here, but mentioned one of the <hi>Howards,</hi> that was then preſent with the <hi>King</hi> when ſuch promiſe was made; and alſo the Priſoner ſaid, 'Tis a general Maxim concerning the Law, <hi>That no man whatſoever can diſpence with any Law of God, nor no Authority ought to command any thing, contrary to the Law of God,</hi> and I am ſure (ſaid he) our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are according to the Law of God, and deſired to ask the Court a queſtion, and they gave him liberty. I deſire to know (ſaid he) whether the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> be <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or according to the Laws of God.</hi> The Judge anſwered, That the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were according to the Laws of God, God forbid elſe (ſaid he.) To which the Priſoner replyed, Well then (ſaid he) If the Laws of this Land be according to the Laws of God, as ye ſay they are, then we have ſufficient Warrant for our Meetings, from the Laws of the Land, becauſe our Meetings are according to the Laws of God, and juſtified thereby; and being warranted by the Law of God, we are Warranted by the Law of the Land alſo, if they are agreeable, and not contrary one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as ye ſay; And ſaid he, ye may read in the Scripture, that the Apoſtles <hi>met together in an upper Chamber, both men and women; and at another time were met together, to the number of</hi> 120. <hi>perſons.—</hi>Hereabout the Court ſtopped his Diſcourſe, and would not ſuffer him further, and told him, That was in the infancy of the Goſpel, and the Rulers were then Heathen, and perſecuted the Chriſtians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not much more the Priſoners were ſuffered to ſay that is now remembred, but all taken away from the Bar, and the Judge ſpoke to the Jury on this wiſe, That they had heard the Matter, both what the evidence could ſay, and alſo what the Priſoners had ſaid, and now they might proceed; and the Jury aroſe up off their Seats, and went out to ſeek their Verdict, and as they were a going, <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> ſpoke to them, and told them, he hoped they would be more juſt, then to paſſe upon him, and not hear him firſt to the utmoſt of what he had to ſay, as they knew he was not permitted to ſpeak for him ſelf, what he would have done in defence of his Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Well, the Jury ſtaid out about half an hour, and returned
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41806:12"/>
to their Seats at the Bar; and the Clerk asked them if they were all agreed? they ſaid, <hi>Yes;</hi> He asked them who ſhould ſpeak for them? they ſaid, their Fore-man; Then the Priſoners were called by name, <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> the firſt, and ſet to the Bar, and the Clerk bad the Jury look upon the Priſoner, and give their Verdict, whether he was guilty or not guilty of the Fact whereof he ſtood Indicted. The Fore-man anſwered, <hi>Guilty.</hi> Thus they did by all the reſt, and every man was returned Guilty by the Jury, ſave <hi>Rob. Craven</hi> and <hi>W. Newil,</hi> about whom the Witneſſe made ſuch a ſtammering contradiction, as before ye have heard; and one of the Priſoners at the Bar, when the Jury pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him guilty, he made anſwer in theſe words, <hi>I would not (ſaid he) for a hundred pounds, but be found guilty of Meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to Worſhip God.</hi> When the Jury had pronounced the Priſoners guilty (in the very time of doing it, came Sir <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando Bridgeman</hi> on to the Bench, and ſat down) <hi>E</hi> B. ſpoke to the Court, Saying, He deſired to know the Names and places of the Jury-men, and of the three perſons who had given evidence againſt him; and he deſired them three might be there the afternoon, and he ſhould prove them falſe Swearers, as he could have done in divers particulars. And alſo ſpoke aloud to the Court, That he ſhould appeal to Judge <hi>Orlando Bridgman</hi> for better Juſtice, and ſhould move him and the Court the afternoon in arreſt of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for he would have the matter heard over again.</p>
            <p>And he ſpoke to divers of the Jury-men, telling them, They had done injuſtly, and while he had a Tongue to ſpeak and a Hand to write, he ſhould not ſpare to ſhew their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal proceedings, who had condemned him, and not heard him to the utmoſt. It was obſerved by a Perſon in the Court, after all the Priſoners were gone, that ſome of the Jury ſpoke to the Court as they were paſſing away, that <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> had threatned them; <hi>What ſhould they do?</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was made to them, Do not heed what he ſaith, for we will ſtand by you, and more words to the ſame effect, which the Informer could not well hear nor remember; and what may be judged of this by wiſe men, but that there was an agreement between the Court and Jury againſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41806:12"/>
The Court immediately adjurned till after dinner, and all the Priſoners were led and driven back to <hi>New-gate</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain</p>
            <p>The Afternoon of that day none of the ſame Priſoners were had down to the Seſſions, but ſome others were of the ſame People, in order to Trial; and ſome were tryed, and others were called over, but no man appeared as to Accuſe them, nor Witneſſe againſt them; ſo the particulars that paſſed in the Court that afternoon, we have not yet had a Relation of, and ſo in this place muſt paſſe it, and paſſe on to the proceedings of the Court the next day, which was as follows.</p>
            <p>In the Morning early, all the ſaid Priſoners that had been Tried the day before were had down to the Court, and alſo Four Women that had been taken at the <hi>Bull and Mouth</hi> about a Week before, who were the firſt Called, and their Indictments read for being at an unlawful and tumultuous Meeting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they ſay; and it was demanded of them, Guilty or not Guilty? to which the Priſoners pleaded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome few words betwixt them and the Court, Not Guilty; then they were ſet by. Next was Called <hi>E. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> and ſet to the Bar, and ſo after him every man by Name was called and ſet to the Bar that had been tried the day before; and the Clerk of the Court read a Paper, which pronounced every man <hi>Fined ſo much,</hi> ſome more and ſome leſſe as the pleaſure of the Court was; when they had read all over each man fined ſo much, and to lye in Priſon till payment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> ſpoke to the Court, and told them, He had not heard his Sentence; the Clerk told him over again, he was <hi>fined one hundred Marks, and muſt lye in Priſon till payment.</hi> To which he Replied again, he looked upon this way of paſſing Sentance, not to be juſt, nor yet according to their own Cuſtome; for he expected they would have asked him (according to their uſual manner in that caſe) what he had to ſay for himſelf, why Judgment ſhould not paſſe, for he had much to ſay on that kind, and bad the Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that yeſterday he moved them and <hi>Orlando Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> one of the chief Judges of the Land, in arreſt of Judgment, and did now again move the ſame, and that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41806:13"/>
Judgment might be ſtaid for a time, till the next Seſſions, or if they would not give him time till then, then but till the afternoon, he deſired to arreſt Judgment, and in that time he would produce divers Statutes contrary to the Form of which theſe proceedings towards him were; He ſaid he was no <hi>Lawyer,</hi> and therefore could not now nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to them the particular <hi>Chapters of the Statutes</hi> which he deſired to inſiſt upon, and therefore deſired time till the next Seſſions, or but till the afternoon. Alderman <hi>Brown</hi> made anſwer and told him he ſhould have time; but the Recorders Deputy (Judge of the Court) told the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he could not have longer time, they could not admit it: To which <hi>E. B.</hi> replied, If they would not give him time in arreſt of Judgment, then they denied him both Law and Equity; for themſelves knew it was very uſual in many Caſes for Perſons after Verdict given in, to have time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them in arreſt of Judgment, and particularly him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had once at a certain place a falſe Verdict brought in againſt him, and he did move the Court at that time in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Judgment, and it was allowed him by Sergeant <hi>Hatten,</hi> who was then Judge of that Court, and he hoped he might have the ſame now.</p>
            <p>To which the Judge Replied, He knew Sergeant <hi>Hatten</hi> well, but his practiſe was no example to them, for do you think (ſaid the Judge to the Priſoner) that we can give you time for you to take the Indictment and Conſult with <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and ſeek this occaſion and the other againſt it, this we will not do (ſaid he) but if ye have any matter or point of Law now to move we will hear you, but we ſhall give you no longer time: To which <hi>E. B.</hi> again Replied, Then he ſhould ſay it was a ſurprizal of Judgment, and very hard to be ſo dealt withal, not to have time till the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, that he might give in his Exceptions againſt the falſe Verdict brought in againſt him; and what if he had a mind to Conſult with any <hi>Lawyers</hi> in the Caſe that knew the particular points of Law better then himſelf; why ſhould he not do this, his Fact was not ſo Criminal, nor of ſo large extent, but that the Law would allow him Counſel if he had a mind to uſe it, for if he were Attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Treaſon (which his preſent Caſe was not comparable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41806:13"/>
too) yet in ſome caſes of Treaſon, he thought the Law would allow Counſel, and therefore he knew not why ſuch exceptions ſhould be made againſt him, as if he could not be admitted Counſel in his Caſe, if he had a mind to uſe it; Hereabouts the Judge interpoſed, and told him, <hi>He ſhould not be ſuffered to over-rule the Court,</hi> and (ſaid he) <hi>Ye think to over-rule the Court to day again;</hi> And do not ye ſee how he flouriſhes, I tell you (ſaid he) ye muſt not have time lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but if ye have any matter now to except upon, we will hear you, or tell us what point ye would inſiſt upon if time were given you. To which <hi>E. B.</hi> Replyed, It was but yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day ſince he was Tryed, ſince which time, he had ſcarce opportunity throughly to conſider and ſtate the Matter, for he was with many more of his Friends, thruſt up into ſuch holes, and ſo thronged together, that he believed they would hardly ſuffer their dogs to lie as they were forced to lodge, and therefore he deſired a little more and better time, to look over the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and other Statutes, which he ſhould peruſe in the Caſe; and for one thing firſt of all, he ſhould inſiſt upon the Matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his <hi>being Illegally Apprehended, and by force, and not by due proceſs at Law brought to his Tryal,</hi> which by the Laws of the Land ought not to be; and this is clear from <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> ſaid he, which ſaith, <hi>No man ſhall be Impriſoned nor deſeized of his free-hold, but by the Law of the Land, and if any be apprehended and brought to Tryal, and not by due proceſs at Law it ſhall he holden for nothing;</hi> The Judge made Anſwer, he was miſtaken, this was not ſaid in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> though the firſt part of the words are, but the ſecond part of them for ſubſtance, is in a Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Further the Judge ſaid, They could not hear him any longer, and they would not give time, and he ſhould not be ſuffered to prate there, and ſeeing (ſaid the Judge) you are ſo peremptory and ſtubborn, the Court takes notice of you, and thinks good to add upon you this Sentence further; <hi>Ye are alſo</hi> (if ye do pay your hundred Marks) <hi>to find ſufficient ſureties for the good behaviour before ye are releaſed,</hi> and take him away Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>E. B.</hi> ſpoke aloud to the Court, and appealed to the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> by Name, and to Alderman <hi>Adams,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41806:14"/>
and Alderman <hi>Brown</hi> by names, is this fair dealing ſaid he, to deny me <hi>Law and Equity at the bar?</hi> and I appeal to you to do me right, and to let me have time, before Judgement be paſſed, that I may ſhew you my Reaſons grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the Laws of the land</hi> againſt the verdict given in againſt me; and ſaid he, <hi>Alderman Brown</hi> thou haſt promiſed me I ſhall have longer time, fulfill thy promiſe to me, what wilt thou go back from thy word on the Bench? Let all take notice, I am <hi>denyed Law and Cuſtome at the bar,</hi> if ye deny me this motion of Arreſt of Judgement. Then Alderman <hi>Brown</hi> ſpoke to him in theſe words, <hi>This is all ye ſhall have, and print it (ſaid he) if ye will through the Land;</hi> To which <hi>E. B.</hi> again replyed, that he was no very great Printer, yet he thought it his duty to publiſh theſe things to as many as he could, that all the World may know the Proceedings; in the mean time the Court cryed <hi>take him away, away with them all Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> and then they began to hale them all away into Priſon again; and as they paſſed away, ſome of the Priſoners told the Court, <hi>that the Lord would remember them in his day, and render unto them according to their doings, and the hand of the Lord was lifted up, and would deliver his people from all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Here follows divers exceptions for Arreſt of Judgement which would have been brought in againſt the proceedings in <hi>E.

                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo in a Book called the Mirror of Juſtice, <hi>fol.</hi> 138. it is rendred a ſufficient exception not to be brought to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a right courſe, in theſe words, the Defendant may ſay in exception of Bill or Indictment againſt him, <hi>That he is not bound to anſwer hereunto, foraſmuch as he is not brought to Judgement by a right courſe,</hi> which is the very caſe now in hand, this Priſoner was not brought to Tryal by a right courſe in due Proceſſe of Law, but contrary thereunto, and that was matter of exception in Law againſt the paſſing of

Judgement. To this adde the very words of the Kings late Proclamation of the 17. of the eleventh Month, 1660.

Therefore it muſt needs appear to be in juſt, unreaſonable and contrary to the equity of the Common Law (which is ſaid to be by the Ancients, the Law written in the heart) That the very Perſons, who had ſo violated the Law, even <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf, in ſuch ſeizing upon him, ſhould be the witneſſes too againſt him, and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence taken as the onely evidence in his tryal, upon which virdict, and ſo Judgement was procured upon him; for inaſmuch as what evidence was given againſt him by the ſaid perſons, was to their own advantage, and to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie themſelves in their illegal dealing, and what they ſpoke to the priſoners diſadvantage was to their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, which proves ſufficiently that they were not <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent witneſses</hi> againſt the priſoner, nor in <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> could their witneſſe be received againſt him, being the party themſelves againſt him, and fully concerned in the caſe, either to get the Priſoner condemned by their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt him, that themſelves might be juſtified in the wrong they had done him, or elſe to be left liable to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Law, for their violating of it; and it muſt needs be againſt the very reaſon of the <hi>Common Law of the Land,</hi> (upon which this Tryal was) That parties in unlawful acts of violence againſt a Perſon, ſhould be permitted to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in the Proſecution and Tryal againſt the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; this was the very caſe of <hi>E.

                  <p>Thus it is plain, he had juſt Ground of Exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Judgment and evident Reaſons from both Common Law, and Statute Law, why Judgment ſhould not be paſſed againſt him in this Caſe; 1. <hi>From the manner of his being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and impriſoned and proſecuted to Trial without due proceſſe of Law, which is held for error, and againſt Juſtice by the Law.</hi> 2. <hi>From the incompetency of the Witneſſes who were parties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Caſe, and what they teſtified to the prejudice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, was to their own advantage.</hi> 3. <hi>From the proceedings of the Court in time of Tryal, who ſuffered not the Priſoner to ſpeak in full in his own defence.</hi> 4. <hi>From the Law it ſelf by which he was Tryed and Judged, which Law is proved to be contrary to the Law of God, and therefore the Judgement of that Law ought to have been arreſted;</hi> And now laſt of all in brief, Judgement ought not to have paſſed againſt him.</p>

you, or we, of all the Innocent Blood that hath been ſhed: The Judge told her, ſhe was to plead; ſhe told him, If he would ſhew her what evil ſhe had done, ſhe would anſwer to it.

He ſaid, It was the beſt work he could do yet; And he ſaid, If he hath done you any wrong (meaning the Witneſſes) you may ſue them at the Law, and write in your Indictment againſt them, That they pulled your Tongue out by the roots: She told him, That was a Lye, and asked him if he would have her be a liar? They ſaid, Take her away: And then they called <hi>Sarah Cobbet,</hi> and <hi>Frances Cole,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn,</hi> and <hi>John Ratten; S.

Then they called <hi>Frances Cole,</hi> and asked her whether ſhe was

Guilty or not Guilty? She ſaid ſhe was not Guilty. Then the Jury brought in their Verdict that they were Guilty. Then <hi>Eſther Biddle</hi> again deſired to know what they had done; <hi>R.

I am afraid thou wilt never ſee ſuch another. <hi>R. Brown</hi> ſaid, He had no other Place then, but now he went to Church, and ſo muſt ye too, ſaid he; She told him, The day was at hand, wherein God would deſtroy the Temples and the the Worſhippers thereof, unleſſe they repented. <hi>R.</hi> B. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her, if ſhe meant her own Temple? And the Judge asked her if ſhe meant Temple-Bar.

Brown</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, And many Nations have been in you. They ſaid, She had ſaid enough, and then bid the Keepers take them away. Then ſhe was pulled away to go to Priſon, and after a little time ſhe went up to the Bar, and ſaid, Friends, I deſire to know what you have done with me? Then the Judge ſaid, Woman, you are young, and the Court hath conſidered you, and we hope you will be of another mind, and ſo we have put a ſmall Fine upon you: To which ſhe replied, This is not the way to make me of another mind; then it is ſign <hi>that liberty of Conſcience is ceaſed within theſe few years;</hi> Then ſhe ſaid, Friends, keep to that pure Principle which drew you forth at firſt from the Idols Temples and Idolatrous Worſhip, if you do not, the Lord will ſweep you away with the Beeſom of deſtruction into the pit of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting perdition. One upon the Bench ſaid, She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members us of the Old Cauſe. And then the Judge bad the Goaler take her away to Priſon; She ſaid, There is Mercy with the Lord, but there is little with men; So ſhe was had away: <hi>Lovel</hi> (who Witneſſed againſt her) <hi>whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Goaler,</hi> bad him have her to <hi>Bridewel;</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe ſtep'd back to the Bar, and ſaid, Friends, have you Ordered me to be ſent to <hi>Bridewel?</hi> They looking one upon another, the Judge ſaid, No: Then ſhe ſaid, This Witneſſe is an envious man; for he bad the Goaler take

me to <hi>Bridewel,</hi> and for ought I know he ſtandeth here to ſuck my blood (ſaid ſhe:) The Judge ſaid, It did not concern my life: Then ſhe ſaid, If it were not the mighty power of the Lord that preſerveth us (who hath the hearts of Kings and Rulers in his hand, and turneth them as a River of Water which way he pleaſeth) you would murder us all. Then they were fined 13. s. and 4. d. a piece, and ſo carried away to Priſon, to lye till payment.</p>

               <p>The ſame Perſon was born in the North part of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and was of very honeſt Parents, his Father was a Yeoman of the Country, and had a good Report of his Neighbours, for uprightneſſe in all his dealings; and <hi>Richard</hi> was his onely Son, who was <hi>Inclinable from his youth upwards to Religion</hi> and to the beſt way, alwayes minding the beſt things, and following the company of good men, and was never known to be addicted to any <hi>vice</hi> or <hi>malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> nor ever followed any evil courſe of life from his Child-hood, but feared the Lord and walked uprightly before him, and was faithful according to the Light and knowledge received in all things; and his natural diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and temper was <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>lowly, and loved peace among men;</hi> he was brought up with his Parents in good educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the cuſtom of the Country; and in the time of the late Wars, he was diſpoſed to go into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and was in <hi>Scotland</hi> moſt of the time till the Land was reduced; and he had ſome office in a Regiment, and did ſometime preach among his ſincere and ſober Companions that loved him wel, according to his knowledge and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at that day; and he obtained <hi>a good Report</hi> amongſt ſuch as were lovers of Religion.</p>
               <p>And when it pleaſed the Lord God everlaſting to raiſe us up to be a People in the North parts, (and through <hi>great Tribulations</hi> and <hi>extream diſtreſſes</hi> within and without, which we paſſed through were we raiſed up of the Lord to be a <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>choſen People)</hi> This ſame Perſon was one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the firſt of us whoſe heart the Lord touched with the

ſence of his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and amongſt us he had the mighty operation of the Power of God experienced in his heart; Great afflictions and tribulations for many weeks was he exerciſed in, through the diſpenſation of the Grace and Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus; he was in that ſtate, and while therein exerciſed for many dayes, a wonder to all that beheld him, as one paſſing out of the body, as one under the deep ſence of the hand of the Lord, under the <hi>operation</hi> of his Power, thus it was with many of us, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with him; Till ſuch time as the ſame Power <hi>that killed made alive,</hi> as <hi>wounded alſo healed,</hi> as brought down alſo raiſed up, and then being raiſed up in the holy Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he was made a Miniſter of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Goſpel,</hi> to preach <hi>Repentance, Converſion, Salvation and Remiſſion of ſins;</hi> and accordingly went forth in the Name and Power of the Lord Jeſus the Saviour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and was <hi>a Miniſter of the glad Tydings of Salvation,</hi> in many parts of this Land and elſwhere, to the converſion of many Souls to God; for his Miniſtry was made effectual by the Almighty Power of the Lord, to turn many <hi>from darkneſſe to light, from the power of Satan to God,</hi> and there are thouſands who can in the Spirit of the Lord bear Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the power and verity of his Miniſtry, in many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys where he travelled; for he laboured much in divers places, and was very diligent and faithful in the work of the Lord, and ſuffered impriſonment divers times, and was hardly dealt withal, and perſecuted in <hi>Cheſter, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> and in <hi>Norwich</hi> priſons and other places and he was found faithful in all his Tryals among his Brethren, and alwayes ready to do his ſervice in what he was called unto with a willing mind, being <hi>truly in body, ſoul and ſpirit given up to the ſervice of the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which was committed unto him, that he might ſerve the Lord in his Generation; and though he now hath fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his Teſtimony in this World, yet <hi>the remembrance of him lives with us in the Spirit of Jeſus,</hi> and he is accounted among the faithful Sufferers, a Martyr for the witneſſe of the Truth which ever liveth. And for the ſpace of nine years he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured and travelled in the work of the Goſpel aforeſaid, in <hi>moſt of the Counties of this Nation,</hi> and was well known for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41806:21"/>
his faithfulneſſe among the <hi>Churches of Chriſt;</hi> He was but little in ſtature in his outward man, and of weak Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of body, and was ſlow of ſpeech, and often more ready to hear then to ſpeak; he made little appearance in the man-hood of Excellency or Authority, but was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptable among men, yet he was very wiſe, and knew his ſeaſon when to ſpeak, and when to be ſilent; and when he ſpoke, it was with much <hi>diſcretion and deliberation,</hi> in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of words many times, yet reached perfectly the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intended by him, and his ſpeech was <hi>with Grace, and in the fear of God,</hi> and had Authority in the Spirits of men, and was of <hi>ſavour and ſound judgment,</hi> though in weakneſſe of the man-hood expreſſed; for he anſwered not mens Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in excellent ſtile of words, but the witneſſe of God in ſincerity of ſpeech; he was a Perſon <hi>of ſound judgment in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Myſteries,</hi> and of good experience in the operations of the power of God, and knew the paſſing through divers <hi>conditions of the inward man,</hi> and was able to ſpeak to many eſtates of man paſſing under the diſpenſations of the Grace of God; he could well inform the mind of a perſon in <hi>an afflicted and toſſed ſtate of terrour and judgment;</hi> and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry was often ſavoury and ſeaſonable; and felt in the pure life, though his words were plain and homely, and no beauty in them to mans Wiſdom; and God made him and his ſervice a bleſſing to many who ſhall ſpeak for him in their own Conſciences; He was of a <hi>loving, gentle and good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> and acceptable was his Company to them that knew him and were like-minded; a <hi>good Companion</hi> in all Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not ſoon moved into paſſion of either grief in Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or of joy in Proſperity; nor had he a Spirit <hi>taking of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences</hi> upon light occaſions againſt any, but watched for Good over all, and not for Evil; He was a man <hi>of peace,</hi> and loved it, and <hi>walked peaceably</hi> among his brethren, <hi>in honeſt kind familiarity;</hi> And I am perſwaded in my Soul, according to the experience I had of him for many years, he abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red diſſention and ſtrife among Friends, and was never the real occaſion intendedly by himſelf, of any <hi>difference and diſſention</hi> among brethren; and what further is Truth of him, I leave it to the juſt God, whoſe teſtimony is true and never fails.</p>

Among many others that were taken from Meetings and ſent to <hi>Newgate</hi> according as ye have heard, This <hi>ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of whom I am now treating, was in like manner rudely and violently taken on the 22th day of the 4th Month laſt, out of a Meeting in the <hi>Bull</hi> at <hi>Alderſgate,</hi> and carried before <hi>Rich.

His anſwer was, <hi>That there was no need to diſpute matters, for he knew the ground of his Salvation, and was ſatisfied for ever in his peace with the Lord God, and we know</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>one another well, and what each of us can ſay about thoſe things,</hi> and ſpoke no further: And the 17th day of the 6th Month he departed this life, and was gathered up to his Fathers, the Generation of the Juſt; and though he be gone in that bodily appearance, and his perſon removed from us, yet is his new-Name written among us, and his Memory can never die, for his Spirit ſtill lives to praiſe the Lord, and the life which breathed forth through that veſſel cannot be removed far away; for it is the <hi>Infinite, Immortal, Eternal Life,</hi> which dwells in <hi>Sons and Daughters now upon the Earth;</hi> and though his outward man be put off, yet he lives alwayes in Spirit, for he was a <hi>Servant of the living God</hi> upon Earth in his day.</p>

Theſe men laid down their lives for the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſuffered for <hi>Conſcience ſake till death,</hi> and left good Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies behind them, ſpoken on their death-beds; One of them ſaid, <hi>This body of mine muſt go for the Truth, this body muſt be laid down for the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, as a Witneſſe againſt this perſecuting Generation; and he rejoyced in the ſame at the point of death.</hi> Another of them ſaid, <hi>The terrible day of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is at hand upon the wicked, Wo unto the perſecuting Rulers of this City, the Lord is nigh unto them in the ſtroak of his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>THere were taken out of ſeveral peaceable Meetings, while they were humbly waiting upon the Lord in his Fear and Worſhip, above fifty of our Friends in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and at divers times committed into the <hi>New Priſon,</hi> all of them ſaving a few perſons by the <hi>Lievtenant of the Tower,</hi> being taken by Souldiers, and violently ſeized upon in ſuch their peaceable Meetings, and not according to Law, and brought before Lieutenant <hi>Robinſon,</hi> who ſent them all to <hi>New Priſon</hi> without much examination of them; and there they were kept Priſoners many of them three Moneths, and never brought to Tryal, onely about thirty of them a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night after their Commitment were had to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the Oath of Allegiance was proferred them, by the Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in theſe words, <hi>Will you take the Oath, will you take it, will you take it;</hi> And for refuſal, they were ſent back to priſon again, though he was ſo haſty in asking them about, that divers of them had not time to ſpeak to him, nor to treat with him in ſober diſcourſe about the lawfulneſs of the ſame, which ſome of them deſired to have done, but little was ſaid; <hi>But will you take it, will you take it?</hi> And they were all continued Priſoners till about the twentieth day of the ſixth moneth, at which time there was a Seſſions at <hi>Hickeſes Hall</hi> for that County, to which place divers of the ſaid Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners were brought, firſt of all ſixteen perſons who were there Indicted <hi>at common Law, for being at an unlawful Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</hi> according to the forme, as before is ſhewed; and they were asked, <hi>Guilty or not guilty:</hi> to which moſt of them pleaded <hi>not guilty,</hi> and were returned back to priſon again,

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe it is contrary to the very Law of Nature</hi> (as the caſe ſtandeth in this City) for the very work of the Train Bands in this City of late have been to <hi>Beat, Abuſe, Knock down, Impriſon and Perſecute us;</hi> and this have they done, and been commanded to do by their Officers, which ſhews the Truth of the Reaſon; for every man <hi>by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is bound to preſerve himſelf and his own life from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and deſtruction; and it is abſolutely contrary to the very Law, for a man to deſtroy himſelf, or be <hi>acceſſary</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by himſelf or by any other; It is againſt the <hi>Law of Nature and Reaſon,</hi> for men to be any way helpful, <hi>to beat, and impriſon, and knock down, and perſecute themſelves;</hi> And ſo is this very Caſe, if any of us ſhould go out or ſend a man on this occaſion, it were to aid and aſſiſt, and endeavour (if not perſonally to act with our hands) to <hi>hale to priſon, or to beat and perſecute, it may be, kill our ſelves or our Friends;</hi> and ſo to be <hi>Helpful and Acceſſary</hi> to our own ſuffering, if it were to <hi>death;</hi> and this the very <hi>Law of Nature</hi> reſtrains us from, and we cannot do it, for it is natural to mankind, and to every Creature, to be helpful to preſerve it ſelf; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature, to be a means by it ſelf (wittingly and willingly) of its own <hi>deſtruction,</hi> no man may in reaſon riſe up againſt himſelf to his own death, which is the caſe; ſo this is one reaſon taken from the <hi>very Law of Nature</hi> (which enjoyneth to preſerve our own lives, and not to deſtroy our

ſelves nor our Friends and Neighbours, neither by our own hands, nor others through our means; wherefore we refuſe to go or ſend our men in Arms on that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is contrary to all equity and reaſon</hi> to be put upon us, and expected from us (as we are Inhabitants of this City) Inaſmuch as we are <hi>daily a ſuffering and perſecuted people,</hi> and <hi>commonly reputed (though falſly)</hi> as the very enemies of the Peace and good of the Land; and upon that pretended Reaſon, daily <hi>haled to priſons, indicted as great Malefactors, and fined in great ſums of money, and many hard impoſitions put upon us;</hi> and ſeeing we are thus dealt withal, and reſtrained of <hi>the lawful enjoynments of common Freedom and Liberty, and our rightly due priviledges,</hi> as other inhabitants have, we cannot be permitted our <hi>Freedoms and Priviledges in our callings, and to follow our employments,</hi> as we are men, nor yet our <hi>liberties as Chriſtians, in the exerciſe of our Chriſtians duties, according to the perſwaſions of our Conſciences, and example of Scriptures,</hi> but are impriſoned and perſecuted, and all our rights (both as we are men and Chriſtians) <hi>violated, and taken from us;</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is thus, how can it in common equity and reaſon be <hi>put upon us, or expected from us,</hi> that we ſhould be charged with any ſuch ſervice and duty, or perform the ſame, either in our <hi>perſons</hi> or <hi>eſtates?</hi> there is no equity nor reaſon in it, that men ſhould be charged with a ſervice for the good of the City, as this is profeſſed to be, and yet not permitted to enjoy any portion of the end of ſuch a profeſſed ſervice, but quite the contrary impoſed, and this is our caſe; It is profeſſed that the Trained Bands are raiſed, and goes out for the good and peace of the City, and we are commanded to joyn with them for that good end; and yet we are <hi>debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> and <hi>reſtrained</hi> of every part of that end, and quite the contrary end is made <hi>our portion,</hi> and therefore it is <hi>unequal and unreaſonable</hi> in our ſelves, as well as in them that expect it from us, that we ſhould joyn in ſuch duty and ſervice, like as if a perſon ſhould <hi>adventure</hi> to Sea ſuch a ſum of mony in the hand of a <hi>Merchant,</hi> truſting him with the <hi>improvement of it,</hi> for the end to bring in gain, and at the return, the Merchant keeps both <hi>Principle and Produce</hi> from the <hi>Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:41806:26"/>
and not only ſo, but he makes uſe of the ſaid mony, to put the man to as much more <hi>needleſs charge and expences;</hi> Would not all men ſay it were <hi>contrary to both equity and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> that ſuch <hi>Adventurer</hi> ſhould ever <hi>credit</hi> ſuch Merchant more, and much more <hi>unreaſonable</hi> that ſuch <hi>Merchant</hi> ſhould put ſuch <hi>Adventurer in Priſon,</hi> becauſe he will not give him <hi>credite and truſt him with more ſtock;</hi> This Parable ſhews the truth of our Caſe, and proves the truth of both the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aforegoing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is contrary to the Law and Principle of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It is contrary to common Equity and Reaſon</hi> (as the caſe ſtandeth) for us to go out our ſelves, or ſend men on the occaſion mentioned, and for theſe Reaſons we do refuſe to do it.</p>
               <p>Alſo let it be rightly conſidered how <hi>unreaſonable this thing is</hi> that we ſhould now Suffer for not going forth in Arms, &amp; yet divers of our houſes have been ſearched <hi>for Arms, and taken away from us</hi> where any were found, and we threatned to be ſent to Priſon, for having <hi>any Arms in our houſes,</hi> if but an old Sword, and yet now muſt Suffer becauſe we will not <hi>keep Arms,</hi> and go out in a <hi>War-like way with them;</hi> Alſo how unequal it is, that we are ſometimes <hi>threatned to perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe we are feared <hi>to fight,</hi> and at other times, <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and made to ſuffer becauſe we will not go out with carnal wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to fight;</hi> and thus are we made to ſuffer on the one hand and on the other, and afflictions are our portion on every ſide, from the men of this Generation, and many are our Troubles, till the Lord deliver us out of them all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe we are true Chriſtians, and Redeemed, and Reſtored, and Sanctified by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and are men of Peace, and Love, and good Will towards all men, and lives in it, and ſeeks after it, and are not men for <hi>War, and Strife, and Debate,</hi> but are <hi>Redeemed</hi> out of that Spirit which is in the fall from God, and <hi>delivered</hi> from the working of ſuch works; and now we cannot <hi>war with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weapons our ſelves, nor uphold it in others,</hi> but do give <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt it,</hi> by ſuch our <hi>refuſal</hi> to riſe up and go out with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41806:27"/>
Carnal Weapons, for all ſuch things are in the fall from that eſtate in which God placed <hi>man in the beginning, and wars and fighting</hi> are in the enmity and Spirit of Iniquity, which is contrary to God, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Wars and fightings do ariſe from the luſt that wars in the members, Jam.</hi> 4. 1. and from that eſtate of <hi>enmity in the fall,</hi> and out of theſe works are we <hi>Redeemed and Sanctified by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and do walk in his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> who hath <hi>exhorted us to love our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to do good for evil, and to reward no man evil for evil; but when we are ſmitten on the one cheek to turn the other, and to be reconciled with our Neighbours;</hi> theſe and many ſuch exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations we have in the Scriptures to the true Chriſtians, which we deſire to be found walking in; and therefore we do deny to go out with <hi>Carnal Weapons to war againſt any,</hi> much leſſe againſt our <hi>own ſelves and our Friends</hi> as this caſe is, as before is ſhewed; And we are come to the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, and to the <hi>Son ſhip to be heirs of God, and Joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Which State is greater then the State of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ſometimes went out to war, and were <hi>Righteous men, and juſtified of God in ſo doing,</hi> yet that State was ſhort of the State of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was the Heir of God, to which <hi>State</hi> in meaſure we are come, and ſo are <hi>Redeemed from wars and fightings with Carnal Weapons;</hi> not onely in their worſt State, but in the beſt Eſtate of ſuch <hi>Wars,</hi> not onely in an evil and wrongful quarrel we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not war, but in the beſt kind of <hi>quarrel,</hi> we refuſe out of Conſcience, <hi>to war our ſelves,</hi> or to ſend others for us, <hi>to war with Carnal weapons</hi> and that becauſe we <hi>are true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and believes in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and abides in his Doctrine, and loves peace with all men, and can do good to them that hate us, and are come to the end of wars, and would have mens lives ſaved and not deſtroyed, and are of the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus which warred with Spiritual Weapons againſt the evil luſts and evil affections within, and againſt that ſpirit of tranſgreſſion in mens hearts, that he might kill and deſtroy that Spirit, and ſave the Bodies and Souls alive; and ſuch war do we make this day with the Weapons of the Spirit of God, that ſin may be ſlain, and unrighteouſneſſe deſtroyed in mens hearts, and that Body and Soul may live;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41806:27"/>
but other kind of war we cannot make for the Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, therefore we are excuſable in the sight of the Lord, in refuſing to go out with <hi>carnal Weapons,</hi> though yet we ſuffer <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> and are <hi>perſecuted</hi> becauſe of the ſame.</p>
               <p>If from hence it be Objected by any, <hi>That this principle and practiſe of denying to fight at all,</hi> is <hi>dangerous and of evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence;</hi> and if all were of this <hi>principle and practiſe,</hi> then we might be <hi>expoſed to ruine and deſtruction by other Nations,</hi> who would come upon us and take our <hi>Country from us, and enſlave us,</hi> and all this while we deny <hi>to fight againſt them,</hi> and will not defend our ſelves by the <hi>uſe of carnal Weapons, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer; 1. If all the People in the Land were of this <hi>Principle and Practiſe, to deny to fight, or riſe up with Carnal Weapons at all;</hi> this would prevent all <hi>Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> at home in our own Land, and all the Fears thereof would be <hi>wholly removed,</hi> and without doubt we ſhould be in <hi>Peace,</hi> and no occaſion of Fears of <hi>Wars among our ſelves in our Country;</hi> and if all the People of the Land were of this <hi>Principle and Practiſe,</hi> this good Conſequence would natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally follow; we ſhould be in perfect Peace in our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without all Doubts or Fears of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. And if this ſame <hi>Spirit, and Principle, and Practiſe</hi> were in all things <hi>believed and obeyed</hi> by all People, ſuch would be the vertue of the <hi>effect of it,</hi> in the <hi>peace, and love, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable union and fellowſhip that would flow forth among all people in our Land</hi> by ſuch Spirit and Principle, and alſo to other Peoples through the World, that occaſion would not be <hi>adminiſtred to any other Nations, to invade or deſtroy us by riſing up againſt us;</hi> but ſuch would be the vertue of ſuch a <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> wherein <hi>perfect peace</hi> were among the People in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that Principle and Spirit, that all the Earth would be engaged towards ſuch <hi>a Government in love and obedience, and would fear and tremble before the Lord to offend it;</hi> yea, ſuch would be the <hi>Majeſty and Power of the Lord God</hi> for ſuch his People, and would ſo appear for them againſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, his People onely truſting in his <hi>power and arm of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41806:28"/>
ſtrength,</hi> renouncing all the Confidence in the <hi>arm of Fleſh;</hi> the God of Heaven would appear for them in his Salvation round about them <hi>ſpiritual and temporal;</hi> If (I ſay,) men were all come to the <hi>Principle and Practiſe; of Righteouſneſſe and Truth, of Juſtice and Mercy, and to renounce all the contrary, and could deny all carnal Weapons,</hi> and would truſt the Lord onely to defend them, and would in all things rely upon him, ſuch a People would be happy and bleſſed among themſelves, and alſo a <hi>happineſſe to all the World,</hi> and <hi>a joy and yet a terror to all Nations;</hi> and the God of Heaven would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them in all their wayes, from the Fury and Wrath of the Wicked; and if the Lord were wholly <hi>truſted to, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon by all people,</hi> his <hi>eternal power</hi> would be ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in preſerving of them, for no man nor People ever yet truſted to the Lord, and was failed in their <hi>hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But to come into the <hi>belief and practiſe of that ſpirit and principle which cleaves onely to the Lord and truſts in him,</hi> and altogether depends upon him for defence and preſervation, and renounceth <hi>carnal Weapons;</hi> this is onely the work of the Lord in mans heart, to beget People into the <hi>belief and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the ſame,</hi> it is God only by his Power and Spirit that muſt bring all men to this eſtate; It cannot be taken upon a Perſon or a People <hi>if they will,</hi> or who may be of this <hi>Principle and Practiſe that will,</hi> this is not the way, it is not thus come by, no man can mould himſelf into ſuch a frame as to <hi>believe and obey God in all things,</hi> and ſo to truſt the Lord <hi>as to renounce carnal Weapons,</hi> but it is he alone that perſwades the Heart and Conſcience into the Faith and Practiſe of this; So we enjoyn no man nor People unto it, we may not <hi>perſwade any man</hi> to lay aſide all Carnal Weapons upon the penalty of damnation, nor bind any ſuch thing upon him with a Curſe, till God perſwade his Heart. And as it was God that wrought the ſame in us, even to deny all <hi>carnal Weapons,</hi> and never to fight more with them, but to truſt the Lord altogether, and that upon the <hi>penalty of damnation,</hi> ſo we leave it to him to work the ſame in others, according to the Counſel of his own Will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In full Anſwer to the Objection thus, We are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced

in our Conſciences by the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to our ſelves of going out to War with <hi>carnal Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons</hi> againſt <hi>any man in any caſe,</hi> and we cannot do it but we ſin againſt God, yet we leave all People <hi>to do,</hi> or <hi>not to do</hi> in that Caſe as they are moved and perſwaded by the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus in their <hi>own hearts,</hi> and may not perſwade any man <hi>to,</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> this thing contrary to their <hi>own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;</hi> but as for us, we being Convinced that we ought not to go out <hi>to War with carnal Weapons,</hi> we muſt be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Lord in this matter, and muſt follow the Lord in his leadings according to the light of Faith which we have received from him, without <hi>reſpect</hi> to what may be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the ſame, we muſt not follow the Lord with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to what effects may follow (as of Peace or Trouble, Joy or Heavineſſe) to our <hi>outward man,</hi> but we muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the Lord <hi>abſolute,</hi> and not meaſure our love and faithfulneſſe, and obedience to him, by either <hi>objected</hi> or <hi>real Conſequences</hi> which may follow; for we muſt, and do truſt the Lord in whatſoever may follow upon our <hi>outward man</hi> for our obedience to him; ſo we are not further care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in any thing what the Lord may do, or ſuffer to be done in any Caſe, only tis our duty to ſtand <hi>in his Counſel,</hi> and to walk <hi>in his Fear,</hi> and to follow <hi>his Teachings,</hi> and then we are certain nothing will come to paſſe as <hi>any Conſequence</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but what will be for our good and the glory of the Lord in the end; for he hath given us hearts to truſt in him, and we do rely upon him for <hi>defence and preſervation</hi> in all caſes, and are made of him to <hi>truſt our ſouls and bodies with him</hi> in our obedience to his Will, commending our ſelves into his hand of power, to <hi>live</hi> or to <hi>die</hi> in our ſubjection to him according to his Heavenly Will; and our Souls do deſire that the ſame <hi>mind and heart were found in all People,</hi> that they would obey him in all things, and truſt in him only, and commit the Conſequence thereof to him; Oh! then ſhould the day be bleſſed, and the whole Earth made happy, and the People rejoyce in the Salvation of the Eternal God; Then ſhould the Heavens ſing for joy, and the Saints and Angels rejoyce together, when God alone is exalted in the midſt of his People, <hi>and all Faith and Obedience given to him</hi> by all the <hi>Sons of Men.</hi>

               <p>WE are and have been <hi>a Suffering and perſecuted People</hi> by the powers of this World, who have all riſen up againſt us from time to time to deſtroy us, and have taken <hi>many occaſions</hi> againſt us, and uſed many wayes and means for that end, but the Lord God everlaſting hath hitherto preſerved us, and kept us alive in his Name and by his Power, and not only ſo, but he hath enlarged us and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed us, and made us to grow in <hi>ſtrength,</hi> in <hi>courage,</hi> in <hi>boldneſſe,</hi> and in <hi>number alſo,</hi> through all our <hi>Afflictions, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Perſecutions;</hi> and this is the Lords doings, and it is marvelous in our eyes, that even the ſame way which our enemies have taken, and thereby thought to deſtroy us, by that very <hi>way and means</hi> hath the Lord advanced us, and promoted us, <hi>raiſed us up, and ſtrengthened us, and encreaſed us,</hi> and this is to his Praiſe and Glory, that all Fleſh and the Wiſdom thereof may be confounded, and its purpoſes turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed backward, which is intended againſt the Lord and his Heritage; we have ſeen the power of the Lord God often appearing in us and for us, and we are evident Witneſſes of his deliverances which he hath wrought, and we cannot but ſit down <hi>aſtoniſhed</hi> in the remembrance of the things which our God hath done for his People in our age.</p>
