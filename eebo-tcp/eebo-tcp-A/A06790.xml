            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLE Reader, I
haue layed open in this
treatise the operations or
effects of the subtill and
cruell dealings of a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
of whose manner and behauiour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
haue written heretofore, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the same to haue bene the cause of the
ouerthrow of kingdomes, states, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales
and families. But forasmuch as
they haue not made the application eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
some writing thereof according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Diuinitie, others according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of diuerse lawes, I haue taken oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to describe briefly and allegorically,
the historie of <hi>Saint George</hi> for expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
thereof: the rather, for that I do
find recorded by <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed
<pb facs="tcp:12223:6"/>
author, that this Dragon is the
chiefest head and cause of rebellion and
variance in countries, and was therefore
altogether banished in the old time, when
least corruption of life appeared amongst
men. For he ouerthroweth the harmonie
of the strings of the good gouernment of a
common-wealth, by too much enriching
some, and by oppressing and impouerish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some others, bringing the instrument
out of tune: when as euery member of the
same should liue contented in his vocation
and execute his charge according to his
profession. For albeit, that equalitie wold
be the cause that euery man should haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
which made some of opinion that
goods ought to be common: yet forasmuch
as the same was neuer vsed or established
in any age, reason requireth, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the course of humane affaires, all
things should be gouerned in the best and
most assuredst maner that can be deuised,
and as it were, seeking a certaintie, euen in
vncertainties, which is tearmed Pollicie:
<pb facs="tcp:12223:7"/>
For all worldly and transitorie things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mutable, maketh the world properly
to consist of strife, warre, discord, enuie,
rankor, burning, sacking, wasting, spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and destroying: a very vncertaine
ground to build vpon. And yet a certaine
equalitie and concord is required in euery
well gouerned commonwealth, the prince
or gouernor hauing the disposing both of
the one and the other. Equalitie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the trafficke and negotiation betwixt
his dominions and other countries in the
trade of merchandize: and Concord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the members of a commonwealth,
when euery member thereof doth liue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly
and proportionably in his vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Both these are brought to confusion
and vtter destruction by the means of this
Dragon, a monster found out by couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
the roote of all euill: whereunto Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
is annexed which mooueth sedition
and ciuill warre: when pride doth oppresse
loue, which prouoketh disdaine and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth
malice, confoundeth iustice, and at
<pb facs="tcp:12223:7"/>
length subuerteth states: whereas huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
stirreth vp affection, augmenteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
maintaineth loue, supporteth equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and most soundly preserueth cities and
countries. This Dragon bringeth inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
in a commonwealth by the meanes of
his taile, wherein lyeth his greatest
strength, making the expences thereof to
surmount the reuenues. For he depriueth
the Prince (which is the father of this
great houshold) of his treasure and readie
money, which are <hi>Nerui bellorum,</hi> and
is the cause of many other inconueniences,
as both in this and in another treatise I
haue described vnto you. This he effecteth
by falsifying the valuation of mony, which
is the rule and measure of things, which
money he caused to be made vncertaine,
and as it were a merchandize, giuing
thereby a wonderfull ability to some of the
members of a commonwealth to oppresse
the other: whereby the concord is broken,
and men cannot liue in their vocation, by
that whereunto they were borne or bred.
<pb facs="tcp:12223:8"/>
Hence do arise the causes that states-men,
or magistrates which haue the managing
of the gouernment of kingdomes, and are
the Phisitions of commonweales, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times blamed and found fault withall,
for not lealing effectually the biles, bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ankers and sores thereof, albeit the
fault proceedeth not of any act or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of theirs, neither is the same properly
to be attributed vnto them, but vnto this
old venimous sore, being <hi>primum mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi>
and yet not spyed out: in the curing
whereof they would be thought to be very
foolish Phisitions, if by their medicine the
bodie were cast into a more dangerous sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Wherefore as the wounds of this
dragon are inueterated, so must he be dealt
withall by degrees and lenitie, depriuing
him first of the strength of his taile, which
will cause a great obstruction to his
breath, whereby his power shall so much
be weakened, as he may easily be brought
into a consumption: albeit that the polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
gouernment of some states do admit
<pb facs="tcp:12223:8"/>
him, as a necessarie euill, with the keeping
of a lombard to qualifie his extreame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
of the poore. This dragon is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Foenus politicum,</hi> his two wings are
<hi>Vsura palliata</hi> and <hi>Vsura explicata,</hi>
and his taile inconstant <hi>Cambium.</hi> The
virgin is the kings treasure: the champion
<hi>Saint George</hi> is the kings authoritie, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with the right armor of a Christian:
who with the sword of the spirit of Gods
most holy word, explained and corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with seuerall other lawes, signified by
the Pybal horse whereon he was mounted:
did destroy the cruell dragon, rescuing the
kings daughter, and deliuering the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
as by the circumstances of the
historie may appeare: the Allegorie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
requireth a due consideration, which
would dilate vnto another treatise. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leauing this to thy good acceptance
and friendly censure, I wish and pray that
all things may be well, although it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to haue perfection and soundnesse
of life in all men, and amongst all states.
<pb facs="tcp:12223:9"/>
God graunt that all men may amend their
liues in euery vocation, and that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
may come hastily amongst vs, to the
comfort of his chosen people. Farewell,

the drought

I discharge some part of that tribute
due vnto nature, when suddenly falling
into most strange dreames, or rather
visions, which seemed to dimme my
sight, I was partly amazed, and partly
rauished with such admirations: which
by apprehension haue left such deepe
impressions in the treasurie of my
braines, as I am now compelled to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
some of them to the generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordor,
whose bodie (after the ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his head) called for blacke
drinke to staine the ouerbeaten clouts,
to ease my fatigable memory, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
whereof is otherwise barred
from all succeeding matters, like a
trammell replenished with fish, which
can containe no more then her full (as
it were) naturall imbibition.</p>
            <p>Me thought according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
motion, that being in a ship sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on the seas with a prosperous
wind and pleasant trauell, I did arriue
into a most fruitfull Iland, whose
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12223:10"/>
beautifull and pleasant sight, with sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorie
and delicious fruites distilling
the iuice of <hi>Nectar,</hi> ministrated such
delight and health vnto my wearied
bones and drowsie mind, that by the
delectable obiect of mine eyes, of
faire running riuers with their siluer
streames, of greene fields with their
varietie of floures, of easie high waies
set with fruite-trees on euery side, of
stately hils gracing their <hi>Horizon</hi> as

of refreshing water, and by the
sweete and harmonious melodie of
birds, whose warbling notes did pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate

vnto me all worldy felicitie. Trauelling
along with a setled pace, taking the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
of these rare blessings, an insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
loathsome smell scaled the
fortresse of my nose, depriuing me of
some part of the former pleasures. But
the sence of smelling not hauing
so great operation with the heart as
the motion of the eyes, made the sence
of seeing to remaine predominant:
howbeit by the interposition of the
facultie of hearing. For behold a man
of meane stature, stricken in age, yet
bearing his bodie vpright, did stand on
the high way, in whose face did shine
such amiable reuerence as was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to behold, notwithstanding his
pale colour caused through the stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
smell; who told me with a loude
voice these or the like speeches.</p>
            <p>Not without cause (courteous gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman)
do you stop your nose to auoid
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12223:12"/>
this pestiferous smell, as dangerous to
the smelling as the cockatrice is to the
sight, proceeding from a terrible cruel
Dragon, which deuoureth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth
daily the inhabitants of this
(otherwise) flourishing Iland, the king
himselfe being in great ieopardy, with
his sweet and welbeloued daughter: as
heretofore his predecessor hath bene,
whome <hi>Saint George</hi> that valiant cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
(through his great faith and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour)
did rescue and saue miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
deliuering therby the whole state of
this common wealth from the like da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
The consideration whereof doth
comfort and reuiue our dead hopes,
that God will be pleased to stirre vp
some other champion, who like vnto
the noble Romaine <hi>Marcus Curtius</hi>
shall deliuer our weale publike, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy

            </p>
            <p>Hearing the same, me thought I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12223:13"/>
was possessed with a most feruent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to vnderstand the particularitie as
well of that Dragon whereof he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
as of the other which is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to haue bene slaine or vanquished
by <hi>Saint George:</hi> for I had many times
inquired very diligently where that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
might be situated where that dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
was destroyed, and how it was
possible that he could deuoure such an
infinite number of creatures as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
which made me to be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
with this man to know eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing with the circumstances ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
whome I found to be not onely by
learning, but also by nature of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
eloquence, and in reasoning and
debating of matters of politicke go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
what by his naturall wit,
and what by daily exercise, surely he
had in my iudgement few fellowes, by
reason whereof, he gaue me full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and answer to all my demands,
and seemed in his discourse to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12223:13"/>
the part of an Orator.</p>
            <p>This flourishing Iland (quoth he)
which ouerfloweth with milk and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
is called <hi>Niobla,</hi> and lyeth vnder the
kingdome of <hi>Persia,</hi> the chiefe citie
whereof called <hi>Diospolus</hi> standeth
partly vpon the side of a low hill, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
almost foure square. For the
breadth of it beginneth a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the toppe of the hill, and still
continueth by the space of one mile.
The length of it which lyeth by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
side is somewhat more. The riuer
called <hi>Semath</hi> riseth aboue foure score
miles aboue <hi>Diospolus</hi> out of a little
spring: but being increased by other
small riuers and brookes that runne
into it, before the city it is halfe a mile
brode, and farther broader, and fortie
miles beyond the citie it falleth into
the <hi>Ocean</hi> sea. By all that space that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
betweene the sea and the citie, and
certaine miles also aboue the citie, the
water ebbeth and floweth sixe houres

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:12223:15"/>
together with a swift tide, when the
sea floweth in, for the length of thirty
miles it filleth al the riuer <hi>Semath</hi> with
salt water, and driueth backe the fresh
water of the riuer: and somewhat fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it changeth the sweetnesse of the
fresh water with saltnesse. But a little
beyond that the riuer waxeth sweete,
and runneth foreby the citie fresh and
pleasant. There goeth a bridge ouer
the riuer, made not of piles or of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but of stone-worke, with gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and substantiall Arches, at that
part of the citie that is farthest from
sea: to the intent that ships may passe
along foreby all the side of the citie
without let: from this riuer the water
is deriued and conueyed downe in
channels of lead diuerse waies, euen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the highest part of the citie, which
doth the inhabitants great seruice.
The citie is compassed about with
high and thick stone walles, with some
bulwarkes, and a dry ditch somewhat
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12223:15"/>
broade and ouergrowne with bushes,
briers and thornes. The streetes are
commodious and reasonable broade
for the most part, with diuerse gorgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and faire buildings standing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without partition, diuerse gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
are enclosed by the backe part
of the streete, all in good order and
most commodious. Almost in the
middle part of this citie in a most sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
and stately building, being
foure square, all of marble &amp; free stone,
erected vpon seuerall pillars curious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrought, hath this Dragon his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
and most ordinarie habitation,
albeit he wandreth through the whole
Iland at his pleasure, and beareth a
wonderfull commaund in deuouring
&amp; destroying an infinite number, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the course of our gouernment.
For the the execution whereof, what
with his venimous breath, what with
his subtilty of setting men together by
the eares, what with his naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12223:16"/>
or what with his alluring <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renian</hi>
songs, he hath all the meanes
that can be excogitated, euen vnder
the colour of religion and iustice.</p>
            <p>Wonder not (good sir) for this
monstrous beast waxing euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
bigger one then another, is like
vnto the Serpent that with the subtile
guile of Sathan seduced our great
grand-mother <hi>Eue,</hi> and brought all
her posterity into exile, and misery
vppon mankind, and so doth this
monster bring al misery and calamitie
vnto our common-weale. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with great reason it was recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that great was the faith of
Saint <hi>George,</hi> whereby he was corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated
and made valiant to deliuer
this commonwealth of the like cruell
and execrable monster, which daily
deuoured so many oxen, sheep, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cattell, and at last all reasonable
creatures, vntill by the fatall lot the
kings daughter was in danger and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12223:16"/>
to be deuoured. Neither must
you imagine, that this infernall dragon
doth deuoure so many creatures, as it
were consuming them, but by sleight,
deuises and stratagemes, he causeth
them to destroy one another, in such
sort as I haue determined to tell you.</p>
            <p>But first I will tell you in what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and by what meanes the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of this Iland did liue before this
monster was bred in hell, next what
the conditions and qualities are of
those that be in league with him. And
lastly what practises this dragon vseth
with euery member of our weale pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke,
to the generall destruction ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
O <hi>Codrus</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> wert thou aliue
to destroy this serpentine dragon, that
creepeth not vpon his belly, as the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of <hi>Paradise</hi> was condemned to
do, and feedeth not on earth, but do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineereth
on his foure indented <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyon</hi>
feete, feeding on the most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
meate, which doth command all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12223:17"/>
other meates and delicacies. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
his cruelty by so much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as most vsually this meate is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
vnto him by the poorer sort, and
vpon them he feedeth most greedily.
And whether euer that <hi>serpent</hi> went
skipping vpon his taile before the
curse, I know not: but I am sure this
beareth his taile aloft like a conquerer,
riding in his triumphant chariot. The
curse of the Scripture denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him is neglected, the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of Diuines hath no efficacie, the
Canonists cursings is without vertue,
the prohibition of Ciuilians is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by the tolleration of the Statute
Law, and the manner of mens actions
before this monster did tyrannize, is
cleane forgotten, whereas <hi>Licurgus</hi>
did banish this canker worme out of
<hi>Sparta, Amasis</hi> did punish him seuerely
in <hi>AEgypt, Cato</hi> did banish him also out
of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and <hi>Solon</hi> did condemne him
in <hi>Athens.</hi> And should not we do the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12223:17"/>
like, if some <hi>Lucullus</hi> would deliuer vs
of this contagion, wherewith we are
infected, when as <hi>Sergius Galba</hi> being
president of <hi>Affrica,</hi> vnder the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Claudius,</hi> caused one to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with death by famine, for feeding
and entertaining this monster, which
like a whirle-poole swalloweth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
it catcheth?</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of this noble Iland
did liue by the naturall richesse of the
lands they were borne vnto, or by the
artificiall riches they were bred vnto,
according to their educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
euery man vsing and enioying his
own, &amp; nothing but his own, which in
regard of charity euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> possessing,
yet seemed not to possesse at all: Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
men and magistrates did liue by
their reuenues and pensions, Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Gentlemen of their lands,
husbandmen by their farmes, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and citizens by their trade, arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
by their craft and handyworke;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12223:18"/>
all of them making a perfect consent
and harmony of the gouernement of a
common-wealth, in proportionable
manner with exercise of religion, and
due administration of iustice in time
of peace, and necessary prouision for
warre, which the Prince is to prouide
for in the two seasons of peace and
warre. And from the Prince as from a
liuely fountaine all vertues did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
into the bosome of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
his worthy counsellors
were with the magistrates as orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Law, and did ministrate
(like Phisitions to the weale publicke)
good potions for the ridding out of all
distemperate humors: euery man was
contented to liue in his vocation with
true obedience: so that experience it
selfe made manifest proofe, Iustice to
be ordained of God, as a measure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men one earth, to defend the
feeble from the mighty, for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
of iniuries, and to roote out
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12223:18"/>
the wicked from among the good, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
how to liue honestly, to hurt
no man wilfully, and to render euery
man his due, carefully furthering what
is right, and prohibiting what is
wrong: to which intent euery man did
endeuor himselfe for the good of the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, obseruing concord, &amp;
all things in the course of traffike were
caried with an equalitie, free lending
was vsed, hospitality maintained, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration
towards the poore was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised,
and loue which is the very
summe and substance of the Law, did
flourish to the generall comfort of a
Christian society.</p>
            <p>But since the accursed comming of
this hell hound, the concord is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
charity is growne cold, inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is crept in, by falsifying our measure:
the generall rule, <hi>Do as thou wouldest
be done vnto,</hi> is broken, free lending is
banished, oppression must needs flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
and no man seemeth to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12223:19"/>
to liue in his vocation, as
though Pride sitting vpon the highest
degree, did contend with Ambition
for preheminence. Briefe, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale
will in time be more like a
prison, where this beast with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
liueth like a Iaylor, with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
in pleasure and wealth, whiles all
other weepe and smart for it. <hi>Auarice</hi>
found out this monster, which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth
idlenesse, and idlenesse is the
bringer forth of euils.</p>
            <p>Our society and weale publicke is
furnished with sixe necessary things,
namely diuine seruice, iudgement,
armes, riches, arts and sustenance, all
which are brought out of their due
course and proportionable order, and
those that haue the managing thereof
as Clergy men, Magistrates, Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Merchants, Artificers and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen,
and such as are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vnder these, cannot execute their
charge according to their profession.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:12223:19"/>
For behold the insinuating dealings
which this monster vseth with some of
the better sort, and his cruell procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
with the inferiour.</p>
            <p>He giueth them ability to destroy
one another, and many times the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
leane kine of <hi>Pharao</hi> do deuoure
the seauen fat kine, and yet proue no
whit fatter themselues.</p>
            <p>Some neglecting their charge, haue
their minds filled with worldly cares,
and ability giuen them with <hi>Simon
Magus</hi> to buy that which ought to be
freely giuen, which maketh them to
sell that which they shold freely giue.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh with <hi>Ananias</hi> &amp;
<hi>Saphira</hi> to dissemble with God, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

liberality, being like cloudes and wind
without raine.</p>
            <p>Hospitality is by his meanes turned
into <hi>Iacke Droms</hi> entertainement, and

an infinite number.</p>
            <p>Others he causeth to measure Gods
blessings by worldly riches, and with

outward shew, but neuer looking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to heauen, hauing the eyes of
their minde set and fixed below on
worldly things.</p>
            <p>Others do blow with him the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

            <p>Others he causeth to account no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

            <p>Others haue a present greater

following whores, harlots,
wine-tauernes, and many other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull

            <p>Others do augment by his meanes
the number of vagabonds, which
through idlenesse the (root of all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief)
do commit robbery and theft,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:12223:22"/>
and then are they destroyed by the

in their apparell, growing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent,
and riding a gallop with a

            <p>Others hauing spent their goods,
he beateth with the whores and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
(like to the prodigall sonne) out of
doores, when they haue no more for

            <p>Others he maketh to whet their

               <hi>Hercules</hi> his exploit in killing the
Serpent <hi>Hydras</hi> was great, because it
had many heads, and after the ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of one, another did arise: But
the heads of this monster do multiply
without that any be cut off, and those
that are infected therwith, are as swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
monsters, like vnto those that are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12223:23"/>
diseased with the dropsie, which the

            <p>Others he causeth to bestow all

in gemmes and precious stones, as fit
meate and commodious for him to
feede vpon, in hope that the folly of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
shall pay for all: wherby he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
some to destruction; for these
things increasing and not wearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
neither being consumed, must of
necessitie consume others.</p>
            <p>Others he causeth to deuoure one
another, and by his posteriors he doth
auoide them both as excrements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diana</hi> is preuented to cause <hi>Acte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

monster is the right firebrand which
<hi>Samson</hi> put betweene the foxes tailes
to burne the rickes and standing corn,
with the vineyardes and oliues. For
the world consisting of strife, warre,
and discord, must needes bring a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and fall into wasting, spoiling
and destroying, when this monster
doth augment the causes thereof.</p>
            <p>Consider then, how iustice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
can flourish? the one shewing
vs how we ought to liue in this life,
and the other teaching vs of the life to
come.</p>
            <p>Will not religion suffer shipwrack
in time, when charitie decayeth and
the bonds of loue are broken, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities
of opinions are the causes of
<hi>Schismes?</hi> Shal I with the Philosophers
describe iustice to be of foure sorts:
<hi>Celestiall, Naturall, Ciuill</hi> and <hi>Iudiciall:</hi>
I shall but knocke at a deafe mans
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12223:24"/>
doore: yet in hope of the antiquitie
thereof, which (as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith) will
make the same flourish, I demaund
where <hi>Celestiall</hi> iustice (which is the
perfect consideration and dutie to
God) is found, seeing that <hi>Naturall</hi>
iustice, which all men should haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselues by nature, is bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
which was the cause that <hi>Ciuill</hi>
iustice was made, grounded vpon the
law of nature, the statutes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the consultation of the <hi>Senators,</hi> or
the authoritie of graue and wise men,
as the deuice of Princes, whereupon
also <hi>Iudiciall</hi> iustice dependeth, for the
commoditie of the common-wealth.
In regard whereof we are in hope that
one day this monster shall be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For the better acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I would our images of Iudges were
erected againe, hauing neither hands
nor eyes. O <hi>Manlius Torquatus</hi> who

of iustice, not sparing thine owne son?</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:12223:25"/>
The members of our common-wealth
which haue the managing of
the naturall and artificiall riches, are
dealt withall in most strange and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
manner by this monster, which
hath his principall delight therefore
to feede vpon them, &amp; with his scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
looke, recreating his mind with
the internal miserie of the mind of his
leaguors, and with the externall cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the body, &amp; inward troubles of
the mind of others, he beareth a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
sway.</p>
            <p>Those that be in league with him, &amp;
become miserable in mind, he haled
with a cable rope of vnsatiable desires,
causing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make no period or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma

transmutation of all things they touch
into gold, &amp; staruing for want of food:
for they make by his instigation of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12223:25"/>
abundance, indigence, to the end that
by possessing more, they should haue
lesse, as not hauing a hart giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as
the wisema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saith) to enioy their wealth</p>
            <p>He maketh them thinke with the
Ape that is tyed to the clogge, that he
keepeth the clog, &amp; not the clog him,
for they keepe not their riches, but ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
keepeth them, and entangleth
their minds.</p>
            <p>He maketh them like vnto the Asse
which carrieth meate for his maisters
belly, &amp; the clothes for his backe, yet
himselfe is contented to feede vpon
grasse, and to weare a haire skinne, for
miserie hath assaulted their soules.</p>
            <p>He maketh them like vnto the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Ants</hi> or <hi>Emets,</hi> who gather the gold
and keep it, although they cannot vse
it, and to hunt after goods, graunting
them onely the sight, and not the vse
thereof: he maketh their riches to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
as though he would make
them contented, seeming to quench
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12223:26"/>
the fire by casting oyle into it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them more couetous.</p>
            <p>He causeth diuerse to get their
goods fraudulently, and by taking of
forfeitures, which maketh them to
hide their treasure, or to purchase la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
therewith: when as their heires shall
vnthritily spend that, which they haue
vnlawfully gotten.</p>
            <p>Some he maketh like vnto the
wolues of <hi>Syria,</hi> which delight to bark
against the Moone, spending their
time about nothing, and entertaining
<hi>Podagra,</hi> for the most part of the yere.</p>
            <p>He caused him that did dreame to
haue spent a great summe of money in
a banquet, to haue so strong an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that by the apprehension ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
thinking the same to be true, went
to hang himselfe most desperately, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
bought for the purpose a two pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
halter, and being saued from han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
by the meanes of his friends
which did cut the halter, would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12223:26"/>
make his friends pay for
that halter.</p>
            <p>He caused the vnthriftie sonne to
hang himselfe, that gaping for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
death for to enioy the goods of
this nature, became desperate vpon
the witches declaration, that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should yet liue thirtie yeares.</p>
            <p>He caused that miser (who hauing
hid his treasure in a hollow tree, and
finding the same taken away) to hang
himselfe, changing his treasure with
the halter that a poore man left: who
by the finding of this treasure was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from hanging, being through the
cruell dealings of others become des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.</p>
            <p>Some he causeth to haue all their
wealth in paper and inke, or parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which they accompt as preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as the golden fleece, multiplying
the same in their imagination vntill
they die, when as the debtors haue of
a long time bene insoluent, and they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12223:27"/>
deceiued with false pleasure, like vnto
those who hiding their gold in the
ground do depriue themselues of the
vse of it, hoping for ioy: when as the
gold hauing bene stolen and they ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
thereof, dye ten yeares after,
and all that ten yeares that they liued
after the money was stolen, haue fed
themselues with a vaine conceipt.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh to grow and
spread as great oakes full of branches,
by whose dropping he destroyeth and
suffocateth the young little sprigs.</p>
            <p>Others he causeth to be more dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish
then the dogs themselues, which
will sooner licke the vlcers and sores of
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> then they will giue any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
to the poore.</p>
            <p>Others he causeth to sel their lands
and goods, and to liue obscurely, like
vnto the staring owle, which will not
looke vpon the bright sunne.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh to seeme that
which they are not, like vnto the <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:12223:27"/>
which are as a wooden leg set to
the body, being no member thereof.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh like vnto madde
men, desiring nothing so much as to
get water, by reason of their excessiue
distemperature, when as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so much tormenting them; as
the abundance of riches.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh like vnto the
Moone when she is at the full, and
then farthest from the sunne of whom
she hath her light: and so by increasing
their riches, remoueth them farther
from God and godlinesse.</p>
            <p>Others which be leane, like vnto the
henne which daily did lay an egge, or
in poore estate did good deedes and
were vertuous, he causeth to become
fat, leauing the laying of egges, and
to become wealthie and vitious.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh like hogges to
feed vpon acornes vnder the oake, and
in steed to looke thankefully vpward,
to deuoure the garment of him
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12223:28"/>
that feedeth them.</p>
            <p>Others he causeth to be like vnto
the fawning Spaniell, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fetcheth his maisters gloue, in
hope to change it for a better morsell:
doing a small pleasure, to the end they
might reape a greater aduantage.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh to be like flouds,
which send their waters into the sea,
and leaue the dry land (which is thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie)
vnwatered, bestowing or leauing
their goods vnto those that need them
not.</p>
            <p>Others are exalted like vnto the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
sticking to the boughes of trees,
and yet by an ouerhard embracing do
hinder the growing of the trees, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
meane men to oppresse their

bene aduanced.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh to liue idle, and
their braines to become a shop for the
Diuels <hi>Alchemy,</hi> sowing tares amongst
the wheat, whiles men are asleepe, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12223:28"/>
with the traiterous seruant, the
doore open to the theefe.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh to thinke that
the increase of riches commeth by
their owne meanes: whereas with king
<hi>Kanutus</hi> who in this Iland would haue
commaunded the waters, they should
learne, that they were commaunded
by the heauenly power.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh like vnto the two
theeues of Esops fable, the one stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and the other the receiuer or
conueyer.</p>
            <p>His strength lyeth chiefly in his
taile: for triall whereof, euen for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
and sport, after a full stomack,
he will many times encounter with
great Elephants, clapping his taile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their mil-post legges, and neuer
leauing them vntil he haue felled their
vnweildie bodies to the ground.</p>
            <p>But behold his subtill proceedings,
for he will not onely change colours
with the <hi>Camelion,</hi> but also weepe for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12223:29"/>
their ouerthrowe with the <hi>Crocodiles</hi>
teares, when as hee intended to
make them instruments to serue his
turne.</p>
            <p>With the wild boare and swine,
which are wont to eate and destroy all
other corne, he will beware of bearded
wheate, because of the prickie beards
which do hurt him, as the authoritie
of great men. Yet sometimes like the
boare franking in his stye, he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
men of many miles off, by the
means of his leaguors and attendants,
whereby he knoweth the lands and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
of noble men and gentlemen,
yeoman and husbandmen, and here
he will gobble vp a whole towne, and
there a goodly parke, here a Lordship
or Manor, and there a most pleasant
wood.</p>
            <p>Some he causeth to weaue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<hi>Penelopes</hi> cloath, vndoing by
night that which they made in the day,
and loosing one way that which they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:12223:29"/>
get another way.</p>
            <p>Others he setteth on <hi>Icarian</hi> wings
with waxe, and maketh them to flie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
aboue the cloudes, when as the
waxe by the heate of the sunne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing,
they are drowned vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.</p>
            <p>Others that vpon pleasure enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
him, and haue taken him vp out
of the snow, being almost dead with
the snake of <hi>AEsope,</hi> do find him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to bite of their throate in processe
of time.</p>
            <p>Others he causeth to serue his turn,
whose labour like vnto the Cats paw,
he maketh to serue as the Ape did, to
take the chesnuts out of the fire for
his owne vse.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh with the hauke
to mount so high, trusting to their
wings and other mens feathers, that
they lose themselues, and their wit and
wisedome is ouercome.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh so poore, that they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12223:30"/>
are alwaies in prison, forth-comming,
but neuer comming forth.</p>
            <p>Others he causeth alwaies to be
waited on by Serieants, and their
clokes cannot take hold at a butchers
hooke, but they imagine that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieants
Mace taketh them by the
backe.</p>
            <p>Others he playeth withall like the
Cat with the mouse for a time for to
eate her vp, or like the flie about the
candle, and in the end are brought to
destruction.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh like vnto <hi>AEsops
Iay,</hi> clad with the feathers of other
birds, which being discouered and
stript of all, for a reward are throughly
scorned, and turned from their scarlet
Gownes, into blacke threed-bare
cloakes.</p>
            <p>Others he maketh like vnto bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and slaues, that though they toile
and labour neuer so much, all is for
their maisters, and they get nothing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12223:30"/>
for themselues.</p>
            <p>He causeth Mariners to conspire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their ships, and the diuell <hi>Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery</hi>
to arise to boare holes to make
them sinke and perish.</p>
            <p>He maketh many owners of ships,
and by their discord to destroy ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.
For he is like vnto the worme
called of <hi>Plinie Teredo,</hi> that breedeth
in timber, which being touched or
handled seemeth gentle and soft, and
yet hath so hard teeth that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth
all manner of wood.</p>
            <p>He draweth with the Lady <hi>Claudia,</hi>
the ship wherein the idoll of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse
<hi>Bona</hi> is, and maketh that the
Mariners (like vnto the young men)
not once do stirre.</p>
            <p>He causeth the water to get in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
and to increase by the Pumpes
of their shippes, so that both they and
their ships are drowned.</p>
            <p>He causeth many apprentises to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
vntimely maisters, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:12223:31"/>
with other mens bladders, they
are soone drowned.</p>
            <p>He maketh them to spoile their
maisters occupation and their owne,
and not to be able to liue by that they
were bred vnto.</p>
            <p>He maketh the husbandman vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to liue by his farme, and giueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
vnto others to incorporate them
to the decay of husbandry.</p>
            <p>He maketh sheepe to become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers
of men, destroying the lustie
husbandmen which are alwaies the
best souldiers.</p>
            <p>He maketh the husbandman to
make money of his woods and trees,
in proyning his old trees, and neuer
to mipe or graffe young settes, so that
the woods do daily decay, and the
trees dye within few yeares.</p>
            <p>He maketh them to sell their
croppes halfe for nought, and to buye
such things deare as they haue neede
of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:12223:31"/>
He will like a thorne-bush succour
and shelter a poore silly sheepe in
some storme or tempest a litle while:
but when she departeth from the
bush, keep backe a peece of her fleece,
and that so often vntill all be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>He bringeth with the Bee sweete
hony in his mouth, but a very sharpe
sting in his taile.</p>
            <p>The horse of <hi>Gargantua</hi> had
not so much strength in his taile
as he hath, for the same being pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of flies, did beate downe with
his taile, all the trees of a great
wood. But this Dragon by the
meanes of his taile causeth others to
transport whole woods, with trees,
houses and lands into forreine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>He maketh the prosperitie of
common-wealthes to be like vnto the
grasse on the house top, which for

            <p>He is the cause that the kings trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is like water powred into a siue or

and is neuer filled.</p>
            <p>By the meanes of his taile he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth

at a deare rate, and they to

common-wealthes destruction.</p>
            <p>He doth falsifie our weight and

to our ouer-great hinderance,
making of money a merchandize.</p>
            <p>He carieth out our treasure in bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion

cheese, making vs like vnto <hi>AEsops</hi>
dog, going ouer a bridge to snatch at
the shadow of the flesh, loosing the

            <p>He causeth vs to spend farre aboue

more then we sell, and to sell our home
commodities good cheape, and to

all tending to our destruction.</p>
            <p>He feedeth vppon both kinds of

vnable to liue by his farme,
and the merchant by the trade of our

            <p>He bringeth inequality betweene

            <p>He giueth ability vnto landed men

conuerting arable ground into pasture
to the decay of husbandry, and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of souldiers.</p>
            <p>

more, and to sell them deare, or
to haue it transported vnto other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>He is the cause of dilapidations of
cities and townes, and depopulations
of inhabitants, with the decay of their

            <p>He gnaweth the poore artificer to

most greedily.</p>

many farmes into few mens hands, the

out the right eyes of the iudgement
of gouernors, in the course of politike
gouernement, to bring common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales

            <p>He is the cause of rebellion and
variance in countries, which many
times is imputed vnto the gouernours
thereof, and maketh men generally
vnable to liue by the naturall or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall

for pride doth not measure wealth and

He giueth ability to intemperance

men slaues to the mouth and belly,
bringing them both wayes to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>He maketh money to be the creede

            <p>He causeth men to commence sutes

            <p>He striketh out with the rauen, first
of all the sheepes eyes, and so bringeth
to passe that men cannot see the way
to escape his tyranny.</p>
            <p>He is the right <hi>Cannibal,</hi> feeding
onely vpon raw flesh, especially of

his bitter bils with some sweete

            <p>He maketh men to fall into the

            <p>He will not haue men to depend v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

            <p>He maketh the hearts of his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guors

            <p>He maketh men generally like vnto

            <p>Conceiue now (I pray you) in your

of this monster, and his subtile
practises and dealings, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of the creatures deuoured by him
and by his meanes. And because the

towards his child, and especially of a

&amp; peereles daughter: the bright splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
beames of whose angelicall beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
do dim my sight, and captiuate my

cleare guilt tresses, and you <hi>Hester</hi>
your meeknes &amp; beauty, giuing place
to this Virgin and noble creature; you
<hi>Penelope, Marcia, Lauine</hi> and <hi>Helleni,</hi>
make no comparison with her: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you <hi>Lucrece</hi> and <hi>Polixene, Dido,
Laodomia</hi> or <hi>Tisbe,</hi> that haue bought
your loue so deare; or thou <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
with all thy passions, you all may be
handmaids vnto her: for her melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
voyce doth command the heathen
Gods, <hi>Bacchus, Pan, Ceres</hi> &amp; <hi>Minerua,</hi>
and by her sweete breath a second life
is inspired into you all. <hi>Venus</hi> her selfe
giueth her the preheminence, for
the strength of <hi>Cupide</hi> without her
countenance will soone decay, his
firy darts will soone be cold, and his
wings loose their viuacity. <hi>Mars, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
and <hi>Bellona</hi> cannot subsist, if this
Virgin should withdraw her fauour,
she remaineth still a Virgin immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
though all the world seemeth to
be contaminated by her, for her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:12223:36"/>
is singular, she is bright shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
as the Moone, although the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
doth darken her for a time, to
make her brightnesse to appeare more
glorious: and albeit she receiued her
light from the transparent Sunne,
yet in a manner she seemeth to be
predominant, and by a voluntarie
loue to command, for she is the rose
of the field, and the lilly of the vallies,
whose fragrant smell as the sauour
of good ointments poured out, doth
reioyce and make glad the king, and
maketh him runne after her, for his
soule loueth her, and he hath brought
her into his chamber, where like a
bundle of mirrhe she lyeth betweene
his breasts, his left hand is vnder
her head, and his right hand doth
embrace her, for she is faire and
pleasaunt. She came accompanied
with a Lambe representing her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie,
her amiable eyes the
messengers of her perplexed heart,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:12223:37"/>
distilling salt teares, did wound &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
the cruellest mind: the lockes
of her golden hanging haire did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne
her as a triumphant Goddesse:
her yuory white teeth stood like a flock
of sheepe in good order: from her scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat
lips did drop the sweetenesse of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
combes, for hony and milke was
vnder her tongue, and the sauour of
her garments was odoriferous as the
smell of <hi>Lebanon:</hi> her straight snow
white necke like a prety towre of iuory
was compassed with chaines of orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
pearle, wearing the garland of her
virginity of most precious stones, as a
royall Diademe: and yet from her
two breasts (which were like two yong
Roes that are twinnes feeding among
the lillies) two liuely fountaines of
celestiall water did runne, nourishing
an infinite number: her cheekes were
as a bed of spices, and as sweet floures
delectable: the ioyntes of her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
were delicate, making the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:12223:37"/>
whitenesse of her hands to haue a
strong attraction. For in briefe such
was her perfection, that <hi>Dame Nature</hi>
was ashamed to see her selfe ouercome
and vanquished of her owne worke:
her admirable body was couered with
a garment of white silke Damaske
hanging loose about her, embrode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with letters of gold <hi>Patientia vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrix,</hi>
wherein the Sunne with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of <hi>AEolus</hi> did seeme to play
her illustration, with the repercussion
of the varietie of colours of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Virgines following her.</p>
            <p>Consider now the agony of her
mind tempered with magnanimity,
notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the aggrauating ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by the lamentation of her associats,
and although the lot cast for her was
not so fatall as the rash vow of <hi>Iphtah</hi>
was to his daughter: yet she had
greater cause to go to the mountaines
with her companions, to lament and
bewalie her virginitie, because the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:12223:38"/>
deuouring of the dragon was farre
more crueller then the fire where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>Iptahs</hi> daughter is sayd to haue
bene consumed; when as this Virgin
being brought vp like a kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in all pleasures and delicacies, was
brought to the sight of this cruell
monster, and that she was ready to
abandon her ornaments, preparing
her gentle body to his cruelty with a
perfect patience.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Griselde</hi> was worthy of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and obtained the name of
Patient, for being aduanced by the
Marquesse of <hi>Saluzze,</hi> who tooke her
from a poore estate to be his wife, and
afterwards to try her, made a shew to
relinquish her againe, vnder colour
that he would haue maried another,
which (vnknowne vnto her) was her
owne daughter had by him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
depriued her of all her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments;
if she (I say) was renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for enduring all this patiently,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12223:38"/>
much more without all comparison
is the patience of this rare Virgin to
be had in perpetuall remembrance,
who abandoning all her peculiar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues
and pleasures, suffered her
body to be expounded to the cruelty
of this monster. And the greater was
the exployt of Saint <hi>George</hi> in deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her, who like a valiant champion
being arriued into this Iland, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the danger she was in,
came with a Princely resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
her, mounted on a pyball horse of
seuerall colours, armed like a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
to fight the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat with the shield
of faith, hauing on the breast-plate of
righteousnesse, the helmet of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
his loynes girt about with verity, and
being adorned with the liuery of the
Crosse, did with the sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
destroy this monster, and deliuered
this <hi>Indian Phenix</hi> &amp; this Iland, of that
contagion &amp; abominable hell hound,
being not moued or amazed at his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12223:39"/>
terrible sight and fashion; neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
those that were in league with
this dragon, or tooke vpon them to
speake in his defence.</p>
            <p>What vnspeakeable ioy came ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
let the consideration rauish your
mind, and ease me of the amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof. For I must now exactly
describe vnto you this dragon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his compounded body, as I
haue already done his properties, and
the effects of his mischieuous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and qualities.</p>
            <p>His ordinary mansion (I haue told
you) to be about the middle part of the
city, which is beset with many gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers
round about, without any
green fields wheron to feed, for they be
not wild, sauage, or noysome, diuerse
of those that be in league with the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
are like toades, which drinke the
iuice of grapes so fast, till ouercharged
with the broath, their bowels do burst,
casting their venimous poyson and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12223:39"/>
many, and yet the aire is soft,
temperate and gentle.</p>
            <p>Here may you behold this hideous
monster, swelling euery moneth big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
one then another, with his fierie
flaming eyes, seeming to cast fire at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
moment, by the means of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ted
toung like vnto a Turkish dart,
his body vnweildy like an Elepha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but
his taile nimble, &amp; continually waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
&amp; inconstant, for therin consisteth
his greatest strength &amp; actiuity, to the
commonwealths destruction: and the
same is marked with the new Moon of
the Turkes, like vnto the letter C, and
his forehead with an F, like a fellon, he
walketh vpon his foure <hi>Harpion</hi> legs,
like a theefe closely to surprise any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
either by night or day: for he omitteth
no time, albeit he seemeth with the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi>
of the dyall not to moue, when he
is continually moouing, and stirred in
such sort, that when men begin to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
his motion, and pretend to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12223:40"/>
runne from him: he doth so allure
them, that the more they runne, the
more he seemeth to follow them, as
the moone doth to the little children,
whereby his motion is the lesse regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
He rideth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wings of time,
and by imagination hasteneth the
course thereof: so that he that sitteth
surest may be ouerthrowne, for he
hath two wings to fly withall, the one
hauing an internall strength from the
mind, and the other an externall from
the bodie: that of the mind is (as it
were) couered with a vaile: but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is plaine and naked: howbeit both
of them are indented with seuerall
braunches, wherewith according to
the <hi>Adage,</hi> the Diuell seemeth to be
God to some bodie, and maketh those
to speak in his defence. For in abusing
iustice to the hurt of many, he seemeth
to do good vnto some particular: these
therefore (although they be ashamed
of him) do allow him as a necessarie
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12223:40"/>
member in a common-wealth, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hangman which for executions
sake must needes be had. Others doe
compare him to be admitted, as the
husbandman suffereth many weedes
to grow in his ground which he likes
not, and that so he is to be tollerated;
when as in the like manner they might
speake for murtherers and theeues,
and say that the naturall rule <hi>(Do as
thou wouldest be done vnto,)</hi> is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
generall without any exception
in all things and in all respects: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Magistrate must of loue spare
the conuicted malefactor: for if he
were in the malefactors case, he wold
be glad to be spared and pardoned
himselfe: albeit they would not be
bound by this rule, to giue all their
goods vnto another, seeing their grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
mind is such, that they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
an other man should giue them
all his substance. They would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to haue mony freely lent them,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:12223:41"/>
yet they would lend none freely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
for (say they) I must make a
gaine of my money, which is as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for me to take, as others do of the
rents of their houses, reuenues of
lands, or gaines of corne and cattell,
or wares and merchandizes: whereas
they do not consider, that money was
ordained as a pledge or right betwixt
man and man, and in contracts and
bargaining a iust measure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
which measure is by them
falsifyed: and this monster causeth
them to incorporate the same, so that
no man can come by it without their
consent and paying for it, falsifying
and altering the same. And yet can
they find fault, and hold for very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
if vpon plentie or scarcitie of
corne, or abundance of cloth, or scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
thereof, the measure or yard
should be altered vpon all occasions,
considering that a measure ought to
remaine at a certaintie. But what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12223:41"/>
this dragon bring to passe? when
he will seeme to be a protectour of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,
as though Magistrates or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
could not prouide for them, for
vnlesse he should carie some shew of
good, he could neuer haue raigned so
long: he seemeth to fauour iustice,
for if any man borrow money for an
other, and do enter his bond for it,
and take of him the like that receiued
the money, he will see him that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
the money recouer that by
lawe <hi>ex damno habito</hi> which he is
damnified, albeit there be meanes
otherwise to satisfie him. Againe,
if a shopkeeper lend money freely
to his neighbour till such a day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
then occasion to vse it at some
faire to lay it out in wares, if he breake
touch, he helpeth the shopkeeper
with all extremitie vnder colour of
iustice <hi>ex lucro cessante,</hi> to recouer so
much as he sustained losse for want
of his money to lay out; as if at an
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12223:42"/>
other time the other could not lend
him the like summe of money, and
make him recompence another way.
Whereas these euents come to passe
vpon abuses which this monster hath
brought in, hauing with the operation
of his taile (being a very Canker) trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
the moneys of our Iland, and
within our land altered the nature and
valuation of the money, making one
hundred pounds, to be one hundred
and ten pounds, and hauing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
charitie and free lending.
Hence did the cause proceede, that the
statute lawes were repealed, which
did banish this monster, for therein it
was like vnto the water which the
more it is pent, the more it swelleth,
and like a theefe, who when he is loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in at the prison doore, breaketh
out at the windowes, falling to his
shifts, subtilties and deuises. For if
money had remained plentifull with
vs, this monster could neuer haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:12223:42"/>
nor charitie should haue wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
so cold, neither casuall and aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous
bargaines would haue bene so
hunted after. And to conclude, no law
can do good which admitteth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience
as a necessarie euill.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant, that with a wet
finger, some do point at those that are
growne rich by the meanes of the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of this monster, which maketh
me to remember a pretie historie to
my purpose. A man comming into a
certaine church, and seeing it fraught
full of images made of waxe, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
what might be the cause of such
an vnwoonted sight; answer was made,
that those whom these images did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present,
were certaine persons, which
on a time were saued from drowning
by calling vpon our Lady. Nay then
(quoth he againe) where be the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of those (I pray ye) that called v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
our Lady and were drowned not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding?
So say I in this case, if
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:12223:43"/>
any man will set before me the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and as it were the images of those
who haue fed this dragon, and yet are
not become poore: I would demaund
on the other side, that he shew foorth
the hundreds and thousands of those,
whose estates and persons he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured,
they will be found a million
for one, yea to be without all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison:
for this monster is an actiue ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that consumeth all things.</p>
            <p>He demaundeth consideration for
that which is none of his owne, and
moreouer two recompences for one
entire thing: by reason whereof he
bringeth foorth inequalitie for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage,
making men to forget that
euer they liued without him, by that
which they were borne or bred vnto.
But let this hideous monster be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
and euery man will returne
vnto his quietnesse, and liue within
his bounds and calling, vsing such
trade as he ought to do. Plentie will
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:12223:43"/>
soone increase, and money will
abound, if you take away but the
strength of his taile, and we shall feele
our libertie and deliuerance.</p>
            <p>Will not the daunger that the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guors
of this Dragon do runne into,
giue them warning, when as at one
time fiue hundreth Iewes were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with <hi>Carons</hi> boate the ferrie
man of hell, which were slaine by
the Cittizens of <hi>Troynouant</hi> for fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him? Let the punishments as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for them, put them in feare if
they haue any feeling.</p>
            <p>The curse of God denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them in the holy Scripture, in
<hi>Exodus 22. Leuiticus 25. Psalm. 15.
Ezechiel 18.</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> the sixth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
expounded by the auncient and
learned holy Fathers, vpon which
ground the temporall punishments
haue bene ordained against those that
should feed this monster: whereby
their condemnation appeareth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:12223:44"/>
They are diffamed persons by the
lawe, and if any man make by his last
will any goods vnto them, the testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be broken, neither should
they be admitted to communicate
with Christians, or enter into their
congregation, or offer any oblation.</p>
            <p>When they are dead, they should
not be buried in Christian buriall, and
if they be, the doers thereof are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated:
for they are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of such reuerence, which dumbe
beastes, and euen a silly Asse (who like
vnto <hi>Balaams</hi> Asse was inspired) did
manifest, for one of these leaguors
being departed out of this world, a
certaine zealous &amp; godly parson wold
not bury him, notwithstanding his
great riches, whereof part was offered
vnto the parson to the same effect.
Wherupon his friends vnderstanding
that the parson had an asse which
brought his books from his parsonage
daily to the church, being a pretie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12223:44"/>
in sunder, they politikly desired
to obtaine this fauour of him, that as
his asse did daily cary his seruice books
to the church, so it would please him,
that for this one time the quicke Asse
might take pain to carie this dead asse
in a Coffin; with this condition, that
wheresoeuer the asse stayed, there the
body should be buried, perswading
themselues, that as the asse by an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
course, vsed euery day to go from
the parsonage to the church with a
burden of bookes vpon his backe: so of
course he would take the same way
with this dead mans corps being che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> straight to the church; which
being granted by the parson, had not
that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For the asse feeling a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
burden vpon his back then vsually,
did seeke all the meanes to be disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened,
running and flinging along the
streets, vntill he came to a paire of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
at the townes end, and there did
neuer leaue tumbling and tossing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12223:45"/>
vpon the bare ground, till he was
clean disburdned of so miserable a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,
leauing a sacrifice to that altar as
miraculously assigned for it: for it was
not without cause that priests were
forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue vnto such any ghostly
comfort, but vpon euident proofe of
repentance; also that they must make
their willes without witnesse, which
wills are not of any force except satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
be made, or else their goods to
be forfited to the higher powers, with
many other hard ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sures which ought
to moue any reasonable man in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of so easy a coma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement as to
forbeare to feed a monster vnto whom
<hi>Cerberus</hi> in hell, and all those monsters
that <hi>Hercules</hi> subdued are inferior in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.
Alas poore creatures, how are
you tossed with the waues of care to
satisfie this dragon before you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed?
you know by experience, that
the feare of death is more then death it
selfe: what shifts, deuises, or extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12223:45"/>
are not you driuen vnto? <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi>
hath painted foorth your ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and perplexed minds, vnder the
person of an aged ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> altogether ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracked
by fraighting with this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
who thinking to haue found out
the way to be eased of his slauerie, did
propound vnto <hi>Socrates</hi> this demaund:
That if he should by a witch of <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
and by her enchantments fetch the
Moone out of heauen, and bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and afterwards inclose it in a case
of glasse, and so keepe it, as if he
would keepe a flye in a boxe: <hi>Socrates</hi>
demaunding, what good that would
do him: he answered, If the Moone do
neuer rise againe, and I being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to feede this monster by the
new Moone, shall be freed of that
trouble. A straunge shift, that this
poore man was driuen vnto, to plucke
by violence the Moone out of heauen
for his helpe. For in truth the witch
did her best, and beganne to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12223:46"/>
charme the Moone, which when the
leaguor of the dragon vnderstood, did
put him in such a pelting chafe, as was
wonderfull to heare: for accusing this
poore man of enchantment, at last he
went himselfe to another witch, not
onely to keepe the Moone from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
out of heauen, but also to hasten
the course of it faster, that the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
might be the sooner fed. Good
God what a trouble was the Moone
put vnto betweene these two witches?
What stormes and tempestes did
arise? What horrible wind did blow?
What great raine did fall? What
floudes ensued euery where? What
countreys were almost drowned and
vnder the water in many places? But
herein (say some) was the dragon to
be blamed, for troubling or oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a poore man, or feeding vpon
him, which he ought to haue done
vpon the rich: for they conclude that
to be lawfull, in regard of the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12223:46"/>
of the other; as who would say,
it is not lawfull to vexe a poore man
by lawe, therefore it is lawfull to vexe
or trouble a rich man by lawe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
neither rich or poore, young or old,
lowe or high, should be troubled or
vexed at all to feede this monster: for
it taketh away the chiefest comfort
of the poore, which is the quietnesse
of their minds, and deuoureth their
gaine before it can be gotten; and to
the rich it giueth abilitie to doe all
the mischiefe that can be deuised, as
I haue told you. Others say <hi>Volenti non
fit iniuria,</hi> when as money being made
a merchandize, hindreth the course
of commodities, and that euen the
politicke course of our gouernement
driueth men to feede this monster,
and for the most part vpon an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue
wealth, when by meanes of
his taile he hath transported our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
into forraine parts.</p>
            <p>Arise thou ô Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:12223:47"/>
make knowne vnto our most gracious
king the deceipts and cruelties of the
false god <hi>Bell</hi> and of this dragon. Let
the footsteppes be seene of those that
are in league with their false God
<hi>Mammon</hi> and this <hi>Dragon,</hi> in the
ashes of the efficacie of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and our most wholesome lawes,
and let them be vsed as pitch, fat and
haire, to burst this Dragon in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>He is not contented with the spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
daily of twelue great measures of
fine flower, forty sheepe, and sixe great
pots of wine: but he consumeth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of measures of corne, innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
flockes of sheep, and whole ships
lading of wines, euen with al the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that haue the managing thereof:
for he doth not feede threescore &amp; ten
priests with their wines and children
only, but an infinit number that are in
league with him and their followers,
to the commonwealths destruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:12223:47"/>
The aspect, countenance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour
of creatures doth many times
prouoke loue towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But behold
his vgly and fearfull countenance, his
ill fauored shape and cruel behauiour,
and you will wonder how it is possible
that any man can loue him.</p>
            <p>With that, me thought he tooke
me by the hand, and shewed me a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
place, where this monster stood
wallowing like a bear, which expecteth
the comming of the dogs; presently al
my sences did assaile him, <hi>Prima facie</hi>
I saw him, then I imagined him and
my fancy did delude me, as if I had
seene some <hi>satire,</hi> halfe a man &amp; halfe a
beast, which made so deep an impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
into my memory, that by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sion
therof, I was possessed with
a great feare &amp; ashonishment, which
made me to cry and awake from slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
remaining still pensiue aboue
measure: for on the one side I knowe
the passions of men and the debility of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:12223:48"/>
nature, and on the other side I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the difference betwixt dreames
and visions.</p>
            <p>Such are the naturall passions of
men, that some not fearing to fight
with the strongest and stoutest man,
will notwithstanding cry out, and
sweat at the sight of a cat, or any other
abiect creature: others are alwayes in
feare, if they be alone, and cannot abide
to haue their doores locked in priuate:
nay, some cannot endure the pointing
of a finger or any iesture towards
them, or but the rehearsing or telling
of a dreame, for they do for the time
participate so much of the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
humor, that reason and discretion
is not able to conquere it: dreames
being prouoked according to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the mind and of the body,
and dilating into fansies and illusions,
I can hardly conclude them to be visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for visions are really seene, and
fansies are but represented or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:12223:48"/>
But howsoeuer this came to passe,
and may be importeth little, so long
as the morall of it declareth with all
the history of Saint <hi>George,</hi> wishing
with all my heart, that I might haue
seene also that valiant champion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
vnto me as the dragon was,
for then no doubt the deliuerance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
and long required would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue;
and this my dreame (howsouer
displeasing to some) might be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for a vision to the welfare
of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>

            <head>A conclusion to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
reader.</head>
            <p>COuetousnesse the roote of all euill,
brought foorth the tree of <hi>Politicall
vsury,</hi> whose roote with the body and
branches, together with their operations
and effects in the course of politicke go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
we haue layed open in this
treatise vnder certaine <hi>Metaphores</hi> and
<hi>Similies,</hi> the Morall whereof we do leaue
to thy good construction and amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For albeit that the substance with the
application of the effects thereof is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared:
yet vpon due consideration many
branches more may be handled, which
the deuines at their pleasure may apply
and amplifie, for they haue the word of
God for their warrant, without which all
humane pollicy is vaine. So that as he
would be accounted foolish, that would
take vpon him to plant or set a fruitfull
tree into a vault or seller, where the Sunne
hath no operation: much more without
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12223:49"/>
all comparison are those foolish, that will
seeme to set this tree of <hi>Politicall vsury</hi> in
the gouernement of any common-wealth,
seeing that the same is both depriued of the
blessings of the most glorious Sunne, and
accompanied with the heauy curse of Gods
most holy word. For with this holy word
all humane lawes should agree and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre,
notwithstanding that the lawes are
sayd to he made according to the people of
euery countrey, and euery countrey to haue
his influences according to the climate,
whereas many of such lawes might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished,
if the causes of offences were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented,
among the which <hi>vsury</hi> is the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
and giueth therefore iust cause of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
that polititians will any manner
of wayes suffer the same. Wise was that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititian
who perceiuing that there was not
any punishment so horrible to punish theft,
that it could keepe men from stealing,
would haue Magistrates not to be like euill
schoolemaisters, which be readier to beate
then to teach their schollers: But rather
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12223:50"/>
to preuent the causes, &amp; to prouide meanes
whereby men might get their liuing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
no man should be driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this extreame
necessity, first to steale, and then to dye: the
chiefe cause of this necessity or pouerty is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,
which doth too much enrich some
few, and doth impouerish too much a great
many. So that men cannot liue contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and proportionably in their vocation,
according to their profession, taking away
the chiefest comfort of the poore, which is
the quietnesse of their minds, and giuing
ability to the rich to do all the mischiefe
that can be deuised: which being duly
considered of, will no doubt in proces of
time worke effectually for the good of the
realme. Meane time I pray God that we
may all become Spirituall vsurers in the
Lord, vsing pitty and compassion towards
our neighbours, for which God himselfe
will pay vsury: to whom be all honor,
praise and glory, for euer and
euer. Amen.</p>
