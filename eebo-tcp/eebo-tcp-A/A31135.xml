            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE CITY OF Londonderry in Ireland.</head>
            <p>THE City of <hi>Londonderry,</hi> ſince it was firſt Built, has been always a Refuge and Defence to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in that Kingdom, and very Fatal to their Enemies, as by many Inſtances might be ſhewn. It was remarkably ſo in that long, Bloudy War which began there in the Year 1641. when ſo many Thouſand <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were barbarouſly Maſſacred and Deſtroyed by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> all over that Kingdom; no other Place of Note; beſides <hi>Dublin,</hi> in all <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> held out for the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at that time, of whom it ſaved many.</p>
            <p>IT has been Eminently ſo again on this late Happy Revolution, as cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; Nor of what Importance its Services and Sufferings were to theſe Kingdoms, and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt; That when all lookt Deſperate in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the whole Kingdom, the Sword, and all Power in <hi>Popiſh</hi> Hands, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> all diſarm'd and diſcourag'd, and a General Maſſacre of them <hi>all greatly fear'd, and believ'd very nigh them,</hi> as before in 1641.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Londonderry,</hi> tho in a weak Condition, and in provided at that time, yet to ſave what it could in ſuch Danger, was the Firſt Place that appear'd in that Kingdom, laid all at Stake, and gave the Firſt Check to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Power there, when it ſhut up its Gates againſt them, on the Seventh of <hi>December</hi> 1688, and ſtood from thence-forward on its Defence, till the end of the Siege, the laſt Day of <hi>July</hi> 1689, about Eight Months toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and near Four of them, in that Memorable Siege, wherein the Great GOD ſo ſignally own'd it, in its wonderful <hi>Preſervation</hi> and <hi>Defence</hi> againſt all poſſible Discouragements, the Charge of all which it bore on its Own Head, which it has ſunk under to this day.</p>
            <p>IT was Fatal to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> every way, it broke all their Meaſures, and ruin'd all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and ſo Baffl'd and Conſum'd the beſt of their Troops, as they never after retriev'd it. It ſtood in the Gap for theſe Kingdoms, and prevented the coming over of all thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Forces, with what had enſued, and made the Reduction of <hi>Ireland</hi> far more eaſie and cheap, than it could otherwiſe have been. It kept a Footing in that Kingdom, which had been otherwiſe quite loſt, and ſaved many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that fled thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Refuge.</p>
            <p>Its Loſſes, Disburſements and Dammage by all this, (beſides Perſonal Sufferings, hardly to be expreſt) has been exceeding great, and of a ſingular and extraordinary Nature, and amounted (as on a moderate Computation appear'd) to the Sum or Value of about 30000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, (the ruin'd Houſes by the Siege being about one half thereof) by all which it has been reduced to a poor and ruinous Condition, as is ſtill too apparent, and having lain under its Miſeries ſo long, till the Wars are now ended: In hopes of finding then the happy Effects of what it has undergone, Does by its Petition, in the Name of the Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens thereof, to this <hi>Honourable Houſe of Commons,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PRAY That its Caſe and Sufferings may be taken into Conſideration, and ſo laid before His Sacred Majeſty, for the Petitioners effectual Relief in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> As They in Their Great Wiſdoms shall think meet.</p>
