            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FOR Incouragement of this Address to you my worthy Friends,
I am oblidg'd to acknowledge, that a worthless Fruit, like
this, stands no less indebted to the Courteous Gardner, that lent
the warm Bed to rear it, then to the indulgent Palates that were
so favourably pleased to relish it. Your Favour therefore that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it to the Stage, and the kind pardoning Audience that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it there, divide my equal Gratitude. I confess indeed, if I
durst, (for there was no good will wanting,) I had the same itch
with the greater Brothers of the Quill, of committing this pubish't
Bawble into some Noble, protecting Hands; had not a riseing check
of Grace, call'd a Blush, withheld me. I consider'd, possibly the
highest Quality may forgive the loss of two short hours at a poor
homely Entertainment, much easier then publickly admitting so
mean a Trifle, Dedicated and laid at the Feet of Honour. The first
of the two Favours is but a generous Condescension e'en passant.
But the prefixing a great Name in lasting Print, before so undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a piece of scrible, is a Concession on their side too low, and
and an Ambition on mine too aspireing. And therefore though I
durst be bold with it on a Theatre, and make 'em all my Patrons
there, my Confidence, the Talent of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ge, I wear not beyond
my Dressing Room, and durst presume upon Quality no farther.
To you therefore who were before kind to it, I now send it for
Protection; and choose you Gentlemen, my Patrons, and on my
word I know not where I cou'd have pick't out better, for to pride
my self in the choice of your Protection, and give my Patrons their
true Panegyrick. I must avow to the World, that if ever there
were a true <hi>Mecaenas</hi> of Poetry, (at least in Modern Story,) that
name properly and rightly belongs to none, Gentlemen, so much
as your Selves; and to prove this just Honour no Complement, but
your lawful due, (which indeed is more then the Laws of Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
oblige me to,) if the Town wou'd allow me able to read,
(as that they'll hardly do.) I'de venture to quote one stanza of
<hi>Gondibert</hi> for my Justification, giving this Account of Poetry.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Oh! hireless Science, and of all, alone</l>
               <l>The Liberal! meanly the rest each State</l>
               <l>With Pension treats; but this depends on none;</l>
               <l>Whose worth they reverently forbear to rate.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105121:3"/>
Now if the World has made so little Provision for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Muses, (as kind <hi>Davenants</hi> too true Oracle tells us,)
I'm afraid upon due Examination, that little Bread they gather will
be found almost all glean'd from a Theatre; one kind honest Actor,
that frets and struts his hour upon the Stage (as the Immortal
<hi>Shaksphear</hi> has it,) is possibly a greater Benefactor to the Muses,
then the greatest Family of Grandees that run Pedigrees, and track
Originals up from the Conquest.</p>
            <p>The time has been when as old <hi>Ben</hi> ended his Grace with God
bless me, and God bless <hi>Ralph, viz.</hi> the honest Drawer that drew
him good Sack. So some Modern Authors with the same Equity,
might full as Pathetically have furnish'd out one Article of their
Prayers, (not forgetting the present Props of the Stage) with God
bless Mohun, and God bless Hart, the good Actors that got 'em
their good third Days, and consequently more substantial Patrons
then the greatest gay Name, in the Frontispiece of the proudest
Dedication. Poetry thrives so little now, that I much fear the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Suckling</hi> himself was mistaken in his own Laureat; for there
are those wou'd be glad to find that kind rich Alderman, his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi>
gave the Bays to, that out of all his heaped Coffers, wou'd
either give or lend, to the fairest of the nine <hi>Mendicant</hi> Sisters.</p>
            <p>No Gentlemen, the <hi>Pernassus</hi> bears no good Crop, but upon that
part of it lying and scituate within your own Garden Walls; all the rest
of it produces only that unprofitable growth, that 'tis scarce worth cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating;
all other Poetry (Dramatick only excepted,) turns to so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Account, that the Toyl's as hopeless as labouring for the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's
Stone; the Undertaker is certain to get nothing by it, and if he's
born to an Estate to bear his Expences in the Projection, his only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
is, he shall not be undone by it. If therefore a few stragling Cions
of Poetry now and then start up in the World, the Incouragement is so
much your own, that they wholly root with you. And if the greatest
Dons of Wit, that carry the highest merit with 'em, are in Honour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to this Confession; how much greater ought my Acknowledgments
to be, who owe my Access to the Stage, meerly to your Act of Grace.</p>
            <p>In turning this dowdy Brat therefore into the World, a like bound
to the Midwife, and the Godfathers: Your generous administring kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in handing it into light, and the no less generous Audience for
standing Vouchers for it, I take this Opportunity of publishing my self,</p>

            <head>THE
Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THE time was, upon the uniting of the two <hi>Theatres,</hi> that the
reviveing of the old stock of Plays, so ingrost the study of the
House, that the Poets lay dorment; and a new Play cou'd hardly get
admittance, amongst the more precious pieces of Antiquity, that then
waited to walk the Stage: And since the World runs all upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes,
as you had such a Scarcity of new ones then; 'tis Iustice you
shou'd have as great a glut of them now: for this reason, this little
Prig makes bold to thrust in with the Crowd.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, some of the Poets, the great Dramatick Professors, began
to murmur, that such diminutive Interlopers as my self should be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,
and cou'd scarce forbear railing at the Injustice of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
in indulging such inconsiderable Invaders of their Province, the
Stage.</p>
            <p>Now, I think, my Masters, 'tis a little hard, that those greater
first-rate Wits, shou'd come with top and Top Gallant, and thunder
their Broad sides amongst you, and a poor little <hi>Fan Fan</hi> should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
giving the Town a small Pot-Gun.</p>
            <p>Besides, they have more Cause to be pleased at the exposing of so wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
a trifle as this, if 'twere no more than for a Foil to their own
more exalted Sence; for Faith some of 'em need one.</p>
            <p>After this Apology for their Favors; I am affraid, kind <hi>Reader,</hi>
I shall find it a harder Task to Court yours; however, to make some Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
towards it; First I must tell you, that it if the <hi>Play</hi> wants Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
or any thing else, (or rather all things) to please you, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
to take the modish way of Prefacing, and not undervalue my
self: I assure you, (to the Credit of the Author be it spoken,) 'tis the
best I ever writ; and By Gad, (as my Brother <hi>Bayes</hi> says,) I
cou'd not have took more Pains about it, had I been to have had <hi>Six-score
Pounds</hi> for it at a Venture: Besides, whatever Confidence I
may be taxt with, to shew what respect I owe you, I resolved when I
writ it to use a Conscience in persecuting you, and accordingly you'll
find, I shall not tire my <hi>Reader</hi> with over much length; the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller
was in no danger of swelling the <hi>Play</hi> to <hi>Price two Shillings,</hi>
and shall be thankful if he finds his Accounts in half the Summ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105121:4"/>
So much for my Conscience, now for my Civility: Look ye good
Friends, considering that greater Bodies move slow, and the other
weightier, massier Sense, now in Rehearsal, and Study, cou'd not so
easily be hammer'd into the Players Heads, nor got up fast enough; I
resolv'd the Town showd not be so disoblig'd, as to have a whole <hi>Hilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Term</hi>
with never a new <hi>Play;</hi> and so I understudy'd, and jirckt
up my little <hi>Whipster:</hi> This lighter toy, like a Dance between the
Acts, in pure Complausance. I could instance several other Obligations
of this kind, but not willing to insist too much upon Merit, for fear of
running up into Supererrogation, I am content to end with subscribing
my self</p>

Butler in Mans Apparel.</byline>
            <l>OUR Scribler could not find a better way,</l>
            <l>Then singling me a Champion for his Play,</l>
            <l>My Manhood and his Wit are much at one,</l>
            <l>The want of both in us are too well known;</l>
            <l>Excuse him, 'tis his Tryal, just such another,</l>
            <l>As some poor under-witted elder Brother,</l>
            <l>Whose hasty Father did young Bride Beleaguer,</l>
            <l>And got the Honey-moon weak Brat too eager,</l>
            <l>Faith Gentlemen be kind to his first born,</l>
            <l>I may perhaps do you as good a turn;</l>
            <l>Be not too harsh you Critticks of the Pit,</l>
            <l>To damn his Play wou'd look like spite, not wit,</l>
            <l>"See't but three days, and fill the House the last,</l>
            <l>"He shall not trouble you again in haste;</l>
            <l>"Besides, each Creditor he has is here,</l>
            <l>"And if your Actions seem to him severe,</l>
            <l>"They'll bring all theirs against him, that they swear;</l>
            <l>"Ladies, on you his chiefest hopes rely,</l>
            <l>"Your Goodness may command their Courtesie,</l>
            <l>"None dare oppose whatever you esteem,</l>
            <l>"If then they're cruel, may you prove so to them,</l>
            <l>"'Tis Charity, when begg'd to give relief,</l>
            <l>"If not, we must put on with <hi>Irish</hi> Brief,</l>
            <l>"And as at Church, the Gatherers stand at Door,</l>
            <l>"So ours with Plates shall Cry,</l>
            <l>Pray Remember the Poor.</l>
            <p>These Lines were spoken the third day, in the Room of the last thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen

            <l>You've fill'd the House, and he has gain'd his ends.</l>
