            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Epistle to Mr. Dryden.</head>
            <l>
               <hi>DRYDEN,</hi> thy Wit has catterwauld too long,</l>
            <l>Now <hi>Lero, Lero,</hi> is the only Song.</l>
            <l>What Singing, Dancing, Interludes of late</l>
            <l>Stuff, and set off our goodly Farce of State?</l>
            <l>Not <hi>Abbevil</hi> can turn a deep intrigue,</l>
            <l>Till first well warm'd with Bishop <hi>Talgol</hi>'s Jigg.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Wem</hi> cannot sleep, or if a Nap he takes,</l>
            <l>His Dream some old <hi>Tressilian</hi> Ballad breaks.</l>
            <l>But was e'er seen the like, in Prose or Metre,</l>
            <l>To this mad Play, or work of Father <hi>P?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>At Court no longer Punchionello takes,</l>
            <l>Each Scene, Part, Cue, mishapen to the <hi>Mac</hi>'s.</l>
            <l>Such Plot, and the Catastrophe is such,</l>
            <l>We must be either <hi>Irish</hi> all, or <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Our very Judges in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Like their old Roof, are <hi>Irish</hi> Timber all.</l>
            <l>And (bless us!) <hi>Irish</hi> Wolves are brought to keep</l>
            <l>The Nation, grown now all such silly Sheep;</l>
            <l>Such errant Asses, errant Cattle made,</l>
            <l>Or to be yoak'd, or saddl'd, fleec'd, or slea'd.</l>
            <l>O Martyrs Son! thy destiny is shown,</l>
            <l>Such props are for a Scaffold, not a Throne:</l>
            <l>So <hi>Iuno,</hi> in her impotence of rage,</l>
            <l>By Heaven deny'd, did Hell's black Powers engage;</l>
            <l>Yet sped the Heroe: <hi>Iove</hi> and Fate were strong;</l>
            <l>Religious care! He took his Gods along:</l>
            <l>But heark, O heark, the <hi>Belgick</hi> Lion roars,</l>
            <l>And shakes afar the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>British</hi> Shoars:</l>
            <l>One Brandy drinks, one mad with Prophecies:</l>
            <l>Lord! what they tell us of some Prince from <hi>Frize;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Arms, and the Man they sing, no <hi>French</hi> finess,</l>
            <l>But hearty Blows, and <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Address.</l>
            <l>Hence Vigor, and our Figure come agen,</l>
            <l>We rise, and walk, all true erected men.</l>
            <l>The force of those <hi>Circaean</hi> Cups subdu'd,</l>
            <l>And the wild Charms our new <hi>Armida</hi> brew'd,</l>
            <l>The Witchcraft he (our true <hi>Rinaldo</hi>) broke,</l>
            <l>And grubs the base pretenders to his stock.</l>
            <l>But oh, what Spirit of Deceit afar,</l>
            <l>Possess'd our Pulpits, and bewitch'd the Bar?</l>
            <l>What Bane, what Mischief on poor Mortals shed</l>
            <l>By Vermin, from the Laws corruption bred?</l>
            <l>Tho to their <hi>Irish</hi> Roof no Cobwebs cleave,</l>
            <l>Below what strife and endless toyls they weave:</l>
            <l>Wanting brave Strength to strangle men to death,</l>
            <l>What Frauds they hide! What Venom underneath!</l>
            <l>And when some shorter course to Murder's shown,</l>
            <l>Cry, O that (luscious) Point! they gain'd the Crown.</l>
            <l>Sons of the Pulpit the same measures keep,</l>
            <l>And of that same stumm'd Cup have drunk as deep.</l>
            <l>Agog for some odd transubstantiate thing,</l>
            <l>Chimera reign, and Metaphysick King,</l>
            <l>Sublim'd to School Divinity texreams,</l>
            <l>Their Brains would crow with Patriarchal Dreams.</l>
            <l>So high from solid honest wisdom blown,</l>
            <l>They'd have some <hi>Hippo-Centaur</hi> on the Throne.</l>
            <l>Not Law-ordain'd, but by some God appointed,</l>
            <l>Not Lay-elected, but be Priest-anointed.</l>
            <l>Away this Goblin Witchcraft, Priestcraft-Prince;</l>
            <l>Give us a King, Divine, by Law and Sense.</l>
            <l>Now Bar and Pulpit to Dragoons a sport,</l>
            <l>Their Cause is carried to the last Resort.</l>
            <l>Princes in more compendious method teach,</l>
            <l>Force is their way; let old Apostles preach.</l>
            <l>What's stablish'd Law, where standing Armies come;</l>
            <l>Or who'll talk Gospel to a Kettle Drum?</l>
            <l>When God would hear, where Giants did oppress,</l>
            <l>The several Nations had their <hi>Hercules.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>So were the Horns of grizly violence broke,</l>
            <l>So People freed from triple <hi>Geryon</hi>'s yoke.</l>
            <l>The various Snake in <hi>Lerna</hi> Lough that bred,</l>
            <l>That loll'd and hiss'd to death, at every head,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Nemaean</hi> Lion, <hi>Erymanthian</hi> Boar,</l>
            <l>In Bogs that wallow, and on Hills that roar:</l>
            <l>All by his Godlike Prowess done away,</l>
            <l>Their lawless rule, and that Gigantick sway.</l>
            <l>In vain whilst this high Virtue Nations sought,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Nassau</hi>-House were never yet without.</l>
            <l>Nor is confin'd to <hi>Provinces</hi> their care,</l>
            <l>Their generous <hi>labour</hi> neighboring <hi>Kingdoms</hi> share.</l>
            <l>Here the foul Herd slee from his lifted hand,</l>
            <l>That long had made a <hi>Stable</hi> of the Land.</l>
            <l>The Monster of the Lough, new <hi>Lerna</hi>-Plague</l>
            <l>(But scarce in head) the Bog-begotten <hi>Teague,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The ravenous kind, the Harpyes sharp for prey,</l>
            <l>With Birds obscene, and uncouth to the day.</l>
            <l>No Den, no Ditch, no rousting for 'em more,</l>
            <l>Now, now is come our <hi>Hercules</hi> ashore.</l>
            <l>Vile Fraud dispell'd, and superstitious Mists:</l>
            <l>He from our Temple drives all knavish Priests.</l>
            <l>Then warmer <hi>Wallop,</hi> in due Scarlet shown,</l>
            <l>To Coffee-<hi>Dick</hi> bequeaths his rusty Gown.</l>
            <l>Oh <hi>Dryden,</hi> if this <hi>Hercules</hi> were thine,</l>
            <l>How wou'd his Club, and <hi>Atlas</hi>-shoulders shine:</l>
            <l>How wou'dst thou all our Maids of Honor fright,</l>
            <l>With naughty Tale, of <hi>Fifty</hi> in a night?</l>
            <l>Howe'er, no more let <hi>Xavier</hi> mar thy Pen,</l>
            <l>No Miracle to Forty thousand Men.</l>
            <l>When Law, and bald Divinity begins,</l>
            <l>Why then, the marvel that a Poet sins?</l>
