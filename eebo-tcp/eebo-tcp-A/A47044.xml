            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

more than One thousand five hundred years, from the Apostles downward, that, is become the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Dispute of this last Age, both as to Pen and Sword.</p>
            <p>This had its Rise at <hi>Geneva, Anno</hi> 1541. <note n="a" place="margin">Ric. Hookers Eccles. Pol.

Of that made he use in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, forming, and proposing a <hi>Model of Church-government,</hi> (it being desired of him by the people;)
<pb facs="tcp:43197:3"/>
which he well ordered to his ends, and interests; intermixing <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Lay-Elders</hi>; (those fixed, these yearly elected) appointing a double number of the Laity, to what was of the other; <note place="margin">Ep. p. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Six out of their Council of two hundred, and four out of that of sixty, and two out of the twenty five; wherein (for pleasing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) the advantage of major Votes was given them in decisions; and in that, most of power in them (seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly) placed; whereas, indeed, all was thereby in himself, and in his Church-Elders principally, well judging, that the fewer (being learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leading, and lasting) might easily
<pb facs="tcp:43197:4"/>
influence, and overbear a greater number not so reaching, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, whose election also might be by the other so ordered, as to serve a Church-interest. And least (on consideration,) this might be (over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon apprehended and avoided. Therefore had <hi>Calvin</hi> (underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that form of Government, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him) first, politickly, obliged that people <hi>by Oath to receive and submit to what should be so proposed</hi>; <hi>Provided,</hi> it were <hi>agreeable to Gods Word, and to the approbation of such of the Reformed Churches as should be thought fit to be therein consulted.</hi> And accordingly, did he carefully hold, in that, <hi>to Scripture-names and words,</hi> knowing, that this could not but sound well howsoever, and
<pb facs="tcp:43197:4"/>
that it might take with the less dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, and would certainly pass with those, whose interest it was to be so satisfied. In which, he fixed principally on the name of <hi>Elders</hi>; a <hi>Scripture-name,</hi> of which much is spoken in <hi>both Testaments,</hi> but in the <hi>New Testament</hi> sounding toward the <hi>frame of Government</hi> in the Christian Church: yet, in the <hi>New Testament</hi> was found the <hi>word Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> also: and <hi>this,</hi> as considerable, for <hi>Church government</hi> as could be pretended to, in that other of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>; and yet, must not (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing) <hi>the name of Bishop</hi> be in this new Model mentioned: for, the <hi>Name</hi> would mind the injurious casting off of their Bishop, and <hi>the Thing</hi> stood in the way to other
<pb facs="tcp:43197:5"/>
grandeures; therefore <hi>with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> must <hi>the name of Bishop be shut out also.</hi> But how may that be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out force and wrong to Scripture? where, of the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> is mention frequent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; As to that, the <hi>expedient</hi> is readie and easie. It is <hi>but ordering the Text to the gloss,</hi> and <hi>framing such an Interpretation for that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-name Bishop,</hi> that <hi>thenceforth</hi> (although never till then) <hi>by Bishops, Elders</hi> be understood: so as, <hi>whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is in the New Testament said of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, should be of Elders onely,</hi> &amp; <hi>that Bishops and Elders be as the same, not distinguished in office or work.</hi> But such avoiding of express Scriptures by private constructions, could not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie all: therefore, what is short
<pb facs="tcp:43197:5"/>
in that, is to be supplied otherwise; that is, <hi>by the sense and approbation of other Reformed Churches</hi>: and to that is <hi>this new Law-giver</hi> put (unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly) by a reluctancy found in the people, they beginning to resent the design, and desiring (if possible) to get off, and loose from that, in which they now saw, (but too late) themselves intangled. And whereas their late obligation of an <hi>Oath,</hi> could not but stick close, it behoved to seek their libertie some other way, and no other way appeared so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as <hi>that part</hi> of the mentioned <hi>proviso, the sense of other Churches in the case,</hi> by which <hi>was hope for eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> it being observed, <hi>that no other Church was then so modelled in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>; and therefore, was it
<pb facs="tcp:43197:6"/>
hoped <hi>they might be inclined not to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this, being new and strange.</hi> This, the people now press, and to <hi>four</hi> of the <hi>Helvetian Cities and Churches</hi> is by them addressed, with which <hi>Calvin</hi> closeth readily; that being what he expected, and for what he was prepared, and of which he had already assurance. For, (all that having been foreseen) he had before (underhand) by Letters, <hi>dealt with the principals of those Churches, that they would not fail to declare for that form of Government, in which he had so laboured for</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva, (saying) <hi>That Religion, and piety, and the welfare of that Church and people depended on it.</hi> Whereby when that business was by all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties laid before those <hi>Churches,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:43197:6"/>
               <hi>Answer</hi> was readie; which was, That <hi>they had heard of those Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Laws, which they acknowledged for godly Ordinances, and drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the prescript of Gods Word: therefore did they think it good for the Church of</hi> Geneva, <hi>not to change the same, but rather to keep as they were.</hi> Thus, is <hi>Calvins</hi> Work done, and setled, and the people brought to a succumbency; onely, it remained, That whereas it had been by those <hi>compromising Churches,</hi> more warily delivered concerning <hi>those Laws of Government,</hi> that <hi>they were godly Ordinances</hi> (which might seem a lean expression) and that <hi>they did draw toward the prescript of Gods Word,</hi> (which was short and diminishing) therefore was something to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:43197:7"/>
more absolute and positive in the case. And seeing it was not to be expected from <hi>other Churches,</hi> it was thus therefore otherwise order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (and as effectually) First, that <hi>this Discipline be cried up</hi> (as it was industriously) for <hi>ancient, Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and <hi>wholly Scriptural</hi>; and so, <hi>above all other forms whatsoever,</hi> and therefore, to <hi>be that to which other Churches should conform</hi>; and <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> (as to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi>) to be <hi>esteemed of all, and above all best reformed</hi>: unto which, <hi>in that cursed National Covenant in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>was respect had particularly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein is to be observed the <hi>prodigious growth of this last nights mushrom</hi>; that this, but just now, standing on its good behaviour, and
<pb facs="tcp:43197:7"/>
beholding to others votes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation (and that begged) for introducing it, and needing an Oath (slily imposed, and inconsiderately taken) for holding the people to it, it self also looking on it self jealously, whether to be or not; yet should it now from <hi>a politick Government start up in a moment, and be transformed to what is Divine.</hi> And <hi>therefore</hi> no <hi>longer begging, but commanding</hi>; nor to <hi>be now confined to</hi> Geneva, (where first imposed,) but <hi>Geneva in that, giving Laws to the world,</hi> and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting <hi>from other Churches conformity to that as the principal.</hi> By all which (notwithstanding) although <hi>other Reformed</hi> Churches had been in all this time, little influenced; yet (sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by some fatality) hath it been

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>WHat is here withall now published, was at first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have been no farther publique, then as spoken. But it being since then, otherwise ordered, and concieving that so necessary a Truth (now dark and controversal,) might require more for its Explication and
<pb facs="tcp:43197:12"/>
Proof, then was, or could (circumstances considered) be, at that time, in speaking allowed. Therefore is this intended in way of Supplement at present, which may be hereafter farther enlarged, as opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity shall be for it; if not, perhaps, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto provoked by Gain-sayers, whom I expect and provide for.</p>
            <p>The <hi>asserting the Episcopal Office and Calling, and in that, the Government Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical of the Christian Church,</hi> is that now before us, concerning which that may be found true, which <hi>God</hi> speaks of some other his <hi>Truths,</hi> in corrupt times. <hi>I have</hi> (saith he) <hi>written to them the great things of my Law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Hos. 3. 12.</note> And what is now so <hi>strange,</hi> as to hear of <hi>Episcopacy, that it is the true, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and Apostolical Government of the Church</hi>? And on the contrary, <hi>That the Government without Elders</hi> (<hi>Lay or others</hi>) <hi>is but feigned, and novel</hi>?</p>
            <p>Yet, is this a great <hi>Truth, Episcopacy</hi> having been received, both in profession and practice in all Ages of the Church,

            <p>These are his Majesties words.

So Apostolique Churches derive themselves; So doth the Church of Smyrna shew Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus placed there by John: and Rome, Clements, ordained by Peter; so have other Churches those, who were by the Apostles appointed Bishops by whom the Apostolique seed</hi> (or race) is <hi>derived, or

            <p>Yet <hi>did not those Reformers</hi> in that, cast off <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> with <hi>aversness to the Order</hi>; but onely in respect of those <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual persons of the Popish</hi> Bishops <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing,</hi> they the Reformers in the mean time <hi>professing for Episcopacy,</hi> and greatly desiring it, if it might be.</p>

            </p>
            <p>First, Planting where yet none were: In

which his pains were great, labours indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and endeavours succesful; so that <hi>from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illiricum, I have</hi> (saith he) <hi>fully preached the Gospel of Christ.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, After that, was his <hi>care</hi> also in <hi>watering and confirming the Churches so planted.</hi> And that did he: 1.
