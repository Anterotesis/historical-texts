         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface</head>
            <p>Ingratitude towards men, after ſignal fawours received,
is, amongſt all civilized people, looked upon with a
juſt deteſtation; inſomuch that the morall <hi>Gentiles</hi> in ages
paſt, thought they could give no worſe a character of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
than to call him ungratefull. How much more then are
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> (eſpecially in a time of ſuch Light, as now ſhineth)
engaged, to ſhun this fin of ingratitude, towards their <hi>GOD,</hi>
whom the ſenſible know, to be <hi>the Fountain of all their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:</hi>
And ſurely, next to the infinite mercy ſhewed them
for <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake, in cauſing <hi>the days-ſpring from on high to
viſit</hi> their Souls; remarkable outward deliverances, ought
in a more than commonly remarkable manner, to be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of their gratitude, to their great <hi>Deliverer.</hi> I muſt
confeſs, thanks giving (which is what we poor <hi>Mortal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> can
return, for the manifold favours we daily receive from
him) hath it's riſe in the heart; and as <hi>out of the abundance
of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> how can thoſe who are
truly thankfull in heart; but <hi>render the calves of their lips;</hi>
in telling to their Friends and acquaintance, <hi>how great things
GOD hath done</hi> for them: Nay, they are ſo affected, with
ſuch eminent appearances of the Protecting hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
for their help, preſervation and deliverance; that
they are not vvilling to confine it to them only, but to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
it to the World; that the Fame of their God may be
ſpread <hi>from Sea to Sea,</hi> and from one end of the Earth to
the other.</p>
            <p>The following relation being large, I ſhall endeavour to
be ſhort; only, ſome of the things which ſeem to me moſt
remarkable' I would more particularly recommend to the
<hi>Readers</hi> obſervation.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The hearts of all men are in the hand of God,</hi> he can
turn them as he pleaſes. When theſe <hi>Man-eaters</hi> fury was
at height, their knives in one hand, and the poor Shipwrakt
People's heads in the other; their knees upon the others
ſhoulders, and their looks diſmal; on a ſuddain; the <hi>Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
were ſtruck dumb, and their countenances changed, that
<pb facs="tcp:97900:3"/>
they looked like another People; the <hi>Caſseekey</hi> (or <hi>King</hi>)
becoming as a ſafegard to the diſtreſſed, from the injuries of
his own men: Nay, ſuch confidence put he in them, that
he would truſt them to remove the mony, he had taken
from themſelves, before he would truſt his own. When
they were got from theſe to another place, where they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
more ſafety, they found themſelves disappointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
freſh dangers preſenting themſelves, as diſmally as before,
Yet God prevented any further miſchief, than the ſtripping
them of thoſe poor rags the others had left them, and ſome
other abuſes, which by that time were grown familiar to
them, and were looked upon as <hi>light afflictions.</hi> The <hi>Caſſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kys</hi>
Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e being made an inſtrument for their delivery, ſhe
and ſome others having ſome thing of tenderneſs of heart in
them, though amongſt ſuch an inhumane crew.</p>
            <p>2. Many were the particular deliverances upon occaſion of
injuries offered. Once, an <hi>Arrow</hi> ſhot at them narrowly
eſcaped them. Another time, ſome going to ſhoot Arrows
at them, certain of their own company caught hold of their
Bows and arms; Nay, though ſome of them ſhot, yet their
arrows miſt. Not to mention the frequent dangers they
were in, upon every ſlight ſuſpicion of their being <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
of which more anon: And well might theſe poor ſufferers
be in continual fear of their lives, ſince about a 12 month be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a parcel of <hi>Dutch-men</hi> who had likewiſe ſuffered Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack,
had been killed and devoured; and moreover, of the
many Veſſels ſuppoſed to be loſt on that Coaſt, theſe are
the firſt company, that are known to have eſcaped. Neither is
it ſo wonderfull that they are thus cruel to ſtrangers, ſince they
are unnatural to their own aged People; they having no
more compaſſion on them, than to make them Slaves to the
younger. Yet are theſe <hi>Man-eaters</hi> as cowardly as cruel;
when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came up, the ſight of a ruſty muske<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
preſented towards them, would make ſeverall of them flie.</p>
            <p>3. The dangers they were delivered from, aroſe not only
from men, but the <hi>Elements</hi> alſo God permitted to threaten
them, and afflict them. One time rowing in their Boat,
<pb facs="tcp:97900:3"/>
the Sea ſwelled, ſo that it was dangerous continuing there
on al night, and as dangerous, to ende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet Providence failed them not, but conducted them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap> through the
Breakers. Another time, by reaſon of a great Flood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
were forced to remove their lodgings ſeveral times, and for
divers daies, were in a continual apprehenſion of being
drowned, at length were preſerved upon an <hi>Oyſter-hill.</hi> Not
to mention the frequent dangers they were in, by reason of
the extream cold, too tedious to touch at here. Wherein
this however is remarkable; that God can both adminiſter
ſtrength in the midſt of weakneſs, and alſo take away
ſtrength, and cauſe weakneſs to ſeize, whenever he pleaſes:
Here was an old man, a Woman with a ſucking child, and
another with child Perſons, ſeemingly, very unlikely to
encounter ſuch hardſhips, all eſcaped, and divers <hi>Negro's,</hi>
uſed to more hardineſs, periſhed.</p>
            <p>4. As to lodging, I ſhall ſay little, any discreet perſon may
imagine, how hard it was to people well brought up, to lie
on a floor, ſwarming with abundance of many ſorts of creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things, occaſioned by the throwing the berry ſtones on
the floor, and letting all the naſtineſs they made lye there,
which bred theſe vermine; and yet perhaps might be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
good lodging, in comparison of the cold ground, where
on they often lay afterwards unſheltered, expoſed to the
bleak blaſts of the rigid <hi>North-Weſt-Wind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Their Food moſtly ſcanty, the beſt of it ſuch, as (I am
ready to think) the meanest <hi>Negro,</hi> here would not touch with
his lips: Sometimes the gills and gutts of fiſh pickt oft a
dunghill, ſometimes the ſcraps the <hi>Indians</hi> flung away, and
the Water they boyled their Fiſh in, though never ſo unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
handled. At firſt their sorrows were ſo great, and
their alarms ſo many, they could not eat; afterwards their
dyet ſo uncouth, they could not away with it; untill at
length hunger had ſo far prevailed over them, that they
could eat with an appetite, the <hi>Palmetto berries,</hi> the taſt
whereof was once irkſome, and ready to take away their
<pb facs="tcp:97900:4"/>
breath: Nay ſo ſend were they of them, that the getting
about a buſhel accident<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ly, was looked on as a great prize.</p>
            <p>6. Their being forced to mask themſelves under the name
of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though few of them could ſpeak any <hi>Spaniſh,</hi>
was an other hardſhip: moſtly becauſe the <hi>Natives</hi> often
ſuſpected them to be <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and thereby they were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
in danger of their lives. Whether their cruelty againſt
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> proceeds from their being under no apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of danger from them, and ſo may think themſelves law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
in what they do againſt our <hi>Nation;</hi> Or whether it
proceeds, from any particular diſguſt offered them by ſome
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> I ſhall not determine: However it would do well,
for thoſe that are not under their power, to avoid giving
them any juſt cauſe of offence, leaſt their Neighbours ſuffer
for their faults: One of theſe <hi>Savages</hi> could complain, <hi>that,
ſome years paſt, he had been taken off by ſome of our</hi> Engliſh
<hi>Sloops, from whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e eſcaped by ſwimming,</hi> and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
diſguſted, insomuch, that could he, by his ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ting,
have found o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t that they were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of ill conſequence to them.</p>
            <p>7. The courteſy of the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Auguſteen,</hi> who cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
theſe naked people, fed their hungry ſtomachs, and
cauſed them to be conducted ſafely to <hi>Carolina,</hi> is not to be
paſſed by without due notice; eſpecially being a man of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<hi>Nation,</hi> as well as of a different <hi>Religion,</hi> and what
is more, of ſuch an one, as doth not teach its <hi>Votaries,</hi>
ſo much compaſſion, towards thoſe they count <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
Neither let me forget the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Carolina,</hi> whoſe
Generoſity compleated, what the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Auguſteen</hi>
had begun, in aſſiſting and cheriſhing theſe our afflicted
Friends and Country folks; With which I ſhall conclude
theſe Remarks, to treat more particularly, concerning that
faithfull Servant of the Lord <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> who was one
of this Company.</p>
            <p>This man of God, whoſe habitation was in one of the
Northern Counties of <hi>England,</hi> was early convinced of the
bleſſed truth of God, proſeſſed by the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97900:4"/>
and ſoon after had <hi>a diſcenſation of the Goſpel committed</hi> to
him. He lived in his Native Country, in eſteem amongſt
his Neighbours, for his godly converſation, and honoured
in the Church of God, as an Elder vvho had abode faithfull
in his teſtimony, both in preaching the Goſpel, ſuffering
for the ſame, and behaving himſelf anſvverably thereunto.
And in the Year 1694 the Spirit of God (from vvhom he firſt
had his commiſſion) requiring him to come over into theſe
parts, to Preach the Goſpel here alſo, <hi>he was not disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the heavenly call,</hi> but gave up to do the will of God,
though in a croſs to his own, as appeared by an expreſſion
of his, before he left <hi>England,</hi> Which was to this effect,

How he behaved himſelf under them, is therein expreſſed,
with what patience he was carried through them, with what

by his grace ſeeing beyond them and their cruelty; by
Prayer <hi>wreſtling with God for a bleſſing,</hi> even the bleſſing
of being delivered out of their barbarous hands, and laying
his bones amongſt faithfull Friends; and ſo effectual were
his fervent prayers, that they <hi>prevailed with God;</hi> and ſo
gracious was his God unto him, that He ſealed an aſſurance
upon his ſpirit, that his prayers were heard, and ſhould
in due time be anſvvered, before he vvas yet off his knees.

            <p>On the 4th. day of the 2d. month, being the 1ſt. day of

               </q> He further ſaid, divers Friends being preſent,
<q>That the Lord was with him, &amp; all things were Well,

            <p>This day the <hi>Indians</hi> were buſy with what they had

told us; They went up Sound with the <hi>Caſseekey,</hi> and
landed near the place where our Tent had been: The
chief Buſineſs was to remove the Mony from one place
to another, and bury it. This Old man would truſt
our People, but not his own. After that was done,
they went to the place where our Veſsel was burnt;
they lanched our Boat, in which the Old <hi>Caſseekey</hi>
put his Cheſts, wherein was our Linnen and other

               <p>We underſtood by the <hi>Old Caſseekey</hi> that it would

<hi>Wife's Milk</hi> was gone, and our poor <hi>Child</hi> was in great
want; the <hi>Indians</hi> now and then would give it ſuck,
but rearly to ſatisfy it; for there was a <hi>Woman</hi> or two
of their own which had Young Children and no Breaſt
to Suckle them. Our Extrenity was ſuch that any

though my <hi>Wiſe</hi> had hardly and <hi>Milk</hi> for our Child,
yet an <hi>Indian-Women</hi> who was lately delivered of a

The <hi>Indians</hi> ſaid, he would be here within a day or

I had a great loſs; having about a Quart of <hi>Berries</hi>

I took my Child from the Negroe and carried him.
I had an <hi>Indian-Matt</hi> with a ſplitt in it, through

helpe't to break the wind off it; but the poor Babe was

being Dead, as we thought, for ſhe was as ſtiff as a

the Bank. This increaſed my Wife, sſorrow; and ſhe
began to doubt ſhe ſhould not be able to travell much

leave ſtriving as long as any ability was left. All our
People were out of ſight exept Four, and thoſe We
had gained upon. I ſent my Negroe to overtake them,
and to diſire them to ſlacken their pace till we gott up

Setting; and we began to look out for the ſentinalls

a ſtarved People both within our bodies and without,
and if we ceaſed from travelling, we ſhould inſtantly
be nummed and move no further. In the midſt of

prove otherwiſe, but he was ſoon ſeen by the whole

this was joy unto us, though we began to have a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

and made room for us to ſitt down by the fire. The

gave my Wife to cover her, and gave each of us a
piece of bread made of <hi>Indian-Corn,</hi> which was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant

concerning our being caſt away and what goods and
Moneys was loſt in our Veſſell, and concerning our

was done, and every one did Sign it. This took up
2 or 3 days time to Complete it. After this was done
the <hi>Governour</hi> told us, That he expected <hi>Capt. Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

               <p>This Week my <hi>Wife</hi> was taken with a Fever and

The <hi>Governour</hi> ordered his own <hi>Docter</hi> to adminiſter

The Wall of the <hi>Fortification</hi> is about thirthy foot high
