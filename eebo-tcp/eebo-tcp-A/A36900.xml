            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>In sine, during this Iayle delivery, and these separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Noah <hi>was carefull not to do like Seafaring men, who during the Storm and Tempest, invoke all the Saints of Paradise, and make a thousand vows unto them, which nevertheless they perform not in the Haven, and calm, but by an infinity of Blasphemies, and by the continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Impieties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Scarce was this eminent Man (chosen by God for the conservation of the World) descended out of the Ark, but he instantly built an Altar, on which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Holocausts and victimes in honor of him who had so sweetly, and by such marvellous wayes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to the shore and harbour.</p>
            <p>It is then peradventure for this cause God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth unto men and <hi>Noah,</hi> that the Earth shall be no more accursed for their sake: He assures them that his revenging hand shall never take the Rod so universally to scourge all sinners: that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth Winter and Summer, Cold and Heat, Day and Night, shall have their courses, periods, motions, and vicissitudes, with order, and by regular inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Is not this an innocent freedom, and capable of moving even the Bowels of Gods mercy? Indeed God promised him to deliver all those that were invelaped in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But too long have the horrors of <hi>Sodom</hi> irritated and provoked God: The night already approacheth, and there remains no day but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold two Angels in the habit of Pilgrims, who seek out <hi>Lot</hi> even at the Gates of <hi>Sodom</hi>; observe how welcome they are, and certainly, they have met with an Heart who perfectly understands the rights of Hospitality; observe what hast he makes to them, how he casts himself at their Feet, how he conjures them to spend at least one night in his House: In fine, after some refusals and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he inforceth them by his charitable impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to shelter themselves in his Lodging; they enter into it, and nothing but Feasts and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are seen in this House. But they were no sooner risen from the Table, and preparing to take some repose, when immediatly <hi>Sodomites</hi> came from a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65380:31"/>
the Flames which were ready to devour them.</p>
            <p>Mean while <hi>Lot</hi> is very much afflicted; for these <hi>Cyclops</hi> of Hell are come out of a Furnace of obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities with Hammers and Iron Bars in their Hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to break his Gate in a thousand pieces, to destroy Fathers and Children, Masters and Servants.</p>
            <p>Mean while the night slips away, and from the break of day, as if the Sun should have served to inkindle the Pyle of <hi>Sodom,</hi> two Angels delegated for the preservation of <hi>Lot,</hi> taking him by the Hand with his Wife and two Daughters, constrained them to depart together out of the City, advertizing them that to preserve their lives, and to enjoy the benefit they had received, they must seek out a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge upon some high Mountain, without turning their Heads or Eyes towards the unhappy <hi>Sodom,</hi> least some Whirlwind of Flames should chance to surprise and devour them.</p>
            <p>Behold then <hi>Lot</hi> much astonished: Nevertheless he conjures these amiable Spirits to afford him a retreat in a little Town not far from thence; the Angels granted all he desired, and the Village as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd him for a Sanctuary was also freed from the Flames for his sake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as there is nothing weaker and more wavering than a Womans mind,</hi> Lot <hi>had not power enough to hinder her Head, which was filled only with Wind, from moving at the sight of the first Lightnings which preceeded this Storm; so in testimony of her inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy she was transformed into a Pillar of Salt, as if Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65380:32"/>
Torrents of Thunder which makes a hideous noise which tears the Skyes and carries away all without pitty; nothing is seen in the Air but Flaming ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurities and ardent shadows heaped upon one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which form a Hears-cloath to cover the shamefull Reliques of these loathsome Coals.</p>
            <p>The Earth on the other side is an inlivened gulph of burning Coals, which vomit forth so many Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands and Torches, as at length one would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Air, the Skyes, the Clouds, and the Earth were no other than a Hell. Nothing is heard there but Clamors, Sobs, Rages, Blasphemies and roarings out.</p>
            <p>What a spectacle is it to see Men and Women with Bodies all on fire running through the Streets, their Hair flaming, their Eyes sparkling, their Mouths burning, and their Hearts filled with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur? What a Monstrous Spectacle is it to behold an Infant in his Mothers bosom, and in his Nurses Arms like a lump of Sulphur which is consumed with the flash of a Torch? Who hath ever heard that the World was watred with a rain of Sulphur, with a Deluge of Fire, and with an Inundation of burning Coals and Flames? What Thunder, what spoyl, what desolation of Wood-piles, of Houses, and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces?

            <p>What a wonder is it to see this Child of Tears and Desires become an object of a ravishing Joy. <hi>Sara</hi> art thou afraid that the life of thy Son will bring thee death, and that the excess of a joy so little expected, will even melt thy heart? For my part I allready ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend lest the pastime of <hi>Isaack</hi> and <hi>Ishmael</hi> prove the occasion of a quarel, and that at last either the Mother or Child must be chased away: In effect, <hi>Sara</hi> could not endure the sight of <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Ishmael,</hi> she intreats <hi>Abraham</hi> to put both of them out of his House. But <hi>Abraham</hi> who hath the tenderness of a Father for <hi>Ishmael,</hi> cannot condescend to her desires. It seems to this good Man that the severing of <hi>Isaack</hi> and <hi>Ishmael</hi> would even cut his heart in two.

Sword which you carry, as also the Wood on my Shoulders, but where is the Victim, which must be offered as an Holocaust? My Son trouble not your self; for God will provide one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So</hi> Abraham <hi>still persists in his fidelity to God, he makes ready the Altar, he sets the Wood in order, he kindles the Fire, he draws his Sword out of the Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, he takes</hi> Isaack <hi>into his Arms, he placeth him near the pile, he tyes his Hands, and puts the cover over his forehead; in sine, this innocent Lamb being on both his Knees, his Body half naked, and his Head bowed a little forward sighing sweetly without making the least complaint, or demanding any more why, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the stroak of Death, when his Father (as it is very probable) began to acquaint him with the secret of his happy lot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Isaack <hi>my most dear Son, thou didst ask me at the foot of the Mountain, where was the Victim of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. I answered thee, that God woul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> provide one; his Paternal Goodness hath done it, and his will i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that thou must be the Victim, and I the Priest: it is very true, that thou art the object of my sweetest hopes, and that I should look on thee as the support of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ouse; but it is in God we must place our only hope; it is he that serves for a Basis and Piller to all fortunes, and it is his sage Providence, which holds in its hands good and evil, favours and disgraces, Life and Death. Dye then cheerfully my dear Child, and rest assured that I would willingly put my self in thy place, if God had so ordained. I adore his will, and I am too happy to serve as an instrument unto his commands? As for thee my poor Son, I had very constant proofs of thy sweet disposition, and if I had not often tryed how obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and pliable thou art unto Gods will and mine, I should endeavour more efficaciously to perswade thee; but it would be fruitless, and it is from Gods goodness and thy constancy I hope for the Grace of being inabled to offer and immolate thee with my own Hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:65380:42"/>What can <hi>Isaack</hi> say to this? It is enough for him to assent and be silent; I yet frame in my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that he besought his Father to give him his Sword, that he might kiss it as the rod of the wise Providence of Heaven. I believe also he bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down his Head a little more forward to testifie that his thoughts accorded with his Heart, and that his most real affections were ready to be immolated unto God and his Father.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while <hi>Abraham</hi> takes his Sword again into his Hand, and having bathed it with his tears, he lifts up his arm to discharge his blow upon the Neck of his Son.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But what will be the issue, will not all the Angels of Heaven who look upon this Sacrifice put some Victim, in</hi> Isaacks <hi>place? Divine Spirits, I call on you for</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Isaack.</p>
                  <p>In conclusion, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had already lifted up his Arm, and was ready to dart the Thunder-bolt God had put into his Hand, the Voice of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel cryes out, <hi>Abraham, Abraham, I command thee from God not to touch the Child, and to pass no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. XIX. Giveing an Account of the Death of Sara.</head>
            <p>THe most smiling prosperities often swim amidst Tears; the clearest and most serene dayes are followed sometimes by the most obscurest &amp; dusky Nights: Bodies for Companions have their own sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, Roses are mixed with Thorns, and even the Life of Man never ends but in Death. To see <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Sara,</hi> and <hi>Isaack,</hi> after their deliverance, and the tryals God had of their fidelity, would not one have believed them almost immortall and exempted from all the miseries of Life? And yet scarce were they returned to their own home, but <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaack</hi> met with a new occasion of grief for the Death of <hi>Sara.</hi> But so it is, the strictest unions must break, the sincerest friendships must have an end, and even M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rriages themselves of which God was the sacred knot, must at length make a Tragick Divorce upon a Bed which is the most common Theater of the blind furies of Death.</p>
            <p>We ought to confess nevertheless that it is a spect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle able to excite the constancy of a good Courage, when we shall behold this unmercifull Murdress which snacheth away Daughters out of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Bosoms, and Sons in the sight of their Fathers, and Wifes between the Arms of their Husbands.</p>
            <p>In such a case, if Nature had not some tenderness, she would be unnaturall, and we must have Hearts of Marble not to be touched with some sense of grief and pitty: <hi>Abraham</hi> had then just cause to testifie by his tears, the regret he had for his dear <hi>Sara</hi>'s Death; and surely since he lost so rare a blessing, well might he disconsolately bewayl it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:65380:43"/>This mourning was not yet blameable, and he was very carefull not to doe like those, who bury all their affections in the preparation of a Funerall pomp, and who have but a shadowed meen, or else not being able sufficiently to disguise their looks, strive to hide under the Veils and shadows of a Bed or dark Chamber, the shame of their insensibility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> shed more tears from his Heart, than by his Eyes, and in rendring all duties to Nature and his Wife, he most amply satisfied God, and his own piety: while he was a Pilgrim and stranger in the Land of <hi>Canaan, Sara</hi> being Dead in the City of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron,</hi> he went directly into the place where his Wifes Body reposed.</p>
            <p>There he offered up his Prayers unto God, and kiss'd a thousand times those amiable reliques, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering them from time to time with his tears.</p>
            <p>He presently intreated <hi>Ephron</hi> to sell him a double Cave which was close by the vale of <hi>Mambre</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr <hi>Sara</hi> in that place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ephron</hi> is willing to grant what he asketh; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at last as it were inforced to take a sum of Money for the purchace of his Land, <hi>Abraham</hi> became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Field and Groat in which he laid the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his dear moity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is in this monument where the most generous Woman of her time reposeth; and under this Rock of Diamond will be found a Diamantine Heart in the Body of</hi> Sara, <hi>who was a perfect pattern of Constancy and Fidelity.</hi>

            <p>In fine, after the deliverance of his Son, and the death of his Wife, he feeling himself wholy broken with old age, and upon the point of following the happy lot of <hi>Sara,</hi> resolved to seek a Wife for <hi>Isaack,</hi> and for that end he calls one of the most Faithfull Servants of his House called <hi>Eliezer,</hi> and having commanded him to lay his Hand under his Thigh, he conjured him by the name of God to seek a match for his Son in the Land of <hi>Haram.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The holy Scripture observes, that <hi>Eliezer</hi> very seriously contemplated all the actions of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> as being a Myrrour, in which he was to discern the marks of Gods conduct concerning <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, this prudent Man chose a fit time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto <hi>Rebecca</hi> some <hi>Ear-rings</hi> and <hi>Bracelets.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he informed himself of the conveniencies which were in the House of his Maids Parents who spake unto him. Being then well instructed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the alliances of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> and what was in her House, seeing also that all corresponded with his desires, he threw himself on the ground to render thanks unto his God, and to adore his ineffable goodness towards <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mean while <hi>Rebecca</hi> hastens to her Parents to bring them the first news of what had passed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of her Brother whose name was <hi>Laban,</hi> having taken notice, he went presently unto the Well from whence <hi>Rebecca</hi> came.</p>
            <p>Finding <hi>Eliezer,</hi> he most affectionatly intreated him to visit his Fathers House, and having conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him thither, he immediately gave Hay and Straw to his Camels, afterwards he washed his Feet, as also the Feet of those who came with him. Then <hi>Eliezer</hi> took occasion to publish the Commission which had been given him, and the artifices he had used to bring them to a Head, and to understand whether it were the will of God that <hi>Rebecca</hi> should be <hi>Isaacks</hi> Wife.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eliezer</hi> could not doubt it, and <hi>Rebecca</hi> but too much testified by her silence that her desires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented thereunto. <hi>Bathuel</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> were also of

this opinion, and therefore they were to dispose themselves to the commands of God.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXI. Giveing an account of the Birth of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AT the earnest request of <hi>Isaack</hi> Heaven was obliged to grant that at last, which a long time before God had promised him; and in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion therefore, behold <hi>Rebecca</hi> great with Child and ready to lye down. But as the pleasures of the World are not durable, so she quickly feels the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of her labour; They are no other than pains and throws, and her Womb seemed to be a thick Cloud of Thunders, and a Field of Battle, in which two little Children begin an intestine War against each other, which cannot end but by the Destruction of the Mother, or the death of her Children.</p>
            <p>However it were, she consulted God; and God answered her, that she bore too Nations in her Womb, and that two People should issue forth of her Bowels, one of which should Triumph over the other, and the Elder be slave unto the Younger; And <hi>Iacob</hi> though the Younger, supplanted <hi>Esau</hi> who was his Elder Brother.</p>
            <p>For this reason <hi>Iacob</hi> received his name; for as his Elder Brother was stiled <hi>Esau</hi> because his whole Body was covered with rough Hair; so <hi>Iacob</hi> was called <hi>Iacob,</hi> because at the issuing sorth of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Is not this an early beginning to War with each

other, since in their Mothers Womb they began the intestine Duel?</p>
            <p>But what ever happens, <hi>Iacob</hi> shall be vanquisher; for Heaven is on his side, and the supplanting of <hi>Esau</hi> shall rather proceed from the Hand of God than that of <hi>Iacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! What strife? What Victory? What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. XXVI. The Combats of <hi>Joseph</hi> for defence of his Chastity.</head>
            <p>THe Wife of <hi>Potiphar,</hi> to whom <hi>Ioseph</hi> was sold by the Ishmaelites, made it sufficiently appear, when she was so impudent, as to attempt the Chastity of her Servant; this Female Wolf had only Eyes to gaze on this Lamb, all his gestures and motions were artifices to intrap him; and she would have willingly preferred the inthrallment of <hi>Ioseph</hi> before the Command over her Husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All her bonds of Marriage were but Chains which kept her in Captivity, and the most just, and most holy Laws imposed on her, a Yoke which rendred all the duties of fidelity, which Wives own unto their Husbands, insupportable to her.</p>
            <p>It is a strange thing that we can hardly trust our selves, and that the Tongue dare not speak a word, or at least if she speaks, it is but after she hath pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all her discourses. Wherefore the Eyes are the first solicitours of Evil, and then their silence hath an Eloquent voice, which is yet not heard, but by those that are Confederates.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder then, if <hi>Ioseph</hi> heard not this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast language, when his Mistriss speak to him more from her Eyes than her Mouth. This impudent Creature cast a thousand glances on him: But the heart of <hi>Ioseph</hi> was a piece of Marble, which could not be pierced, all the Flames of this Egyptian Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fell into a dead Sea, and all her lightnings found nothing but water which instantly quenched them.</p>
            <p>We must pass then further, and see whether the Mouth peradventure will have more powerfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions than the Eyes. This shameless Woman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I should be ungratefull if I abused the favours of my Master, I should be a thief if I stole away his fairest goods, and no death could be cruel enough to punish me, if I should attempt on that which is more dear to him than life.

It was in the power of my Brethren to sell my Body, but they could not ingage my Soul; I may serve without prostituting my self, and my glory will ever be illustrious enough if I shall do no dishonourable act, and unworthy of my Extraction. In fine, I adore a God who hath most pure eyes, and should all Creatures be blind, it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies me, that he be the witness of my actions; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence all his decrees, and if all the Iudges of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Is not this to speak like an Angel, and to have the sentiments of those spirits who live in flames without being consumed, and amidst Lightnings without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dazled.</p>
            <p>But now such was the Devil of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyptian Woman,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Devil of</hi> Egypt.</note> who so eagerly persu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ioseph,</hi> he was an insolent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> importunate &amp; furious companion. His rage notwithstanding had by fits some relaxation, he knew the art of dissembling, and to be silent for a time; his Element was solitude, and the night his refuge, he sighed alwayes after <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and nothing pleased him when he was absent. In fine, he seems to have the power, to possess this Soul if she be alone, and if all witnesses be drawn aside.</p>
            <p>Beware then <hi>Ioseph,</hi> what you doe; you are alone, you are young, you are beautifull, and Esteemed. Remember that the eyes of Women dart as many lightnings as glances; call to mind that their mouths shed honey and poison, and that their tongues cast more dangerous darts than Adders: Contemn then what ever this impudent Creature can say unto you.</p>

               <hi>She will peradventure say she is your Mistriss, and that you ought to obey her; And that if she affect you, you cannot hate her; and if she seek you, you have no reason to flye from her; she will conjure you to tell her, what in her displeaseth you. Since she omits nothing that may content you, and without injustice you cannot refuse her one single favour she expects from you; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially she being ready, on her part, to grant all that you can ask of her. There is no colour, she will not employ to represent unto you her passion; and her Eyes though silent, will swear to you, that they have often enough spoken to you, when her mouth durst not utter a word: that if it were possible, she would believe that she hath by her words manifested to you all the thoughts of her Soul, when they might have been kept secret: Besides, she will flatter you, saying, you have refused her that out of prudence, which now you ought to grant her through love and goodness. Moreover, if you fear any thing, she will assure you that she hath foreseen all that may expose you unto danger.</hi>

            <p>

            <p>Mean while let us see I beseech you, what strong endeavours are used to stay him.

               <p>Reparing to <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> he requested that all the <hi>Iews</hi> might be destroyed.

               <p>What, out of his own Purse?

But alas, it is to no purpose to complain here, the Swine I
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65380:134"/>
feed cannot pity me, and the Master I serve will not: There is no other choice left me now, but I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my Father or perish; little did I think what would come of it when I forsook him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps little does he think what I have suffered since: If my sufferings have brought down my proud heart and taught me submission, it may be, my deplorable condition may move his Bowels; it is true, he cast me not out, but I forsook and abandoned him: My Youthful heat and folly precipitated me upon my own Ruine, but as he hath more Wisdom than I, so perhaps the affections of a Father are more strong than those of a Child; and the more he sees my Foolishness, the more arguments he would find to shew me Mercy; at least, I will make tryal of his Clemency, I will humbly prostrate my self before him, I le embrace those knees that educated me, I'le lick the dust of that Threshold which I contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously forsook, I'le own my fault, and take shame to my self, and so both magnifie his Mercy if he receive me, and justifie his proceedings if he reject me.</p>
               <p>I know my Father is subject or obnoxious to no body, who shall blame him for pardoning, or set li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets to his mercy? nay, who can tell the measure of a Fathers Bowels? it may be too there is irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable Eloquence in misery; and the spectacle of a Sons adversity may have Rhetorick enough in it to carry a cause where the Father is Judge: Or if he, provoked by my Folly at first, and Extravagances since, will no more own me as a Son, perhaps he may receive me as a Servant; for if my rebellion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to be boared to his Door-post, and be his Servant for ever.</p>
               <p>Or, <hi>Lastly,</hi> if he will not trust a Runnagate, nor believe he will ever prove a constant Servant that hath once deserted his station, let him be pleased to take me as a hired Servant, whom he may turn off at pleasure; make tryal of me, and admit me only upon good behaviour. But if all fail, and he should utterly cast me off (which yet I hope he will not) I can but perish, and that I do however.</p>

                  <hi>Well,</hi> this being resolved, he casts a longing look towards his Fathers House, and puts himself on his way thither: but no sooner was he on his way, (though yet a great way off) but his Father spies him. Those lean and wan Cheeks, and the hallow funken Eyes his extremity had reduced him to, had not so disfigured him, nor those rags unable to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Nakedness, so disguised him, but his Father knew him; and the memory of his former disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had not so cancelled the interest of a Son, or shut up the Bowels of a Father, but that the sight of his present misery kindled his Compassion. And whilst the Son, partly through that weakness which his Vices and his Sufferings had conspired to bring upon him, and partly through a Combination of shame and just fear of his Fathers indignation, with difficulty makes towards him; the Father, prompted by Paternal affection, and transported between joy and Pity, runs to meet him, <hi>falls on his Neck, and kisses him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now see what entertainment his Father gives him being come into his presence. He calls for a Robe; yea, the best Robe, and so cloaths him; for a Ring to adorn and beautifie him; for Shoes for his Feet, that stones might not annoy or hurt them; for the fat Calf to feed and refresh him; and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is wanting he bestows upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that he should rip up unto him his former Faults, and call to remembrance the offences of his Youth, and welcom him home after this manner: <hi>Ah, Sirrah, are you now come, is all spent amongst your Whores and Harlots? Return unto them, let them provide for you, come you no more within my doors.</hi> But behold the love of this his Father, he useth no such thundring speeches, he threatneth not to cast him off, nor yet doth he cast him in the teeth with the former Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; he Remembreth not old reckonings, the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Youth are not spoken of: But he (seeing this his Riotous and unthrifty Son return home with an humble Heart) presently offers himself to his Child, and before he had made an end of his Confession, or could beg a supply of things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, his Father intercepts him by his hasty calling to his Servants, <hi>Bring hither the best Robe, the Shoes, the Ring, let the fat Calf be killed, make a Feast, send for Musick, let all be forgotten that is past; let my Son<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Whilst the Son was going on at this rate, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Bowels yearned too earnestly to admit of long Apologies, and therefore chuses rather to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him in his Discourse, than to adjourn his own Joys or the others comfort: and because he thought

Chief Iustice of the whole World,</hi> the Judge of the Quick and Dead is now (as it were) in all his Robes and Royalty, with millions of glorious Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, in the G lory of his Father, with all his holy Angels, set on the Bench. The poor prisoner, whose trembling Soul is newly reunited to the loathsome Carcass of his Body, is drag'd to the Bar awaiting and expecting some doleful Doom. He is lately come from hell, to give an account of his Life on earth, and to receive his Sentence; and loath he is to go back to that place of torments, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the pain of his Body will be a new and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous addition to his misery, when that shall burn in flames as his soul doth already in fury.
