            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Neyther to be fauoured of the good, nor to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted of the yll, may be, but that ſomtyme trouth may be ſtopped and hydde, but whan it is diſpleaſed, and wyl diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe, than at the laſte ſhe commeth to a good porte, and taketh londe. The fruites in the ſpryngyng tyme haue not the vertue to gyue ſuſtenaunce nor perfyte ſweteneſſe to ſatisfie the taſte of them that eatetth therof: but thanne paſſeth the ſeaſon of ſommer, and harueſt comethe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che tyme dothe better rype them, and thanne that that we doo eate dothe profyte vs, the profe therof is ryghte ſaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryneſſe, and gyuethe the more force and vertue, and the greatter is the taſte. I wyll in theſe fyrſte wordes ſaye, that in the fyrſte aeges menne were more eſtemed by theyr meke cuſtomes and delycatenes, than they were after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by their groſſe and rude vnderſtandynges. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynely ſomme of the aunciente philiſophers, I ſpeake of the mooſte aunciente, as welle Caldees as Grekes, who fyrſte lyfted theym ſelues to regarde the ſterres of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and ſurmounted the hyghe mounte of Olympius, there to contemplate and regarde the influences of the
<pb facs="tcp:3639:6"/>
planettes in the heuen: I dare well ſaye, that they haue rather merited pardon by theyr ignoraunces, than pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge or grace by their wyſedome. Theſe were the fyrſte that wolde ſerch the trouthe of the elementes of the heuen, and yet they were the fyrſte that dyd ſo we errours in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges natural of the erthe. Homere in his Illiade ſaid theſe wordes in ſpeakynge of philoſophers: I prayſe nothyng the knowlege of myn aunceſters, but I can them greatte thanke and prayſe, in that they deſyred knowlege. This was welle ſayde of Homer. For if amonge the aunciente men had not rayned ſuche ignoraunce, there had not ben ſoo many ſectes and parcialities in euery ſchole. He that hath redde the auncient antiquities of the philoſophers, ſhall not denay me, the preſumption of the knowledge and ignorance of that they deſired to knowe, the whiche is chiefe cauſe, that ſcience is not all one. There is greatte nombre of parcialities, Cynitiens, Catoniens, Peripati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens, Academyens, and Epicuriens, who were as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their opinions, as dyuers in their naturalities. I wil not that my penne be ſo diſmeaſured to reproue ſoo moche the auncient men, that the glorie all onely ſhoulde abyde with them that be preſent. Truely if he merite guardon and prayſe, that ſheweth me the way, wherby I thynke to paſſe: yet no leſſe meriteth he that ſheweth and aduiſethe me of the waye, wherby I maye fayle. The ignoraunce of the auncient men hath ben but as a guyde to aduyſe and aduertiſe all other, and bycauſe they erred, we haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſith the waye, to their great prayſe, and to our gret ſhame. I ſay that if we that be no we preſent had benne than, wo had knowen leſſe than they dydde. And if they that were than were nowe at this houre, they ſhoulde ſurmounte vs in knowlege. And that this is trewe, tt appereth wel. For the auncient ſages, with their dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to know the trouth,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:6"/>
by their cloſe and ferme made the wayes: But we by our ſlouthe folowe not the open wayes. Than to the purpoſe that I wyll ſaye, we that be nowe preſent, canne not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne of them that haue bene, but that the trouthe (the which accordynge to Aule. Gel. is doughter of the tyme) In this tyme of the worlde declarethe to vs the errours that we oughte to flee, and the trouthe of the doctrine that we ought to folowe. But as nowe the humayne malyce is ſo experte, and the vnderſtandynge of mortall menne is ſo dulle, that in tyme of nede, in goodnes of wyt we fayle and in all yll we knowe more than we ought to knowe. In ſuche wyſe, that ſome with one parte of the more, and ſome with leſſe, al preſume to wyn the game. And though this be true, yet it is but a ſmalle thynge to that we abyde fore: There is ſo moche that we oughte to knowe. For the moſte that we knowe, is the leaſt parte of that we be ignorant of, as the thynges natural, accordyng to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of the tyme, lyke maner dothe the operations of the elementes. In ſemblable wiſe in thynges mortall, as the ages hath ſucceded, ſo are diſcouered the ſciences. For cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne all the fruites cometh not together. Whan one fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth an other begynneth to entre in reaſon. I wylle ſaye, that neyther all doctours amonge chriſten menne, nor all the philoſophers amonge the gentylles were concurrante in one tyme, but after the deathe of one good, an other came better. The hygh and ſupreme wyſedome, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che all meane thynges gouerneth by Iuſtice, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it accordynge to his bountie, wyll not that at oone tyme the worlde ſhulde want or be deſtitute of ſage men, nor at an other tyme want of ſymple perſonnes: ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyringe the fruite, and ſome the leaues. In ſuch ſort that they ſhulde haue enuy of that other were impeched. This auncient world that ranne in Saturnus dayes, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb facs="tcp:3639:7"/>
other wyſe was called the golden worlde, the whiche was ſo eſtemed of them that ſawe it, and ſoo moche pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of theym that harde the writynge therof, and ſoo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che deſired of them that felt no parte therof, was not gold by the ſages that dyd gylte it, but bycauſe that there was none yll that did vngylt it. This our age nowe is of iron: yet it is not called of yron, for faute of ſages, but bycauſe the malycious people ſurmounte. I confeſſe one thynge, and I thynke I ſhall haue manye wyll fauour me in the ſame, that there was neuer in the worlde ſo moche people teachynge vertue, and ſoo fewe folowynge the ſame. Aul. Gele ſayth in his boke, that the ancient ſages were holden in reputation, bycauſe there were fewe teachers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lerners: &amp; at this houre it is contrary, there be but fewe lerners and many teachers. The ſmall eſteme that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be in at this tyme maye be ſene by greatte veneration that the philoſophers were holden in as than, the whiche thynge was trewe: Homer among the grekes, Salomom amonge the Hebrewes, Lygurge amonge the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyens, Lyuie amonge the Romayns, Cicero amonge the Latines, Apolonius Thianeus amonge all the barbarike nations. I deſyre to haue ben in all theſe ages, whan the worlde was ſo ryche of ſage perſons, and ſo poore of ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perſons, whan they aſſembled out of ferre countreys, and of dyuers realmes and ſtrange nations: not all one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue hard their doctrines, but alſo to haue ſene their perſones. I thynke I am not begyled in the hiſtories, for whan Rome in his moſte proſperitie was hygheſt in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe, Titus Liuius dothe write it in his hiſtories, and the glorious ſaynt Ierome affirmethe it in the prologe of the byble, that mo people came to Rome to ſe the eloquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the bokes, more than to ioy any Romayne trumph. Whan Olympias was delyuered of her chylde the great
<pb facs="tcp:3639:7"/>
Alexander, Philip her huſbande and father to the yonge chylde wrote a letter to Areſtotle, wherin he ſayde: I gyue greate graces to the goddes, not all onely that they haue gyuen vnto me a ſonne, but bycauſe they haue gyuen him to me in the tyme that thou mayſte be his mayſter, and he thy diſciple. Marc Aurele the emperour, of whom this pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſente boke entreatethe, he ſpeakynge of hym ſelfe wrote to Polion theſe wordes: Frende I wyl thou knowe, that I am not made emperour by reaſon of the bloude of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, nor yet for the fauour of my lynage nowe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but it was bycauſe I haue ben always a frende and louer of the ſage people, and enmy to them that haue noo good knowlege. Ryght happy was Rome to choſe ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyant an emperour, and ryghte fortunate was that empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to come to ſuche an empire, not by patrimonye but by ſagenes. And if that aege was glorious in ioyinge of his perſone, no leſſe it is to vs to ioye of his doctrines. I wyll intitle this boke the Golden boke. It maye be called golden, bycauſe in ſo high eſtimation it holdethe the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, diſcoueringe in theyr tyme this boke with the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, as theſe princes holdethe their myndes of golde in theyr Indes. But I ſaye that at this houre there be moo hartes banyſhed into the Indes of golde, than to employ them to rede the werkes of this boke. Saluſt ſaythe, that there ought great glory be gyuen to them that haue done there hygh and great actes: And that there oughte no les fame and renowme be gyuen to thoſe that in a good ſtyle haue written them. In this caſe I confeſſe to deſerue noo merites for my traduction or any fame, but I demaunde pardon of all them that be ſage, for the fawtes that they ſhall fynde therin. For excepte the diuine letters, there is nothynge ſoo well written, but that there maye be founde neceſſitie of correction, lyne, and ſenſure. Semed this to
<pb facs="tcp:3639:8"/>
to be trewe, by that Socrates was reproued of Plato, and Plato of Ariſtotle, Ariſtotle of Abenruyz, Scilio of Sulpice, Lelie of Varro, Marinꝰ of Tome, Enio of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, Senec of Aule Gele, Eſtratocles of Strabo, Teſato of Galene, Hermagore of Cicero, Origen of ſaint Ierom, ſaynt Ierome of Ruffyn, and Ruffyn of Donate? Sythe that in them and in theyr werkes there hath ben correcty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who were men of hyghe knowlege, it is no reaſon that I ſhulde be in their fraternitie, ſeinge that I knowe ſo ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel as I do to the examynation of wiſe and vertuous men. To them I ſubmyt this preſent warke, and to theym that haue ben ſuche, I them require to be contente to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and not iuges therof. It were no pacience to ſuffre, nor lawe to permytte, that a thynge that a ſage perſonne with great maturite and delyberation hath written, to be diſprayſed by a ſymple perſone. For ones redynge, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes the auctours and wryters are dyſprayſed, not of them that can traduce and compoſe werkes: but of them that can not vnderſtande them, and yet leſſe rede theym. I ſaye further of aduantage, that dyuers haue written of the tyme of the ſayde Marke Aureleo emperour, as Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian wrote lyttel, Eutropio leſſe, Lampridio yet leſſe, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Capitolyn ſome what more. The writinges of them and of other ſemeth rather epitomes than hiſtories. There is difference betwene this writynge, and that they wrote by herynge ſaye: but they by whome I haue compoſed this preſent warke, they were wytneſſe by ſyghte, and not by herynge of other, but they wrote what they ſawe them ſelfe: That is to ſay among the mayſters, who lerned the ſaid emperour their ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, there were thre, that is to ſay, Iunto Raſtico, Cina Catule, and Sexto Cheronenſe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue we to the greatte Plutarke. Theſe bene they that haue written this preſent hiſtorie, Sexto Cheronenſe in greke,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:8"/>
and the other two in latyne. I thinke of this hiſtorie is but ſmall notice, bycauſe vnto this houre it hath not be ſeene imprinted. Whan I departed from the college of my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and wente to preache in the palays, where I ſawe ſoo many newe nouelties in the courtes, I delybered my ſelfe with greatte deſyre to knowe thynges, and gaue my ſelfe to ſerche and knowe thinges aunciente. And the caſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned on a day, redynge an hiſtorie, I founde therin mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be noted in a piſtel, and it ſemed to me ſo good, that I put all myne humayne forces to ſerche farther. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in reuoluyng dyuers bokes, ſerchyng in dyuers libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and alſo ſpeakynge with diuers ſages of dyuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almes, finally I founde this tretiſe in Florence, amonge the bokes left there by Coſme de Medicis, a man of good memory. I haue vſed in this writinge, the whiche is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, that that dyuers tymes hath ben vſed in diuinitie, that is to reduce, not worde for word, but ſentence for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. We other interpretours are not bounde to gyue for the meane the wordes, it ſuffiſeth to gyue for the weyghte the ſentence: As the hiſtoriographes, of whom there were dyuers, and the hiſtorie that they made was all but one thing. I wyl not deny, but I haue left out ſome wordes, which were not mete, nor well ſittynge, rude, and leaſte of valure, and I haue medled it with outher more ſwete and profitable. I thynke that euery wyſe man, after he hathe redde this boke, wyll not ſaye that I am the principal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of this warke, nor yet to iuge me ſo ignorant to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude me clene from it, for ſo hygh ſentences are not found at this preſente tyme, nor to ſo hygh a ſtyle they of tyme paſt neuer atteyned.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the yere of the foundation of Rome .vi.C.lxxxxv. in the Olimpiade a. C.lxiii. Anthony the meke, beinge deed, than conſules Fuluie Caton, and Gnee Patrocle in the hygh capy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, the .iiii. daye of Octobre, at the demaunde of all the people Romayn, and conſent of the ſacred Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, was declared for emperour vniuerſall of all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narche of Rome, Marc Aurely Antony. This excellente baron was naturally of Rome borne in the mounte Celye. And accordyng as Iulius Capitolyne ſayth, he was born the .vi. kalendes of May, the whiche accordynge to the accompt of the latyns, was the xxvi. daye of the monethe of Apryll paſſed. His father was named Anio Vero. For the occaſion whereof the hiſtories dyuers tymes calle hym Marc Anthony Vero. True it is, that Adriane the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour called hym Veriſſimus, bycauſe in hym was neuer founde no lyes, nor neuer fayled the trouth. Theſe Anius Veres was a lignage, that auaunced them to be deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of Numa Pompilio, and of Quintꝰ Curtius the famous Romayn: whiche for to delyuer the towne of Rome from perylle, and to gyue his perſone perpetualle memorye, of his owne good free wylle he yelded hym ſelfe to the ſame vorage, that as than was ſene in Rome. The mother of this emperour was called Domiciade, as Cyne hiſtorien recounteth in the bokes of the lygnages of Rome. The Camilles were perſones in that tyme greatly eſtemed, by cauſe they were accompted to be deſcended of Camille the
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:3639:9"/>
famous and auncient capytayne Romayne, whiche dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered Rome frome the Gaulles, that had wonne hit. The men that deſcended of that lygnage were called Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, for the remembrance of Camille, and the women were likewiſe called Camilles, in the remembrance of a dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſayde Camylle, that was called Camilla. ¶There was an auncyent lawe, that al Romaynes ſhuld haue a partycular priuylege in the ſame place, where their predeceſſours had done to the Romayne people any great ſeruyce. For this auncient cuſtome they had priuylege, ſo that all they of the lygnage of Camylle were kepte and maynteyned in the hygh capytol. And though the varietie of the tyme, the multitude of tyrantes, the ebulition and mouynge of cyuill warres were cauſe of the diminyſhing of the aunciente Polycie of Rome, and introduced in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a lyfe not very good: yet for all that we reede not, that the preemynences of the Romaynes were broken, but yf it were in the tyme of Sylla, whanne he made the vny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall preſcription agaynſt the Marians. After the deth of this cruelle Sylla, in exaltynge of hym ſelfe, Iulius Ceſar the pitiefull, made dictatour of Rome, and chiefe of the Marians, adnulled and vndydde all that Sylla had made, and broughte ageyne into the auncyent eſtate the common welthe.</p>
            <p>¶What hath benne the condycions, the eſtate, pouertie, rycheſſe, fauour, or diſfauour of the aunceſtours of this Marke Aurelye Emperour, we fynde not in the aunciente hyſtories, and yet it hath ben dilygently ſerched for. The ancyent Romayn hyſtoriens were not accuſtomed to write the lyues of the emperours fathers, namely whanne they be made monarches, but the merytes and graces that their chyldren had, as for the auctoritie that they hadde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritynge their fathers. Trouthe it is, as ſaythe Iulius
<pb facs="tcp:3639:10"/>
Capitolyn, the father of Marke Aurelee themperour, had ben pretour in exerciſes, and capitayne in the Frontiers, in the tyme of Traian the good, and Adrian the wyſe, and Anthony the meke, emperours. This is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by that the ſame Marc Aurelee wrot (being at Rodes) to a frende of his called Polion, that was at Rome, ſayinge thus: Many thynges haue I felte and knowen frende Polyon, by the abſence of Rome, namely of that I ſe my ſelfe here alone in this yle: but as vertue makethe a ſtraunger na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and vice tournethe naturall to a ſtraunger: And as I haue ben .x. yeres here at Rodes to rede philoſophy, I therby repute my ſelfe as naturall of this lande, &amp; that hathe cauſed me to forgette the pleaſures of Rome, and it hath lerned me the maners of the yle. And here I haue founde many of my fathers frendes. Here was capitayne agaynſte the Barbariens, to my lorde Adrian, Anthonye my father in lawe, the ſpace of .xv. yeres. I lette the to wyte, that the Rodian people are curteis, and ful of good graces. I wolde haue redde phyloſophy as longe as my father had ben at Rodes in warre, but I maye not: for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian my lorde commaundethe me to go and kepe reſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at Rome, howe be it euery man reioyſethe to ſee his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall countrey.</p>
            <p>¶So by the wordes of this letter it is to be beleued, that Anio Vero, father to this emperour Marc, hadde applyed the mooſte parte of his lyfe in warre. It was not the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome lyghtly to truſte a perſon to haue the office of a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour on the Frontiers, without he had bene well exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyſed in the feates of warre. And as all the glorie of the Romaynes was to leaue after theym good renowme, the ſayd Marc certaynly was taken for the mooſte vertuous, and had greatteſte frendes in the Senate, wherby he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on the conqueſt of the moſt cruell enmyes: accordyng
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3639:10"/>
as the ſayde Sexto Cheronenſe hiſtorien ſaythe. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns all though they had in theyr handes mooſte peryl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous warres, yet they hadde in foure partes of the empire ſtronge and entier garniſons. That is to ſay in Byzance, the which is nowe Conſtantinople, by reaſone of them of the oryente: And Engades, the whiche nowe is called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex a citie of Spayne, for loue of them of the weſte: In the ryuer of Rhodano, which is nowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ryuer of Ryne, for the Germaynes: And in Colloſſe, whiche nowe is calledde the Rhodes, bycauſe of the Barbariens. In the kalendes of Ianuarie, whanne the ſenate deuyded the offyces, beinge pourueyed of a dictatour, and of two conſulles yerely. Incontynente in the thyrde place they prouyded for foure mooſte excellente barons to defendethe ſayde foure Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers: The whiche ſemeth to be true, for the moſt famous and renowmed barons of theyr yonge daies were capitai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the ſaid Frontiers. The great Pompeius was ſent to the Byzaunces Canſtantinople: The worthy Scipio was ſente to the Colloſſences and Rodyans: And the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Iulius Ceſar was ſent with the Gadytaynes of Calyx of Spayne: and the ſtronge eſtemed Marcus was ſente to theym of the ryuer of Ryne. This we ſaye bycauſe that Anio Vero father to Marc Aurele emperour, had ben prouoſte and pretour in the offices, and one of the capitai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Frontiers, whiche oughte to be in Rome one of the perſons moſt eſtemed.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:3639:11"/>
the moſte parte of the lyfe of this good emperour. But to be ſhorte, Iulius Capitolyn ſayth, that he had ben xxiii. yere vnder the commaundemente of Adrian the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. Howe be it contrarye wyſe is founde by other hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriens, accordynge as ſaythe Sexto Cheronenſe in his hyſtorie. It was not the cuſtome of the Romayns crony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clers, to wryte the thynges doone by theſe princes, before they were pryncis, but onely of yonge people, beynge in their yonge age, hauynge greatte and hye magnyficence, and doing great interpriſes. This ſemeth to be of trouth: for Sueton Tranquyll recounteth largely the fearefulle dedes and enterpryſes doone by Caius Iul. Ceſar in his yonge age, to ſhewe to princes to comme, howe it was a great ambicyon, that they had to attayn to the monarchy, and but of ſmalle wytte and maturitie to kepe theym ſelfe therin. It is noo newe thynge that menne gape for hye and frayle thynges. And the more hygher the magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is, the more lower they fele fortune. And whan they were diligent to accomplyſſhe their deſyre, as moche thoughte had they to conſerue their quyetnes and reſte. In caſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Anio Vero, father to Marke the Emperour, folowed the exerciſe of warres: yet he put his ſonne in the way to lerne ſcience. For there was a lawe ſore vſed and accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and well kepte in the Romayne polycye, that euery citeſens ſonnes, that enioyed the lybertie of Rome, and had accomplyſſed .x. yeres, ſhulde not be ſuffred to goo by the ſtretes as vacabundes. Nor it ſhulde not be ſuffered by the Cenſure, who gouerned Rome, &amp; dayely toke hede to the forfaytes doone therin, to ſuffre a chylde no lengar than .x. yeres of his age to play the chylde. But fro thenſe forthe the father of the chylde ſhulde be bounde to noryſhe hym out of the circuite of Rome, or to laye a pledge, that his ſonne ſhulde doo no folyes. Whan Rome tryumphed,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3639:11"/>
and by theyr policie gouerned all the worlde, it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynly a meruaylous and monſtruous thing to ſe it then, and no leſſe fearefull vnto vs nowe to here therof. There was at that tyme in Rome .iiii. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred. M, inhabitantes, amonge whom there was .ii. hundred. M. yonge people, that were refreyned and brydled from their yonge pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. The ſonne of Cato was chaſtyſed, bycauſe he was wylfull and preſumptuous. And alſo the brother of good Cyna was banyſhed, bycauſe he wente ydelly as a vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounde. Without that Cicero begyleth vs in his bokes of the Romayne lawes, no Romayne ought to ſtraye abrode in the ſtretes of Rome, but if he bare in his hand the ſigne or token of the offyce, wherby he lyued. To thentente that euery man ſhuld knowe, that he lyued by his trauayl, and not by the ſweate of other men. This lawe was kepte of euery perſone. The emperour hadde borne before hym a brennynge brande: The conſulle an axe of armes: the prieſtes a hat in maner of a coyfe: the ſenatours a tongue in maner of a cruſyble on their armes, the Cenſure a lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telle table: the tribunes a mace: the centuryons a ſygne or baner, the oratours a boke, the gladiatours a ſwerde, the tayllours ſheres, the ſmethes a hammer, and in lyke wyſe of all the other offices and craftes. We maye knowe than by this that is ſayde, that after that Marke Aurelye was borne at Rome, his father in his youthe had taughte hym good norture. And though it ſo were, that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of his yonge aege ſhulde be hydde from vs: at the leaſt way we are certayne, that the myddell aege and ende of hym was ryght glorious. His father Anio Vero wolde that his ſonne Marcus Aurelius ſhoulde leaue feates of armes, and folowe ſtudy. And ſurely it is to be thoughte, that it was done more by the valyauntenes of the father, than the cowardenes of the ſonne, excepte the dedes of

them that be deed begyle vs that ben alyue, and the cauſe iudged by clere vnderſtandynge, and that we fynde moo ſentences of dyuers ſadde perſons, that there hath benne but fewe that ben loſte by writinges and lernynge, ye and a great meynye fewer that haue had auantage by armes. Reuolue all bokes, and ſerche throughe all realmes, and finally they ſhewe vs, that very few in theyr realmes haue ben happy in armes, but there haue bene many famous &amp; renowmed by ſcripture and lernynge. Take here example and ſe if it be true or not that I ſaye. Had the Aſſiriens mo than one kynge, that was Ninus, one Lygurge amonge the Lacedemonians, the Egyptiens one Ptholome, the Hebrewes one Machabee, the Grekes one Hercules, the Macedoniens one Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der: the Epirotiens one Pirrhe, one Hanyball the Carthageniens, and one Iulius Ceſar amonge the Romayns? It is not thus of lerned men: for if the Grekes had one Homer, noo leſſe the Grekes vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth theym of the .vii. ſages, whome we beleue more in their philoſophy, than Homer in the warres of Troy. For as difficile it is to fynde a trouthe in Homere, as a lye in theſe ſages. Semblably the Romaynes hadde not onely Cycero as ryght eloquent, but alſo they had Saluſt, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, Titus Liuius, with a great company of noble men, and well approued, who haue left ryght great credence in their ſcriptures in the ſayinge of trouthe. What loſt Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro in the ſenate for vſyng of inuectiues? And as we ſaye of ſo ſmall a nombre of Grekes and latynes, we may ſaye of the Aſſitiens, Perſians, Medes, Argiues, Acayens, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens, Frenchemen, Britons, Englyſhemen, and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyardes. All the whiche nations withoute comparyſon haue of theym ſelfe lefte more memorye, and haue honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theyr londes and countreyes more by writing, thanne they that haue lefte ſignes by armes.

According as this excellent baron lerned diuers ſciences, ſo he had dyuers mayſters to teche hym. He ſtudied gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with a mayſter named Euphorion, muſyke with an other named Gemino Comode, eloquence with Alexander a greke, In naturalle philoſophy he had to his mayſters Comode Calcedonien an auncient baron, whiche expoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded to hym Homer: and Sexto Cheronenſe, neuewe to the great Plutarche. Alſo he ſtudied in the lawes, and Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Meciano was his mayſter. This emperour eſtemed to haue the knowlege of payntinge, and to graue in wood and metall, in erthe, and other ſculptures, in whiche arte his maiſter was Diogenito, in his tyme a famous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed paynter.

Of theſe noble and excellent barons, that flouryſſhed in thoſe dayes, he was taughte in vertues and ſciences. Cicero lamentethe the auncient policie of Rome, bycauſe that he ſawe great loſſe in the common welthe than preſente, ſayinge in his Retorike, that the auncient Romayns had alway regarde to that parte, where they thoughte mooſte domage and peryll ſhulde growe.

            <p>¶Frend Polion, thou meruayleſt, why that I leaue not to lerne newe thynges at the ende of my dayes.

In al naturall thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:14"/>
nature is with righte lyttell content, but the ſpirite &amp; vnderſtandynge, is not ſatisfied with many thinges. And ſithe the vnderſtandynge is of ſuche condition, that it is loſte by libertie, and is lyghtely encombred, with ſubtilite it percethe, with quicknes it knoweth, &amp; with ignorance it waſteth: it is neceſſarie, by time to remount to very high thinges, leſt it bowe vnto lowe and yll thynges.

The aunciente philoſophers, in the ſayd hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye golden worlde, and golden age, dyd not all only lerne one thing, wherby they myght ſuſteyne theyr life, and en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>creaſe good fame: But they trauayled, to knowe all that was to be knowen, and yet euer ſoughte to knowe more. ¶In the .lxxv. of the Olympiade, as dyuers perſons were aſſembled in the hygh mountayn Olympius, to celebrate the playes, by fortune thither came a philoſopher of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, whiche had made all that euer he brought with hym. He made his ſhowes, his cote, and ſewed his ſherte, and had written his bokes, and ſo of all other thynges. They that were there aſſembled, were abaſhed, and meruaylled greatly, that one man coude do it. He was dyuers tymes aſked, where he lerned ſo many thynges. And he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſayde, The ſlouthe of man is the cauſe, that one arte is diuided into dyuers artes. For he that knoweth al artes together, muſte nedes knowe one alone. This phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher anſwered highly. And ſurely, they that herd him, ought to haue bene as greatly aſhamed of his wordes, as the philoſopher was of the vainglory of his apparel. Let euery man remembre hym ſelfe, and let no man blame the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3639:14"/>
ſhortnes of the tyme, nor wekenes of our nature. For ther is nothyng ſo hard, but it is made ſoft: nor ſo high, but it may be raught: nor kept ſo cloſe, but it may be ſene: nor ſo ſubtyle, but it may be felt: nor ſo darke, but it may be ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: nor ſo profounde, but it may be diſcouered: nor ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuered, but it may be gathered to gether: nor ſo loſt, but it may be found: nor ſo impoſſible, but it may be conſerued, if with al our hartes, we occupie our powers in good exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and applye our vnderſtandynge in hyghe thynges. I deny not, but our nature is lyttell worth: But I know well, that leſſe worth is our ſlouthfulnes.

The cauſe is, we call it natural, for to do and commit vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and miſeries. And ſlouth in vertue, we calle ſtraunge and weake, bycauſe of the werkes.</p>
            <p>¶Lette no man blame our nature, for beynge weake and fainte: nor lay agaynſt the goddes, that they be cruell: for we haue no leſſe ablenes to do well, than redyneſſe to doo yll.

All this I haue ſayde, my frende Polyon, to aunſwere, to that ye haue demaunded of me. That is, in what ſciences I haue waſted and conſumed my tyme. Wherfore it pleaſeth me, to telle it to the.

The dyuers inclynations, that princis had in dyuers thynges, hath made to vary the fauour &amp; disfauour of many pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, with their people. And as the common people regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more fauour, than Iuſtice, ſuche officers are mooſte fauoured, to whom princis doth mooſte inclyne.

For the whyche occaſyon after the aſſemblynge of theſe wyſe menne, the emperour commaunded to examyne them, and to be informed of the bloude of their predeceſſours, of the appoyntement in all their thynges, and of the treatie of their buſynes, and of the credence amonge their neyghbours, and of the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their lyues, and grauitie of theyr perſones, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally of their ſciences, what they coulde do, and this to be done in an order.

And accordyng to the vii. artes lyberall there was aſſigned to euery ſcience two mayſters: ſo that the prince was one, and the mayſters xiiii.

Wherfore wyl wiſe men haue their wordes ſo diſtincte and moderate, if their wordes be lyght? And to thentent that it ſhulde not ſeme to you that I ſpeake of pleaſure, I wyl brynge to you an antyke lawe of Rome. In the ſeuenthe table of the lawes of our fathers was written theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: We commaunde, that a more greuous chaſtyſement be gyuen to the wyſe manne for a lyght dede done openly, than to a ſecrete murderer. O iuſte lawe and iuſt men that ordeyned it. For the ſymple labourer ſleeth but one with his knyfe in his angre, but he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is wyſe ſleeth many with the euyll example of his lyuynge. Curiouſely I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, that Rome begynneth to declyne, when our ſenate fayllethe of meke and wyſe Senatours, and multyplieth with theſe ſerpentines. The holy ſenate was adorned with olde prudent perſons: And not without teares, I ſaye at this houre it is full of ianglers and lyers. Auncientely in the ſcoles of Grece was taught onely wordes, leauynge the werkes: and than in Rome was taught to do werkes, and leaue wordes. But nowe it is contrarye, for nowe in grece the lyers and ianglers are banyſhed, and hath ſente them to Rome: and Rome hath baniſhed and ſent the good wyſe menne in to Grece: and in this maner I deſyre ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be banyſhed into Grece with wyſe menne, than to abyde in Rome with fooles. To the prayſe of a good man (I ſweare to you my frendes) that whyles I was yonge, I ſawe in the ſenate the philoſopher Criſippus (broughte vp with good Traian) ſpeake oftentymes: and he was ſo ſwete in his wordes, that many tymes he was harde more than thre houres to gyther: And he neuer ſpake word but it was of eternall memorye. And whan ſo euer he wente
<pb facs="tcp:3639:20"/>
out of the ſenate, I neuer ſawe hym do dede, wherby he de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerued to haue greuous peyn. Certainly it was a meruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thynge to ſe &amp; here the eſtimation of his eloquence, &amp; the infamie of his perſon. All Rome was abaſſhed of his high eloquence: and all Rome and Italy were ſclandered with his wycked werkes. The proſperitie of Rome dured CCC. yere. And ſo long Rome was Rome, as it had ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie in wordes, and grauitie in workes. One thynge I ſhal ſhewe you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is great confuſion to them alyue, and great admyration of them that be deed, that of all the auncient men I neuer redde a lyght word that they ſpake, nor an yuell dede that they dydde. What thynge was ſene than in that glorious worlde, but to reioyce in ſo glorious wyſe men? And nowe at this daye the worlde is ſo corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, bycauſe there is ſo many yong corrupt, ſurely I haue greatter enuie of their dedes thanne of our wrytynges. Their fewe wordes and good werkes haue lefte vs exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of greate admyration. And the wyſe men of this tyme teache vs openly, and write vs ſecretely doctrines of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Than by this that I haue ſayde, and by other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that I ſhall ſay, ye maye knowe, what I meane. Whan the realme of Acaye ſubmitted his peryllous hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and his proude heed, to the ſwete obeyſance of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, they drewe theym to this condicion, that they wolde haue benne the hooſtes of the garnyſons of all Aſye, and not diſciples of the oratours of Rome. At that ſeſon there was in Rome a great lorde, ambaſſadour of Acaye, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in wordes, and honeſte of lyuynge, with a whyte heed: He was enquired of the ſenate, why he was ſo cruel, to leade into his countrey for men of warre, poore and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous ſquiers, and leaue wyſe men of greatte harte. He aunſwered with ſuche loue as he had to his countrey, and with ſuche grauitie as longed to ſuche a perſon, and alſo

with ſuche hardynes as his offyce required, ſaying O fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcriptes, O happy peple, It is .ii. days ſyth I yete any thynge, and .ii. dayes ſythe I ſlepte, curſynge the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall deſtenyes of fortune, that hath brought me into Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and lamenynge vnto the goddis, that kepe me in this lyfe, bycauſe my ſpirite is betwene the harde anuelde and the importunate hammer, where as I do ſe all is as harde as the anuelde, wheron the hammer often ſtrykethe. The thynge moſte peryllous amonge all perylles, is to make election. ye conſtrayne me to choſe, and myne vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge canne not attayne therto: and the goddis doo not ſhewe me, what I haue to chooſe. If I leade garryſons of menne of armes, it ſhall be verye noyfull to the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes: if I brynge aduocates, it ſhall be peryllous for the common welthe. Sorowfull that I am, what ſhall I do? Oh heuy and vnhappy realme, that abydeth for theym, and ye cruel, that commaundeth them. Than ſythe hit is thus, I determyne me to leade them, that ſhall waſte our goodes, and ſpende them, rather thanne thoſe that ſhould corrupte and breake our cuſtomes. For a legyon and an army by neceſſitie may put to affliction and ſorowe onely a people: But an oratour or an Aduocate by his malyce, may corrupte a hole realme. Than ſayde the emperour to theſe wyſe men: Frendes, howe greatte is the credence of ignorant people, and loſſe of lerned men? Wherfore ſhuld they of Acaie rather gyue meate to poore ſowldiours, men of armes, than to haue for their neyghbours oratours and wyſe ſpeakynge aduocates? So whan this communyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the emperour was ended, the .v. greate mayſters wente awaye with greatte ſhame, and the .ix. other taryed with great feare. In all this whyle it paſſed not two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes after, that the prince Comode was come from his norces, where as he hadde lerned the doctrine of ſuckyng

He was more derely beloued of Fauſtina his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then hated of Marcus Aurelius his father. And to ſpeake with all due honour among them, the mother held her for certayne to be the chyldes mother: and the chylde accordynge to his cuſtomes was moche lyke his mother: and the father was in doubte, whether he were his ſonne, bicauſe he reſembled but lytel in vertues to the father.</p>

are lyghtely lefte agayne. I chaunced in companye of an auncient Romayne, whiche was all whyte for aege: and bycauſe he merited it, I called hym father, and he for loue and nurture called me ſonne: the whiche in caſe of aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enquyred many thynges of me, but I wolde make hym none aunſwere. Than he ſayde theſe wordes to me: Son beholde, In the lawe of frendſhyp it is written, that the frende in all thynges truſteth to his frend, firſt regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge who is his frende. Surely this councel was good. The curious man of armes (if he wil bye a horſe) fyrſte he wyll ſe hym renue and aſſayed, or he ſpeake of the ſale of hym: if he pleaſe hym not, thoughe he myghte haue hym for a leſſe price, he wyll not haue hym: yf he pleaſe hym, what ſo euer the price is ſet, he wyll not leaue hym. Than it is a lefull thynge, that the beaſte be examyned and felte er he be had into the ſtable. In lyke wyſe a manne ſhulde be examyned, er he be receyued in to amytie. And yf the horſe that eateth but hey, ſtrawe, and otes, be lefte for one yll tatche, moche more the frende, whiche is the inteſtyne of the harte, and oughte to kepe our ſecretes and affecty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for dyuers fautes ought not to be receyued in to the ſame. There was a philoſopher named Ariſpo, the fyrſte that was in the tyme of Silla and Marius, who ſayde, that frendes ought to be lyke good horſes: That is to ſay, that they oughte to haue a lyttell heed by humble conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: quicke of herynge, to the entent that they be redye whan they are called: a ſofte mouthe, to thende that theyr tongue be temperate: The houe of the foote harde, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer trauaylle: and theyr handes open to doo good dedes: their fete ſure to perſeuer in amitie: a baye colour for his good renowme: And fynally the hors retournethe, that is the manuall frende: And thereto is ioyned theſe wordes: That is, that he be without curbes or byttes: and that he

And thoughe he ſaye not ſoo, yet I confeſſe it, that is, that the naturalle fathers of the fleſhe are ſtepfathers of nobleneſſe, ſythe that we gyue the naturalitie of them ſubiecte to ſo many mutabilities, and bonde and captiue to ſoo many myſeries.

Regarde as nowe, what thynge is moſte conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for my ſonne, whiche as a yonge colte wold go play in the grene medowes, and noyſome ſhall be the keper to hym, and a thynge peynefulle to kepe hym therfro. The firſt thyng, wherof I praye you, is to gyue hym a ſtronge bridel, and a ſharpe bytte, to thentent that he be well mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, ſo that none take hym with lyes. The greatteſt faut that can be in men of honeſtie, is to ſpare the trouthe, and not to be veritable: And the greatteſte vyllanye in a vyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layne is to be gyuen in largeſſe of lyes. Sette good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vppon hym. Take hede to his handes, to the entente that he accuſtome hym not to demaunde to play at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and dyce with ſuche as be loſte and noughte. The greatteſt token, that a prince wyll looſe and dyſtroye the empire, is whan in his yonge age, he is knowen to be vycious in play. The play is ſuche a vyce, that who ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it bytethe, hit is lyke the bytynge of a madde dogge, the whiche rage endureth vnto deathe. I recommende to you my chylde, though he be yong, make hym ſad and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. Certaynly it is not ſo great a glorye vnto a prince
<pb facs="tcp:3639:24"/>
to haue the crowne on his heed, nor a chayn of gold about his ſhulders, nor the ſceptre in his hande, nor the greatte company and garde that he hath aboute hym, as to ſhewe ſadneſſe from his youthe. The open honeſtie ſuppliethe many fautes and debilities. Spare not to caſte on hym a ſtronge chayne, and to tye hym faſt, that he goo not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes and vanities. For an effeminate perſone neuer hath ſpirite to any hye or noble dedes. I am greately ſatisfied with that the teacher of Nero ſaid to his diſciple: Though I wyſt that god wolde pardon me, and that men knew no myſſe of me, yet for the vilany of the fleſſhe, I wolde not ſynne in the fleſhe. Surely they were good wordes, and yl borne awaye of Nero. Let not yet go the reyne. For yf he ſee the yonge mares, he wyll neigh or bray if he ſee tyme. The vyce of the fleſhe in all tymes, in all ages, and in al eſtates holdeth his ſeaſone or courſe, yf it paſſe not in the grene age of chyldehode, caſtynge of the reyne of reaſon, and ſtryking with the ſpurres of the fleſhe, and blowynge with the trompe of ſenſualite: Takyng the brydell in the tethe with a furious wyll, rennyng through mountaynes and woddes after the mare: In leauynge her goinge but ſoftely, and in the ouertakynge moche leſſe. And than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde being therin deliberate, the body remayneth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dinge acloyed and blynded, the reaſon troubled, the good name loſte, and yet neuertheleſſe at the laſte the fleſhe remayneth fleſhe. What remedy for this? I fynde none other but that a greate quycke fyre, couered and laden with erthe, dieth. And whan the vitious man is layde in his graue, he maketh an ende and may neuer cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte hym ſelfe. Wherfore I aduyſe you to gyue noo place to this yonge chylde to be vycious. And in the chaſtyſing of hym, gyue noo reſpyte, though he be younge, and my chyld, and well loued and cheryſhed with his mother, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3639:24"/>
though he be the only heire of thempire. With chyldren of a ſtranger crueltie is tiranny, but with a mans own childe pitie is the occaſion of his loſſe in tyme to come. It is ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vs by trees, howe we ought to noriſhe our childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of trouthe the cheſtain trees bryng forth the ſoft ſwete cheſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutte out of the ſharpe prickinge &amp; hard huſke: And on the nut tres amonge the ſwete ſofte leaues, is nouriſſhed the harde nutte.

In good ſoth theſe were good wordes ſpoken of ſuche a perſone, and ſemeth reaſone. For it is reaſon that the hors, that hathe runne and paſſed his courſe of cariage, ſhoulde reſte hym. And who that hath paſſed rightouſely, it is Iuſtice that he be ſuffred in reſte. And the chylde that wyll paſſe reaſonne, ought to be reformed. Cauſe hym to be alwayes occupied in vertuous actes. For if the vnderſtandynge be dulled, and the bodye ſlouthfull in ſuche aege, with greatte diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie wylle they drawe to thynges that be ſtraunge to their delectations, bycauſe that the lyghteneſſe is in the heed, and reaſonne vnder the eyes.

O moſte highe wordes, Glorious is the hande that wrote them, the whiche not at the gates, as they were than, oughte to be written, but within mens breeſtes they ſhoulde be paynted and grauen.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Arcus Aurelius the emperour hadde but two ſonnes, that is to wytte, the prince Comode and Veriſſime: He hadde fowre doughters by Fauſtyne his wyfe, legittimate and hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of thempyre. This emperour was exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng diligent for to nouriſhe his daughters. As ſoone as any of them were borne, forthwith they were put to nours into ſome ferme without Rome: He wolde neuer ſuffre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his chyldren, ſonnes nor doughters, to be nouryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed within the walles of Rome: Nor conſente, that they ſhoulde ſucke the breaſtes of delycate women. He hated delycate and gaye nourſes, and they that were laborous homely and holſome he loued, and to them and none other he betoke his chyldren to nouryſhe, and he wolde neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that they ſhoulde be brought home to his howſe. He was wont to ſay in his ſportynge: I haue more adoo to contente theſe nouryſſes, than to mary my doughters. Homere ſhewethe, that in Grece there dyed Arthemio, that was kynge of Argiue, withoute any ſonne to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte: and the nourſe, that hadde nouryſſhed hym, with all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3639:26"/>
her myght demanded the realme for a ſonne of hers, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hadde ſucked of the ſame mylke, that the ſayde kynge had done, allegynge, that ſyth they were bothe nouryſſhed togyther, and ſucked one mylke, that they bothe ſhuld en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heryte one realme. This ſayde Homer, to reproue the nou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryces of Grece, whiche toke more preſumption for nouriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhynge of princis, than quenes dyd in bearynge of theym. Therfore this noble Marcus Aurelius emperour, wolde not that his doughters alonely ſhoulde ſucke groſſe and rude mylke, but he wolde not agree, that any reuerence honour or ſeruice ſhulde be doone vnto them, as it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the chyldren of ſo hygh princis to be doone, and as the cuſtome is to be doone. On a daye as the ſayde empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was at ſupper, a foole named Galindo, at whoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des the emperour often toke pleaſure, ſayde, Syr yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye I came from Salon, and fro the gate of Hoſtie, and there I ſawe the emperours chyldren goo lyke labourers, and I ſe here in thy houſe labourers chyldren go lyke em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours: Telle me, why do ye diſſimule as a wyſe man, for I that am but a foole, vnderſtandethe hit not. The emperour aunſwered: O Galyndo, bycauſe that yet at this tyme, Rome is not Rome, all thoughe throughe all the worlde hit be renowmed Rome. In my ſelfe I fynde farre more aſſuraunce, that my chyldren begynne lyke poore labourers, and ende as ryche emperoures, thanne to begynne as ryche emperours, and ende as poore ſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Doeſt thou not knowe why Italy is nowe loſt? They wolde haue theyr chyldren to be wantonly and delycately nouryſſhed, and wyl not ſuffre theym to lyue in trauayle, and to leaue theyr heires poore and nedy, and theym ſelfe to ende in greatte peryl. This aunſwere was ſo excellent in fame, that it was euer taken for a prouerbe in Rome. Whan this emperours doughters were of two yere olde,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:27"/>
incontinent he prouided women and mayſtreſſes for to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che theym. Sextus Cheronenſe ſaythe, that he ſerched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the auncient matrones of Rome, which were clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of lyfe, mooſte eſtemed of good fame, of nobleneſſe of bloudde, of ſadde wytte, and that had ben mooſte vſed in bringing vp of princis chyldren. This emperour was ſoo thoughtefull in the orderynge and teachynge of his chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that he wolde haue no woman, but if ſhe were of .l. yere of age at the leaſte, and .x. yere a widowe, and that ſhe hadde nouriſhed a. C. chyldren, doughters of ſenatours. Imagining, that ſhe that had medled in ſo many thynges of other mens, ſhulde not be ignorant in her owne. After that he hadde prouyded theſe mayſtreſſes, he cauſed his doughters to be broughte to theyr houſes, and there gaue them theyr charge. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the birth of any of his dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he wolde neuer conſent, that they ſhuld come into his palays, tyll they ſhulde haue huſbandes. It chanced, that Fauſtine the empreſſe chylded a doughter, and ſhe beinge certified, that it was lyke her, and very faire, moued with a ſoft herte of womanheed, and with a motherly affection, prayed themperour, that the ſayde chylde myghte be nory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in her preſence, ſythe euery man ſayd, the chylde was ſo fayre and ſo lyke vnto them. The emperour aunſwered and ſayde: Fauſtyne, for thoſe thynges that all other haue ſayde to you, dothe it beſeme you, to demaunde this of me? But I that haue red in this caſe, and in other caſes haue ſene, in no maner I ought to condiſcende therto. Do you not knowe, that the tyme, that the doughter is nouryſſhed in the houſe, the father is charged with thoughte, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flatteringes, enuy in the bretherne, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the doughter, and foly in the nouryce. I wolde wit of you, if ſhe were nouryſſhed in the houſe: what profyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tethe it, if her mayſtres teache her ſaddeneſſe and honeſtie
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3639:27"/>
with her wordes: and we entice her to lewdenes with our workes and dedes? what profiteth it, if the doughter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue chaſtiſemente, and the mother flatter and make her wanton? More reaſon it were, that your doughter ſhould folowe the good doinges of you, that are her mother, than the wordes of the ſtraunge wydowe, that is her mayſtres. Marke well Fauſtyne, if ye oughte to reioyce at her chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhe toys. Remembre, that the pleſure of yonge chyldren, is but chyldyſſhe trifles. But if you nouryſhe theym not well, as the pleaſures were ioyful whan they were yonge, ſo whan they be olde, to refrayne them, ſhal be greatter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſure. Therfore, if you be vertuous, with drawe theyr iapynge trifles as nowe, for them that ſhall be vertuous. I wyll tel you one thynge, I wolde rather my doughters, in myne abſence, ſhulde be diſciples to vertues, than to be mayſtreſſes in lewdeneſſe in my preſence. And ſythe it is ſo, I deſire you, require it not of me. And I deſire you, that it be not ſoo. I am importune on you, that ye be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate on me.

the grace and gyfte of god, or by his fortune, he was as happy in vertuous ſonnes in lawe, as greatly infortunate of dyſhoneſt doughters. After the dethe of the good olde man, with the ſmalle thoughte of the prynce his ſonne in his gouernance, and vngoodly fame of his doughtes in theyr lyuinge, it ſemed to haue made an ende of the glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous memorie of the father, but if it were by the ſouerayne goodnes of his ſonnes in lawe, that he hadde choſe by his lyfe tyme. It is dayely ſene, that the loſſe of the father by euyll chyldrene, is wonne by vertuous ſonnes in lawe. Than Marcus Aurelius, in choſinge huſbandes for his doughters, he toke not of dyuers, that the vanitye of the worlde offered hym: but of a fewe, that of manye folkes were eſtemed to be of good behauour, and that to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge were ſuche in dede. And as in mariages all the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is to couete goodes that be in the pourſe, and not to examyne the perſone that is broughte to the houſe, He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardynge this, maried not his doughters to ſtraung kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but to naturall borne Senatours, not to ſuche as diſcended from hygh lygnage, as were the Sipions, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricions, and torquates: but to ſuche that with theyr ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues reyſed newely good lygnages: Nor he maried theym not to ſuche as were preſumptuous of the prowes and dedes of theyr predeceſſours: but to them that reſplendy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the dedes of theyr owne perſonnes. Nor of trouthe he choſe none that were very riche, but ſuche as were ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: nor ſuche as were ſoone moued, but ſuche as were quiete: not the hyghe mynded: but to the moderate, that were no boſters, but ſhamefaſt: no bablers, but ſmall ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers: no quarellers, but ſuffrers: not to preſumptuous, but to them that were meke, not to haſty men, but to them that were pacient: not to them that were eſtemed amonge the commons, but vnto them that deſerued laude amonge

wyſe men. In this maner he truſted no perſon, for he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried not his doughters to ſuche as were prayſed a farre of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to them that of longe tyme had ben proued nerehand. In good faythe herein his reaſone was good. For in the thynge that towcheth a mannes honour, he that is wyſe ought not to truſt in the onely information of ſtraungers: Nor he is not wyſe, that is ſo hardy, to doo al thynges by his owne ſemynge and opinyon. And he is but a ſymple perſone, that wyll do all thynge after the opinion of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. And in theſe poyntes the emperour Marcus had a good reſpecte to kepe theym: In walkynge good reſt, In ſpeakynge great eloquence, in eatynge good temperance: In anſwering great ſubtiltie: In his ſentences and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynations great grauitie. And therfore in this caſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryage he was full of grauitie, tyl he was therin determy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And this onely came not of hym, but of other, whan they came to pray hym. It befell that in a feaſt of the god Ianus, the emperour goinge to the campe of Mars, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a luſty hors fyers and flyngynge, he mette ſoo rudely with a tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pettour, that courſed as a knyght vpon a hors, that with the ſtroke of metyng, the trumpetour was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen with his horſe, ſo that he was ſlayne, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours hors legge broken, and his owne fote hurte, and his arme out of ioynte.

Truely therin behoueth rype and ſadde counſell. For ones fallen into the peryll therof, none may haue remedy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute greatter perylle. The renowmed Marcus Portius, whoſe lyuynge was a myrrour in his dayes, and his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and counſels remayne for a remembrance, ſayd open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſenate: O noble fathers and happy people, by the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3639:29"/>
decrees openly proclaimed in places accuſtomed, I know that in a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel and ſenate ye ordeyned three thinges, that is, ye vndertoke to make a newe warre agaynſte the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, to continue the enmitie agaynſt the Peniens, and to marie .v. hundred matrones of Rome, to .v.C. knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Mauritanie. And certaynely I am abaſhed, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge wyſe men ſo hyghe affayres ſhulde be ſo ſoone and ſodaynely concluded and determined. To ſatiſfie myn vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandynge, and for the good wylle that I owe to the countrey, I ſhall ſaye one worde, that is, to begyn warre, and to purſue hatred and yll wyll, and to conclude mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, In theſe cauſes a man ought to aſke counſell of all the men of the worlde, and al the goddis oughte to correct and amende it. And .x.M. counſaylynges wolde be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vpon eche of theſe thynges. Theſe wordes were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of great recommendation. For one thynge by dyuers opinions ought to be determyned: But many thinges by one opinion oughte not to be determyned. And if this be for all thinges, it ſerueth then moſt ſpecially in mariages. My fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, ye ſay, that he that offreth hym to be my ſonne in lawe, is greatly deſyred loued and wel named amonge the common people. To ſell ſuche marchandyſe, ſet it not in ſo yll a ſhewe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The credence of an honeſt manne lyethe not amonge the common voyce of the people, but amonge philoſophers: not amonge many, but amonge fewe: not among howe many, but what they be. Ye know your ſelfe, that at this houre all that the commons thynke is but a vayne thynge: that they prayſe is falſe: that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempne is good, that they approue, is nought, that they alowe is ſhamefull: and finally all that they laude, is but folye. Theyr prayſinge begynneth with lyghtnes, their fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowynge without order, and it endeth with furie. O howe many haue I ſene in Italye lyke the lies of wyne caſte out
<pb facs="tcp:3639:30"/>
of the ſenate, and after put as fyrebrondes of tauernes in Rome, by whoſe opinions the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth is gouerned, and with great lyghtnes men put downe, and with no les lyghtnes exalted agayne. Beholde here, that the workes of the people are holden in mockage with wyſe men: and that that is agreed amonge theym, is eſtemed but for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities with wiſe men. For that that is meale with philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, is eaten but for branne &amp; chaffe with ſymple folke: and contrary wyſe, the meale of the ſymple, is but branne &amp; chaffe amonge wiſe men. Of al that our predeceſſours haue ſyfted, in theſe dayes the chylderne of vanitie worke thereafter, for they wyll be deſyred, and hate to be hated. All ſuche holdeth a generall rule, that euery man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyreth to be beloued of euery man openly, can not eſcape fro diuers ſecrete fautes. Shall I tell you, who is beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued nowe adayes? Than harken to me, and I wyll tell you, as moche as it toucheth, to whom it may touche, hurt who it may hurte, fele it who that may fele it. The people loueth hym that can diſſimule with them, and him that is nought, and enuious of them that be good, &amp; alſo ſuche as fauour lyers, &amp; ſetteth trouth aſyde, and ſuche as accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth with mankyllers and murtherers, &amp; to be ſerued of theues, and fauoureth quarellers, and purſueth ſuche as be peaſible, delyuereth offenders, and ſleeth innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tis, renometh them that be ſhamefull, and ſhameth them that be of good fame: Finally he is moſt ſet by, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> putteth them that be good fro hym, and is the moſt vayne among them that be vayne. Certaynly there is great ſuſpection to ſette hym amonge wyſe men, that is allowed of all fooles. And the reaſon therof is, that the commons lyghtly loue none but men that with malyce refrayneth them that be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and letteth the rayne ſlyppe to them that be vicious. Truely wiſe men haue hym as ſuſpect that the commons
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3639:30"/>

O howe often tymes dothe the goddis permytte the ambi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious man in honours, that procureth to do yl many dais without Iuſtice, and dothe not beholde the ſodayne hole loſſe therof with ſhame?

And I wyll not, that ye ſhoulde thynke, that the chylde my doughter, that hath ben brought vp in ſo great vertue in my palais, ſhulde be maried to this yong man for the onely fame that he hath amonge the people.

with the yll intentions of theym that be ylle: But the good condicions haue ſuch a priuilege, that of yl the good is prayſed, and the good approueth the yll. In a mans ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge, there is none ſo great a vyce, but by good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is couered and hid. And contrary wiſe, no crime is ſecrete, but with ylle conuerſation, at the tyme that it hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, it is more openly knowen. Of two extremities hit is not ſo greuous to the common welthe, a man to be weake and faynt in ſecretenes, &amp; of gentyll conuerſation abrode, as it is of hym that is ſecrete, and is rude &amp; of yll conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation openly. Dyuers not being of good order and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, we haue ſene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant a gret whyle in Rome, only for beinge well condicioned. And many mo we haue ſene, that in a ſhort whyle after they were put in office, haue ben ſoo proude and haſty in theyr condicions, that they haue ben depriued from theyr offyces. And this we ſay bicauſe this good emperour was ſo ioyous of vyſage, ſoo amyable in his cuſtomes, ſo louynge in his conuerſation, that lyght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he wolde caſte his armes aboute the necke, and on the ſhulders of them, and take them by the handes, that had any thynge to do with hym. The porters ſhoulde not lette them that wolde accompany hym in the palays: nor his garde was not ſo hardy to put abacke ſuch as wold ſpeke with hym in the fieldes. In all his ages he applyed to that that euery age gaue hym by nature: He was a childe amonge children, yonge amonge yonge folkes, worldely with them that were worldly, good felowe with good fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, a baron amonge barons, hardy with hardy men: and finally olde with olde menne. He was wonte to ſaye, whan any in his preſence that were yonge and not welle taught in their language, ieſted at the debilitie of age, or olde men at the foly of youth: Leaue them, ſith they leaue you. Many tymes of wyſe yonge men cometh olde foles,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:33"/>
And of yonge fooles cuſtomably cometh wiſe olde men: Naturalyte at the laſte maketh all thynge in kynde. As of greatte debilitie we canne drawe but ſmalle ſtrengthe, by our naturalitie we may for a tyme reſiſte it, but not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mayſter it. I am ſore abaſhed, that ſomme wyll be ſoo lordely and valiant in vertues, and ſo hygh mynded, and yet wyll make vs beleue, that they lyuinge in the fleſſhe, and being of fleſhe, onely fele not the fleſhe. I can not tel, if nature hath made other of an other nature than I am of, or me of an other nature thanne other be. For I beynge neuer ſo faſte incloſed in the ſwete conuerſation of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, yea in the beſte tyme, this falſe fleſſhe wolle calle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>atte the gate with his noughtye fleſhe. The more that we reyſe and exalte vs with ſcience and gette lyberties, the more lower we doo putte the fleſſhe with her myſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Beleue me one thynge, that if a tree beareth not in Prymetyme his flowers, we hope not to haue the fruite in harueſte type: and a yonge man that hathe not paſſed his youthe with yonge people, we haue noo hope that he ſhulde paſſe his age with olde men. And as we may reſyſte our naturalitie, and not cleane to for do it, ſo thoſe fathers erre, that are ſo extremely affectioned, to haue theyr chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to begynne as olde men, whervpon it foloweth, that they ende as yonge. This emperour was ſoo wyſe in all thynges, that amonge them that were mery, he was of great myrthe. And in verities he was very veritable. In his paſtimes he was greattely temperate, and a louer of muſike, ſpecially in good voyce and inſtrumentes, and ſoore diſpleaſed if he harde any diſcorde therin. He paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed moſte of his youthe in lernynge of ſciences. Whan he came to mannes ſtate, he exerciſed feates of knyghthode: he loued diſciplyne and not of adulation. He was apt and happye in armes, but yet in rydinge of horſes he hadde
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3639:33"/>
ofte tymes yll happe. In his yonge age he delyted to play at the tennys, and at the cheſſe in his aege. He loued not theſe counterfaytyng players of farces and mummeries, and yet leſſe trewandes, that bene natural fooles, iuglers, and geſters for pleaſure. The players and geſters ſuffred great varietie in the empire, accordynge to the diuerſitie of emperours. Iulius Ceſar ſuſteyned theym, Octauian his neuewe droue theym away, Caligula called theym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, Cruell Nero banyſhed them, Nerua made theym come agayne, Good Traian banyſhed them out of al Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Anthony Pius brought theym in ageyne: And by the handes of this good emperour Marcus Aurelius, they ended. And the occaſion was, the Romayns dyd celebrate with great ioye, the .iiii. day of May, the great feaſte of the mother Berecynte, mother of all the goddis. The ſacred prieſtes flamines diales, wold haue brought thyther theſe mynſtrelles iugglers and geſters, for to reioyce the feaſte, and contrarye wyſe the holy nunnes veſtales wolde haue done the ſame, ſo that variance felle betwene theym, ſome with force, and ſomme with reſiſtence, and ſome ranne thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in fauourynge of bothe parties, and not a fewe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte theym. The cruell and greate noyſe of ſlaughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them, was ſuche, that it tourned the feaſte to we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynges, the pleaſures into ſorowes, and theyr ſonges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to waylynges. This good emperour laboured to peaſe this furie of the people, and to ſette peace among the ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Rome. Whan all was done, he made curious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to ſerche out all the players, iuglers, and ieſtours of Rome, and in all the circuite of Italy, that they might be chaſtiſed, and Rome delyuered of them. And for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all the worlde, he ſente theym to the gate of Hoſtie, and commaunded to ſette them in Galies, and to banyſhe them for euer, into the yles of Helliſpont: whiche was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complyſhed,

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue ſayd of the hatred that this emperour had to trewandes, reuelers, getters, iuglers, geſters, and ſuche other: Nowe wyl we ſpeke of his laudable exercyſes of them that came to hym. To be welle condicioned, the malyce of mankynde is ſo great, that as good men are bounde to regard the yll, ſo do they that be yll, regarde to diſtroy the good. The trace of vertu is as good in good thingis, with them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be good, as the vice &amp; diſhoneſtie of euyll folkes, is in euyll thinges. What greatter corruption in this worlde may be, than a vertuous perſone, for one worke of vertue, can not fynde one to helpe hym to worke it, and whan he alone hath wroughte it, there cometh tenne thouſande to gaynſaye hym? The greatteſt goodnes of all goodnes is, whan tyrannies are putte vnder by vertues acquyred: or to fynde remedye agaynſte accuſtomed vyces, with good inclynations. And the greatteſt euyll of all euyls, is whan a perſone forgetteth that he is a manne, puttynge reaſon vnder fote, ſtraynynge his hande agaynſt vertue, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vice rule the bridell. This emperour Mar. Aurel. ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyned in his lyfe great glorie, in the eſchewyng the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vyllaynes: no leſſe merited he immortall memorye, in ſufferynge dyuers dyſhoneſties in the execution of his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3639:34"/>
vertues. An vnfallible reule hit is, amonge the chyldren of vanitie, to chylde the vices of theym that be vycyous. And the vertues welle incorporate, nouryſſhe many enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. They that be ylle, benne allwayes double ylle, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they beare armour defenſiue, to defende theyr owne yuelles: and armes offenſyue to aſſaylle the good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of other. The trowthe is, if good menne be dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gente to ſeke other that be good, no leſſe oughte they for to hyde theym from theym that be ylle: for a good manne with one fynger, hathe power ouer all theym that be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, but for to withſtande one ylle perſonne, he hathe nede of handes feete and frendes. And thoughe fortune be ylle to good menne, theyr owne propre fame ſhall be ſpente as of ſtraungiers. This good emperoure was ſtronge in vertue, meeke in wordes, attemperate in his exercyſes, homely with euery manne, ſadde amonge ſadde men, haſty amonge haſty men, mery with mery men, and wiſe amonge wyſe men, as it is conuenable for a curyous prince to be. And whan theſe are approued in the lawe of good men, by clere vnderſtandynge, as well ſhall they be condempned by theym that haue yll intencions. Thanne as the cooles canne not be in the embres without ſparkis, nor corruption of the carion withoute ſtenche: no more can he that hath a hole and clere herte be, without inforſynge hym to vtter louynge wordes: And he that hathe an ylle harte, alwayes ouercommeth other with wordes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyce. For it is certayne, for a ſmall ſeaſone the louer maye abſteyne his loue, and yette leſſe tyme the payne of hym, that is payned with loue hydde. The ſorowfulle ſyghes, ſhewe the hurte of the harte, and the malicious wordes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouer the yll of the harte. We haue ſayde all this, bycauſe that the bountie of this good Emperoure Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius ſet all his ioy and gladnes in them that were good,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:35"/>
and bewayled theym that were ylle. And as in ſemblable thynges, the worthy men ſhewe their worthynes, and wiſe men their wyſedome, beinge vertuous in workynge, and wiſe in knowlegynge, were very wiſe in diſſimulyng. One of the vertues, that a wyſe man ought to haue (wherin he ſhall be knowen as wyſe) is that he can ſuffre well. For a man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can ſuffre well, was neuer but wyſe &amp; wel manerd, and therwith to ſuffre the vertue of yll buſines, is a thing reaſonable, of all reaſonable beaſtis, and of them that be good, very good. And by contrarye wiſe, the man that can not well ſuffre, though it be in very iuſte thynges, hopeth not to be welle treated.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Monge the ſolemne feaſtes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the auncient Romaynes had inuented, was one of the god Ianus, kept the fyrſt day of the yere, whiche as nowe is the fyrſte day of Iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: He was paynted with two faces, to ſhewe, that it was the laſte daye of the yere paſſed, and the begynnyng of the newe yere. To this god was dedicate a ſumptuous temple in Rome, which temple Numa Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pilius, called it the temple of peace. And except the temple of Iupiter, it was holden in moſt reuerence of all other. Whan the Romayn emperours went or came to Rome, to vyſite the high capitoll, and the veſtall vyrgins, forthwith they wente to praye, worſhyp, and to offre at the temple of Ianus. The day of celebration of the ſayd feaſt, all Rome reioyced, and put on them the beſte clothes that they hadde, brennynge great lyghtes in euerye hous, and made many playes of interludes, of geſtes and iuglyng, &amp;
watched all nyght in the temples, &amp; delyuered al the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that were in priſon for dette, &amp; payde the debtes with the common treaſour. They had tables with meate before their doores, in ſuch haboundance, that more was left tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eaten, wherwith all the poore folkes in Rome were rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The Romayns thought, that what ſo euer they ſpent that daye, that the god Iano (whiche was god of tymes) wolde rewarde them double. The Romaynes ſayde, that this god Ianus was not vnkynde nor no nygarde, for yf they ſpente a lyttell, he wolde recompence theym with a great deale. At this feaſte was made greate proceſſions, euery ſorte of people by them ſelfe, the ſenate went apart, the prieſtes aparte, The Cenſores aparte, the Plebeyens aparte, The matrones and yonge maydens by them ſelfe, and the ambaſſadours went in proceſſion with al the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues and priſoners. Thus they wente euer two and two:
<pb facs="tcp:3639:36"/>
the ende of one company, was the beginnyng of an other. And thus out of the temple of Ianus, they wente aboute all the temples of Rome, and ſoo out of Porte latine into the fieldes, and rounde about the walles of Rome. And bycauſe the circuite of Rome was greatte, the proceſſions went but from one gate to an other, ſo that towarde night all the proceſſions of Rome had gone euerychone in theyr company aboute: And that done, they retourned all into the temple, that they came out of, and there offred echeone as they myght. And in the ſayde proceſſions it was of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, that the emperours went accompanied with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours: but this good emperour was ſoo famylier, that he wolde honour and accompany euery man. It was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed in Rome, that the ſayde day themperour ſhulde weare on his robe, and mantelle unperiall. And all priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and captiues that myght touch hym with their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, were deliuered, &amp; al treſpaſſours were pardoned, and bani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhed folke were forgiuen, and called agayn. And this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to vſe his clemency, and to leaue after hym perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall memorie, lefte the proceſſion of ſenatours, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any gard, went the proceſſion with priſoners and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues. The whiche doinge, was occaſion to leaue behynde hym perpetuall memory of hym ſelfe, and greate example of clemencie and lowlynes to princes for to come. Howe be it there is nothynge ſo well done of them that be good, but forthwith it ſhalbe contraried of them that be yl: And therfore this example was ſoo moche diſprayſed of theym that were yll, as prayſed and allowed of theym that were good. And in likewiſe as among them that be good, there is one noted to be pure good, ſo amonge them that be yll, there is one noted to be right ylle. And that worſe is, that the vertuous perſon eſtemeth not the glorie his vertue ſo great, as the malitious perſon by his malice is ſhamid.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3639:36"/>
This is ſayde, bycauſe there was a ſenatour in the ſenate, named Fuluius, whiche was as blacke by his malyce, as whyte by his heares. He laboured ſoore in the dayes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian to haue ben emperour, and had Marcus always as competitour. And as it is a naturall thyng to theym that haue yll hartes, to ſhewe theyr malyce in ſmal thynges, ſo this emperour dyd neuer no good thynge openly, but this Fuluius wolde grudge therat ſecretely. And though this emperour was greatly prayſed for the delyuerynge of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, yet the ſayd ſenatour coude not haue the prudence for to ſuffre it, and ſo part in mockery, and part in erneſte, he ſayd theſe wordes to the emperour in the ſenate: Why gyueſt thou thy ſelfe to all men?</p>

Beleue me, that ouer great rigour in a prince, cauſeth hatred of the people.

I haue redde in bokes, &amp; haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it by my ſelfe, that the loue of ſubiectes, the ſuretie of the prince, the dignitie of thempire, and the honour of the Senate, do conſerue the prince, not with rigour, but with gentyll conuerſation. The fyſher goth not to take dyuers fyſhes of the riuer with one baite, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mariner with one nette entreth into the ſee. I promyſe you the depeneſſe of
<pb facs="tcp:3639:37"/>
good wylles ought to be wonne with the depeneſſe of the harte, ſome with gyftes, ſome with wordes, ſome with pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myſes, and ſome with fauours. The inſaciate couetous men are neuer content, nor wyll open their affection, but locke vp their treaſours. And ſuch as ſerueth for loue, ar leſſe content with openyng of their treaſure, than locking vp their wylles. It is an olde prouerbe of Pythagoras: Loue is payd with other loue. O how yl fortune it is to a prince, &amp; how vnhappy it is to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſerue not their lordes, but for rewardes, &amp; the lordes to kepe &amp; mayntayne them, but for their ſeruice. With diuers ſtones and one ciment, buyldynge is reyſed, and of diuers men, and one lord, is compoſed a common welthe. And if geometrie begile me not, the morter that ioyneth one ſtone with an other, ought to be medled with ſande and ſlecked lyme by reſon. Separate the ſtones, and the wal openeth, and let the cyment fayle, and the edifice falleth. He that is wyſe, may well vnderſtande me. Loue betwene neybours ſuffereth to be mitigate with water: but hit is requyſite, that the loue of the prince and his people be pure. Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers trowbles, and acte dyuers tymes, I haue ſeene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the common people of Rome in one day moued and appeaſed: but one diſcorde, reyſed betwene the lorde and the common welthe, vnto the death, is neuer accorded. It is a difficile thinge, to make appoyntment of many with many, and more difficile, to accorde one with an nother. But without compariſon, more harder it is, to appoynt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers with one, than one with dyuers. And in this caſe I wyl not ſaue the prince, nor leue the people vnconde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pned. Fro whens (as ye thynk) cometh it now adays, that lordis with annoyance commaunde vniuſte thinges, and in iuſt thinges the ſubiectes are vnobediente? Nowe here me, &amp; I ſhall tell you. The prince doinge a thynge in dede, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3639:37"/>
not of righte, wyl confounde the wyl of euery manne, and beleue his owne vnderſtandynge, and drawe of hym ſelfe and all other his onely wyl. Contrary wiſe, the multitude of the people diſprayſynge theyr lordes vnderſtandynge, do as they will: not as all wyll, but as euery manne deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth hym ſelfe. Of trouth it is a greuous thing, although it be greately accuſtomed, to wyll, that all gounes ſhulde be mete fore one man, and that one mans harneis ſhuld be mete to arme all men. Than what ſhall we do, that our fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers haue lefte thus in the worlde, &amp; alſo we hold that we be theyr chyldren, and that worſe is, we leaue the ſame to our heires? O howe many princis of my predeceſſours, I haue redde of, that haue bene loſte in ſhewynge theym ſelfe ouer ſtraunge, and beloued of none? I wyll tell you of ſomme of them for exaumples, that I haue redde in my bokes, to thintent that pryncis maye ſe what they wynne by amiable conuerſation, and what they loſe by ouermoch ſtraungenes. In the realme of Aſſiens, greatter in armes than the Caldeens, and leſſe in aduantage and antiquitie than the Aſſiriens: One maner forme of kynges endured amonge them. CC. and .xx. yeres, by reaſon they were of lowable conuerſation. And an nother fourme and maner (as Homer ſayth) laſted but .xl. yeres, bicauſe their kinges were of an yll condition. And the .ix. Epiphanes of the Egiptiens was vnnombred and put down, bycauſe there was a lawe that eche one ſhulde be bare legged in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples vpon the holy dayes. And this kynge on a day riding came before the god Apis, god of the Egiptiens, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thyng was not ſuffred, for beſyde that he was put out of his realme, he was chaſtiſed. Alſo the .vi. Arfacidauel the inuincible kynge of Parthes, not onely was depriued, but alſo banyſhed out of his realme, bycauſe he dyned at a knyghtes bridale, and wolde not eate at the bridale of a
<pb facs="tcp:3639:38"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muner. Yet alſo though the realme of Italy was ſcant, theyr hartes were greatte: for bycauſe one of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranes, for ſo were their kynges called, had ſhette his ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes by nyghte, for to ſlepe the ſurelyer, he was depriued of his realme: bycauſe a lawe was made, that noo prynce ſhulde ſhette his gates nyght nor day. for they ſaide, they had made him kynge for to dryue awaye their ennemyes, and not to be daintily nouriſhed. Tarquine the laſt kyng of the Romayns was vnkynde to his father in lawe, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed his blod and kynrede, was a traytour to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, cruell of his perſone, and aduoutrer with Luctece: but for all that he was not called vngentyll, nor infamed, nor traytour, nor cruell, nor aduoutrer, but he was named Tarquine the prowde, bycauſe he was of ylle condicions and complexions. And yet by the lawe of good menne, I ſwere to you, that if the ſayd vnhappy Tarquine had had good wyll in Rome, for the aduoutry of Lucrece he hadde not be put out of his realme, for as moche as other great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more greuous harmes hadde benne doone before his tyme, and alſo moche wors ſithen by aged emperours in the empire, the whyche crymes by theym commytted were ſuche, that the offence of this frayle yonge man was but ſmall in eſtimation. For thynge certayne theſe pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces holde, that if they gyue dyuers occaſions for their yll wyll, yet a lyttell thing ſuffiſeth if he ſhewe, that the hate that he hath is for none yll wyll: but the hate that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte hath to the lorde, is bycauſe he hath no power. ¶Iulius Ceſar, the laſte dictatour and firſte emperour, bycauſe he forgate to be a man among men, but thinking to be a god amonge goddis, beynge a lawdable cuſtome, that the ſenate ſhulde ſalute the emperour on their knees, and the emperour to ryſe courteyſly agaynſte theym: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a preſumptuous mind, he wold not kepe the ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3639:38"/>
he merited to leſe his lyfe with .xxiii. ſtrokes of pen kniues, And as I ſaye of theſe ſo fewe a nombre, I maye ſaye of many other. The phiſitions with a lyttel Rubarbe purge many humours of the body, and the emperor with a littel beneuolence taketh many greues fro the ſtomakes of his ſubiectes. The people owe obedience to the prynce, and to do his perſone great reuerence, and fulfyll his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, and the prince oweth egall iuſtice to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, and meke conuerſation to all men.</p>
            <p>¶Marcus Portius ſayde dyuers tymes in Rome: That the publycke welthe is there perpetuall and without any ſodayne falle, where the prynce fyndethe obedience, and all the people fyndethe loue with the prynce. For of the loue of the lorde bredethe the good obedience of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte, and of the obedience of the ſubiecte bredeth the good loue of the lorde. The emperour in Rome is lyke to a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that is in the myddes of her webbe. For if the ſayde coppe webbe be touched with the poynte of a nedell, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſpider feleth hit. I meane that all the werkes of the emperour in Rome benne ſtreyghte waye knowen in all the erthe. I beleue that this daye I haue bene iudged of humayne malyce, for accompanyenge the proceſſyon of the captiues, and that I ſuffredde theym to towche me, that they myghte enioy the priuilege of lybertie. I yelde and gyue great graces to my goddis of my good happe, bycauſe they haue made me pitifull for to delyuer priſoners, and not cruell as a tyraunte for to make theym bonde that be free. The prouerbe ſayth: One ſnare maye take two byrdes: So it hath ben this daye, for that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte rebounded onely to the myſerable priſoners, but the fauour, to all theyr nations. And doo ye not knowe, that by the takyng away of their yrons, I haue drawen to me the hartes of all theyr realmes and countreys? Fynally
<pb facs="tcp:3639:39"/>
hit is more ſure to a prince to be ſerued with free hartes, and loue of them that be at libertie, than of ſubiectes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreyned with feare.</p>

And bycauſe the tyme is glorious of hym that gloriouſly ſpendeth it, and the tyme is accurſed, that to our domage and without profyte to other paſſeth, leauing vs ignorant as brute beaſtes: He departed the tyme by times, the order wherof was thus. Seuen howres he ſlepte in the nyght, and reſted one howre in the daye: At dyner and ſupper he waſted but onely two howres: he deputed two howres for the matters of Aſie: Other two howres for the buſyneſſe of Europe and Affrike: and in conuerſation of his houſe, and with his wife and children ſeruantes and fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des that came to ſee him, he ſpente other two howres: And for the outwarde beſyneſſe, as to here the complayntes of theym

All the reſt of the day and nyght in reding of bokes, to write workes, to make metres, to ſtudye antyquities, to practyſe with wiſe men, to diſpute amonge philoſophers, he paſſed thus ordinately in wynter: And in ſommer if cruel warres let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hym not, or that he were troubled with great and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous matters, he went euer to bed at .ix. of the clocke, and awoke at .iiii.

And thus in redynge he ſpente the reſt of the nyght, tyll it was day.

One thynge I haue ſene, the whiche neuer begyled me, that the iuſte goddes do gyue to the vniuſte menne, that all the euylles that they doo in this worlde, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytted to the furies of the other worlde: But if they doo commytte any ſynne for the pleaſure of any woman, the goddis commaunde, that by the handes of the ſame wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manne, we ſhall receyue peyne in this worlde, and not in the other. There is not ſoo fyers or peryllous an ennemie to a manne, as is his wyfe. And though a manne can not lyue with her as a man, I neuer ſawe none ſoo lyght, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge with a vicious woman, in doynge vyce, but that by the ſame woman at the laſt he receyued ſhame and chaſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſement. Of one thynge I am ſure, and I ſaye it not by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue ſene it, but experimented in my ſelfe, that though the huſbande do all that his wyfe wylle, yet wyll ſhe do nothynge that her huſband wolde haue done. Gret crueltie is among the barbariens to holde theyr wiues as ſclaues: And no leſſe madnes is it of Romaynes, to kepe them as ladyes. Fleſſhe oughte not to be ſoo leane, that it abhorre: nor ſo fatte that it cloye the ſtomake: but meane and enterlarded, to the ende that it be ſauourye. I ſaye that a wyſe manne canne not gyue ſo ſtronge a brydelle to his wyfe, that ſhe wylle obeye as an hande mayden: nor gyue her ſo lyttell of the brydell, but ſhe wylle exalte her ſelfe as mayſtreſſe and reuler.

ye womenne are ſoo extreme in all heedlonge extremities, that with a lyttell fauour ye wylle exalte, augemente, and growe into great pride: and with a lyttell disfauour, ye recouer greatte hatred. There is no parfite loue, where is no egalitie betwene the louers. And as ye and other are vnperfite, ſoo is your loue vnperfite. I wote well ye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande me not. Therfore vnderſtande Fauſtine, that I ſay more than ye wene. There is no woman, that with her wyll wolde ſuffre any greatter than her ſelfe: nor to be contente to haue an other egall with her. For thoughe ſhe haue a. M.li. rent, yet ſhe hathe, x.M. folyes in her heed. And that worſe is, though it chaunce her huſbande to dye, and ſhe leſe all her rent, yet endeth not her folyſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Herken to me, and I ſhall tell you more. All women wolde ſpeake, and haue all other to be ſtylle: they wolde gouerne, and be gouerned of none other. One thyng they deſyre, that is to ſe, and to be ſene. And ſuche as be lyghte in folowynge theyr lyghtnes, they holde as theyr ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and ſclaues: and ſuche as be wyſe, and reproue theyr appetites, they purſue as enemies. In the annales Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peyens, I haue founde a thyng worthy for to be knowen, and that is: Whan Gnee Pompeie paſſed into the Orient on the mountaynes Rifees he founde a maner of people called Maſagetes, whiche had a lawe, that euery inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunt or dweller ſhuld haue two tonnes or fattes, bycauſe there was lacke of houſes in the ſayde mountaynes: In one was the houſbande, the ſonnes and men ſeruauntes: and in the other the wyfe the doughters and maydens. On the holy dayes they dydde eate to gether, and ones in the weke they laye together. Whan great Pompeye had queſtioned the cauſe of theyr lyuynge in that maner, for that he neuer ſawe nor knewe a more extreme thynge in all the worlde, One of them aunſwered: Pompey behold,

            <p>¶I tell the Fauſtin, that though we cal the Maſagettes barbariens, in this caſe they be wiſer than the Romayns. One thing I wyl tel you Fauſtin, and I pray you marke it wel. If the beaſtly mouynge of the fleſſhe enforced not the wyll of man to do his luſte, and that he wolde not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire women, I doubte whether women wolde ſuffre it or loue it the leſſe. Of trouth if the goddis hadde made this loue voluntarie, as it is naturall, that is as we wolde we myght, and not as we wold and may not: with great peyn a man myghte be ſatisfied, though he ſhuld loſe him ſelfe for any woman. It is a great ſecrete of the goddis, and a great myſerie to man, that the faynt and weke fleſhe doth force the herte whiche ſhulde be free, to loue that it abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and to alowe that that domageth. This is a greatte ſecrete, that men can fele hit euery houre as men: and yet by diſcretion may not remedy it. I enuie not the lyuynge goddis, nor the menne that be deed, but for two thynges, and they ben theſe: The goddis lyue without feare of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be malycious, and they that be deed are in peace with out nede of women. The ayre is ſo corrupt, that it corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth euery man with two peſtilent plages ſo deadely, tha the fleſhe and the harte endeth. O Fauſtine, is the loue of the fleſhe ſo naturall, that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fleſhe fleeth ſcornefully we ſhulde leue the true harte as captiue? And the reſonne

Many dayes ago Fauſtyne, I haue wylled to tell the this, but I haue differred it tyll now, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge that thou woldeſt gyue me occaſion to telle it the: the whiche longe agoo thou haſte cauſed me to feele. It is no poynte of wyſe men, that for euerye tyme they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed with theyr wyues, forthewith to hurte theym with wordes. For amonge wiſe men the ſayd wordes are moſte eſtemed whan they are well appropried and ſayd to good purpoſe. I do bethynke me, that it is .vi. yere ſith Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pie thy father dyd chuſe me to be his ſonne in law, and thou me to be thy huſbande, and I the for my wyfe: this my fatall deſtenie dyd permytte, at the commaundemente of Adrian my lorde.

and howe yuell haue the goddis prouided for the. They haue giuen the beautie and richeſſe for to vndo the: And they haue denied &amp; refuſid to the the beſt, that is good condicions, qualitie, and wyſedome to maynteyne them. I ſay to the agayn, that the goddis haue ben very cruelle to the, ſythe they adreſſed the to the whyrlepoole, where as all yll folke peryſhe, and haue taken from the, the ſayles and oores, wherby all good folke eſcape. The .xxxviii. ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that I was without wyfe, ſeemed not to me .xxxviii. dayes: and the .vi. yeres that I haue ben maried, ſeme to me .vi. hundred yeres.

And though the goddis wold commande me, and Adrian my mayſter wolde commaunde me, I wolde not chaunge my pouertie and quietnes, for the mariage of the &amp; them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. But I haue deſired the in thy good fortune, and my ſelfe to myn yll fortune. I haue ſayde but a lyttelle, and haue ſuffred a great deale: I haue feyned a great whyle, but I can feyne no longer. No man ſuffreth his wyfe ſoo moche, but he is bounde to ſuffre more. Let a man, that is a man conſider, and lykewiſe a woman that is a woman conſyder, what boldenes ſhe is of, that quarellethe with her huſbande, and that he is a foole that brawleth openly with his wyfe. For if ſhe be good, he ought to fauour her, that ſhe maye be the better: if ſhe be a ſhrewe, he muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre her, that ſhe waxe not wors. Euery man knoweth, that all thynges ſuffereth chaſtiſement ſaue a woman, whiche (as a woman) wyll be deſired and praide.

The harte of man is verye noble, and the harte of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

is deyntie, and wyll haue great hyre for a lytel good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and for moch euyl no chaſtyſement. A wyſe man wyl knowe what he hath to do or he marie. Than if he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myne hym to take the company of a wyfe, he ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his harte to receyue all that may come with her. It is but a ſmalle wytte in a man to ſette by the ſmalle fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of his wyfe, or for to chaſtiſe openly that may be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betwene them ſecretely. He that is wyſe and wyl lyue quietly with his wyfe, ought to kepe this rule: Admoniſhe her often, and reproue her but ſeldome, and lay no handis on her. For by other meanes he getteth no fydelitie in her, nor good entreatynge of her, nor good bryngynge vp of their chyldren, nor ſeruyce to the goodis, nor any hope of profyte of her. And thus Fauſtyne I wyll ſay no more to the, but that thou conſyder, that I do conſyder, and know that I do ſe, and that my ſuffrance vnknowen to the, may ſuffyſe to amende thy lyfe.</p>

And all ye in all yll are deſyrous and couetous. As farre as I canne remembre, whan Camylle made his vowe to Cybille the mother of goddis, to ſende hym victo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie in a battayle, whan he had wonne the victorie, Rome was ſo poore, that it hadde neyther golde nor ſyluer for to make the ſtatute of promeſſe, the matrones than being, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their huſbandes dyd offre their lyues in the ſayde warre, they granted to preſent their iewels to the holy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. It was a meruayllous thynge to see, that withoute any ſpekynge to them, or without any mans entyſement they determyned all togyther to go to the hye capitol, and there in the preſence of euery man preſented their owches hanginge at theyr eares, The ringes of their fingers, the bracelettes of their armes, the perles from their attires of their heades, the collers from their neckes, The broches of theyr breſtes, the girdelles aboute theyr myddels, and borders of their gownes. And though that their gift was eſtemed to a great value, yet their good wylles was eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a greatte deale more. The rycheſſes that they offered there was ſo greatte, that there was not all onely inough to performe the vow of the ſtatute, but alſo to purſewe the warre. And as than the cuſtome of Rome was, that none dyd them any pleſure, but he was ſhortly recompenſed: the ſame day that the matrones did offre theyr ryche and faire iewelles in the capitolle, there was graunted vnto theym fyue maner of thynges in the Senate: The fyrſte, that at theyr deathes the oratours ſhuld preache, publiſhe, and ſhewe their good liuinge: The ſeconde that they ſhulde ſit in the temple, where as before they were wont to ſtand: The thirde, that they ſhuld were furred &amp; lyned gownes,

where as before they ware none but ſyngle: The .iiii. that in theyr diſeſes they myght drinke wyne, where as before on theyr liues they durſt drinke none, but water: The .v. that the matrones of Rome great with chylde, ſhulde not be refuſed of any thynge that they deſyred. Theſe fyue thinges for certayne were iuſtlye and wyllyngely graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſenate. And why this lawe that commaundethe to denaye nothynge to a woman with chylde was made, I wyll tel the the occaſion that moued the ſenate ſo to do. Fuluius Torquate beinge conſull in the warre agaynſte the Volſeos, the knyghtes of Mauritayne broughte to Rome a wylde man, that had but one eye, that they hadde taken in huntynge in the deſertes of Egypt. And the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones of Rome were at that tyme as ſad and honeſte, as they be nowe bolde and lyght: ſo was the wyfe of the ſaid Torquate, that was nyghe the tyme of her delyueraunce great with chylde, of trouth a woman ſo honeſte, that for the ſobre ſolytarines that ſhe kepte in Rome, ſhe hadde noo leſſe glorie thanne hadde her huſbande in the warres for his worthynes, the whiche was well proued. For in the .xiiii. yere that Torquate her huſbande was in Aſye a warre fare, the fyrſte tyme that he wente thyder, ſhe was neuer ſene at the wyndowe lokynge out, and ſhe was not all onely regarded for that, but in all the ſayde .xiiii. yeres neuer manchylde nor manne aboue the age of .viii. yeres came within her gates. And not contente with this, that ſhe dyd to gyue example to all Rome, and to attayne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall memory, where as ſhe had lefte with her thre ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the eldeſt of whom was but thre yeres of age: and as ſoone as they came to .viii. yere, ſhe ſente them out of her houſe to their grauntefathers. And thus dydde this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Romayne lady, to the entente that vnder colour of her owne chyldren there ſhulde none other yonge children

entre into her howſe. Thoſe yeres paſſed, after that the good olde man Torquate was retourned fro the warres of the Volſeos, the ſayde wylde man with one eye wente by the doore of the ſayde Torquate, and one of her may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens tolde her, that it was a meruaylous thyng to ſe: and the good lady hadde great deſyre to ſee hym, and bycauſe there was none to brynge hym to her, that ſhe myghte ſee hym, ſhe dyed for ſorowe. And for certayne thoughe he came often inoughe by her doore, yet ſhe wolde neuer goo nor loke out at her wyndowe to ſe hym. Her deathe was gretly bewayled in Rome, for ſhe was in Rome moſt dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued, and good reaſon: for many dayes afore was no ſuche womanne brought in Rome.

What a diuine thing was it to ſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worldes of our predeceſſous, the whiche ſyth Tulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Hoſtilius, vnto Quintus Cincinatus dictatour, and ſith Cincinatus vnto Cyncinos, whiche were of the Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans and Marians, there was neuer Conſulle at Rome, but he coude do ſome maner of offyce or occupation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were occupied whan their offyce in the Senate was ended.

Take hede amonge you of my courte, and forgette not this. Haue ye no thought but to ſeke newe paſtymes, and to borowe euery day? No man, of what condition ſo euer he be, excepte he haunt feates of armes, or other lernynge in ſome ordinarie exercyſe, ſhall haue his body luſtye and his ſpirite quicke: but ſhalbe acloyed in al other thinges, and wander frome ſtrete to ſtrete, as a vacabounde. The harte of man is noble, and hathe power continuallye for all actes, and all paſtymes of the bodye: and yet in three dayes it is annoyed of hym ſelfe alone, ſoo that with hym can not reſt one laudable exercyſe. Lyke as I am emperor of all the worlde, ſo it is reaſon, and muſte nedes be, that I haue folke of all nacions in my palays. And ſuche as the prince is, ſuche ſhal be his houſeholde: &amp; as his houſe is, ſo ſhal his courte be: &amp; as the courte is, ſo ſhal the hole empire be.

The emperour that coude vanyſhe all theſe ydell perſons out of his empire, myght well auant him ſelfe to haue op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed all the vices of the worlde. I wolde it pleaſed the immortal goddis, that of ſo many triumphis, that I haue hadde of ſtraungers, occupied in good exercyſes, that I hadde ſene one of the vacaboundes of Rome driuen out of all houſes. There was an auncient lawe, none myghte be taken and receyued for a citiſen in Rome, but he were firſt examined by the Cenſure. In the time of Cato Cenſorius, when any wolde be a citieſin of Rome, this examination was made of hym: He was not demaunded, of whens he was, nor what he was, nor whens he came, nor wherfore he came, nor of what kinne or auncient ſtocke he cam: but only they toke his handes betwene theyrs, and if they felte them ſofte and ſmothe, forthewith as an ydell vacabunde man they diſpatched and ſent him away: and if they found his handes harde and full of hard knottes, by and by they admitted hym a citezen and dweller in Rome. Alſo whan any officers toke any yll doers, &amp; put them in priſon, that was called Marmotine, in ſtede of information, the firſte thynge that they toke hede of, was theyr hondes, whiche
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3639:51"/>
if they had bene as a labourers handes, and a worke man, though his crime were greuous, yet his chaſtiſement was mitigate, and more eaſye: and if the vnhappye pryſoner cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to haue ydell handes, for a littel faut he ſhuld haue ſharpe puniſhement. It hath ben an old ſayeng: He that hath good handes, muſte nedes haue good cuſtomes. I ſay, I chaſtiſed neuer a labouringe man, but I was ſorye for it: nor I neuer cauſed to whyppe a vacabunde, but I was gladde of it. I wyll tel you more of this Catho Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorius, whiche was greately feared. For euen as chyldren in the ſcholes, herynge their maiſter commynge in, renne to their bokes, So when Catho went through the ſtretez of Rome, euery body went to theyr worke. O right happy baron, before whom the people feared more to be idel, than to do yl before any other. Than beholde ye at this houre, what force vertue hath, and howe valiaunte a vertuous man is, ſeinge that all the worlde feared Rome onely, for her worthynes in armes: and all Rome feared Catho, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his vertues. The aduentures of men are ſo dyuers, and the ſuſpect fortune gyueth ſoo many ouerthwart tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that after that a great ſpace ſhe hathe gyuen greatte pleaſures, incontinent we are cyted to her ſubtyll trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of repentaunce. O happy Cato Cenſorine, who with ſuche as haue folowed his wayes, are nowe ſure fro the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batementes of fortune. Than he that wyll haue glorye in this lyfe, and attayne glorye after deathe, and be beloued of many, and feared of all: lette hym be vertuous in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge of good workes, and deceyue no manne with vayne wordes. I ſweare vnto you by the lawe of a man of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyppe, that if the goddes wolde accompliſſhe my deſyre, I had rather to be Cato with the vertuous policies that he vſed in Rome, than to be Scipio, with the abundance of blode, that he ſhedde in Affrike. All we knowe wel, that
<pb facs="tcp:3639:52"/>
Scipio hadde a great fame in beatynge downe of cities, and cuttynge innocentes throtes, and Catho hath attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned eternal, memorie in reformyng the people, pardoning treſpaſſours, and teachyng ignorant folke. Than ye may all ſee, yf I haue not good reaſon, more to deſyre to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to the profyte of many, than to be Scipio, to the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyce of ſo many.

Thanne as all the people were withdrawen into theyr houſes aboute ſuppertyme, for it was ſommer, ſodenly there came a monſter into the myd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the citie, after this ſhape: He ſemed to be of two cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytes of heighte, and he had but one eye, his heed was all pylled, ſo that his ſcul myght be ſene: He had none eares, but that a lyttell of his necke was open, wherby it ſemed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hard: He had two croked hornes as a gote: His ryght arme was longer than the left, his handes were lyke hors fete, he had no throte, his necke was egall with his heed: his ſhulders ſhone as pytche, his breſte and ſtomacke was all rough of heare, his face was lyke a man, ſaufe it had but one eye in the myddes of his forheed, and had but one noſethryll, from the waſte downewarde he was not ſeene, for it was couered, he ſatte on a chariot with .iiii. wheles, wherat were two lyons faſtened together before, and two beares behynde: and it coude not be determyned, wherof the chariotte was made, but there was no difference in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion therof, and other that were vſed commonlye: In the myddis of the ſayde chariotte was a caudron lyke a table

with two eares, wherin the ſayd monſter was: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was ſene but fro the gyrdelſtede vpwarde. He went about in the citie fro gate to gate a long ſpace caſtyng out ſpercles of fyre. The feare was ſo great, that dyuers wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with chylde were delyuered with great peryll, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that were weake harted fell in a ſwowne. And all the people great and ſmalle, leſſe and more, ranne to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Iupiter, Mars, and Phebus, makyng importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate cries and clamours. And the ſame ſeaſon all the ſaid Pyrates were lodged in the gouernours palayes named Solyn. He was of the nation of Capue, and there was all the rycheſſe kepte. And whan this monſter had bene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the citie with his charyot, than the lyons and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res brought hym to the palays, where the Pyrates were, and beinge very nygh to the gates that were faſte cloſed, the monſter cut an eare of one of the lyons, and with the bloode therof he wrote theſe letters. R. A. S. P. I. P. Theſe letters were a profe to all theym of highe ſpirite, to gyue declaration of them: and there were mo declarations than there were letters. But finally a woman diuinereſſe, or contrary, a ſothſayer, that was had in great reputation for her craftes, made the very declaration of the ſayde let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſayinge thus. R. reddite. A, aliena. S, ſi vultis. P, propria. I, in pace. P. poſſidere. Whiche all togyther is to ſaye, Render that perteyneth to other, yf that ye wylle in peace poſſeſſe your owne. Surely the Pyrates were ſoore affrayde of that dredeful commaundement: and the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was greatly praiſed for her high declaration. Than forthewith the ſame nyght the monſter wente into a highe mountayne called as than Ianitia, and there by the ſpace of thre days was in the ſyght of all the citie: and in that ſeaſon the lyons made great rorynge and howlynge, and the beares and monſter keſte out greate fearefull flames.
<pb facs="tcp:3639:54"/>
And all that ſeaſon there neyther appered byrd in the aire, nor beaſte in the feldes, and all the men offred great ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to the goddis, in ſuche wiſe that they brake the vey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their handes and fete, and offred their blode, to ſe if they myght appeaſe their goddis.

And all ſuche as were ones war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and in the nexte viſytation founde ſtylle vnamended, to be greuouſly punyſhed, and ſomtyme banyſhed. Theſe were the wordes of the lawe in the .v. table and third cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter: It is ordeyned by the holy ſenate, by conſent of bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, receyuyng the auncient colonies, that if men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men in one yere do treſpas, the men as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the ſaid yere ſhall diſſimule and forbeare: but if they that be yll as yll do not amende, they that be good, as good, ſhal chaſtiſe them.

This mortalitie dured the ſpace of two yeres, and it was vnyuerſall tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough out all Italy, to the great domage and feare of all the Romains: for they thought that the goddis wold haue diſtroyed them, for ſome diſpleaſure that they had done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt them. There dyed ſo many, as wel of great eſtate, as ryche and poore, greatte and ſmall, yong and olde, that the writers had leſſe trauayle to wryte the ſmal nombre of them that were lefte alyue, than to wryte the multytude of them that were deed. Lyke as whan a great buyldynge wyll falle, firſte there falleth ſome ſtone: In lyke wyſe the Romayns neuer had no great peſtilence in their tyme, but firſt they were thretned with ſome token, ſigne, or prodigie fro heuen. Two yere before that Hanyball entred into I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, in an euenyng, whan the wether was clere and faire, ſodaynely it rayned bloudde and mylke in Rome. And it was declared by a woman, that the blode betokened cruel warre, and the mylke a mortall peſtilence. Whan Scilla retourned from Champayne, to put Marius his ennemy out of Rome, his men of warre and knyghtes ſawe in a nyght a fountayne that ranne bloudde, and who ſoo euer was bathed therin, ſemed to be poyſoned with venyme. Of the whiche prodigie folowed, that of .ii.C. and .l.M. dwellers in Rome, what with theym that dyed with the ſwerde, and other conſumed by peſtilence, were conſumed with Scilla, and of them that ſledde with Marius, of the
<pb facs="tcp:3639:56"/>
ſayde great multitude of Romayns, there abode alyue no mo but .xl.M. perſons. Certaynly Rome neuer receyued ſo greate domage in .vi.C. yeres before, as they dydde by their owne propre people. All the tyrantes were neuer ſoo cruell ageinſt ſtrange landes, as the Romayns were than ageinſt their owne propre landis. And this ſeemeth to be true, bycauſe the ſame day y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Scilla paſſed through Rome with his bloody ſwerde, a capitayn of his ſayd to him: Sir Scylla, if we ſlee them that beare armour in the feldes, &amp; them that bere no armour in their houſes, with whom ſhal we lyue? I coniure the by the hye goddis, ſith we be borne of women, let vs not ſlee the women: and ſyth we be men, lette vs not ſlee the men. Thou thynkeſt that in ſleinge al the Romaynes, to make a common welth of beaſtis of the mountaynes. Thou entreſt with a crie to defende the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welthe, and to put out the tyrantes that diſtroye the common welthe, and we do remayne tyrantes our ſelues. To myn vnderſtandynge that capitayn merited as great glorie for the good wordes that he ſpake, as Scilla dydde merite chaſtiſement for the crueltie that he dyd. This we haue ſaid, bycauſe that ere ſuche damages dyd falle, there appered before certayne prodigyes and tokens. No leſſe token was ſhewed before the mortalitie that fel in the time of this good emperour, the whiche was a fearefull thyng. The caſe was ſo: On a day as themperour was at the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Virgins Veſtales, ſodaynly there entred in two hogges, and ranne aboute his fete, and there felle downe deed. And on an other day as he came frome the high Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitoll, for to haue gone oute at the gate Salaire, he ſawe two kytes ioynynge togyther with their talantes: and ſoo fel downe deed at the emperours fete.

two greyhoundes that he loued well, water to drinke with his owne handes, ſodenly they fel downe deed at his fete. Than he remembryng the ſwyne, the kytes, and the grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houndes deed ſo ſodeynly, he was greatly diſmayed, and aſſembled all his prieſtes magitiens, and diuines, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge what they ſayde to the prodigies. And they by thoſe thinges paſſed, iudged the dede preſent, and determyned, that within two yeres the goddis wold ſende great &amp; gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous punyſhementes to Rome. Than within ſhort while after there began a warre agaynſte the Parthes, whereby there fel the yere after great famyn and peſtylence amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the Romayns. This peſtilence came with ſores vnder the arme pittes, ſo that all the ſenate fledde away, and the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour alone abode ſtyll in the capitoll.

<pb facs="tcp:3639:57"/>
there was brought to hym out of a citie of Aſia called He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, by certayne Hebrewes, a boke writen in Hebrew: &amp; he toke ſuche pleaſure in that boke, that ofte tymes he wolde leaue his meate and goo to ſtudy: and for all that he was in his hote feuer, he wolde not leaue to reede, for all that his phiſitiens warned him, and his frendes prayde hym: and they that were about hym, counſaylled hym, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded hym, why he lefte to procure the helth of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone in ſo moche redynge. He aunſwered: By the goddis that we honour I coniure you, and for the frendſhyp that is betwene vs, I pray you lette me alone. Ye knowe well, that ſuche as are of a delycate bloode, haue not ſoo moche ſolicytude as the ruſticall people, that haue hard ſynewes and be of a more harder complexion.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng.

If they knewe, that knowe not, what thynge knowlege is, I ſweare to you, they ſhuld ſee what auayleth more the lyttell knowlege that a wyſe man hath, than the greatte ryches of the ryche man. For the myſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ryche perſone, the more that he encreaſeth in rycheſſe, the more he diminiſheth in frendes, and groweth in enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes to his domage. And he that is wyttie, the wiſer that he is, the better he is beloued of theym that be good, and feared of them that be yll for his profite. One of the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, wherin I holde my ſelfe moſte bounde to the goddis is this, that they haue cauſed me to compas the tyme as I haue done, the whiche is no lyttel gift for a man to lyue in this worlde. I ſay it is, bycauſe I haue had great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of the poore, that be verye poore, of wydowes, of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3639:57"/>
them that be ſorowfull and vnhappy, and of Orphelins. But without compariſon, I haue had greatteſt compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them, that lacke knowlege. For the goddis, making menne ignoraunt by naturalitie, myghte haue made them goddis by connynge and knowledge: and as the ſlouthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men are tamed and made leſſe than men, by their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, ſo certainly bleſſed he is, that is not contente to be a man, but if he procure to be more than a man, by his vertue. And curſed is that man, that knoweth not to be a man, but maketh hym ſelfe leſſe than a man by his vyce. By the iugement of al philoſophers, there is but one, that is the fyrſte cauſe, which is one god immortal, and if there be dyuers goddis in the heuens, it is bycauſe there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers vertues in the erthe. And in the worlde, that is paſte, whan the ſymple men were ſeruauntes and bonde menne, and the good men rulers and gouernours, they were then ſo eſtemed, bycauſe they were knowen and renowmed for theyr good werkes in theyr lyfe. Soo that they were hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and reputed as goddis after theyr deathe. This is the ryghte rewarde, that commeth of vertue. It is a thynge conſonaunt to reaſon, that they that be good amonge ſoo many yll in this lyfe, ſhulde be greattely honoured among the goddis after theyr deathe. Ye are not wel content with me, bycauſe I am alwaye redynge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I am worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with you, bycauſe I neuer ſe boke in your handes: ye thynke it great trauayle, to a ſycke man, to rede, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it a very peryllous thynge, for a hole manne, to reſte and be idell. Ye ſay, my redyng is cauſe of my feuer quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne in my fleſſhe: and I ſaye, that ydelnes engendreth great peſtilence. Syth I may profite by my bokes, let no man haue compaſſion of my trauayle. For I deſire rather to dye as a wiſe perſon, amonge wiſe men, than to lyue ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly amonge men. I demaunde one thynge of you:
<pb facs="tcp:3639:58"/>
A man, preſuming to be a man, and is not lerned, what dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference is betwene hym and other beaſtes? Certaynly, the beaſtes are more profitable to labour the erthe, than ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perſons be, to ſerue the common welthe. A pore oxe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his ſkynne to make ſhone, his fleſhe to be eaten, and his ſtrength to labour: and a poore ſymple ſhepe doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, his flece and wol to make clothe, &amp; his mylke to make cheſe: But what profiteth a foliſhe ideote man? Nothing, but offendeth the goddis, ſclaundereth innocentes, eateth the breade of other, and is chiefe heed of vacabundes. Of trouth, if it lay in my handes to do, I had rather giue lyfe to a ſimple oxe, than to a malycious ideot. For the beaſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, for the vtilitie of dyuers, without doing domage to any other: and the ſimple ideot man liueth, to the domage of all other, and without profite to any perſon. Therfore thinke well, why I am not pleaſed with theym that be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt, and loue them that be lerned. Harke ſyrs, what I ſhall ſhewe you: That man ſemeth good, that is meke and gentyll of condition, ſofte in wordes, and reſtefull in his perſone, and gracious in conuerſation: And contrary wiſe, that perſonne ſoore diſpleaſeth me, that is ſharpe of wordes, ſoore moued in his warkes, riottous in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion, and double of his promys, and harde harted. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I ſay, that if any thing wante in a wiſe man by nature, he ſupplyeth it by ſcience: and he that is ignorant and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſhe, if he want diſcretion, he ſupplyethe it with his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. And truſt ſurely, that a worthy vertuous man ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by becomethe wiſe, and he is to be truſted: and he that is of an other maner, beware of hym, for he goeth aboute to ſell his malice. He that wyll begile an other, the firſt thing that he doth is, he ſheweth hym ſelfe to be ſymple and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt.

Al defautes in a gouernour may be borne ſaue ignoraunce: for ignoraunce in a prince, is a ſtroke of peſtilence: and it ſleeth dyuers, and infecteth all perſons, and vnpeopleth the realme, chaceth awaye frendes, &amp; gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth harte to enmies of ſtrange natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that were in drede, &amp; finally domageth his perſon, and ſclau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth euery one. ¶Whan Camyll triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phed ouer the frenche men, the day of his triumphe he wrote theſe wordes in the capytoll: O Rome, thou haſt ben moder of all wiſe men, and ſtepdame to al fooles. ¶Theſe were worthy wordes of ſuch a lorde.
<pb facs="tcp:3639:59"/>
and but if my remembrance begyle me, certaynely Rome was more renoumed for wiſe perſons, that came thyther, than for the featis of warre, that were ſente from thenſe. Our auncient Romayns were more feared, for their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowlege, than for their conqueſtes. Al the erth feared them more, that tourned leaues of bokes in Rome, than them, that were armed with armour. For that cauſe Rome was neuer vanquiſhed: and though their armyes were deuyded and broken, yet they neuer lacked wyſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I can not ſay it without teares, Rome is fallen frome the moſt hight of her eſtate, not for faut of money and armes, for to fight withall, but for lacke of wyſe men, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for to gouerne. Our forefathers wanne lyke men, and we leſe lyke ſimple chyldren. All thynges that are deſired of men, they atteyn by trauayle, ſuſteyn with thought, and departe fro, with great annoyance. And the reaſon is this: There is nothynge ſo good, nor ſoo well beloued, but the courſe of tyme, cauſeth vs to leaue it, and to diſprayſe and abhorre it, or to be wery therof. This is the vayn vanite of the world, and loſt tyme loſt: for with their yonge deſires, they do refrayne their deſires. They wolde oftentimes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne a thynge, and after they ſtudy, howe to go therfro a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne. And yet to ſhewe further their lyghtnes, that that coſte moche, they gyue for a lytel price. That that they loue at one tyme, they hate at an other: and that that they with great ſtudy and labour haue atteyned, with greatte furye they forgo. And me thynketh this is the ordinaunce of the goddis, that he that loueth, ſhall haue an ende, and it that is beloued, ſhall take an ende: and the tyme that we are in, ſhall ende. Than it is reaſone, that the loue, wherwith we doo loue, ſhall ende in lykewiſe. Thus our appetite is ſo diſhoneſt, that in ſeinge we deſire it, and in deſyryng we procure it, and in procurynge, we attayne it, and in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayninge
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3639:59"/>
we abhorre it, and in the abhorryng, we leaue it: and than forthewith agayne, we procure an other thynge, and that newe procurynge, we abhorre agayne: In ſuche wyſe, that whan we begynne to loue a thyng, than we fall agayne to hate it, and in the fallynge to hate it, we begyn ageyn to loue an other thynge. So thus fynally, our lyfe dothe ende, er our couetyſe dothe leaue vs. It is not thus of wyſedome and knowlege, the which, if it ones entre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mans hart, it cauſeth hym to forget the trauayle, that he toke in the attaynynge thereof. For he taketh the tyme paſt as good, and enioyeth with rightful ioy, the tyme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and hateth ydelnes. Nor he is not contente with that he knoweth, but inforceth his appetite, to knowe more, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge that other leaueth: and leauyng, that other loueth. Finally, he that is perfittely wyſe, ſporteth in this worlde with trauayle, and in trauailyng in bokes, is his reſte. We haue not to ſay of all thinges, but of that we fele of them. For it is an other maner to ſpeake by ſimilitude of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and of our owne experience. And in this caſe I ſaye, that though we hope of no rewarde of the goddis, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour amonge men, nor memorie of the worlde to come: yet am I ryght gladde, to be al onely a philoſopher, to ſe howe gloriouſly the philoſophers haue paſſed their tyme. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde one thynge, whan myne vnderſtandynge is dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in that I haue to doo, and whan my memorie is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, in that I haue to determyne, and whan my bodye is compaſſed with dolours, and whan my harte is charged with thoughtes, and whan I am without knowlege, and whan I am ſet about with peryls, where can I be better accompanied, than with wiſe men, or els redynge amonge bokes? In bokes I fynde wyſedom, wherby I may lerne: alſo there I fynd worthynes, which I may folowe: I fynd there prudence, to counſell me, I fynde ſuche as be ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:60"/>
with whom I may wepe. I fynde them there that be merye, with whom I may laughe: I fynde there, ſymple folke, at whom I may ſport: I fynde that is nought, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I may leaue: And fynally, in bokes, I fynde, howe in proſperitie, I ought to behaue me: and howe in aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I ought to guyde me. O, howe happy is that manne, that hath wel red: And yet more happy is he, that though he knoweth moche, yet ſtayeth vppon counſayle. And yf this be true generally, than moche more is it neceſſary, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he kepe the true waye, whiche gouerneth all other. It is a rule infallible, that a prince being wyſe, can neuer be ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply good, but very good: and the prince that is ignorant, can not be ſimply yll, but very yll. A prince, that is not wel fortunate, his wyſedome may greately excuſe hym to his people, of his myſfortune gyuen to hym by fortune. Whan a prince is greatly beloued of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>montie, and is vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his perſone, than euery man ſaythe, if he haue not good fortune: Al though our prince wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good fortune, yet his worthy vertues fayle not: and though he be not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in his ententes, yet at the leaſte he ſheweth his wyſdom in the meane ſeaſon. And thoughe fortune denye hym at one howre, yet at an other tyme. ſhe agreeth, by his wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And contrary wyſe, an vnwyſe prince, and hated of his people, by yuell fortune, renneth into great peryll. For if ylle ſuccede to hym in weighty mattiers, than inconty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent it ſhalbe ſaid, it is by reaſon of the ignoraunce of hym ſelfe, or by yll counſell of ſuch as be about hym: &amp; if good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſuccede to hym, it ſhall not be attrybuted by reaſon of his good gouernaunce, but that fortune hath ſuffered it, and not by the circumſpecte wyſedome, that he hath hadde in the meane ſeaſone, but that it was of the pitie, that the goddis had of hym. Than ſithe it is thus, a vertuous and a worthy prince, in his ydell tymes, ought ſecretely to rede
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3639:60"/>
is bokes, and openly to common and counſell with wyſe men. And in caſe, yll fortune wyll not permyt hym, to take their counſelles, yet at the leaſt, he ſhal recouer credence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his ſubiectes. I wil ſay no more to you, but I eſtem the knowlege of a wiſe perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo moch, that if I knewe, that there were ſhops of ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, as there is of other marchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, I wold giue al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue, only to lerne, that a wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lerneth in one day.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His emperour, being ſicke, as it is aforeſaid, on a day, as there were with hym diuers phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and oratours, there was a purpoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued amonge them, howe greately Rome was chaunged, not all onely in edifices, but alſo in cuſtomes, and was full of flaterers, and vnpepled of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that durſte ſay the trouthe. Than the emperour ſayd: The fyrſte yere, that I was conſul, there came a poore vilayne from the riuer of Danubie, to aſke iuſtice of the ſenate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenſte a cenſure, who dydde dyuers extortions to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and he hadde a ſmall face, and great lyppes, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe eyes, his heare curled, bare heeded, his ſhoes of a porkepes ſkyn, his cote of gotis heare, his gyldell of bulle ruſhes, and a wyld eglantine in his hand. It was a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge thinge to ſe him ſo monſtruous: and meruayl, to here his purpoſe. Certainly, whan I ſaw him com into the ſenate, I wende it had bene ſome beaſte, in the figure of a manne.
<pb facs="tcp:3639:61"/>
And after I had harde hym, I iuged hym one of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, if there be goddes amonge men. And as the cuſtome in the ſenate was, that the complayntes of the poore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were hard, before the requeſtis of the ryche: this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layne had lycence to ſpeake, and ſo beganne his purpoſe, wherin he ſhewed him ſelfe as bolde in wordes, as extreme and baſe in his aray, and ſayd: O ye auncient fathers, and happy people, I Myles, dwellynge in a citie on the ryuer of Danubie, doo ſalute you Senatours, that are here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in the ſacred ſenate. The dedes do permytte, and the goddis ſuffre, that the capytayns of Rome, with theyr great pride haue reduſed vnder ſubiection, the vnhappy people of Germany. Great is the glory of you Romayns, for your battayles that ye haue wonne throughout all the worlde. But if writers ſay true, more greater ſhalbe your infamy, in time to come, for the cruelties that ye haue done to the innocentes. My predeceſſours had people nyghe to the flode of Danubie, and bycauſe they dyd ylle, the erthe wared drie, and they drewe to the frſeſhe water: than the water was noyful to them, and they returned to the main lande. What ſhal I ſay than? your couetiſe is ſo great, to haue ſteangers goodes, and your pryde ſoo renoumed, to commaunde all ſtrange landes, that the ſee maye not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite vs, in the depenes therof, nor the erthe, to aſſure vs in the caues therof. Therfore I hope in the iuſt goddes, that as ye, without reaſon, haue caſt vs out of our houſes and poſſeſſions: ſo other ſhal com, that by reaſon, ſhal caſt you out of Italy and Rome. And infallible rule it is, that he, that taketh wrongfully an other mans good, ſhall leſe the right of his owne. Regard ye Romains, though I be a vil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lain, yet I knowe, who is iuſt &amp; rightwiſe, in holding his owne: and who a tyrant, in poſſeſſynge others. There is a rule, that what ſo euer they, that be yl, haue gathered in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3639:61"/>
many dayes, the goddes taketh fro them in one day: and contrarie wiſe, all that euer the good haue loſte in manye days, the goddis reſtoreth to them agayne in one day. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue me in one thynge, and haue no doute therin, that of the vnlaufull wynning of the fathers, there foloweth the iuſte loſſe to theyr chyldren. And if the goddes toke from them, that be yll, euery thyng, that they haue wonne, as ſoone as it is wonne, it were but reaſone: but in lettynge them alone, therby they aſſemble by lyttel and lytel diuers thynges, and than, whan they thynke leaſt theron, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them all at ones. This is a iuſte iugement of the goddis, that ſithe they haue done yll to dyuerſe, that ſome ſhulde do yll to them. Certaynely it is not poſſible to any vertuous man, if he be vertuous, that he take any taſte in an other mans good. And I am ſore abaſhed, how a man, kepynge an other mans good, can lyue one houre. Syth he ſeeth, that he hath don iniure to the goddis, ſcla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred his neibours, pleſed his enmies, loſt his frendes, greued them that he hath robbed, and aboue all, hath put his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in peryll. This is a ſhamefull thynge amonge menne, and culpable before the goddis, the man that hath the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre of his harte, and the brydelle of his warkes at ſuche lybertie, that the lyttel, that he taketh and robbeth fro the poore, ſemeth moche to hym: but a great dele of his owne, ſemeth to hym but lyttel. O what an vnhappy man is he, whether he be Greke, or latin, that without conſideration, wyll change his good fame into ſhame, iuſtice into wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, ryght into tyranny, or trouth into leſynge, the certayne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vncertayne, hauynge annoyaunce of his owne goodes, and dye for other mens? He that hath his principall inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to gather goodes for his chyldren, and ſeke not for a good name, amonge them that be good: it is a iuſte cauſe, that he leſe all his goodes, and ſo without good name to
<pb facs="tcp:3639:62"/>
to be ſhamefull amonge them that be yl. Let all couetous and auaricious people knowe, that neuer amonge noble men was gotten good renoume, with ſpredynge abrode of yll gotten goodes. It can not endure many dayes, nor yet be hydden vnder couert many yeres: a man to be holden ryche amonge them that be ryche, and an honorable man amonge them that be honorable: for he ſhal be infamed, of that he hath gathered his ryches, with greate couetyſe, or kepeth it with extreme auarice. O if theſe couetous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were as couetous of theyr owne honour, as they be of other mens goodes: I ſwere to you, that the lyttel worme or mothe, that eateth the gounes or clothes of ſuche coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous people, ſhulde not eate the reſte of theyr lyfe, nor the canker of infamie, diſtroye theyr good name and faame at theyr deathes. Harke ye Romaynes, harke what I wyll ſay, I wolde to the goddis, that ye coude taſte it. I ſe, that al the world hateth pride, and yet is there none, that folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth mekenes and humilitie. Euery man condempnethe aduoutrie, and yet I ſee none, that liueth chaſte: Euerye man curſeth exceſſe, and I ſe none lyue temperately: eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man prayſeth pacience, and I ſe none that wyll ſuffre: euery man blameth ſlouth, and I ſe none, but they be ydel: euery one blameth auarice, and yet euery body robbeth. One thynge I ſay, and not without wepynge: I ſay eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manne, with his tongue onely, prayſeth vertue, and yet they them ſelfes, with al theyr lymmes are ſeruantes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vices. I ſaye not this onely for the Romaynes, whiche bene in Illirie: but I ſaye it, by the ſenatours that I ſe in the ſenate. All ye Romaynes, in your deuiſes aboute your armes beare theſe wordes: <hi>Romanorum eſt debellare ſuperbos, et parcere ſubiectis,</hi> That is, it pertainethe to Romaynes, to ſubdewe them that be proude, and to forgyue ſubiectes.

Of trouthe in Almayne hereby, they haue felt your tyranny, as wel as we haue herde of your renoume. And more ouer I ſay, that the names of the Romaynes, &amp; the crueltie of tyrantes, aryued togither in one day vppon our people. I wote not what ye wyll ſay, that the goddis care not for the hardines of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for I ſee, he that hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, dothe tiranny, to him that hath but lytell. And he that hath but lyttell, though it be to his infamy, wyll ſerue him that hath moche. So that diſordred men appoynt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſecrete malice, &amp; ſecrete malice gyueth place to open theft: and the open robbery no manne reſiſteth. And therfore it cometh, that the couetyſe of an yll man neceſſarily is had
<pb facs="tcp:3639:63"/>
to be complete, to the preiudyce of many good men. One thynge I wyl ſay, that eyther the goddis ought to thynke, howe theſe men ſhall haue an ende, or elles that the world muſt ende: or els the worlde, to be no worlde: Or fortune muſte holde ſure with you, if all that ye haue won in .viii.C. yeres, ye leſe not in .viii. dayes. And where as ye are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lordes ouer many, ye ſhall become ſlaues to all the worlde. Certaynely the goddis ſhall be vniuſte, withoute that thynge come, that muſte fall to the worlde hereafter. For that man that maketh hym ſelfe a tyraunt perforce, it is ryght, that he retourne to be a ſlaue by Iuſtice. And it is reaſon, that ſyth ye haue taken our myſerable la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, that ye kepe vs in Iuſtyce. I haue great meruayle of you Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that ye ſend ſo ſmple perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to be our iuges. For I ſwere to the goddis, they can not declare your lawes, nor vnderſtande ours. I wote not whether ye ſente them thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or no, but I ſhal ſhewe you, what they do there. They take openly, what ſo euer is delyuered to theym: and they doo their profytte with that they deſyre in ſecrete. They chaſtiſe the poore perſonne greuouſely, and they forbeare for money, them that be riche: they conſent to many wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to bryng them after to the lawes: &amp; without goodes it boteth not to demand Iuſtice: and fynally, vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> colour that they be iuges, vnder the ſenate of Rome, they ſay they may robbe all the londe. What is this ye Romayns? ſhall your pride neuer haue an ende in commandyng, nor your couetyſe in robbynge? Saye what ye wyll. If ye do it for our chyldren, charge theym with yrons, and make theym ſclaues: If ye do it for our goodes, goo thyther and take them: If our ſeruyce doth not contente you, ſtryke of our heedes. Why is not the knyfe ſoo cruell in our throtes, as your tyrannies be in our hartes? Doo ye knowe, what ye haue doone ye Romaynes? ye haue cauſed vs to ſweare,

greatteſt grefe is, whan my loſſe may be remedied, and he that may, wyll not, and he that wyll, can not remedy it. O ye cruell Romaynes, if the ſorowes all onely ſhulde be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to memory, that we ſuffre, my tonge ſhulde be wery, and all my membres faynte, and myne eyes ſhoulde wepe bluddy teares, &amp; my fleſhe wold conſume.

Certaynly my harte departeth, and my ſoule is troubled, &amp; myn entrayles breake. And I beleue yet, the goddis wyll haue compaſſiion. I wylle deſire you to take my wordes for ſclaunder. For ye Romaynes, if ye be Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns, ye may well ſee, that the trouble, that we haue, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by men, and amonge men, and with men, and by the handes of men. Than it is no meruayle, though men fele it as men. One thynge comforteth me, and dyuers tymes amonge other, that be vnfortunate, it cometh to ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the whiche is, I thinke the goddis be ſo ryghtwiſe, that their fierce and cruell chaſtiſementes come not but by our owne cruell ſhrewdnes: &amp; our ſecrete ſinnes awaketh vs ſo, that we haue open iuſtyce. But of one thynge I am ſore troubled, bicauſe the goddis can not be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. For a good perſon, for a lyttel faut, is greatly chaſtiſed, and he that is yl, for many fautes, is not puniſhed at al. So thus the goddis forbeare ſome, &amp; ſome haue no mercy.

and to the entent, that the Romaynes ſhulde apparell his triumph in Rome right glorious and rychly: There was one thynge done, that was neuer ſene before in Rome. For the day of his triumph, by al the people and conſent of the ſenate, the prince Comodus, ſonne to Marcꝰ Au. was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen after the dethe of his father to be emperour vniuerſall of thempire.

            <p>¶Nowe to returne where as we lefte. This emperour beynge at Salon, ſtudied ſore to entre into Rome in good order, and Rome ſtudied ſoore howe to receyue hym, as it appertained triumphantly for ſuche a warre. He was ſore deſyred of thempire: and euer he imagined, howe to do ple<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure to the people, and the people were redy to dye in his ſeruice. Dyuers tymes was moued a pleaſant purpoſe in the ſenate, which of theſe thynges was moſte to be loued: The emperour to loue the people of the empire, or the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of thempire themperour. On a daye hit was determy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to ſette iuges in that caſe: There were choſen the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of the Parthes and Roodes: and vppon that effecte they hadde writynge. It was layde for the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the good dedes that he had done in his abſence, and the tokens of loue, that they hadde alwayes ſhewed in his preſence. And on an other day the emperour moued an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion before the ſenate, ſaying, that it was a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glorie, to haue ſuch ſubiectes, than the glorie of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, to haue ſuche an emperour.

nay: Affirming that it is a greatter glorie that they had of hym, than he coude haue of them. And in this maner the emperour gaue the glorie to the people, and the people to the emperour. Thus in ſporte and play they toke iudges agayn. It was a merueylous thyng to ſe the ioy that they al had to proue their intentes. And the good emperour for a memorye gaue the laude to the people, bycauſe of theyr great obedience and ſeruice, and extreme loue that he had founde in them: And the happy people recounted the gret clemencie and mercy that was in the emperour, and his vertue and worthynes in gouernynge, his honeſtie of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge, and his force and valiantnes in conqueringe. It was a great thing to ſe the honour that the people gaue to themperour, and the good renoume that themperour gaue to the people. The writinges were gyuen to the ſtraunge ambaſſadours, to thentent that the people myght lerne to obey theyr princes: and princes to loue theyr people. To the ende that by ſuch examples, as it was reaſon, the good people ſhuld enforce them ſelfes, and the yl to withdrawe. Thus this emperour adreſſed his entre with his capitay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and captiues, and Rome apparayled theym with all their ſenatours and people to receyue hym. It was a huge thynge to ſe what people was at Rome to go forth to mete hym, and what people were with the emperour to entre.

This mayden was named Lucie or Lucyll: She was higher than the prince Commodus her brother: ſhe was of a goodly geſture and wel proporcioned of her body, and wel be loued of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And ſhe reſembled her not all onelye in her beautie, but alſo in her lyuynge. And thoughe the requeſt was py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and they that made it familier, and he to whome it was made was the father, and the demaunder was the mother, and ſhe for whom it was made, was the dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the emperour graunted it, but not without great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Neuertheles Fauſtine was full gladde, and as ſone as ſhe had obteyned lycence, ſhe broughte her dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the palays. And ſo whan the day of the great feaſte and triumph was comme, the damoyſell Lucylle beynge out of gouernance, and ſeinge her ſelfe at large, truſtinge thanne vppon her owne innocencye, toke noo hede of any ſtrange malyce, laughed with them that laughed, talked with them that talked, and behelde them that behelde her, and without care ſhe thought that none thought yl of her, bycauſe ſhe thought yll of none: yet in thoſe dayes a may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to laugh among men was reputed as moche as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to haue done aduoutrie with the prieſtes of Grece, ſo great was the honeſtie of Romayn women eſtemed. And lightnes of maydens was a great infamie: for they were wors puniſhed for one open lyghtnes, than for two ſecrete fautes. Amonge all other ſeuen thynges the women dyd
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3639:66"/>
obſerue ſurely, that is to wytte, not to ſpeke moche at fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, not to eate moche at bankettes, to drynke no wyne in theyr helthe, nor to ſpeake alone with men, nor to lyfte vp their eies in the temples, nor to ſtande longe lokynge out at wyndowes, nor to go out of their houſes without their huſbandes. The woman taken with any of theſe dyſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thynges, was always after reputed infamed. Many thynges were ſuffred of perſons in ſmall reputation, that were not ſuffred in perſons of honour. For the noble wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men coude not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerue the reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their eſtate, but by reaſon of keping their perſon in great feare &amp; good order. Al thinges done vnkyndly is ſyn, &amp; may be amended: but the diſhoneſt woman is alway ſhamed. The noble ladies, if they wyl be taken as ladies, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they excede other in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the leſſe lyce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ought they to haue to go wandring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.

And this is ſayd, for bycauſe that duryng the ſaid feaſtis, the damoyſel Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cille, as a yonge mayden, and Fauſtyne, her louynge mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not beinge olde, ſommetyme a foote, and ſometyme rydynge on horſebacke, ſommetyme openly, and ſomme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme meruaylous ſecretely, ſommetymes with company, and ſommetymes without companye, ſommetyme on the day, and nowe and than by nyghte, they wolde walke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode in the ſtretes of Rome to ſe the feldes of Vulcan, in gardeynes Saturnynes, and drynke at the conduites of Neros water, and ſommetyme paſſe the tyme by the faire ryuer of Thiber, and in all ſuche other pleaſaunt ſportes as apperteyned to their age. And thoughe the fore ryped primetyme prouoked them therto, yet the grauitie of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ladies ſhoulde not ſuffre it. I wylle ſaye one thynge, to thentent noble women ſhuld take aduertiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therby,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:67"/>
and that is this: I knowe not whiche was the greatteſte diſſolution, eyther the walkynge abrode of Fauſtyne and Lucylle through the ſtretes and other places, or elles the boldnes of yll ſpeakers, ſpeakyng ageynſt their perſons and good names. The withdrawyng and kepinge of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men clooſe is a brydell to the tongues of all men: and the woman that dothe otherwiſe, otherwiſe putteth her good name in daunger. Of trouthe it were better for a woman neuer to be borne, than to be defamed. Amonge the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns the lygnage of the Cornelies were had in great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation. For of them all, neuer none was founde a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, nor a woman defamed. The hyſtories ſhewe, that ones a lady of that lygnage beynge onelye defamed, was hanged on the galowes by the handes of her owne kyns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke. Surely it was well doone of the Romaynes, to the entent that the wyckednes of one woman ſhuld not ſuffer yll fame to renne vppon the hole lygnage: where is there noblenes without ſhame? The thynges that to wche ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ought not to be hyd but amended by Juſtice, and to put theym to deathe, that loſe their good fame. It is not ſufficient for a perſon to be good: but it is neceſſarye that he put fro hym all occaſions that are reputed to be yll. All the loſſes that a man may haue of any temporall goodis, can not countrepeyſe the leeſt loſſe of good fame. A man that layeth his good name for a farthynge at a but of this worlde, at a hundred ſhottes ſcantly ſhall he ſhoote one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryght. And contrary wiſe the man that feareth no ſhame, nor wyll not haue his perſonne in reputation, there is noo hope of goodnes in hym. Than this emperour, as a ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter, ſayling in moſte faire and calme wether, foreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtethe, and is in greatte thoughte and feare of tempeſtes and ſtormes to comme, in the feaſtis of his greatte glory, was in doubte of theſe two ladies, leſte ſodenly any mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3639:67"/>
ſhuld folowe. And certaynly he had great cauſe. For hit is an infallyble rule of enuious fortune, that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent felicitie is gyuen with a prycke of a ſodayne falle of myſchaunce. In thinges naturall, we ſe ſomtyme the ſee caulme, and yet forthewith foloweth a peryllous ſtorme, and conſequently the great heate of the daye is ſygne of thunder at nyght. I ſay fortune comynge with ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent delyte or pleaſure, is a token that by flatterynge vs, ſhe hath made redy her ſnares to catche vs. Whan the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is ſure, he dreſſeth his water gaate, and the labourer whan it reyneth not, couereth his howſe, thynkynge that an other tyme the wethers or raynes wyll falle theron and trouble hym: In lyke wyſe a wyſe and a vertuous man ought to thynke, as longe as he lyueth in this worlde, he holdeth his felicitie but at aduenture: and his aduerſitie for his naturall patrimony. Amonge all them that coulde reioyce in proſperitie, and helpe theym ſelfe in aduerſitie, this emperour Marcus Aurelius was one: whiche for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny flatterynges that Fortune coulde ſhewe hym, he neuer truſted in them: nor for myſhappe that he had in this life, he neuer diſpayred.</p>

As god helpe me, and as euer I haue part with my predeceſſours, and as euer I haue good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the thoughtes that I haue had for theſe feſtes, haue bene farre greatter than the feares that I haue had in all the iourneyes and battayles afore. And the reaſon therof is very euydent to theym that haue clere vnderſtanding: For always in cruel battailes I was euer in hope to haue glorie, &amp; feared not the ouerthrow of fortune. What coude I loſe in battayle? Nothynge but the lyfe, that is the leeſt thyng that men haue, and alwayes in theſe triumphes I feare to loſe renowme, whiche is the greateſt gyfte that the goddis haue gyuen me. O howe happy is that man, that loſeth his lyfe, and leaueth behynde hym perpetuall memorie? Lette euery man vnderſtande this that wylle, and ſaye what they lyſte: that amonge noble and valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt barons, he dyeth not, that leeſeth his lyfe, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth good renowme after hym: and moche leſſe tyme ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth he that hath an yll name, thoughe he lyued many ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.

The ſenate was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune vppon me, that I ſhulde take this triumphe, as ye knowe well: and I can not tell whiche was greatteſt, theyr deſyre or my reſiſtence. You knowe not the trouthe why I ſay thus. I dyd it not bycauſe of ambicion, and for couetouſnes of glorie, but it was bicauſe I fere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> humain malice. At the day of the triumph there was not ſo greate ioy ſhewed by the ſymple perſons, but the hyd enuy was

greatter among the greatteſt perſons. This glory paſſeth in one day, but enuy abydeth a hole yere. The plentifulle realme of Egipt, ſo happy in the blodſhed of their enmies, as in the waters of Nyle, hadde a lawe immouable. They neuer denyed theyr mercy to the captiues ouercome: nor they gaue no triumph to theyr capitaynes ouercomers. ¶The Caldees mocke at the Romayne triumphes, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng how there is not gyuen ſo great chaſtiſement to the capitayne of Egipte ouercome, as the empire Romayne gyue to the ouercomer, whan tryumphe is gyuen to hym. And ſurely the reaſon is good, for the thoughtefull capy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, whanne he hathe chaſed his ennemyes, that Rome hath in ſtraunge londes, with his owne propre ſpeare, in payement for his trauayle they gyue him ennemyes in his owne propre lande.

The greatteſt gyfte that the goddis haue gyuen to the matrones of Rome is, bycauſe they are women, they kepe them ſelfe cloſe and ſecret: and bycauſe they be Romayns, they are ſhamefaſte. The day, whan the women want the feare of the goddis ſecretelye, and ſhame of menne openly, beleue me, eyther they ſhall faile the worlde, or the worlde them. The common welth requireth ſo greatte neceſſitie, that the women that dwell therin, ſhulde be as honeſt, as the capitaynes be valiant. For the capitaynes going to warre, defende them, and the women that abyde at home, conſerue them. As a. iiii. yeres paſſed ye ſawe the great peſtilence, and I demanded then to haue a compt of the people, and I founde, that of a. C.xl.M. women well lyuynge .lxxx.M. dyed: And of .x.M. yll womenne, in maner they ſcaped all. I can not telle for whiche I ſhulde wepe, eyther for the lacke, that we haue of the good and vertuous women in our common welthe, or elles for the greuous hurte and domage, that theſe yll and wycked women do to the youthe of Rome.

to them that dwelle in Scycille, as one ylle woman doth in the circuit of Rome. A fierſe beaſt and a perillous, ennemie to the comon welth, is an yl woman: for ſhe is of power to do moche harme, and is not apte to folowe any goodneſſe. O how many realmes and kynges rede we of, to be loſte by the yll gouernance of women, and to reſyſte agaynſte them hath ben nede of wyſedom, peryls, money, force, and worthynes of many men. The vices in a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is as a grene rede, that boweth euery way: but the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and diſhoneſtie is as a drye kix, that breaketh: in ſuche wiſe that the more yll they vtter, the more vnlykely is the redres therof ageyn. Behold Fauſtin, there is no creature that more deſireth honour, and wors kepeth it, than a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And that this is true, ſe by Iuſtice, by orations, by writynge, and other trauayles, manne getteth renowme: but (without it be by flatterynge and fayre ſpeakyng) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this houre, by antyke writing, we can rede of fewe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or none, that eyther by writinge, redynge, workinge with nedell, ſpynnyng, or by weauyng, haue gotten them any great renoume. But as I ſaye of one, I ſaye of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Certaynly of dyuers we rede, by kepynge them cloſe in their houſes, well occupied in their beſyneſſes, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in theyr wordes, faythfull to their huſbandes, well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their perſonnes, peaſible with their neyghbours, and finally beinge honeſte amonge theyr owne famylye, and ſhamefaſte amonge ſtraungers, ſuche haue attayned great renowme in theyr lyfe, and lefte eternal memorie of them after theyr death. I wol tel you an antike hiſtore, as profitable to reſtreyne our vices, as it dyd than augment vertues, and it is this: The realme of Lacedemoniens (as Plato ſheweth) was at a ſeaſon more diſſolute by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftines of women, than infamed by the crueltie of men: ſo that of al maner nations they were called Barbariens.

What tyme Grece as a mother, called philiſophie of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, Lygurge, a wiſe philoſopher in knowlege, and a right iuſte kynge to gouerne, partely with his doctrine righte profitable, and partely with his pure lyfe, made la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes in the ſayde realme, wherby he extirped all vices, and planted all vertues. I can not telle, whiche of theſe two were moſte happy, The kynge, hauynge ſo obedient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or els the realme, to haue ſo rightfull a kynge. Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge all other lawes, for women he made one greatly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: He commanded, that the father that dyed, ſhuld gyue nothing to his doughter.

And where as nowe, ſome be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried, bycauſe they are poore, ſo then they abode vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, bycauſe they were ſhamefulle and vicious. O tyme, worthy to be deſyred, whan maydens hoped nothynge to be maried with theyr fathers goodes, but by the vertuous werkes of theyr owne perſons. This was the tyme, called the golden worlde: whan neyther the doughter feared to be diſherited by the father in his lyfe, nor the father to dye ſorye for leauynge her without remedye at his deathe. O Rome, curſed be he that firſt brought golde into thy hous: and curſed be he, that firſte beganne to hurde vp treaſure. Who hath made Rome to be ſo ryche of treaſure, and ſoo pore of vertues?

O curſed worlde, where the doughter of a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, ſhall haue no mariage. But it was not wonte to be ſoo. For in the aunciente tyme, whan they treated of maryages, fyrſte they ſpake of the perſones, and after of the goodis: not as they doo at this houre, in this vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py tyme: for nowe they ſpeke firſte of goodes: and laſte of all, of the perſone. In the ſayde golden worlde, fryſte they ſpake of the vertues, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the perſon was endowed with, and whan they were maryed, in ſportynge, they wolde ſpeake of the goodes. Whan Camillo triumphed vpon the Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les or frenchemen, he had then but one ſonne, and he was ſuche one, that his perſon merited great lawdes. And for the renome of his father, dyuers kynges deſyred to haue him to theyr ſonne: and dyuers ſenatours deſyred to haue hym to theyr ſonne in lawe.

And he deſerued eternall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for that he ſaid. I ſay to you Fauſtine al theſe wordes, bycauſe I ſe you lede your doughter to the Theatres and playes, and do brynge her into the Capitoll. You put her to the kepynge of the ſwerde players, you ſuffre her to ſe the toumblers, and yet you doo not remembre, that ſhe is yonge, and you not aged: ye go into the ſtretes withoute lycence, and play by the ryuers. I fynd no vilany therin, nor thynke that your doughter is yl: but I ſay it, bycauſe you giue occaſion, that ſhe ſhoulde not be good. Beware Fauſtine, neuer truſte in the caſe of the fleſhe of yong peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Nor haue no confidence in olde folkes. For there is no better way, than to flee the occaſion of al thynges. For this entent the virgins veſtales are cloſed vp betwene the walles, to eſchewe the occaſions of open places, not to be more lyght and foolyſhe, but to be more ſadde and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, fleing occaſions. The yonge ſhal not ſay, I am yong and vertuous, nor the olde ſhall not ſay, I am olde &amp; bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. For of neceſſite, the drye flaxe wyl brenne in the fyre: and the grene flagge ſmoke in the flamme. I ſaye, that a man beinge a diamonde enchaced amonge men, yet of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie he ought to be quicke and mery amonge women. And as waxe melteth in the heate, we can not denye, that thoughe the wodde be taken fro the fyre, and the ymbres quenched, yet neuer the les the ſtones oftentime remayne hote and brennyng. In lyke wiſe the fleſſhe, thoughe it be chaſtiſed with hote &amp; drie maladies, or conſumed by many yeres with trauayle, yet concupiſcence abideth ſtyll in the bones.

Oftentymes ſome holſome fleſhe for meate corrupteth in an vnholſome potte: and good wyne ſomtyme ſauoureth of the foiſte.

The Romayne matrones, if they wil nouriſhe their doughters wel, ought to kepe theſe rules. Whan they ſe, that they wolde goo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode, than breke theyr legges: and if they wold be gaſing, than put out their eies, and if they wyl harke, ſtoppe theyr eares: if they wyl giue or take, cut of their handes: if they dare ſpeke, ſowe vp theyr mouthes: and if they wil entend any lyghtnes, bury them quicke. wordes ought to be gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to an yll doughter: and in ſtede of preſentes and gyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis at her weddyng, gyue her wormes: and for her hous, a graue.

O howe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my yll hath there ben, not bycauſe they wolde be ſo, but by cauſe they folowed ſuche occaſions, the which they ought to haue eſchewed? It is for me to entre into this battayle, but yet it is not in me to attayne the vyctorie. It is for me to entre into the ſee, yet it lyeth not in my handes to eſcape the perylle. It is in the handes of a woman to entree into the occaſion, and after that ſhe is therin, hit is not in her handes to delyuer her from faute.</p>

The mattier was ſoo horrible to here, that I myght not endure to ſe the curſed men. And I commanded by my decrees, that none ſhulde be ſo bolde to ſpeake in ſuche a caſe any more. And if this caſe were fearefull to men, than certaynely the Romayne matrones oughte to lyue chaſtely. Than if the fyre of the father doo chaufe the doughter, enflameth kynſfolke, and bourne theym ſelfe: ye maye be ſicre, if he fynde after ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther couſyn or fayre ſiſter, the flames of his concupiſcence wyll not leaue to take holde on her for any parentage. If this riotous fleſhe wyll obey reaſon, than it maye be, that your doughter may ſpeake liberally with her couſins: but ſith that paſſion repugneth ſo moche at reaſon, I councel you truſt not to moche in her bretherne. you ſee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:

His hart was ſo agreable to hym, that neyther the hyghe buſineſſes of them: nor for all the affaires of his houſe, he wolde not leaue one of thempire vnſped. I ſaye this, bycauſe this emperour Marcus had foure doughters, whoſe names were Lucylle, Porſena, Matrina, and Domitia. All reſembled their mother in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent beautie, but they reſembled not theyr father in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie and vertuouſnes. And thoughe they were in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance vnder their mayſtreſſes out of his preſence, yet he had them always in memorie: and the elder they were, the more ſtudy and thought he toke for them: and whan they cam to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plete age, he ſtudied to fynd prouiſion for them. It was a laudable cuſtome, that the doughters of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Senate, ſhulde not marye withoute lycence, nor the emperours doughter without the aduyſemente of the ſenate. Than it was ſo, that one of the ſayd princeſſes his doughters, beynge of aege, and of wyll to be maryed, her father ſeinge her importunitie, to accomplyſhe her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, bycauſe he was ſycke, he ſente for Fauſtyne, that ſhe ſhulde goo and commune in the ſenate. The whiche with all her power ſhe withſtode, bycauſe that ſecretely ſhe had treated for an other mariage for her doughter. And open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe excuſed her ſelfe, ſayinge, that her doughter was to yonge and tender of aege: and as the goddis had gyuen age ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the father, ſo had not the doughter of yeres Whan the emperour vnderſtode this, he called Fauſtyne to his bedde ſyde, where as he lay, and ſayd: Dyuers thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are diſſimuled in particuler perſons, the leaſt of them is not to be ſuffred in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſhuld enſigne all other. The prince is neuer well obeyed, but if he haue good credence
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3639:77"/>
among his people. I ſay this Fauſtin, bicauſe you do one thinge in ſecrete, and ſay an other openly. Here in fayleth the credence of ſo high a lady, and putteth inconuenience in the auctoritie of ſo great an empire. If ye ſuppoſe my good deſires be ſiniſter in your hart for the welth of your owne chyldren: howe ſhulde we hope than in any of your good workes for the children of ſtraungers? It ſemeth to you better, to gyue your doughter to them that dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hir of the mother, and refuſe them that the father doth chuſe. Certainly bicauſe ye be a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you deſerue pardon: but in that you are a mother, you augment your faut. Do you not knowe, that mariages are guyded ſomme by fortune, and ſome by vertues and wyſedome? Suche as demande the doughters of the fathers, beleue me, their eyes benne moore vppon their owne propre vtilitie, than vppon the welth of an other. I knowe welle, you brynge forthe the chyldern, but the goddis wyll mary them, ſithe they haue endewed them with ſo meruaylous beautie. Doo you not knowe, that the beautie of women ſetteth ſtraungers on deſire, and putteth neyghbours in ſuſpection, to great me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it gyueth force, to meane men enuye, to the parentes infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and peryll to the perſon ſelfe? With great peyne it is kepte that is deſired of many. Of trouthe I ſay the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of women is nothynge but a ſygne for ydell folke: and an erly wakynge for them that be lyghte: where as of the ſtrange deſyres lieth the renome of them ſelf. And I deny not, but that a light perſon ſercheth ſoner a woman with a faire face than one of honeſt lyuyng. But I ſay, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that is maried only for her beautie, may hope in her age to haue a ſorye lyfe. It is an infallible reule, that ſhe that was maried for her faireneſſe, is hated for her fowle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. O what trauayle he offreth him ſelfe vnto, that mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a faire woman? It behoueth hym to ſuffre her pryde,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:78"/>
for beautie and foly alway go togyther. Alſo he muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre her expences. For folye in the heed, and beautie in the face bene two wormes, that frete the lyfe, and waſteth the goodes. Alſo he muſt ſuffre her ryottes, for a faire woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyll that none but ſhe haue her commandementes in the houſe: Alſo he muſt ſuffre her nyce mynionneſſe, for euery fayre woman wyll paſſe her lyfe in pleaſure: Alſo he muſt ſuffre her preſumption, for euery fayre woman wyll haue preeminence before al other. Finally he that marieth with a faire woman, aparaileth him to a right great adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture: and I ſhall tell you wherfore. Surely Carthage was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo enuyronned with Scipions, as the howſe of a faire woman is with lyght perſones. O vnhappye huſbande, whan his ſpirite is at reſt, and the body ſleping, than theſe lyght perſons wyl come about his houſe, drieng his body with ielouſy, caſting their eies to the wyndowes, ſcalynge the walles with ladders, or clyminge ouer, ſingyng ſwete ſonges, playeng on diuers inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, watchinge at the gates, treting with baudes, vncoueryng the houſe, &amp; wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge at euery corner therof. Al theſe thinges, in caſe they ſhote at the pricke of the womans beautie, they leue not to ſhote at the butte of the ſorowfull huſbandes good name. And whether this be true or not, report me to my ſelf, that maried me with your beautie: and let them wite of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume that go ſo about the citie. I ſay moche, but truely I fele more. No man complayneth of the goddis for gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge hym a fowle wyfe, amonge his deſtenies. Whyte ſyluer is not wroughte but in blacke pytche: and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tree is not conſerued but by the harde rynde. I ſay the man that marieth a fowle wyfe, ledeth a ſure life, lette eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man chuſe as he lyſteth: and I ſay a man that marieth a faire wife, caſteth his good fame at haſarde, and putteth his lyfe in peryl. Al the infamy of our predeceſſours ſtode
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3639:78"/>
in none exercyſinge of dedes of armes: and nowe all the paſtime of the Romayne youth is to ſerue ladies. Whan a woman is famed to be faire, than euery man gothe thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and taketh great peyne to ſerue her, and the women woll be ſene. I ſay Fauſtine, you neuer ſawe a yonge da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyſel Romayne, greatly renoumed in beautie, but either in dede or in ſuſpection there folowed ſom yl name of her. In that lyttell that I haue redde, I haue harde of dyuers fayre women, bothe of grece, Italy, Parthe, and Rome: and they be not put in remembraunce, bycauſe they were fayre, but for the greatte perylles and heuy chaunces that by their beauties felle in the worlde. For in maner by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their excellente beauties they were vyſited in theyr owne landes: and by their infamye ſhamed throughe all the worlde.</p>
            <p>¶Whan the realme of Carthage was flouryſſhynge in ryches and happy in armes, they ruled the common welth by wyſe philoſophers, and ſuſteyned it by diſcrete armies on the ſee. Arminius the philoſopher was as greatly eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amonge them, as Homer amonge the grekes, or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero amonge the Romaynes: he lyued in this worlde ſyxe ſcore yeres and .ii. Of the whiche happy age .lxxx. yeres he ruled quietly as a baron moſt peaſible of mynd: and was as ſtraunge to women, as familiar with his bokes. Than the ſenate ſeinge he was ſo broken with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welthe, and withdrawen from all naturalle recreations, they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hym with greate inſtaunce to be maried, bycauſe that memory myght be had of ſo perfytte a wyſe man in tyme to come: and the more importunate they were the more he reſiſted, and ſayd, I wyll not be maried: for if ſhe be foule, I ſhall abhorre her: if ſhe be ryche, I muſte ſuffre her: if ſhe be poore, I muſt maynteyn her: if ſhe be faire, I muſt take hede to her: if ſhe be a ſhrewe, I canne not ſuffre her:
<pb facs="tcp:3639:79"/>
and the leaſte peſtylence of all theſe, is ſuffycient to flee a M. men. With ſuche wordes this wyſe man excuſed hym ſelfe: and he in his aege, by reaſon of his great ſtudy, loſt his ſight. And the ſolytarines of his ſwete lyberties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned hym to take company of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſhe had by him a doughter, of whom deſcended the noble Amilcares of Carthage, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petitours of the Scipions of Rome, the which ſhewed no leſſe worthyneſſe in defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Carthage, than ours were fortunate to augment Rome. ¶Tell me Fauſtine, may not ſuche ſuſpection fall vppon your doughters, though their vertue ſuccour in the peryl, and their honeſtie aſſure their perſons? I will diſcouer a ſecrete thynge to you. There is nothynge, that can be ſoo quyckely commytted, yf a womanne be enuyronned with chaſt kepers and feminine ſhamefaſtnes. Stedfaſtly they deſire, and with great leyſure they procure theſe thynges, that lyghtly may be atteyned. There is nothynge ſoo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, but that the welth of an other is matter for the own euyll. And Fauſtine ye knowe, that the mooſt honeſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menne, by our malyce are moſt deſyred. Certaynely theyr ſhamefaſtnes and kepynge cloſe, ben arowes in defence of our honeſtie. We rede not that bludde, ryches, nor beautie of the vnhappy matrone Lucrece was the cauſe, that ſhe was deſired: But the clerenes of her viſage, the grauitie of her perſon, the pureneſſe of her lyfe, the kepyng of hyr ſelfe cloſe in her howſe, the exercytie of her tyme, the credence amonge her neyghbours, and the great renoume that ſhe hadde amonge ſtraungers, waked the foolyſhe Tarquine to commytte with her aduoultrye by force. What thynke you? Wherof came this? I ſhall ſhewe you. We that be yll, are ſo yll, that as yll we vſe the goodnes of them that be good. This is no faute to the ladyes of Rome, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the immortall goddis. Their cleane honeſtie accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3639:79"/>
our cruell malice. Fauſtine, you ſay, your doughter is to yonge to be maried. Do you not knowe, that the good father ought to endoctrine his ſonnes fro their yong age? and to prouide for his doughters whiles they be yonge. Of a trouthe, yf the fathers be fathers, and the mothers mothers, as ſone as the goddis haue giuen them a dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, forthwith they ought to fyxe in their hartes a newe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce: and not forgette it, tyll they haue prouided their doughter an huſband. The fathers ought not to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ryches, nor the moder for hygh lygnage, the better to marie them: So what with the one &amp; the other, the tyme paſſeth, and the doughters waxe aeged: and than after this maner they be to olde to be maryed: and to abyde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, they be maydens: and to ſerue, they be women, they lyue in peyne, the fathers in thought, the parentes in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, leaſt they ſhuld be loſt. O what great ladies haue I knowen, doughters of great ſenatours, and not for faut of ryches, nor of vertues in their perſons, but all only for ſlacke of tyme, and driuinge of one houre to an other, ſoo that at laſte ſodeyn dethe came to the fathers, and no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence made for the doughters: So that in maner ſome were couered vnder the erthe after their deathe, and ſome buried with forgetfulnes. Eyther I lye, or I haue redde in the lawe of the Rodiens, where as it is written, We co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde the father in marienge .x. ſonnes, to trauayle but one day: but to mary oone vertuous doughter, lette hym trauayle .x. yeres, ye &amp; ſuffre the water come to the mouth, ſweate droppes of bloode, trauayle the ſtomake, diſherite all his ſonnes, loſe his goodis, and aduenture his perſon. Theſe wordes in this law were pitieful for the doughters, &amp; not leſſe greuous to the ſonnes. For .x. ſonnes by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe of men ar bound to diſcouer, &amp; to go ouer al the world: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doughter, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good law ought not to go out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hous.
<pb facs="tcp:3639:80"/>
I ſay more ouer, that as thinges vnſtable threte fallyng, ſo lyke wiſe it chaunſeth to yonge damſelles, whiche thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all theyr tyme loſte and ſuperfluous vnto the daye of their mariage. Homere ſayth, it was the cuſtome of ladies of Grece, to count the yeres of theyr lyfe, not fro the tyme of their byrth, but from the tyme of theyr maryage. As if one demaunded of a Grecian her age, ſhe wolde aunſwere xx. yeres, if it were .xx. yeres ſith ſhe was maried: though it were .lx. yeres ſith ſhe was borne: Affirminge after they hadde a houſe to gouerne and to commande, that daye ſhe begynneth to lyue. The Melon after it is rype, and aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſtyll in the gardeyn, can nat ſcape, but eyther rotteth, or elles muſt be gathered. I ſay the mayden that taryethe longe, tyll ſhe be maried, can not eſcape, eyther to be taken or infamed. I will ſaye no more. As ſoone as the grapes be ripe, it behouethe that they be gathered: ſo it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the woman that is come to perfite age, be maried and kept. And the father, that doth this, caſteth perill out of his houſe, and bringeth him ſelfe out of thoughte, and contenteth well his doughter.</p>

Than this good emperour charged with yeres, and with noo leſſe thoughtes, and wynter increaſynge with manye great ſnowes, and freſynge of the erthe, there felle on him an other malady called Lytarge, the whiche put the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariens in great hardines, and his hoſte in greatte heuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, his perſon in peryll, and his frendes in great ſuſpect of his helthe. There was done to hym all the experience that coude be founde by medicins, as vnto great pryncis and lordes is accuſtomed. And all dyd him no profite: by reaſon the maladye was greuous, and themperour char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with yeres, and the ayre of the lande was contrarye to hym, and the tyme helped hym nothynge: and alſo he was not well intended. And as men of worſhyppe do ſette more by theyr honour than by theyr lyues, and had rather dye with honour, thanne lyue diſhonoured, to aſſure their honour, they aduenture euery houre their lyues, and had leauer haue one houre of honour, than a.

Certainly conſidering the crueltie that was there done, the profyte that came therby, was very ſmalle to the Romayns, ſo that there went but a fewe away with the fourage, &amp; of the Hungariens fewer was lefte to make reſiſtence. The emperour ſeinge the yll order, and that by the reaſon of his bloudde lettynge and feuer, he was not preſent at that acte, he toke ſuche a heuynes at his harte, wherby he fell into ſuche a traunce, that it was thought he had ben deade: and ſo he lay .iii. nyghtes and two dayes, that he coude ſe no lyght of the ſkye, nor ſpeake to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone.

to laughe at the deth of them, that die olde, ſith they dye to laugh: and to wepe at the birth of chyldren, ſithe they are borne to wepe, and that the lyfe abydeth the ſentence of yl, proueth well, that the deathe is good. Wyll you, that I ſaye one veritie to you? I haue alwayes ſeene, that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell in the wyſeſt man, ſoneſt faileth him. Such as wolde gouerne al thinges, by theyr opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, of neceſſitie in ſome, or in the moſte parte, they do erre and fayle. O Marc my dere lorde, weene you, that haue cauſed to burye ſoo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that ſome ſhulde not burye you in lykewiſe? As you haue ſeene the ende of theyr dayes, ſo other ſhal ſe the ende of your yeres. Therfore me ſemeth, it were better for you to dye, and to go your waye, to atteyne ſoo moche welthe, than to ſcape, and to lyue in ſo moche myſery. If you fele deathe, I haue no meruayle, ſythe you be a man. But I meruayle, that you do not diſſimule it, ſythe you are dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete. They that haue clere vnderſtandynge, feele many thynges at theyr harte, that putteth them to peyne, which they ſhewe not outwarde, for the preſumption of honour. If al the poyſon, that is in a heuy hart, were ſpred abrode in the weake fleſſhe by ſmalle greynes, noo walles ſhulde ſuffyſe vs to rubbe, nor our nayles to ſcratche. For certain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the deathe is but a playe, wherin the player, if he be apt, aduentureth but lyttell, to wynne moche: and they that play, may ſe wel, that this is a wyly play, and not a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. And that alſo, as well they leſe, that haue but a ſmal card, not fearyng dethe, as they, that with a greatte carde, loue long lyfe? What thinge is deth, but a trappe dore, wherin the tent is cloſed, in the whiche is ſolde, all the miſeries of our life? This the goddis do change vs, fro an olde filthy houſe, into a newe. And what other thing is the ſepulchre, but a caſtelle, wherin we be cloſed agaynſt the aſſautes of the lyfe? Of trouth you ought more to couete, to take that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3639:83"/>
you find at your deth, than the hurte of that you ſhal leue in your lyfe. I demand of you, what is it, that dothe you moſt peyne, in leſyng of the lyfe? If you peyn your ſelf, for Helie Fabrice your wyfe, bicauſe you leaue her yonge, we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not yourſelf, for ſhe is wel thought on in Rome, for any peryll of your lyfe. And as ſoone as ſhe knoweth it, I am in certayne, ſhe wyll not wepe moche, though you go your way. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ought not to wepe, for leuyng of her. Theſe yonge damoyſels, maried to old men, haue euer their eyes fixed in the deth of their huſbandes. And holly faſten their hartes on him, that they think, to mary with ageyn. They wepe with their eies, &amp; laughe in their hartis. And thinke not contrary, though ſhe be an empreſſe, and can not fynde an other emperour, to be her huſbande, yet ſhe wyll fynde ſome other man. For if they be ſoo determyned, they wyll change their robes of ſylke, for a gowne of clothe. I dare well ſaye, they more deſyre a yonge ſheparde, than an olde emperour. If you care for your chyldren, whom ye muſte leaue behind you: I can not tell, why you ſhuld do ſo. For if your deth be diſpleaſant to them, moch more diſpleaſeth them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you liue ſo longe. It is great pein to the child, not to deſire the deth of his father: For if he be poore, it is for feare, how they ſhuld be mainteined: if he be ryche, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhalbe his heire. They ſynge, &amp; you wepe, you fere the deth &amp; wepe, bicauſe you leaue your life.

Alſo I ſay, that after infancy, cometh childhode, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cometh youth, &amp; age after that, and ſo at laſte cometh deth, and after dethe, fearefull hope, of a ſure lyfe. Sir, beleue me, in one thyng, The beginning, the meane, and the ende euery man hath.

            <p>¶Auguſte the Emperour ſayde, that after that men had lyued .l. yeres, they ought to dye, orels cauſe them ſelfe to be ſlayne, bycauſe that vnto that tyme, is the felycitie of man. He that lyueth beyonde that tyme, paſſeth his tyme in heuyneſſe, in greuous aches, deathe of his chylderne, and loſſe of his goodes, in importunities of his chyldren in lawe, buryenge of his frendes, ſuſteynynge proceſſe, payinge of dettis, and other infinyte trauayles: So that it were better, with his eies clooſed to abyde theym in his graue, thanne with his eyes open, to abyde theym in his lyfe dayes. Certaynly it is a fortune of all fortunes, and he is ryght priuie with the goddis, that at .l. yere, leaueth his lyfe. For al the time that he liueth after, is in decaying, and neuer vpryght, but rollyng, relynge, and redy to fall. O Marc my dere lorde, do you not know, that by the ſame way, that lyfe gothe, cometh dethe? It is .lxii. yere, that ye haue ſoughte the one from the other. And whan ye wente
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3639:84"/>
fro Rome, where as you lefte your howſe, ye wente to Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirike, where you lefte a great peſtylence: and nowe you are retourned into Hungarie. Do you not knowe, that as ſoone as you were borne, to gouerne the erthe, incontinent dethe iſſued out of his ſepulchre, to fynde your lyfe? And if you haue honored ambaſſadours of the ſtraunge kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, moche more ye oughte to honour deathe, that cometh fro the goddis. What lordſhyp can be loſte in this lyfe, but you ſhal fynde greatter in the death? Are you not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, whan Vulcan my ſonne in lawe poiſoned me, bicauſe he deſyred my goodes more than my lyfe, howe you, my lorde, for loue that you had to me, gaue me comforte and counſell, for the deth of my ſorowfull youth: and you ſayd to me, the goddis were cruell, in kyllynge of them that be yonge, and pitiefull, whan they burie theym that be olde. And alſo you ſayde to me, Comforte thy ſelfe Panutius: For if thou dydſt lyue to dye, now than thou dyeſt to liue. Therfore right high and myghty prince, I ſaye to you, as you ſayde to me: and I counſayle you, as you counſayled me, and that you gaue me, I gyue you ageyne.

And therof cometh, that as ſone as he is deed, ſtreight way begynneth to ſtynke. And ſo I ſay, that the ende of his lyfe, is the begynnynge of his infamy. All they that were there, as well the olde ſeruantes as the newe, belongynge to themperour, capitaynes of warre, &amp; other, were not a lyttell abaſhed, of the ſayenge of Panu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, and they all allowed his ſayinge, and ſayde, he was worthy to haue the gouernaunce of thempire.

So all the reſt of that night, the Secretarie occupied hym ſelfe, to put in writing the ſame ſayinge: and the next day he delyuered it to themperour, whiche toke it, and looked theron all the day: and kept it ſtyll in his handes, and ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times redde theron, And the next nyght themperour ſente for the Secretarie, &amp; in open audience he ſaid, as foloweth.</p>

Alſo diuers thingis ar in me,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:86"/>
that I knowe not of my ſelfe, noo more than that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me. O Panutius, thou accuſeſt me that I feare death. To feare it greatly, I deny it: but I confeſſe to feare it as a man. Of trouth, if I ſhuld ſay, that I feare not death, I muſte deny, that I am not made of fleſhe. We ſe, that the Olyphant feareth the lyon, and the beare feareth the oly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and the wolfe fearethe the beare, and the ſhepe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethe the wolfe, and the ratte the catte, and the catte the dogge, and the dogge the man, and all onely theyr feare is, that they drede to be ſlayne. Than if theſe brute beſtes refuſe deth, not fearynge the fyghtynge with furious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, nor the enioyenge with the goddes: Howe moche rather oughte we to feare the deathe? For we are in feare to be torne in pieces with the furies in theyr peynes, or to be receyued in pleaſure with the goddes. Therfore I ſay, that the naturall feare of deathe, I haue ouer come with the bridell and lyberties of reaſon. Thinkeſte thou Panu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, that I ſee not my graſſe waſted, and my grapes ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that my houſe breaketh, and that I haue nothyng left, but the ſtocke of the grapes, the ſkynne of the fleſſhe, and but one onely blaſte of all my lyfe? Thou ſeeſte well, that by the tokens, the exerciſe is ſene. And nettes be caſte in the riuers, and in the parkes bulles bene chaſed. I ſaye that the rumour of deathe holdeth in ſauetie the lyfe that is in me, at this houre redy armed agaynſt dethe.

Thus I hope abydyng deth. And this I ſay, bycauſe thou ſhalt knowe, that I knowe it, and that thou ſhalt fele, that I fele. And to the entent thou lyue vnbegiled, I wyll tell the a ſecrete.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3639:86"/>
ſecrete. The nouelties, that thou haſt ſene in me, as in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrynge of meate, bereuynge of ſlepe, liuynge alone, we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynes of company, drownynge in ſyghes, and paſtyme in wepynge: Thou mayſte wel thinke, what turment ought to be in the ſee of my harte, whan ſuche tremblynges and motions of erthe and reynes are ſet in the erthe of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Shal I ſhew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, wherfore my body is in this thought, and my herte in ſuche trouble? The cauſe, why I ſuffre dethe ſoo greuouſely, is that I leaue my ſonne Commode in this lyfe, in a perillous age for him, and ſuſpecious for thempire. By the floures the fruites are knowen, and the viues in burgenyng: by the colt the hors is knowen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhall be meke or ſtubborne for labour or cariage: &amp; in the youthe the yonge man is knowen: and by the lytell that I ſe in my lyfe by my ſonne Commode, I feare me, it wyll be leſſe after my deth. Thou knoweſt not, why I ſay thus. And I ſay it not without cauſe: for my ſonne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode is very yonge, and yet yonger in wytte. He is of an yll inclination, but he be forced: he gouerneth hym ſelfe by his owne wytte and vnderſtandyng, as thoughe he were a man of experince: he knoweth but lyttelle, and carethe for nothynge. Of the tyme paſſed he hath no knowledge: all onely he occupieth hym ſelfe with the tyme preſent. Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, by that I ſe with myn eies, and thynke in my harte, I feare me the perſonne of my ſonne ſhall be in peryll, and the memorie of his fathers howſe peryſſhe. Fauſtyne his mother hath foſtred hym to delycately: and by a harde ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grounde he hath a great way to go. He entreth as now alone into the pathe of youth without any guyde. I feare me he ſhall goo out of the ryght waye, and wander in the buſhes and thornes of vices. O Panutius, harken what I ſay, I ſay it not without teares, thou ſeeſte that my ſon remayneth ryche, yonge, and at libertie. Ryches youthe,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:87"/>
ſolitarines, and lybertie ben .iiii. peſtilences, that enpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone the prince, and waſte the common welthe: hit ſleethe them that be a lyue, &amp; infameth them that be deed. Beleue me one thynge, dyuers graces are requiſite to ſuſteyn di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers vertues. With the faireſt women the brothell houſes are peopled, the mooſte vilaynes are made ruffyens: the moſte hardye are robbers in woddes: the quickeſte of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandynge ofte proue fooles: and the mooſte ſubtylle becom theues. I ſay, that ſuch as are clothed with dyuers graces of nature, lacke the furres of accquired vertues. We may ſay, they hold in their handes a knyfe, wherwith they ſtryke and hurte theym ſelfes: fire on their ſhulders, wherwith they bren: and a corde about their necke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they hange: daggers at theyr ſtomacke, wherwith they are ſtayne: thornes at theyr feete, wherwith they are pricked: a ſtony way afore theyr eies, where they ſtomble, and ſtomblynge fall, and fallynge they leſe theyr life, and wynne dethe. The great trees of whom we haue fruite in wynter, and ſhadowe in ſommer, firſt be planted the rotes faſte in the entrayles of the erthe, or euer theyr wauerynge boughes are aduentured in the wynd. Marke Panutius, marke well. The man that from his youth hath, ſet before hym the feare of the goddis, and the ſhame of men, is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in vertues: &amp; he that accompanieth with them that be vertuous, mainteyneth trouth to euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and liueth without preiudice of any man. Malicious fortune maye ſomtyme cleue the barke of the welthe of ſuche a tree, wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the floure in his youthe, breake the leaues of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, gather the fruite of his trauaylle, breake downe a bough of his offices, &amp; bowe downe the height of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell: yet for all the ſtrokes that the wynde can ſtrike, it can not be plucked vp by the rote. Certaynely the ſonne that the father hath endued with graces, and the ſonne appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3639:87"/>
hym in vices, ought not to be borne in this worlde: &amp; if he be borne, to be buried quicke. For the fathers ſweate by day, and watche by nyght, to leue honour to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whiche the fathers bye of the goddis with ſighes, &amp; the mothers delyuered of them with peyne, and bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp with trauayle: and the chylde proueth ſo, that he giueth greuous age to the father in his lyfe, &amp; great infamy after his death. I conſider wel, that the prince Comode, beinge yonge and I olde, ageynſt his wyl, forbare vyces, &amp; I fere me, that after my deth, he wyll hate vertues. I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his age, haue inherited the empire, whiche were ſo hardy in their lyues, that they deſerued to be called tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes after their dethes. Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Denys, renoumed tyrant of Sycill, whiche hired theym that coude inuent vices, as our Rome rewardeth them that conquere realmes. What greatter tyranny can be in a tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, than to make moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be vicious? Alſo I forget not the foure kinges, that ſucceded after great Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, as Ptholome, Anthiocꝰ, Siluiꝰ, &amp; Antigonus, whiche the grekes called great tirantis: all that Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der had gotten with renomed triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phes, they loſt by their viciouſnes. And in this maner the world y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der had deuided amonge them .iiii. came to the handes of mo than foure .C. for Antigonꝰ ſet ſo litle by that had coſt his lord Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ſo moch, &amp; was ſo lighte in his age, &amp; ſo bolde in his realme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in mockery in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtede of a crowne of gold, he ware a garlande of Iuie: &amp; in ſtede of a ſcepter, he bare a thyſtle in his right hande: and after that maner, he wold ſyt amonge his men, &amp; whan he ſpake to ſtrangers. I lay ſhame to the yong man ſo to do, but I meruayle, that the ſadde and wyſe men of grece ſuffred it. ¶I remembre alſo Caligula the .iiii. emperour of Rome, a yonge man, in whoſe tyme it was harde to knowe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was the greatter, eyther the diſobedience of the people
<pb facs="tcp:3639:88"/>
to their lorde, or the hatrede, that the lorde bare to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And this yonge prince went ſo farre oute of the waye in his youthe, and was ſo farre wyde frome reaſon in his tyrannies, that euery man ſtudyed, howe to take his lyfe from hym: &amp; he ſtudied to ſlee euery man. He wrote theſe wordes in a table of golde: Wolde to god, that all Rome hadde but one heed, to the entente that with one ſtroke, I myght ſtryke it of.</p>
            <p>¶I alſo remembre Tyberie, ſonne adoptiue of good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſte, called Auguſt, bycauſe he augmented Rome. But this good olde prince dyd not ſo moche augmente it in his lyfe, but this yonge ſucceſſour diſtroyed it moche more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deathe. The hate that the Romayne people had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte Tyberie in his lyfe, was ryght welle ſhewed after his dethe. For the ſame day that he dyed, or whan he was ſlayne, the people made dyuers proceſſions, and the ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours offred great gyftes in the temples, and the prieſtes offred gret ſacrifices to their goddis, to thentent that they ſhulde not receyue the ſoule of the ſayd Tiberie into their glorie: but to ſende it to the furies of Hell.</p>

            <p>¶I remembre cruelle Nero, whiche inheryted, and dyed yonge: &amp; in hym ended the memorie of the noble Ceſars: and by hym was renewed the memorye of Antygones the tyrantes. Whom thynkeſt thou this tyrant wolde ſuffre to lyue, whiche ſlewe his owne mother? Tell me I pray the, what harte is that of a chylde, to ſlee his owne mother, to open the breſtes that he ſucked, to ſhedde the blood of her that nouryſhed hym in her armes, and to beholde the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayles, wherin he was fourmed? What thynkeſte thou, that he wolde not haue done, ſithe he commytted ſuche an yll dede? The day that Nero ſlew his mother, an oratour ſayd in the ſenate, that Agrippyne his mother had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued deth, for chyldyng ſuche a chylde in Rome. Theſe thre dayes, that thou haſte ſene me ſo altered in my mynde, all theſe thinges came before me: and I haue drawen theym into the depenes of my harte, and diſputed theym. This ſonne of myn holdeth me in the gulfe of the ſee, betwene the wawes of feare, and the ankers of diſpayre, hopynge, that he ſhoulde be good, bycauſe I haue nouryſſhed hym well, and fearynge, that he ſhulde be ylle, bycauſe his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fauſtine hath brought hym vppe wantonly, and the yonge man is inclined to yll. And as ye ſe a thynge made by artyfice peryſhe, and a naturall thynge laſte: I am in great feare, that after my dethe, he wyl tourne that waye, that his mother hath chylded hym, and not as I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed hym. O how happy were I, if I had neuer a childe, to leue behinde me to be emperour? Then a childe myght be choſen amonge children of good fathers, and I ſhulde not haue ben troubled with him, that the goddis haue gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me. Panutius, I demaunde one thynge of the, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou calleſt moſte fortunate, Vaſpaſian the naturalle father of Domitian, or els Nerua, the father adoptiue of
<pb facs="tcp:3639:89"/>
Traian? Vaſpaſian was good, and Nerua verye good, &amp; Domitian was of all other mooſte cruelle, and Trayane the myrrour of all clemency. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regard, how Vaſpaſian in the fortune to haue chyldren was vnhappy, and Nerua in the mysfortune to haue chyldren was happy. I knowe not why theſe fathers deſyre to haue children, ſith they ben the occaſion of ſo moche trauayle. O Panutius, I wyll ſay one thynge to the, as a frende to a frende (as thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt wel we be in this worlde) I haue lyued .lxii. yeres, in whiche tyme I haue redde many thinges, and haue hard, ſene, deſired, atteyned, poſſeſſed, ſuffred, and reſted moch, and nowe at this tyme I muſt dye: and of al thing I ſhal beare nothing away, bycauſe bothe it and I are nothyng. Great beſines the hart hath to ſerche for theſe goodes, and great trauayle to come to them: but without compariſon the greatteſt dolour is at the houre of the dethe, to depart and leaue them. What greatter diſeaſe can be to the body, than ſodaynely to be ſurpriſed with ennemies? What pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryll of the ſee, or loſſe of frendes, can be egall, to ſe a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man drawe to his deathe, to leaue the ſweate of his face, the auctoritie of the empire, the honour of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone, the company of his frendes, the remedye of his det<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, the rewardynge of his ſeruantes? and to leaue it to a chylde, that hath not merited it, nor hath not the power to wyll to merite it.</p>
            <p>¶In the .ix. table of the lawes were theſe wordis written: We co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde and ordeyne, that euery father, who in the opinion of all men is good, ſhall diſheryte his ſonne, that is yll in euery mans opinion. Alſo euery chylde, what ſoo euer he be, that diſobeyeth his father, or robbeth any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or hurt any wydowe, ſo that ſhe blede, flee fro the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, or do any treaſon to a ſtranger, who ſo euer is found in any of theſe fyue caſes, lette hym be banyſſhed for euer

the habitation of Rome, and caſte out fro the herytage of his father.</p>
            <p>¶In good ſoth this lawe was good, and in the tyme of Quintus Cincinate, hit was ordeyned, and nowe by vs, whiche be vnhappy, it is cleane lefte and forgotten. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius without doubte I am wery to ſpeake, and alſo I haue ſuche an impediment in my ſtomacke, that I wante brethe: or elles I coulde ſhewe the all by order, if myne vnderſtandynge fayled me not, howe manye Parthiens, Mediens, Aſſiriens, Caldiens, Indiens, Egypeyens, Hebrewes, Grekes, and Romaynes, haue lefte theyr chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren poore, and myght haue left them ryche: and all was bycauſe they were vicious: and other chyldren that were very poore, were lefte ryche, bycauſe they were good and vertuous. I ſwere to the by the immortall goddes, that whan I came fro the warres betwene the Parthiens and Rome, and that the triumphe and glorye was gyuen to me, and my ſonne confirmed to be emperour: I wolde the Senate hadde lefte me my ſonne Commodus poore, with all his vyces, and that I hadde made the Senate heire and lorde to the empire: and to haue chaſtiſed hym to the exaumple of all the worlde. I wyll that thou knowe, I ſhall carie fyue thynges with me out of this worlde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled, the whiche is great ſorowe to my harte. The fyrſte is, that I haue not determyned and iudged the ple<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and proceſſe of the noble wydowe Druſia, with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſeinge that ſhe is very poore, and hath noo bodye to doo her Iuſtyce: The ſeconde is, bycauſe I doo not dye in Rome, to the intente that I myghte cauſe to be cryed and proclaymed euery where in Rome, er I dyed, to wyte if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complayned on me: the thyrde is, that where as I dyd ſlee .xiiii. tyrantes that vndyd the countreye, that I hadde not as well banyſhed all the Pirates that kepte the ſees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the fourth is, that I lefte my dere ſonne Veriſſimus deed: and the .v. that I haue lefte alyue, as heire to the empire, my ſonne Commodus. O Panutius, the greatteſt happe, that the goddis can giue to a man (not couetous but ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous) is to gyue him renoume in his lyfe, &amp; a good heire, to conſerue him after his deathe. Fynally to conclude, I pray to the goddes, if I ſhall haue any parte with theym, that if by my ſonnes offences, Rome be ſclandred, and my renoume miniſhed, and my hous loſt by his life, that they wyll take a way his lyfe yet or I dye.</p>

Ye ſorow for my ſorowe, ye are tourmented with myn anguyſhe, &amp; peyned for my peyne: it is no meruaylle. For the clere vnderſtandynge of the pure blod of true and faythfull frendes, is to double theyr trauayles, and to wepe for other: if one brute beaſt morne for an other, moch more ought one humayne creature to ſo towe for an other.

The goddis wyll take my ſowle away, Comodus my ſonne the empire, the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre my bodye, and ye my ſpeciall frendes my harte. And ſothly it is reaſon, that ſith ye were in the lyfe my hartes, that it be yours after my deth. And in that I wyll ſpeake more particular this nyght ſhall be our reaſonnyng. Now my harty frendes ye ſe, that I am come to the ende of my laſte iourney, and to the begynnynge of my firſte iourney with the goddis. It is reaſon, that ſyth I haue loued you in time paſt, that ye beleue me nowe. For the time is come that ye can demande nothyng of me: nor I haue nothing to offre you: nor myn eares as now can not here flatteries, nor my harte ſuffre importunities: if ye neuer knewe me, knowe me now. I haue ben he that I am, and am he that hath ben, in tymes paſte lyke vnto you, ſome what: nowe ye ſe I am but lyttell, and within a lyttell whyle I ſhalbe nothynge.

And as the goddis be fauourable to you in this worlde, &amp; equalle and fauourable to me in an nother worlde, as my fleſhe neuer toke pleaſure to paſſe this lyfe, but my harte was ſodaynly taken with the feare of death: than take no peyne for me, for eyther I muſte ſee the ende of you, or you of me. I yelde great thankes to the goddis, that they take away this olde perſone to reſt with theym, and leaue you yonge for to ſerue in thempire. For there is no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſon for to ſpeake of dethe to the lyfe, nor to eſchewe the deathe at the houre therof. And yet I wylle not denye, but I do feare dethe, as a mortal man. Whan the lyfe paſſeth, there is no prudence in a prudente, nor vertue in a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor lordſhyp in a lorde, that can take away the feare of the ſpirite, nor peyne of the fleſſhe. Atte this tyme the ſowle and the fleſhe are ſo combyned and ſo conglutinate togyther, and the ſpirite with the bloude are ſoo annexed, that the ſeparation of the one from the other is the mooſte terrible, and the laſt terrible of all terriblenes.

And bycauſe than ſenſualitie peyneth for ſenſibilitie, and the fleſſhe for the fleſſhe, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon guyded with them that be mortall tellethe me, that it

peyneth not with the departynge. If I haue lyued as a bruetbeaſt, it is reaſon that I dye as a diſcrete man ought to do. I dyenge, this day ſhal dye all my ſickenes, hungre ſhal dye, colde ſhal dye, al my peynes ſhal die, my thought ſhall dye, my diſpleaſure ſhall dye, and euery thynge that gyueth peyne and ſorowe. This day the nyght ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and the ſonne ſhyne bryghte in the ſkye: This daye the ruſte ſhall be takem from myne eies, and I ſhall ſee the ſonne clerely: This daye the waye ſhall be made ſmothe for to goo righte: this is, the daye ſhall ende the iourney, wherin I ſhall not drede the ſtayes of Fortune. I thanke the goddes immortall, that haue ſuffered me to lyue ſo clerely, and ſoo longe a tyme. This daye I ſhall haue an ende of al vnhappy deſtenes of enuyous fortune, and not they of me. Of trouthe if the goddis haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded my fleſſhe to be hydden in the ſepulchre, and to be as mortalle: yet if they be iuſte and doo well, they wyll make my renoume to be immortall, bycauſe I haue lyued well. Than ſith I change this wery lyfe and company of menne, for the ſwetenes of the goddis, and the doubtes of fortune for this ſure lyfe, and greate and continuall feare for perpetuall peace, and this ylle and naughty corrupte lyfe for good renoume and glorye, I thynke veryly this ſhuld be none yll change.</p>
            <p>¶It is nowe thre ſcore and two yeres ſythe the erthe hath ſuſteyned and fedde the erthe of my bodye: It is nowe tyme that the erthe knowledge me for her ſonne, and I wyl alſo take her for my mother. Verely it is a pitiful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that wylle nowe take me in to her entrayles for euer, ſythe that I haue ſoo longe ſpace troden her vnder my feete. And yet thoughe that I were as I am, for to be as ſhe is, I am in certayne that ſhe wolde kepe me ſurer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge her wormes, than Rome amonge the Senatours.

And all though it be peynefulle to you, if it pleſe the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to haue it thus, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can excuſe nor ſcape it. I ſhuld be right well eaſed, if this webbe were broken, and my poſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeſſion taken in the Sepulcre. Than ſhulde I haue the fyrſt thyng propre of myn owne, and perpetuall without any feare of leſynge therof. All thynges mortal, that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talle folkes haue, and the enuye of them that be enuious maye be broken, except the deth and the ſepulcre, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are priuileged from enraged hongre of enuy.

And all though our debilite be weake, yet for all that our honour is ſo ſenſible, that at the houre of deathe, the more that the bones diſchargeth them of the fleſhe, the more is the hart charged with thoughtes. In manner that whan the ſinewes vntie them from the bones of the bodye, than newely they tye agayne a ſoore knotte to the herte. Nowe let vs leaue ſpeakyng of that that to wchethe particularly my ſelfe, and ſpeake we in generall of it that is conueny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente to a yonge Prynce, and to you that are his tutours and mayſters.</p>
            <p>¶Ye ſe here my ſonne Comodus only prince and heire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydynge for the heritage of thempire: neyther for beynge good, that he meriteth praiſe, nor for being yl reprefe. For he hathe taken his naturalitie of the goddes, and his nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture among you. Dyuers tymes whan he was a chylde, ye toke hym in your armes, to thentente that nowe he is a man, ye ſhulde ſette him in your hartes. Hytherto he hath taken you for his mayſters: and nowe at this tyme, he muſte repute you as his fathers. And whiles I lyued, ye

helde hym for your prince in nouryſſhynge hym, for your emperour in ſeruing him, and as your parent in helpyng hym, and as your ſonne in teachynge hym. Hytherto ye onely helde him charge, as father, mother, and mayſters: he is nowe as a newe ſhyppe put this daye into the ryghte ſee, fletyng to the botomles ſwolowe, where as the ſayles of proſperitie wyll make hym fall, and the rockes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happynes wyll drowne hym. Than amonge ſo many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate wyndes and vnſtable waters, there is greatte neceſſitie of good oores. Surely I am very ſory for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and haue great compaſſion of this yonge prince, and ſuche as wolde his welthe, ſhall more bewaylle his lyfe than my dethe. For ſcapynge fro the ſee I ſe my ſelfe at a good ſure porte, and vppon mayne lande, and leaue hym the ſweatte and trauayle. For as yet he knoweth not howe to aduenture to ſayle on the ſee: nor yet knoweth not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhal abyde the age of my long experience, nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhall be a reaſonable emperour or noo. But what ſhall ſorowfull Rome do, whan it hath nouryſhed a good prynce, and that fatall deſtenies maketh an ende of hym? or that by enuy of them that be yll he is ſlayne? or the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie of the goddes taketh hym away: or that the body by his owne propre handes be lyfte vp in ſuche wyſe, that in the experiment of princes, al the life tyme parteth in be way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge of the youthe of yonge princes, and the grauitie of theyr aunciente princes paſſed. O if theſe princis beleued at the beginnynge of theyr empire, other kynges that are fayled in the world, howe they be taught when it is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable for one man without charge to rule ſoo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almes, and he doinge nothynge but take theyr goodes, robbe him of his renoume, baniſhe theyr perſons fro him, and he to ende his lyfe, and his ſubiectes augmente theyr ſorowes: and ſith he is but one, he can doo no more than
<pb facs="tcp:3639:93"/>
one, though dyuers hope that he doth for all. Regarde in what myſaduenture a prince lyueth, whan the leaſt villain in Italy thinketh, that all only for hym and on hym alone the prince ſetteth his eies. And ſithe the worlde is ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable, and the people ſo vnruly, the day that a prynce is crowned and exalted with a ſceptre ryalle, the ſame daye he ſubmitteth his goodis to the couetous, &amp; all his eſtate to the ſemblaunce of other. Thus than in this the goddis ſhewe their power. For al the vnderſtandinges are tacked to one free wyll. The ſemynge of all they codempne, and alowe but one. They giue the domination to one, and the ſubiection to many. To one they gyue the chaſtiſemente of all, and not al to the chaſtiſement of one. For the taſt of many, they gyue meate but to one: the ſauour wherof is ſwete to ſome, and ſowre to other: to ſome remayneth the bone, and to ſome the fleſhe: at the laſt ſome be drowned &amp; other be hyndred, &amp; at the ende al haue an ende. I wold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of you that be moſte familiar, what is the crowne of thempire, or the ſceptre of golde, or the coler of perles or p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And this is the cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there be yl mariners, &amp; to hardy pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lottes, for they fle fro the ſee to the lande, &amp; fro the lande to the ſee. One thing I wil ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is ageinſt my ſelf: euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hateth warre, &amp; no man ſeketh for peace. Al ſorowe for one that is angred, and none is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to appeace: al wold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande, but none wil be commanded. This hath ben in the world paſſed, &amp; now at this preſent tyme men be ſo light, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they rather choſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand with peril, than to obey with reſt. Seing that my dayes are diminiſhed, &amp; my ſickenes augmented, ſuſpectinge tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I ſe nowe, whan I retur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned

fro the warre of Sycill, I determyned to make my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, the whiche ye may ſee here: Open and behold it, and therby ye ſhall ſe, howe I leaue you to be mayſters of my ſon, yet in loue and fidelitie ye be to gyther all as one. Great peryll the prince is in, and the common welth in an yll aduenture, where as be many intentions amonge the gouernours. Certainly the princis are gloryous, and the people well fortunate, and the ſenate happy, whan all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in one counſell, and that the counſaylers be auncient, and many of them, and all their inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions agree vpon one thinge. Whan this was in Rome, it was feared and dred of tyrantes, hauynge their conſultations approued with iii.C. barons. And though their reaſons were diuers, yet their wylles and intentis were al one for the comon welth. I deſire and coniure you by the goddis, that ye be al fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in conuerſation, and conformable in counſell. All the weake debilities in a prince may be ſuffred, except yl coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: and al defautes of counſellours are tollerable, except enuy and yre. Whan the freting worme called a mothe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth among them, it cauſeth peril in Iuſtice, diſhonour to the prince, ſclaunder in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons, and parcialitie in the ſuperiours. The counſaylour that hath his mynde ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with ire, and his harte occupied with enuy, and his wordes outragious to a good man, it is reſon that he loſe the fauour of the goddis, his priuitie with the prince, and the credence of the people. For he preſumeth to offende the goddis with yll intention, to ſerue the prince with yll cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and to offende the common welth with his ambition. O howe ignorant are theſe princis, that take hede of ſuche herbes &amp; venims that myghte poyſon theym in their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and care not for the poyſon that they of theyr priuye counſayle do gyue them? Doubtles there is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon, for the herbes and poyſons can be giuen but on one daye:
<pb facs="tcp:3639:94"/>
but the venym of yll counſeyle is gyuen euery howre. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nym is defended by the horne of an vnycorne, by tryacle, and otherwiſe by vomites: but the poyſon of yll counſell hath no remedy, and leſſe defenſiues.

One thynge I commaunde as to my ſeruantes, and I deſyre you as my frendes, that ye ſhewe not your ſelfe ſo priuie openly, as ye be in ſecrete: to thentente that ſome ſeme not as natural ſonnes, and other as hired ſeruantes. He that is vertuous, ought to haue great regarde to the profyte of his lorde ſecretely, and to be meke of conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with euery man openly, els his priuetie wyll not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge endure, and the hate of the prince with the people wyl in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace.

And ſith the ylnes of the time, and vnſtablenes of fortune neuer leauethe any thynge in one caſe, but all is as in maner of a dreame: the moſt ſure purchaſe is to flee fro peril, for then wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the princes haue paſſed their pleaſures entermedled in trauayles, they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che for many, and fynde not one.

The wyly labourer in one yere laboureth to gette cornes togyther, and in an other yere he ſoweth and gade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Be not to preſumptuous, for the preſumption of an auncient prince, fordoth the auctoritie of the yonge prince: yet for all this diſpaire nor rebuke hym not to moche: For the lacke of maners in the ſtate of a lorde engendreth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamefaſtnes in hym, and boldnes to the ſeruant. I haue lefte in my teſtament the prince Comodus for your ſonne, and you for his fathers. But I wyll and commande, that euery man knowlege him to be their lorde, and to be at his commaundemente. And ye my other ſeruantes and ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes to be in his obedience, and in all his highe beſyneſſes to be wel guyded as his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des and louers. Iuſtice ought to be ſene to, by wiſe oratours, accordynge to the opinion of you that be his gouernours. And alway the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be doone by the prince, whiche is lorde of all. One counſell I wyll gyue you (and if you finde it yll, blame me afore the goddis) wherby the empire of my ſonne ſhall be ſtable and permanent in Rome, and your priuetie ſure in his houſe, if your counſelles be moued by reaſon, and his wyll ruled by your counſels. I deſyre ſoore that ye be not couetous: and therfore I haue gyuen you dyuers gyftes and thankes in my lyfe, to take couetouſnes frome you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my dethe.

And as in meane ſhyppes men ſcape beſt in a meane ſee, ſooner than in great carrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes in the wawes of the rorynge and impituous ſees: in lykewiſe ſuche as be in meane eſtate among them that be but meanly enuious, lyue more ſurely, than ſuch as are ſet in high eſtate and priuitie beyng ryche, to be paſſioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge ennemies, that diſdainfully wold put them vnder. It is a notable rule amonge wyſe men, and an infallible experience amonge them that be good, and I thynke that by herynge therof the yll ſhall knowlege it: The glorie of one amonge great men maketh ſtryfe, ſuſpection in them that be egall, and enuy amonge them that be meane. One thinge, that they that gouerne well, ought to haue, is ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie. The leſſe ye be couetous, the more ye ſhalbe libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. For with the rage of couetouſnes the ryght of iuſtice is myniſhed. It is longe tyme ſyth I determined to gyue you the gouernynge of thempire, and the nouriſhynge of my ſonne. And to haue prouided to haue giuen you large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of my goodes, to put the couetynge of other mens goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des from you.

Than ſhal ye folowe the Iuſtice of other, where as ye ſhal ſe your owne propre welth.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus a great parte of the night paſſed, and the day began to breake, and the life of this good emperour began faſte to drawe to an ende: yet for all that he left not the remembrance of ſuch thynges as ſhulde be ordered after his death. There were that tyme in the warre with him diuers right excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men ſenatours of Rome: and in al thinges he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him ſelfe right wiſe, &amp; ſpecially he wold neuer haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vicious perſon in his houſe. He hadde euer in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany .l. gentilmen knyghtes, and in eche of them he might haue put truſt to gouerne Rome. Oftentymes this good emperour wolde ſay, that princis lyued more ſurely with the gadryng to them men of good lyuyng &amp; conuerſation, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with treſure of money ſtuffed in theyr cheſtes. Vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> prince, that eſtemeth hym ſelfe happy to haue his coffres ful of treſure, and his councell full of men of yl ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng. Theſe malicious and yll men make princes poore: and a perfyte man ſuffiſeth to make a holle realme ryche. Surely this emperour ſayde well. For we do ſe daily, that what the father hath gotten in fiftye yeres, the ſon leſethe in halfe a yere. Than chuſinge amonge many a fewe, and of fewe to take the beſt, this emperour appoynted out .vi. notable barons: Thre of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be maiſters of his ſon, &amp; .iii. to be gouernours of thempire. One was called Partinax, whiche after was emperour: an other was called Pompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iano, huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to his doughter, as ſure in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell as he was aged in yeres: The .iii. Gneo Patrocle of the ancient ſtock of the Pompeies, whiche was no leſſe clene in this liuing than his heares were white: The .iiii. was called Andriſco
<pb facs="tcp:3639:96"/>
which in goodlynes of his geſture, highnes of body, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of courage, and wyſedome in conſcience, none was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall to him in Rome: The .v. was named Bononius, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che at that tyme was conſule, and in the aunciente lawes very expert: The laſt was called Iuan Varius the good, and he was called the good, bycauſe that in .lx. yere neuer man ſawe hym do any yll workes, nor harde hym ſpeake any ydel worde, nor do any thynge but it was profytable to the common welthe. Though in caſe they were al egall in gouernynge: yet I ſay theſe laſte thre were princypall. For Iuan Varius particularly was left to be chiefe capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the armye, and to hym was delyueted al the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the teſtament was put into his handes: and with ſore weping the emperour recommended to him the prince his ſonne. Than whan the peine of his ſicknes encreaced, and that he loked for the houre of his deth, he comaunded to awake his ſonne Comodus, whiche without any care was faſte a ſlepe, and whan he was brought into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his father, it was greatte pitie to ſe the eien of the olde emperour ſoore diſcoloured with wepynge, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies of the ſonne allmooſte cloſed with ſlepynge: the ſonne was wakynge with ſmall thoughte, and the father coulde not ſlepe for great thoughte and peyne. And whan he was in his preſence, ſeing the lyttell care that the ſonne toke for the deth of his father, and conſideringe the great deſire of the father for the good lyfe of his ſonne, it moued to pitie the hartes of all the great lordes that were there, noo leſſe to leaue the company of the good old man, than the annoy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ance of the dealynge of the yonge prince.

The mooſte eaſyeſt thynge in the worlde is to giue councel to an other: and the moſte hardeſt and hieſte thinge is a man to take it for him ſelfe. There is none ſo ſimple a man but he may giue good councel, though there be no nede. And there is none ſo wyſe that wyl refuſe coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cell in tyme of neceſſitie.

There is not a worſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnt, than that a man holdeth of him ſelfe. If thou my ſonne be yl, Rome wyl complayne to the goddis, that they haue giuen the ſo yll inclinations: They wyll complayne of Fauſtine thy mother, that hath brought the vp ſo wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly: and they wylle complayne on thy ſelfe, that thou doſte not refrayne the from vices: and they ſhall not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne of thyne olde father, that hath gyuen the ſo many good counſelles. I am in certayne, thou haſt not ſo great dolour to ſee the ende of this nyghte, and the ende of my lyfe, as thou haſt pleaſure to ſe the day that thou ſhalte be emperour: and I haue no meruayle, for where as ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie reigneth, reaſon is put aſyde.

What ſhulde I ſay more? In the courte euery daye the lordes chaunge and after the lawes, awake ſtryfes, and reyſe noyſes, abate noblenes, exalte the vnworthy, banyſſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and honour theues, loue flatterers, and diſpraiſe theym the whiche be vertuous, they embrace delites, and treade vertue vnder their fete: they wepe for them that be ylle, and laughe to ſcorne theym that be good, and finally

In a monethe a manne might recken all the ſtones of the proude edifyces, but in a. M. yeres he myght not compriſe the malyces of his yll cuſtomes. I ſwere to the by the immortall goddis, that in thre yeres I repaired all that was decayed in Rome, and in thirty yere I coude not refourme one quarter therof to good lyuynge. Good ſonne beleue me, the great cities full of good inhabitauntes oughte to be prayſed, and not the great edifices. Our predeceſſours haue triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phed on ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as weake and feeble: and nowe they may triumphe on vs alſo, as menne that be more vanquyſſhed with vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces than any of the other.

Of a very trouthe it is a great ſhame to ſaye, and no leſſe infamy to doo, that the goodneſſe and trauayle of the auncientes ſhuld nowe be tourned and conuerted to folies and preſumption.

Theſe were notable wordes.</p>
            <p>¶Than my ſonne, determin the to take counſel, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in high thinges and matiers of difficultie, and other wiſe let them not be determyned. For whan the counſaylle is taken of dyuers, than if any faute be, it ſhal be deuided amonge them al. Thoughe the determination myghte be done by a fewe, yet take counſel of many. Amonge all thy welthes, here the common counſel. For one wyl ſhewe the al the inconuenience, an nother the peryl, an other the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, an other the profitte, an nother the remedye. And ſette as well thyn eyes vpon the inconueniences, that they laye, as vpon the remedy, that they offre. Whan thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynneſt any harde mattier, eſteme as wel the ſmal doma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that may befall afore, and ſtoppe them, as to remedy the gret miſfortunes, that come after. Of trouth the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and myghty ſhyppe ofte tymes for a ſmalle takynge hede of the pylotte, is ſounken and drowned in a lyttell water:
<pb facs="tcp:3639:100"/>
and an other ſhyppe, not ſo ſtrong, with wiſe diligence, is ſaued in the gulfe of the ſee. Be not annoyed to take cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in ſmal matters euery houre. For many thinges forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with require to be loked to, and in abydinge for councel, it endomageth. And that that thou canſt diſpatche by thyn owne auctoritie, without domage of the common welthe, put it not to any other perſon. For ſith thy ſeruice al onely dependeth of thyn, the rewarde dependeth of the alone. ¶In the yere .vi.C.xxx. of the foundation of Rome, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the cruell warres done ageinſt the kynge of Numedie, the day that Marius triumphed, without puttyng of any of the riches, that he brought, into the common treaſury, he deuyded it to his men of warre. And whan he was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accuſed, and aſked, why he toke not firſte the opinyon of the ſenate: He aunſwered and ſayde: Sythe they toke not the opinion of other, to do me ſeruice, it were no reſon, that I ſhulde take councell of other, to rewarde and reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence them.</p>
            <p>¶Son, yet I wil aduertiſe of other thinges. Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture ſome wyll gyue the counſell, er thou demaund it: In that caſe kepe this general rule: neuer abide the ſecond counſell of a man, if he haue giuen the counſell before in the preiudice of an other. For he offreth his wordes in thy ſeruice, to bringe the beſynes to his owne profyte. O my ſonne, there are many thinges to knowe a man. Xv, yere I haue ben ſenatour, conſule, cenſure, capitaine, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune: and .xviii. yeres I haue ben emperour of Rome, and diuers haue ſpoken to me, in preiudice of other, and many mo, for their own profite, and none haue ſpoken clerely to me, for the profite of other, nor for my ſeruice. Great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion oughte to be taken of princis: for euery man folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth them for theyr owne profite, &amp; none for loue and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.

I haue gouerned Rome: I neuer kepte man in my houſe, after that I knewe hym hatefull agaynſte the common welthe.</p>
            <p>¶In the yere of the foundation of Rome .vi.C.lix. of the Olympiade .C.lxviii. Lucullus Patricien, greate frende to Sylla, goynge to the warre of Methridates, It chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that in Tygoano, a citie of Caldiens, he found a plate of coper or braſſe, vpon the kinges gatis, wherin were cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne lytters, whiche they ſayde were grauen there by the commandement of Alexander the great: The letters were in Caldee, conteynyng theſe ſentences, That prince is not wyſe, that wyll holde his lyfe in peryll, and wil not aſſure his lyfe and ſtate with the loue of all men: That prince is not vertuous, that in giuinge moche to one perſon, wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all other to haue but lyttell: That prince is not iuſte, that wyll ſatysfie more the couetiſe of one perſon, than the voices of all men: That prince is a fole, that diſpyſeth the councell of all other, and truſteth all onely vpon the opini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of one: And finally that prince is to bolde and hardye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that for the loue of one, wil be hated of all other. ¶Theſe were wordes of eternall memorye.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Han the emperour had ended his ſaid recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, the daye began to ſprynge, and his eye ſtringes began to breke, and his tonge faultred, and his handes ſhoke. Than the ſaid happy emperour, felynge that weakenes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſore to drawe aboute his harte, he commaunded Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius to go into his ſtudy, and to brynge to hym a coffre that was there. And whan it was brought to his preſence, he opened it, and toke out a table of thre fote broode, and two fote longe, it was of wood Lybanus, &amp; rounde about garniſhed with vnycorne. It was cloſed with two leaues, ſubtylly wroughte of a red wood, that ſome ſayde was of the tree that the Phenyx bredeth in: and is called Raſyn. And as there is but one byrde Phenix bredyng in Arabie: ſo lykewiſe there is no mo trees in the worlde of the ſame kynde. On one of the outwarde parties of the table was pyctured &amp; grauen the god Iupiter: on the other the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe Venus: In the inwarde partyes of the Table that ſhette, was pictured god Mars, and the goddeſſe Ceres: In the principall of the ſayd table was pyctured a Bulle ſubtylly wrought to the quycke, and vnder that a kynge was pyctured. The whiche payntures were ſayde to be of the handy warke of the expert Appelles an ancient worke man in payntynge. Than the emperour toke the table in his hande, and with great peyne, he ſayd: Thou ſeeſt my ſonne Comodus, how I am al redy ſcaped from the trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of fortune, and am enterynge into the heuy aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of dethe. I wote not why the goddis haue created vs, ſyth there is ſo great annoyance in our lyfe, &amp; ſo great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rylle at our deathe. I vnderſtande not why the goddis
<pb facs="tcp:3639:103"/>
haue and vſe ſo great crueltie to the creatures .Lxii. yere I haue ſayled with great trauayle through the great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rylles of this lyfe: and at this howre I am commaunded to take lande and diſcharge me of my fleſſhe, and to take erthe in the ſepulchre. Nowe vntyeth the lyuely thredes, nowe vndothe the ſpyndel, nowe ryueth the webbe, nowe endeth my lyfe. Nowe am I awaked from the ſlepynge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll: remembrynge howe I haue paſſed my lyfe, I haue no more deſyre to lyue. And in that I knowe not whyche way to go, I refuſe dethe. What ſhall I do? I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myned to put me into the handes of the goddis wyllyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſythe I muſte do ſo of neceſſitie. Whome I require, yf they haue created me for any goodnes, not to depriue me fro them for my demerytes. I am nowe in the laſte gate: and to this howre I haue kepte the greatteſt and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent iewell that I coude fynde in all my lyfe. In the .x. yere of myn empire there aroſe a warre agaynſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes: wherfore I determyned in myne own perſon to giue theym battayle. After that warre I came by the auncient citie of Thebes, for to ſee ſomme antiquitie. Amonge the whiche in a priſtes howſe I founde this table, the whiche as a kynge was reyſed in Egypte, incontynente it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hanged at his beddes heed, and this prieſt ſhewed me, that it was made by a kynge in Egipte named Ptholome Arſacides, that was a vertuous prince. And in the memo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie of him, and example of other, the prieſtes kepte it dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently. And ſonne I haue kepte it alway with me: and I beſeche the goddis, that ſuch may be thy warkes, as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou mayſt fynde good counſell. As emperour I leaue the heyre of many countreys and realmes: and as thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I doo gyue vnto the this table of counſayles. Lette this be the laſte worde, that with the empyre thou ſhalt be feared, and by this table thou ſhalte be beloued.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3639:103"/>
This ſayd, and the table delyuered to his ſonne, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour turned his eyen, and within a quarter of an houre he yelded the ſpirite.</p>
            <p>¶Nowe to retourne to the ſayd table and writing. There was written betwene the bulle and the kynge a ſcrowe in Greke letters, in maner of heroicall verſes, conteynynge in our vulgar tonge thus: I neuer choſe ryche tirant, nor abhorred the poore iuſt man. I neuer denyed Iuſtice to a poore man for his pouertie, nor pardoned a ryche man for his great goodes and rycheſſe: I neuer dyd good deedes, nor neuer gaue hyre for affection, nor gaue correction one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the peyne: I neuer left ylnes vnchaſtiſed, nor good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes without reward: I neuer commytted an other to doo Iuſtice that was clere, nor darke iuſtice I neuer determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by my ſelfe alone: I dydde neuer deny iuſtice to them that demaunded it, nor mercy vnto hym that deſerued it: I neuer dydde correction for angre, nor promyſed any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde in my myrth: I was neuer charged with though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in my proſperitie, nor diſpayred in myne aduerſitie: I neuer committed yl by malic, enor any villany for auarice: I neuer opened my gates to flatterars nor dyſſemblers, nor lyſtened myne eares to murmurers: I haue laboured always to be loued of them that be good, and to be dread and fered of them that be yll: And fynally I haue fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the poore, that myght do but lyttell, and haue be fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the goddis that may do moche.</p>

Sithe I am prince of al honour, being in tribulation, yf thou wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſte, thou canſte not eſcape out of my ſeignourie. For if thou complayne, that thou arte vnhappy in fortune, than I eſteme my ſelfe to be happy in vnhappynes. I demand one thynge of the. Whan haſte thou ſene me haue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente, and thou nede? Whan haſte thou ſene me ſlepe, and thou wake? and whan haſte thou trauayled, and I reſted? Of trouthe ſithe the goodes and perſones are theyr owne propre, the trauayles and yl aduentures are always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. One thynge thou oughteſt to knowe, if in myne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie thou wylte perſeuer, that all my goodes are thyne, and all thyn euylles are myn, ſyth thou arte borne to lyue eaſyly, and to be gentilly ordered and intreated, and I do lyue for to trauayle. I ſay not this faynyngely: for thou haſte hadde experience of me, that whan Iamaria thy ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter dyed, that was no leſſe vertuous than fayre, thou ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt wel whan ſhe was buried deed, I was buried quick: and at the ſowne of my teares thin eies daunced.

I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the, and deſyre the agayne, and in the name of the goddes I pray the, and in theyr names I coniure the, that thou diſpoſe all thy ſorowes into myn entrayles. For the way that thou goeſte, I wyll not leaue one pace to go fro the ſame: if thou go, I wyll go: if thou reſte, I wyll reſte: yf thou worke, I wyll worke: if thou leue of, I wyll doo the ſame: if thou wylt dye, thou knoweſt well, I wyll not

I ſwere to the my frende Pyramon, that of theſe two thinges I haue as moche pouertie in my howſe as thou haſt ſorow in thyn. I knowe wel the remedy ſhuld come by ryches, and by councell, and conſolation of them that be wiſe. And by reaſon of my heuy deſtenies, ſlouthe hath taken fro me the knowlege of wiſedome: and fortune wyll not permytte me to haue great riches. Certaynely I wepe for thy myſerie, and yet there is but ſmalle remedy in me. Thou ſayeſte in thy letter, that thy neyghbours and frendes in promyſynge haue behighte the many thynges: but in giuynge they do nothyng. Hereof I meruaylle: for the vertuous hand is not bound to make the tonge a fole. Truly though our fete daunce, our handes ſhulde werke at the ſowne of the tonge: our lyfe endethe in fewe dayes, and our renoume in fewer. Promys is an auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cuſtome among the ſonnes of vanite, and of cuſtome the tonge ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth haſtily, and the handes worke at leyſure. Nowe lette vs ſpeake more particularly.</p>
               <p>¶Thou oughteſt not to complayne, in that thou fyndeſt not but in a fewe, that dyuers haue founde in the alone. Cuſtome is to receyue forthwith and meryly, and to gyue ſlowelye with ylle wylle and repentaunce. They that be preſumptuous do the one, and they whiche be ſloutheful, do the other. The Grekes ſaye: that he that promyſethe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3639:105"/>
and is longe in fulfyllyng, is but a ſlacke frende. We Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns ſay, that he is moch better that denieth forthwith, bycauſe he wyll not begyle hym that aſketh. In this caſe I ſay, He that may gyue and gyueth not, is a clere enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: and he that promiſeth forthewith, and is longe or he do it, is but a ſuſpecious frende. What nede wordis to our fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may ſuccour them with workes? Is it not right, to whom we gyue our hartis, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt thinge within vs, that we giue him our tongue, that is the worſte thinge of all our vyces? In good ſothe the goddis wylle not ſuffre in the place of amitie, to deſire any thyng of our frende in haſt, &amp; to be driuen it of with long delaying. Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in his lawes ſayth, We commande, that in our gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, that polytike counſayle be gyuen to them, that be in proſperitie, to thentent that they decay not: and to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them that be in heuines and trouble, to thentent that they deſpaire not. Certainly vnder theſe wordes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed dyuers great ſentences. Thou knoweſt wel my fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Piramon, that ſwete wordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort the hart but lytle that is in tribulation, but if there be ſome good workes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. I wyl nat deny, but that they, to whom we haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen oure good wylles in the tyme of our proſperytie, be bounde to gyue vs of their goodes, &amp; to ſhewe vs fauour in our aduerſitie. I demande one thing of the, Wherfore holdeſt thou a preſumptuous lycence to demaunde? And reproueſt on the other part the lybertie of denieng. Truly as there is ſhame in the demanding, there is obligation in ſome thyng to deny: an importunate man is not worthy to haue mercy. Thou mayſt knowe, if thou knowe it not my fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Piramo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that to attayn to euery thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, belongeth only to the goddis. To giue al thing that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded is no ſigne of any ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And to deny any thing is of liberte. To wepe for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is denied is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tis.
<pb facs="tcp:3639:106"/>
And to conne no thanke for that is gyuen, is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Barbaryens: and to haue euer a ſtedfaſte hoope of that is denyed, is the guyſe of the Romaynes. One of theſe thinges, wherein Gayus Ceſar ſhewed hym ſelfe to be of high courage was, that he had moſte greatteſt ioye whan the ſenate refuſed any thynge deſyred by hym. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes he ſayde: There is nothynge wherin Rome gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me more glorye and renowme to my perſone, thanne whan I ſhewe my ſelfe moſte haſty to demaunde, and they moſte ſtyffe to denye me: to thentent that after they ſhuld knowe, what is my power to abyde, and howe lyttel theyr ſtrength is to reſiſt. Me thynk it is better to haue recours to the goddis with vertues, than to diſpleaſe theym with quarelles. And to gyue contentation to thy repoſed wyll, whan thou ſeeſt thy ſelfe in tribulation: and that thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeſt of the goddis and of men to be fruſtrate, thou oughteſt to meaſure it with a ryght meaſure, and to payſe it in a ryght balaunce, the great quantitie that hath bene gyuen to the, and the lyttell quantitie that hath be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the. O howe vncourteyſe be we to the goddis, and of ſmall remembraunce to men, whan we myniſhe with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnes, that we haue receyued of them: and that lytle that hath ben refuſed vs, we augment it with complayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes? Frende Pyramon, I am begyled if thou be not fyftye yeres of age, and all that ſeaſon thou haſte done nothyng but receyued gyftes: and yet for al that, I haue nat ſeene the do one day of ſeruice. Certaynly it is no reſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne of .viii. dayes of yll fortune, beynge fyfty yeres of age. Thou ſayeſt in thy letter, howe thou haſt moch pein, bycauſe thou knoweſt all thy neyghbours to be enuyous. In good ſoth I haue peyne for thy peyne, and of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylyng I haue great meruayle. For all admiration pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedethe but by ſurmountynge of ignorance, and faulte of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3639:106"/>
experience. Doth the quicke vnderſtandynge of men rule the lyfe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be mortall, that they nede not to thinke of the trauayle to come, hauynge in theyr handes haſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy? If they be hungry, they maye eate: whan they are colde, they may warme theym: if they be ſlepy, they maye ſlepe: whan they be wery, they maye reſt: When they are ſycke, they may be healed: whan they are heuye, they maye reioyce, in ſuche maner, that the thoughtfull lyfe paſſeth, ſome to make tiltes and lyſtes, ſome to make armure and ſcaffoldes, ſome to inuente newe gynnes, and ſome to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre bulwarkes. I ſay the world and the fleſh do nought els but fyghte ageynſt vs, and we haue nede at all tymes to defende vs fro them. All theſe remedyes are ageynſt the trauayle of the fleſhe. But what ſhall we do, that the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes of enuy extende not amonge all theſe? Curſed is that welthe, that euery man enuieth. Certaynly agaynſte enuy is no fortreſſe to defend, nor caue to hyde, nor hye hil to mount on, nor thycke wodde to ſhadowe in, nor ſhyppe to ſcape in, nor horſe to beare away, nor money to redeme vs. Enuy is ſo venomous a ſerpent, that there was neuer mortall man amonge mortalles, that coulde ſcape fro the bytynge of her tothe, and ſcratchynge of her nayles, foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge of her fete, and poiſonynge of her poyſon. I ſwere to the my frende Pyramon, that ſuch as fortune lifteth vp with great ryches, ſhe full of crueltie gyueth theym pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde bytynges. Enuie is ſo enuious, that to them, that of her are mooſte denyed, and ſette fardeſt of, ſhe gyuethe moſte cruell ſtrokes with her fete. This vnhappye enuye prepareth poyſon ſecretely fro them that be in reſt among dyuers pleaſures.</p>
               <p>¶I haue redde dyuers bookes of Hebrewe, Greke, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn, and Caldee: And alſo I haue ſpoken with many very wiſe men, to ſe if there might be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de any remedy ageinſt
<pb facs="tcp:3639:107"/>
an enuious man. I confeſſe the truth: Rede all that can be redde, and imagine al that can be, demaunde all that can be demaunded, and ye ſhall fynde none other cure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinſt this curſed enuie, but to banyſhe vs fro all proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and to ſytte with aduerſe fortune. O howe vnhappy ar they that be in proſperitie: for iuſtely they that be ſette vp in hygh eſtate, can not flee from the perille of Scilla, without fallynge into Charibdis. They can not ſcape the peryll, without caſtinge their treaſures into the ſee. I ſay that the malady of enuy wyll not ſuffre theym to ſcape fro dethe, and the medicine that is applyed to them, wyll not aſſure their lyfe. I can not determine me, whiche is the beſte, or to ſaye more properly the worſte, extreme myſerie without the danger of fortune, or extreme proſperitie, that is always thretened to falle. In this caſe to be ſo extreme I wyl not determin me, ſith in the one is a perillous lyfe, and in the other renoume is ſure.</p>
               <p>¶I ſhall tell the, what wiſe Cicero ſayde, whan he was purſued with many at Rome: Beholde you Romaines, I holde you not for ſo good, nor my ſelfe ſo ylle, to ſaye the trouth always, nor always to make lyes. I am certayne, that ye bere me none enuie, for that I am not as ye be, but it is bycauſe ye can not be as I am. In this caſe I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that my ennemies had enuye at my proſperitie, than my frendes at my pouertie.</p>
               <p>¶This oratour ſpake after the appetite of them that be in proſperitie, leuynge to gyue remedy to them that be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull. And after this Cicero had ſene the feldes of Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalye, he toke other councell and remedy, ſuche as pleaſed hym in Rome. For if Ceſar had granted him his goodes, yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> turned not his credence and renoume. Surely frend Pyramo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I know no remedy to gyue the ageinſt enuy, ſith thou ſeeſt al the world ful therof, we ſe how we be the ſons
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3639:107"/>
of enuy, and we liue with enuy, &amp; die with enuy: &amp; he that leueth moſt ryches, leaueth the greateſt enuy. The ancient wiſe men cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſailed rich men, that they ſhuld not haue pore folkes nere them: and they admoniſhed the pore, that they ſhuld nat dwell nere to the rych. And truly it is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For the richeſſe of riche men is the ſede of enuy to the poore. And bycauſe the pore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lacketh and the riche hath to moche, cauſeth diſcorde among the people. I ſwere by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goddis immortal, fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de Pyramon, though they that be yl wolde that I ſhuld ſwere falſely, as moche as riches with thought noriſheth couetiſe, ſo moch the enuious noriſheth enuy therby. I tell the one thynge, and that is, that it is no good counſell to flee enuy, and to auoyde the vertu co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye to the ſame. Homer ſaithe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in his tyme there were two Grekes extreme in all extremities: The one was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme in riches, &amp; therfore he was ꝑſecuted by enuy, &amp; that was Achilles: &amp; the other was ſore noted of malice, but no man had enuy at hym, and that was Thieſtes. Certaynly I had leuer be Achilles with his enuy, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Thieſtes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Thou knoweſt well, that we Romaynes ſerche not but for reſte in our lyfe, and for honour after deathe. And ſithe it is ſo, it is not poſſible but the man that euery man enuieth his renoume, ought to be exalted in the reſt of his lyfe. And ſithe I ſee theſe two thynges in the, ſuche as be thy frendes taketh lyttell thought, for that thyn ennemies murmure ageinſte the. Thou wryteſt to me, howe they of Lyons doo well, and are mery, excepte thy ſelfe, that arte heuy, and full of penſyueneſſe. And ſith they ſhewe not to haue pleaſure at thy diſpleaſure, ſhewe not thy ſelfe dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with their pleaſure. For it maye chaunce one day they ſhall be ſorowfull, whan that thou art merye: Than thou ſhalt be quite with them. In an euyll perſone there can be no greatter yll, nor in a good man a greatter faute,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:108"/>
than to be diſpleaſed with an other mans welthe, and to take pleaſure at an other mans harme. And in caſe that al do vs domage with enuy, yet moche more a frende, than the enemy. For of myn enmy I wyl beware, and for feare he wyll withdrawe: but a frende with his amitie may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle me, and I by my fidelitie ſhal not perceyue. Amonge all mortall ennemies there is none wors than a frend that is enuyous of my felicitie. Pyramon my frende, I wylle conclude, if thou wylt withdrawe thy ſelfe fro ennemies, than kepe company with thyn owne familiar frendes. I wote not what to write more to the, but with all my harte I lamente thy heuyneſſe. Thou knoweſt howe thy nyece Bruſia was ſlayne with a dagger by her owne huſbande. I had great compaſſion for her deth, and for the renoume that ſhe lefte behynde her. Flauius Priſcus thyn vncle is newely made Cenſure. The proceſſe betwene thy brother Fornion and Britio is determyned by the ſenate, and hit pleaſeth me ryghte well, that they be frendes, and euerye man well content. The boke intytuled the conſolation of heuynes I haue ended, and layde it in the capitol. I haue writen it in Greke, and that is the cauſe that I ſent it not to the. But I do ſende the a ryche ſwerde, and a fayre gyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell. Fauſtine my wyfe dothe ſalute the, and ſendethe thy wyfe two ſclaues. The goddis be my kepers, and comfort the in thy preſent heuyneſſe. Marke the man fortunate, to Pyramon ſore diſcomforted.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Arcke emperour of Rome to the Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius my faythfulle frende, ſalutation to thy perſon, and good fortune to thy deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red lyfe. As thou in tyme paſſed, haſte bene partener of my trauayles, I haue ſente to calle the to gyue the pleaſure of my tryumphes. By the haboundance of rycheſſe, diuerſitie of captiues, fierſnes of capitayns that we haue brought to Rome, thou mayſt perceyue what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryls we haue ſuffred in this warre. The parthes are good men of warre: &amp; as euery man findeth in their own lande defendeth their houſes with ſtronge hart: and ſurely they do lyke good men. For without reaſon we dye of affection to take other mens goodes: &amp; they with reaſon do labour to defende that is their owne. Lette no man take enuy at the Romayn capitayn, for any triumph that is gyuen him by his mother Rome: For one day of honour, he is a. M. dayes in diſpaire of his lyfe. I wylle not ſpeake that I myght ſay of them that be in warre, and dwell in Rome, &amp; ben cruell iuges of their owne fame. And ſith that the ꝓ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre renome of a man lyeth in other folkes tonges, it is not ſayde bycauſe his perſone hath meryted, but bycauſe that they doo ſhewe theyr enuye. But our foolyſhenes is ſo fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſhe, and the reputation of men ſoo vayne, that for one vayne worde, more than for our profytte, we put our lyfe in daunger, and lay our honour to gauge with trauayle, rather than to lyue, and to aſſure our renoume with reſte. I ſwere by the goddis immortall, that the daye of my try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph being in the chariot, I was as penſiue as I myght be. O Rome curſed be thy foly, &amp; wo be to hym that hath brought vp in the ſoo moche pride. And curſed be he that hath inuented ſo great pompe in the. What greatter or more vnegall lyghtnes can be, than that a Romayne ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitayn,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:109"/>
bicauſe he hath conquered realmes, altered peaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, dyſtroyed cityes, caſte downe fortreſſes, robbed the poore, enriched tyrantis, ſhedde moche bloode, and made infinite wydowes, ſhoulde for recompence of all theſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages be receyued with great triumph? Where haſt thou ſene a greter foly? Infinite nombre is diſtroyed in warre, &amp; one alone ſhal beare away the glorie therof. And though ſuche miſerable conquerours merited not to be buried, yet whan I went through the ſtretes of Rome (I telle it as a ſecrete betwene the and me) that whanne the charyotte tryumphaunt came, and the vnhappy pryſoners charged with yrons, remembring the infinite treaſures yll gotten, and heryng the lamentations of the wydowes ſorowfully wepynge for the dethe of their huſbandes, and callynge to mynde our manyfolde frendes deed: though I reioyced me openly, I wepte droppes of bloode ſecretely. I canne not telle what perſonne taketh pleaſure in hym ſelfe of an other mannes dammage. In this caſe I prayſe not the Aſſyriens, nor I enuye not the Perſians, nor am contente with the Lacedemoniens, nor approue the Caldeens, nor content me with the Grekes. I curſe the Troyans, and condempne them of Carthage, bycauſe they folowed not the zeale of Iuſtyce, but what they dyd in their tyme was with rage of pryde, wherby they and theyr realmes were brought into ſclaunder, and was occaſion to leſe vs. O curſed Rome, curſed thou haſte ben, and curſed thou ſhalt be. For if the fatal deſtenies deceiue me not, &amp; myn vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandynge fayle me not, and that fortune holde not faſte, we ſhall ſe in tyme to come, Rome ſhall be in lyke caſe as other realmes be nowe in our dayes. And where as nowe with tyranny thou arte lady ouer all ſeignouryes, it ſhall comme by Iuſtyce, that thou ſhalte tourne to be bonde to theym, that are nowe vnder thy bondage. O ylle fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3639:109"/>
Rome: I ſay it bycauſe that vertue is ſo dere in the, and makeſt folye ſoo greate cheape. Peraduenture thou art more autentike than Babylon, fayrer than Hely, ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher than Carthage, ſtronger than Troye, better peopled thanne Thebes, more ſtored with ſhyppes than Corinthe, more delicious than Thyre, more inexpugnable than A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilie, more happy than Numancy: we ſee howe they all are peryſhed, for all theyr vertues and valiant defenders, and thou hopeſt to abyde perpetually, ſtored with them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be vicious, and peopled with ſuche as be full of vyce. O Rome, marke this for certayne, that the glorie that thou haſt at this houre, was fyrſte theyrs: and this diſtruction that nowe is theyrs, hereafter ſhall be thyn. My dere fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Cornelius, ſhall I ſhewe the the loſſe of the Romayne people, but I can not telle it the without wepynge? I the emperour of Rome commaunde, I make decrees for the warre: if any countreye aryſe, by ſownynge of a troum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pette to make menne to reyſe theyr baners, and to create newe Capytaynes. And hit is a thynge very euydente to ſee, that whan they reyſe theyr ſtanderdes, and haue leaue to make and aſſayle ennemyes, chyldren leaue theyr mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Studentes leaue theyr ſcholes, ſeruauntes forſake theyr mayſters, and officers theyr offyces, to the entente that vnder the colour and crafte of goynge to warre, they ſhulde not be chaſtyſed by Iuſtice. They haue noo feare of the goddes, nor reuerence to the temples, nor obedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to theyr fathers, nor loue nor awe of the people, and loue to lyue ydylly, and hate iuſte labour, and theyr exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyſes are domageable. Somme doo robbe the churches, ſomme make qarelles and ſtryffes, and ſomme breake gates open and beare the goodes away. Sometyme they take theym that be at lybertie, and delyuer theym that ſhulde be priſoners. They paſſe the nyghtes in playes,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:110"/>
and the days in blaſphemes: Finally they ar vnfete to do wel: &amp; are holly diſpoſed to do yl. What ſhall I ſay of their neclygence? I am aſhamed to write it. They leaue theyr owne wyues and take other mens, They dyſhonour the daughters of honeſte men, and begyle yonge maydens, They enforce theyr hoſteſſes, and neyghbours wiues: and worſte of al, the women that do go with them, ſette theym agog that do tarye. And ſoo in this maner none of theſe women that ſo go, ſcapeth without loſſe of honour, and the other ar ſtriken with vices in theyr hartes, bicauſe they tarye. Thinke ſurely Cornelius, that the enterpriſes are ſmalle, where as women do goo to warre. Thou knoweſt, that the women Amazones haue made greatter warre in Grece, than the cruell ennemies, and not for bycauſe they had not men ynowe, but bycauſe they were ſoo many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Pyrrhus was ouercome by Alexander, The valyant capitayne Hanyball was lorde of Italy, as long as he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred no women to come in his warres. And when he was enamoured of a fayre yonge damoyſell of Capue, he was faine forthwith to turne his backe to Rome, bicauſe Rome clenſed the felde fro lecherie. For the ſame cauſe Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie was caſte to the erthe. And I my ſelfe haue ſene in the warre of Parthes .xvii.M. horſemen .lxxx.M. fote men, and .xxxv.M. women. And our beſines went ſo, that fro our hoſte I ſent away Fauſtine my wyfe, and ſo dydde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenatours their wyues home to theyr houſes, to then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they ſhulde ſerue them that were olde, and bring vp their chyldren. That daye that a Patricion is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Senate, and ledde aboute Rome by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſules, the egle is hanged at his breſt, and his raymente is reade, and he after ryſeth in ſuche pryde, that he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth not the pouertie of the tyme paſſed, but thynkethe to be emperour of Rome forthwith. Beholde than what
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3639:110"/>
they do. They writh their berdes, and ruffle their heares, boyſtous their wordes, they chaunge their clothes, &amp; rolle their eien, that they may ſeme the fierſer. And finally, they loue to be feared, &amp; hate to be loued. And woteſt thou not, that they wyll be feared? On a day being at Pentapolyn, I harde a capitayne of myn, not ſeinge me, ſwere and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, ſayinge to a woman his hoſteſſe: ye vyllaynous people, wyll not knowe the capitaynes of warre: I wyll thou knoweſt mother, that the erthe neuer trembleth, but whan it is thret of a capitayne Romayne: and god neuer cauſeth the ſonne to ſhyne, but where as we be obeyed. But nowe frende Cornelius, ſythe I haue blaſoned his vaunt, harken his vertue and worthyneſſe. I ſwere to the, that the ſayde capytayne, for al his booſte, beinge in a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell battayle, was the firſte that fled alone fro the batayle, and lefte the ſtanderde: wherin he dydde inough, to cauſe me loſe the field. But whan it was done, I cauſed to ſtrike of his heed. It is an infallible rule, that they, that ſhewe them ſelfe moſte fierſe, in effecte are moſte cowardes. ¶In dyuers bookes I haue redde, and of dyuers I haue harde, and in many I haue ſeene, that it can not fayle in a man, that can ſuffre and take pacience, to haue vertue and force: And it is meruayle, that he is ſtronge and valyant, that can not ſuffre. What ſhall I ſaye more of the greues and domages, that theſe menne of warre do, in paſſynge through realmes, &amp; of theftes and robberies, that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytte in the houſes, where as they lodge? I enſure the, the worme in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tymbre, nor the mothes in the clothes, nor the ſparcle in the towe, nor the darnel amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the corne, nor the weſel among the grayn, nor the caterpyllers in fruit trees, dothe not ſoo moche domage, as one companye of menne of warre dothe hurte the poore people.

nor no mayde vndefloured: and yet which is wors, they eate without payment, and they wyll not ſerue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out payement, nor no man can conuerſe &amp; endure amonge them. Whan they are payde, by and by they play it away: if they be not payde, they robbe, and grudge: and the caſe is come to ſo great corruption, that if thou ſaweſt it, thou woldeſt ſay, that eche of them were the heed of rumour, and the begynnynge of ſtryfe, poyſon to vertues, Pyrate of rouers, and capitayne of al wretched theues. I ſay not this withoute wepynge. It is the greatteſt mockynge of all mockeries: and the cauſe gothe to ſuche loſſe and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that theſe myſcheuous people ar our homely &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar enmies: &amp; yet there is no emperour, that can haue lordſhyppe ouer them, nor iuſtyce chaſtiſe them, nor feare withdrawe them, nor lawe ſubdue them, nor ſhame refrain them, nor dethe that can kyll theym, for they be men reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyleſſe: They ouer renne, and eate, and diſpoyle euerye manne. O howe ſorowfull I am for the Rome, that was not wont to haue in the ſuche yll aduentures. Certaynely in the auncient tyme, whan thou were peopled with ryght and trewe Romayns, and not as thou arte nowe with ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarde chylderne, than the armies, that wente froo Rome, were as well diſciplyned and morigerate, as the ſchooles of the philoſophies, that were in Grece. The olde aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hyſtories wytneſſe, that kynge Philyp of Marcedony, and his ſonne Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, were happy in warre, bicauſe they kepte theyr armyes ſoo welle ordered, that it ſeemed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be a ſenate ruled, than an armye that wolde fyght. I ſwere to the by min honeſtie, that fro the tyme of Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Cincinatus, vnto the noble Marcus Marcellus, (in the whyche tyme was the greatteſt proſperitie of Rome) the common people had great glorie, as longe as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of knyghthoode was welle corrected: and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3639:111"/>
to loſe, whan our capitaynes beganne to deſerue, to be depraued and condempned. O curſed be thou Aſye, and curſed be the day, that we hadde conqueſt of the. The goodnes that hath folowed therby, we ſe it at our eye: and the domage that is come by the, ſhall all wayes be ſoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. In the we haue waſted our treaſures, and thou haſte filled vs with thy vices: In chaunge of ſtronge and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men, thou haſte ſent thy wantons to vs: We haue ouercome thy cities, and thou triumpheſt of our vertues: we haue beaten downe thy fortreſſes, and thou haſt diſtroi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed our good cuſtomes: by force thou art become ours, and with our good wylles, we are nowe thyne: Vniuſtely we are lordes of thy realmes, and we are iuſt ſubiectes to thy vices: Finally, thou Aſye ſhalt be the ſepulchre of Rome, and thou Rome ſhalte be the ſyncke and gutter of the fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynes of Aſye. Certaynely Rome ought to haue ben con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente with the landes of Italye, whiche is the nauyl of the world, without conqueryng the landes of Aſye, to bereue them from other. I lyke wel al thinges that I haue red of my predeceſſours, ſauynge that they were prowde, as we theyr ſucceſſours be to hardy. And I ſweare vnto the, that yet peraduenture, after the peyne, we ſhall becomme ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and good. All the rycheſſe and tryumphes, that our forefathers haue broughte out of Aſye, the goodes and the rycheſſe, and they alſo, with the tyme at laſte hadde an ende: but the wantonneſſe and vyces, that are in vs theyr chyldren, doothe remayne ſtylle vnto this daye. I wolde to god, that the princis knewe, what an outragious thing it is, to inuent warres in ſtraunge landes and countreis, and what trauayle they ſerche in theyr perſons, and what thoughtes in their mindes, and what murmure and moci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on in theyr ſubiectes, what ende and waſtinge of theyr ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſes and treaſures, What pouertie to theyr frendes,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:112"/>
what pleſure to their ennemies, what domage to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue countreys, and what poyſon they leaue to their owne enherytours? I ſweare to the, that if I had knowen, that I do knowe (I wyll not ſay, but by bloude ſhedde they be taken) if they had offered them ſelfe with good wylle, and ſhedynge of teares, I wolde not haue taken theym. The trouthe is, that our capitaynes neuer ſlewe .xx.M. men of Aſie, with their armour, that they bare out of Italye, but they loſte mo than a. C.M. Romayns, with the vices that they brought to Rome: As eatynge openly in the palayes Auſonios, ſuppyng in their houſes ſecretly, the women to cloth them as men, and the men peynted as women, The Patritiens bearynge Meaſques, The Plebeyens vſinge ſmelles, and the emperours to weare purpul. Theſe .vii. vices of Aſie, Aſie ſent for a preſent to Rome. Seuen noble capitayns broughte them, I leaue to ſhewe their names, leste I ſhulde ſhame theym with their faultes, ſythe they were ſo noble men by their highe dedes. Nowe ye princis, beholde what profitte it is, to take ſtraunge realmes with our warres: I leaue the vices, that they recouer, and the vertues that they leſe, with the perdition of their treaſure that they loue. For certayne there is neyther kynge nor realme broughte to extreme pouertie, but by watrynge a ſtraunge realme, with fynall and extreme conqueſt. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of the myne owne frend Cornelius, What cauſeth princis, to leſe their treaſure, and require them of other? Whan their owne can not ſuffyſe, then they take fro chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſerche dyuers lones, reyſe tributes, and inuent new ſubſydies, gyue and ſpende on ſtraungers, and make him ſelfe hated of his owne, pray euery man, and haue nede of euery man: aduenture his perſone, and aduenture his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume? If thou knoweſte not this, I wyll tell the, if thou wylte here me. Theſe princis counſell with men, they liue
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3639:112"/>
with men, and fynally at the laſt they are men. At one time by pryde, that ſurmounteth them, an other tyme by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, that fayleth them, ſome imagininge by theyr fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, ſome ſayinge, that if he haue great goodes, he ought to encreaſe his fame, and that no memory ſhuld be of him, if he inuented no warre, &amp; that the emperour of Rome by right, is lord of al the erth. And in this maner, as his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes is baſe, &amp; his thoughtes hygh, the goddis ſuffre, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thinketh iuſtly to wynne an other mans, than iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he loſeth his owne. O princis, I can not tell what begi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you, for where as ye maye be ryche with pleaſure, ye wyll be poore with warre: where as ye may be beloued, ye wyll be hated: where as ye may play and ſporte your ſelf, and reſte in a ſure lyfe, ye wyll committe your ſelfe to the chaunces of fortune: and where as other haue neceſſitie of you, ye put your ſelfe to be in the neceſſitie of other. And thoughe the prince make no warre, he ſhuld not ſuffre his people to warre: Euery manne ought to leaue the warre. Frend Cornelius, I demaund of the, whether is more tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaylle to his perſone, or domage to his realme, a kynges ennemies, orels his owne armie? His ennemies robbe on the coſtes, but our men robbe all the londe: The enmyes maye be reſiſted, but we dare not ſpeake to our owne men. The ennemies enuade vs on one day, and recule backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyn, but our gariſons robbe daily, and abyde ſtyll. The ſtrangers haue ſome feare, but ours are ſhameles: and at the laſt, the farther that our ennemies goo, the more they waxe liberall, and our armies of men, euery daye encreaſe in crueltie, in ſuche wyſe, that they offend the goddis, and be importunate to theyr princes, and noyful to the people, lyuynge to the domage of euery man, and be vnprofyta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to al men. By the god Mars, I ſwere to the, and as I maye be holpen in the warres, that I gouerne with my
<pb facs="tcp:3639:113"/>
hande, I haue mo complayntes dayly from the ſenate on the capitaynes that ben in Illyrike, than on all the enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Romayne people: I haue more feare in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynynge one ſtandarde of a hundred menne, than to giue battaylle to .l.M. ennemies. For the goddis and fortune diſpatche a battayle in an houre, be it good or badde: but with theſe other, I can do nothyng in al my lyfe. Thus it hath ben my frende Cornelius, and thus it is, and thus it ſhall be. Thus I founde it, thus I holde it, and thus I ſhall leaue it. Our fathers dyd inuente it, and we ſuſteyne it, that be their chyldren, and for ylle, it ſhal abyde to our heires. I ſay to the one thyng, and I thynke I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued therin: To endure ſo great domage, and to no pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitte of the people, I thinke it a great foly in man, or els a great puniſhement of the goddis. Be the goddis ſoo iuſte in all iuſtice, and ſo true in all veritie, that they wyll ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre vs without reaſon, to do yl in ſtrange landes, to whom we dydde neuer good, and in our owne howſes to haue ſhrewde tournes of them, to whom we haue alwaye done good? Theſe thynges frende Cornelius, I haue writen to the, not bycauſe I thynke it nedefull, that thou ſhuldeſte knowe it: but my ſpirite reſteth in ſhewyng of it. Panuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us my ſecretatrie went to viſite this land, and on the way I gaue him this letter, and I do ſend to the two horſes, I thynke they be good.

It is a thre monthes, ſythe I receiued thy letter, the whiche myn eies myght not make an ende to rede, nor my handes to anſwere. I am ſo heuy for thy heuineſſe, ſo pein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for thy peyn, and ſo hurt with thy wounde, that where as thou wepeſt with thyn eies outwardely, I weepe with my harte inwardly. I wote what difference is betwene the tree and the croppe, and the dreme fro the trouthe: I here of thy trauayles by ſtraunge perſons, and I fele them in myn owne perſon.

<pb facs="tcp:3639:114"/>
If I be not forgetfull, I neuer ſawe the contente in this lyfe: bycauſe thou were euer beſye in thy proſperitie, and wery of any aduerſitie. And as nowe, I ſe the diſpayre, as though thou were but new come into this worlde. I haue knowen the this .xxxii. yeres in great ioy: and nowe thou complayneſt of .vi. monethes, that fortune hathe tourned her whele. O Torcate, nowe thou mayſt knowe, that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men, feare more two dayes of proſperitie than two hundred of aduerſe fortune. O howe manye menne, and howe manye ryche cities haue thou and I ſene, ſlyppe fro their proſperities, throughe their vycyous lyuynge and ſtraunge enmities? In ſuche wiſe, that theyr vaynglorye and ſlypper proſperitie, endured but two dayes: and the hurtes and loſſe that they haue hadde, and the cruell and extreme enmities, the whiche alſo that they haue wonne, laſteth to this daye in their heires. Contrarye wyſe, we ſee ſome ſet in the height of tribulations, the whiche haue eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped by caſtynge away vyces, clothynge them with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, wery of euyll warkes, folowynge goodnes, beinge frendes to all, and ennemies to none. What wylte thou, that I ſhulde ſay more? They that are happye, are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in peace, and they that are vnhappy, do ouercomme other in warre. Therfore my frende Torcate, it ſemeth to me, no leſſe neceſſite, to gyue good counſayle, than to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with great proſperitie, to remedy them that are in gret heuyneſſe. For as wery are they, that go the playn way, as they that coſteth the hyghe mountaynes. By thy letter I perceiue, that what tyme thou hopedſt to haue ben in moſt quietnes and reſt, this yll fortune and chaunce fell on the. Be nat abaſhed therof. For thoughe that all newe chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cauſeth newe thoughtes preſently, yet therby cometh more cauſe of ſtedfaſtnes in tyme to come. Certaynly the tree beareth not ſo moche fruite, there as it ſpringeth firſt,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3639:114"/>
as it dothe whan it is newe ſet in an other place. And all good ſmelles are more odoriferous, if they be wel medled and chaufed togyther. I pray the tell me, abydynge in the worlde, beinge a chylde of the ſame, and louing the world, what hopeſt thou to haue of the worlde, but worldly thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? the worlde ſhall always be the worlde. At this houre thou art worldly, and ſhalt be worldly, and ſhalt be entrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted as the worlde is accuſtomed to entreate theym that be worldly. If thou kneweſt thy ſelfe and thy weakeneſſe, yf thou kneweſt fortune and her mutation, if thou kneweſte the men and their malices, if thou kneweſt the worlde, and the flatteryng therof, thou woldeſt reyſe the fro the hande therof with honour, and not be chaſtyſed with infamye. O howe we hope to ſprede by fortune? O how often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute reſpecte vnwares we paſſe this lyfe? O howe often we truſte the bobaunce of this worlde? and we truſt therin as moche as though it neuer begyled man. I ſay it not bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue harde it ſayde, nor bycauſe I haue redde it in bokes: but for we ſe it dayly with our eies, ſomme decaye and leſe their goodes, other fall and looſe their credence, ſome falle in ſyght, and leeſe their honour, and other ariſe and loſe theyr lyues, and ſome thynke, that all are free by pryuilege, where as neuer none were pryuyleged. O my frende Torcate, of one thynge I am certayne, and let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man take it for a warnyng: Men, by whom we be borne, be of ſo yll diſpoſition, and the worlde ſo fierſe and cruel, with whom we lyue, and the glydynge ſerpente fortune ſo full of poyſon, that they hurte vs with their fete, &amp; byte vs with their teethe, and ſcratche vs with theyr nayles, and ſwelle vs with their poyſon, ſoo that the paſſynge of the lyfe is no leſſe than takynge of deathe. And in caſe thou haſte ſene ſomme lyue longe without any falle of fortune, thynke not it is well, for it is not by good aduenture, but
<pb facs="tcp:3639:115"/>
the more his yll fortune. The worlde is ſo malicious, that if we take not hede to prepare againſt his wrinches, it wyl ouerthrowe vs to our greatter loſſe and hurt. Moche ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dye they that ben helthful with the infirmities &amp; ſycke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of few days, than they that be weke with their la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gour of many yeres. I ſay this bycauſe I hold it for moſt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that the myſerable manne, that maye not lyue without myſeries, ſhulde fele the peynes by lyttell and lyttell, and not all at ones. We eate diuers thinges by morſels, which if we ſhulde eate hole, wold choke vs. In lykewyſe by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers dayes we ſuffre dyuers trauayles, whiche al togyder wolde make an ende of vs in one day. And than ſythe the goddis wyll permytte, that thy mysfortune ſhall fall, and that the ryuer of thy decay ouerflowe her chanell, &amp; where thou weneſt to be moſt ſure, thou ſhalt be in greateſt peryl, we ſhall miniſter to the a ſyrope, to thentent that thou loſe not thy good renoume, though thou haue loſte thy goodis that be nought. Telle me I praye the Torcate, why com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneſt thou, as he that is ſycke? Why crieſt thou lyke a foole? why ſygheſt thou as a deſperate man? Why wepeſt thou as a chylde? Thou haſte gone an yll way, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneſt of thy reſte. Thou arte clothed to goo throughe buſhes, and thou ſayeſt that thy gownes do teare. Thou walkeſt amonge the ſtoones, and arte ſorye bycauſe thou falleſt. Thou haſt leaned, and thoughteſt not to fal, and fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally thou arte ſette with the worlde, and thynkeſte to be free with heuen. Wylte thou haue ſaufeconduite of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that is ennemye to many? She can not giue the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalitie, whiche is mother to all thynges. I wyll axe the one thynge: I put caſe the ſee hadde promyſed the, to be alway in ſuretie of her, and the ſkye clere wether, the ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſnowes, and the wynter flowres. It wyll not be of a ſuretie Torcate. If nature canne not fulfylle this, beinge
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3639:115"/>
thyn owne mother, thinkeſt thou than, that fortune wylle gyue it the, whiche is thy vniuſte ſtepmother? Kepe this rule for certayne, and neuer forget it, that al natural cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſubiectes to mutation euery yere. And all worldely folke that truſte on fortune, ſhall ſuffre eclyps euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And than ſith naturall thynges can not be alwayes in one caſe, of neceſſitie the goodis of Fortune muſte pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhe, ſythe they be ſuperfluitie. Ryght vniuſte ſhulde the ryghtwyſe goddis be, yf they had made perpetuall that, whiche is domageable to ſo many: Or that whiche is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, to haue created it fallyble. I wylle ſpeake no more of thy proſperitie in tymes paſte, but nowe I wyll comme to the banyſhement that thou ſuffreſt preſentely. Suſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fortune made a fayre at thy gate, knowynge what ſhe ſolde: and thou wyſte not what thou boughteſt: She made a dere bargayne, and ſolde it dere to the: ſhe hathe gyuen the ſowre for ſwete, and the ſwete is tourned into ſowreneſſe for the: ſhe hath gyuen the yuell for good, and hath tourned thy good to yl. And finaly ſhe hath begyled the at a iuſte price, not wenynge to the that ſhe wold haue done the domage: and though that ſhe was malycious in ſellynge to the, thou were no leſſe foolyſſhe in the byenge therof: for the more there is in fortunes ſhoppe, the more ſuſpecte is the marchandyſe. O howe vnhappy be we, for in that market is nothyng ſold but lyes. And ſhe truſteth nothynge but vppon the pledges of our renoume: and at laſte wyll not be payde but with the ſhotte of our lyfe, and that is the mooſte greatteſte and myſcheuous wounde. It is as openly knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to euery man as to the, that where as they thynke not to leeſe theyr wares, falſe Fortune in that they purpoſe, to theyr myſhappe lyeth in awayte, and is redy to bye theym. Thou makeſt me very ſore abaſſhed Torcate. I haue reputed the ryghte wyſe and vertuous,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:116"/>
and nowe I take the for a loſte foole. In good ſothe whan I ſawe the yonge in Gayette, I iudged the worthy to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne Rome: and nowe that thou art olde, thou deſerueſt nothyng but to be caſt in a galey as a ſclaue. O howe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thynges are there to knowe a man by? There is not ſo hyghe a toppe of a hylle, but it is troden with feete: nor ſoo depe a ſee, but it is ſounded with leade. And in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeres one manne can not attayne to knowe an other mannes harte. Telle me I praye the, what lokedſte thou for of fortune, after ſoo greatte welthe? Lyuynge to the worlde, thynke to be in the world. The chyldren of vanite goo and walke ſoo longe, that at laſte theyr diſordynate deſyre canne not take fro the worlde their antike vilanyes and ſhamfulnes, the whiche fortune dothe not with them that ſhe hathe reyſed vnto the ſkyes, thynkeſte than, that ſhe ſhal bowe with the to the loweſte parties? O fole Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, thoughteſte thou to paſſe the ſee without peryll, to eate fleſſhe withoute bones, To drynke wyne withoute lyes, to walke in the wayes without fyndynge ſtones, To bye wheate without chaffe? In good ſoth, if thou though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to bye yl goodes without hindrance of thy good fame, and to maynteyn thy good renome without loſſe of yl got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten goodes, I wolde wytte of the, what thou dydeſt hope to do, ſithe ſoo longe ſeaſon thou haſte made a face in the worlde .xxxiii, yere thou haſt ben in the grace of the world, nowe it is tyme fro henſforth to fall at ſome diſcorde ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, Abell, kyng of the Aſſiriens, hoped to haue but ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeres of good proſperitie.

of lynage, the groſſeſte of vnderſtandynge, and the leaſte of power, the darkeſt of fame, and the moſt weke in merites: wherfore than complayneſte thou on fortune? If thou haddeſt ben vertuous in all theſe .xxx. yeres, thou haddeſt neuer eaten without thoughte, nor neuer ſpoken without ſuſpection, nor ſlepte without ſtertyng, thinking what thou haddeſt to do, and wherin fortune myghte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle the. He that is ſo longe beſette aboute with ſoo many enemies, I can not tell howe he ſhuld take any ſure ſlepe. Ah Torcate Torcate, the worlde hath ſo many falles, and we knowe ſo yll howe to continue amonge theym, that be worldly, that ſcantly we are fallen whan our handes and fete lyke ſclaues be ſo faſte tyed, that we can not loſe them. It fylleth our perſons full of vices, ſtrengtheth our ſine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes to wickednes, weaketh our hartes in vertues, and fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally rendreth our ſpirites in a traunce, and maſethe our vnderſtandynge, and chaungeth our taſte, and ſufferethe vs as beaſtes to ſhewe our euylles that we fele with way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges, all though as men we durſt not ſhew it. And that this is true, it appereth, that whanne we ſee, that we loſe, we lament and complayne, and none can helpe hym ſelfe.

In this right colde wynter there aroſe in this lande a myghty gret wynd, and by reaſon of the great wynde aroſe great quantitie of waters, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue cauſed great humidites, and great humidities brede dyuers maladies and diſeaſes: and amonge all the infirmities of this lande I haue the goute in my hande, and the ciatica in my legge. For the helth of my wyfe Fau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtine I can neyther go nor write. I ſaye it bycauſe I can not write to the ſo longe as the caſe wolde require, and as thy thankes meryteth, and my deſyre coueteth. It is ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed me, that by occaſion of a hors thou haſt had ſtrif with Patricio thy neyghbour, &amp; that thou art baniſhed fro Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pue, and ſet in the priſon Mamartyn.

It is tolde me, that all the daye thou wepeſt, and wakeſt by nyght: in company thou dieſt, and doeſt loue to reſte ſolytarilye: Thou hateſte pleaſure, and loueſt penſyuenes. And I haue no meruayle: for the ſorowefull hartes lyue with teares and wepynge, and be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3639:117"/>
mery &amp; laugh in dienge. I am ryght ſory to ſe the loſt: but moche more, that for ſo ſmalle a thynge thou ſhuld be caſt away, as for a hors to leſe al thyn eſtate. O howe variable is fortune, and howe ſoone a myſaduenture falleth before our eies? Fortune gyueth theſe euyls, &amp; we ſee it not: with her handes ſhe toucheth vs, and we fele it not: ſhe tredeth vs vnder fete, and we knowe hit not: ſhe ſpeaketh in our eares, and we here her not: ſhe crieth alowde vnto vs, and we vnderſtande her not: and this is bycauſe we wyll not knowe her: and finally, whan we thynke we are moſte ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, than are we in moſte peryll. Trouth it is, that with a lyttell wynde, the fruyte falleth fro the tree: and with a lyttell ſparcle the houſe is ſette a fyre: a ſmall rocke brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a greatte ſhyppe: and with a lyttell ſtone the legge is hurte. I ſaye, that oftentyme of that we feare not, cometh greatte peryll. In a cloſe Fiſtula, rather than in an open, the ſurgiens doubte the peryll: In depe ſtyll waters the pilote feareth more than in the great hye wawes: Of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret enbuſhement, rather than of open armies, the warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doubteth. I wyll not onely ſay of ſtraungers, but of hys owne propre, not of ennemyes, but of frendes, not of crewelle warre, but of peace, not of open domage or ſclaunder, but of ſecrete peryll and myſchiefe, a wyſe man ought to beware. Howe many haue we ſene, that the chan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces of Fortune coulde not abate, and yet within a ſhorte whyle after, vnwarenes with great ignomynious ſhame hath ouerthrowen them? I wolde witte of the, what reſte can a perſone haue, that truſteth euer vpon the proſperitie of fortune, ſyth for ſo lyght a cauſe we haue ſene ſo great a ſtryfe in Rome, and ſuche a loſſe to thy howſe? Seynge that I ſee, I wyll not feare the wyndes of her trauayles, nor beleue in the clereneſſe of her pleaſures, nor her thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhal not feare me, nor wil truſt vpon her flatteringes,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:118"/>
nor thanke her for that ſhe leueth with me, nor be ſorye for that ſhe taketh froo me, nor wake for any trouthe that ſhe ſayth to me, nor ryſe for any of her leaſynges, nor lawghe for any thyng that ſhe deſyreth of me, nor wepe for gyuing me leaue. If thou knoweſt not the cauſe of this, I ſhal tel the. Our lyfe is ſo doubtefull, and fortune ſo way warde, that ſhe dothe not alway threate in ſtrykynge, nor ſtriketh in thretnynge. The wyſe man gothe not ſoo temperately, that he thynketh at euery ſteppe to falle, nor lyue with ſo ſmalle athought, to thynke to ouerthrowe in euery playn pathe. For oftentymes falſe fortune ſhaketh her weapon, and ſtriketh not, and an other tyme ſtryketh without ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge. Beleue me of one thynge Domitius, That parte of the lyfe is in moſte perylle, whan with lyttell thoughte or care men thynke them ſelfe mooſt ſure. Wylt thou ſe the trouthe therof. Cal to thy minde Hercules, that ſcaped fro many perylles by ſee and by lande, and yet dyed betwene his le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mans armes. Laomedon peryſhed not vnder Troy, but was ſlayne in his howſe. Greate Alexander dyed not in makynge warre ouer all the erthe, but he ended with a lyttell poyſon. The couragious Caius Ceſar ſaued hym ſelfe in .lii. battayles, and after in the ſenate was ſlayne with .xxxii. ſtrokes of penknyues. Aſclipio brother of Pom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peie, peryſhed not flotynge .xxii. yere vppon the ſee, but he was drowned after in drawynge water at a welle. Tenne capitains that Scipio had with him in Affrike, that van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyſhed many harde batayles, as they were mockyng on a brydge, they fel fro the bridge, and were drowned. Good Druſio that had ouercome the Parthes, the day of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, goyng to his charyot, there felle a tyle that claue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonder his heed, ſoo that vayneglorie was the ende of his good lyfe. What ſhuld I tel the more? Thou knoweſt well that Lucye my ſyſter, hauyng a nedel on her boſom, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge

with her chylde betwene her armes, the chylde with his hande hytte the nedell ſuche a ſtroke into her bodye, that he ſlewe his mother. Gneo Ruffyn the conſulle, ſente ageinſt the Germayns, of our tyme was ſoo valyaunte in armes, that none of our predeceſſours ſurmounted hym: yet he kembynge his olde whyte heares, one of the teethe of the combe entred into his heed, wherby grewe an ym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume, by occaſion wherof he ended his honorable lyfe for ſoo ſmalle a caſe. Howe ſemethe the Domitius? As I do tell the of ſo ſmall a nombre, I coude recyte infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, What mysfortunes fell after good fortunes, What miſchaunce after great glorie, what myſaduenture after great happe, what greatte euyll they take of theyr deathe, after the begynnynge of greatte welthe in the lyfe. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge as they, knowe not what to deſire, but they beinge as I am, wyl rather chuſe the labourous and honourable deathe, than an yll death and an honourable lyfe. To my ſemynge he, that wyll be a man amonge men, and not a beaſte amonge beſtes, ought to trauayle ſore to lyue well, and moche more to dye better. For at the fynall ende an yll dethe putteth great doubte of the good lyfe: and the good dethe excuſeth the yll lyfe. I haue written to the at the begynnynge of my letter, that by reaſon of the humy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, the gowte greuethe me ylle. But to ſatisfie thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, I wolde fayne write with my hande more at lengthe. Two daies the loue that I bare to the, hathe faught with the peine that I endure. My wille wolde write, but my fyngers can not holde my penne. The remedy is, ſithe I maye not as I wold, that thou wylte take as thine owne, that I maye do, as myne owne dede. Fauſtine my wife ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteth the, who by reaſonne of my diſeaſes, is halfe ylle at eaſe.

that thy hurte ſhal not appere in thy viſage. If thou canſt fynde any grene almondes or new nuttis, Fauſtine pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the, to ſende her ſome by this bearer.

Do you not knowe yet, that the tyme fleeth with mouyng of wynges? The lyfe trauayleth on her way without lyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of her fete: fortune ſtretcheth her without ſtyrryng her armes, &amp; the worlde voydeth it ſelfe ſayenge nothyng, the fleſhe conſumeth without felynge, and our glorye paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as it neuer had ben: and fynally dethe aſſayleth vs er euer he knocke at the gate. Certaynely it is impoſſible for to make ſynewes of blode, of veynes to make bones, of a craggy rocke a plaine way, and of poſſible to make impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. I meane that none ſhal thynke, but that the grene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ of youthe ſhall waſte and wydder in age. O worlde, what a world art thou: ſo lytel is our force, and our weke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ ſo great, that withoute reſyſtynge drowneſte vs wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly in the depenes of thy peryllous whyrlepoole: and hydeſt vs in the thyckeſt of thy mountaynes, and leadeſt vs out of the brode way, wandring by thy narow pathes, and bryngeſt vs into the rugged waye. I doo meane, that they that be greatteſt in fauour, thou bryngeſt into daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to the entente that with one ſtroke of thy foote, thou mayſt ouerthrowe them. O worlde .lii. yere I haue benne in the, and yet thou neuer ſaydeſt one trouthe to me, and I haue taken the with .x.M. lyes. I neuer deſyred any thynge of the, but thou dyddeſt promyſe hit me, but thou neuer gaueſt me any thynge promyſed me: I neuer treted with the, but thou begyledſte me, I neuer arryued at the, but thou loſte me: I neuer ſawe thynge in the, wherby I ſhulde loue the. For all that we ſee in the, is worthy to be abhorred. And beſyde this, I wote not what is the world. O what faut is in vs thy worldly wretches? For yf thou hate vs, we dare not hate the: yf thou braule with vs, we muſte be ſtylle: yf thou ſpurne at vs, we muſte ſuffre the: if thou beate vs with a ſtaffe, we ſaye nothynge: And yet if thou woldeſt haue vs gone, we wyll not go. And worſte
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3639:120"/>
of all is, that we hadde rather ſerue the for nothyng with trauayle, thanne the goddis with prayer and reſte. I ſwere to the by the immortalle goddis, that oftentymes I make accompte of my yeres paſſed: and an other tyme I reuolue my bookes, to ſee what I haue redde. And lykewyſe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of my frendes, to gyue me counſel to know, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is that I wolde ſpeake. I beinge at Rhodes, redynge Rhetorique, My lorde Adrian kepynge me there, at the age of .xxi. yere, my yonge fleſhe, and no leſſe weake than tender, at the fyrſte worke I founde ſolytaryneſſe, and the ſolytarineſſe with lybertie adored the worlde: In adoryng I felte it, in felynge I folowed it, in folowyng I ouertoke it, in ouertakynge I toke it, in takyng I proued it, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge I taſted it, in taſtyng I found it bytter, in fyndyng in bytter, I hated it, in hatynge it, I felte it, in leauynge it, it retourned, and retournynge I receyued it. And in this maner .lii. yeres, we haue eaten of one breadde, and dwelled in one houſe. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſawe it diſpleſed, I ſerued it, whan it ſawe me thoughtfull it chered me, whan I ſawe it in proſperitie, I demaunded it, whan it ſawe me mery, it begyled me. And thus we be togyther vnto this day, not gyuynge me leaue to goo, nor I wyllynge to departe fro it. O worlde, thou haſte ſo many countenances in thy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, that thou leadeſt all wandrynge in vnſtablenes. Syth we suffre the to take vs, thou wylt neuer deliuer vs: if we withdraw our fete fro the ſnare of fortune, forthwith thou fettreſt our legges faſt with yrons: and if by chance we fyle the yrons, anon thou manacleſt our handes: and though the way be ſtrayte, the pathe ſharpe, the iourneye longe, and our fleſhe weake, yet our bodies are euer laden with vyces, and our hartes fulfylled with thoughtes and penſyuenes. Of one thynge I haue greatte meruayle, and I can not deuyſe what it is: without any conſtraynt to the
<pb facs="tcp:3639:121"/>
contrary, we go ſurely ouer the brydge, and yet we wyll go an other way: and though the ſame waye be ſure, yet we wyll aduenture into the gulfre: if the wayes be drye, yet wyll we goo throughe the dyrte and myre and plaſſhe: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge meate for our lyuynge we ſerche for poyſon to kyll vs: we ſerche to be loſt, and may be aſſured: withoute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt we commytte ſynne, ſeinge peyne commynge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: and fynally, to the entente that we ſhoulde be taken for good, we ſhote at the whyte of vertues, and hytte the butte of vyces. One thynge I confeſſe, though it be myne owne ſhame, Peraduenture in tyme to come it ſhal be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytable to ſomme other. In .l. yeres of my lyfe, I wolde proue all the vyces of this lyfe, to ſee if any thynge might haue ſatisfied the humayn malyce: And after I had ſene all thynge, I founde, that the more I dydde eate, the more I dyed for hungre: The more I ſlepte, the more fluggye I was: the more I dranke, the more thyrſte I hadde, the more I reſted, the more werye I was: the more good I hadde, the more couetous I was: the more I ſoughte, the leſſe I founde: And fynally I neuer toke peyne for any thynge, but I was euer lette: and thanne anone I hadde appetite to an other. Lette no manne thynke to lyue in the fleſhe, and ſatisfie the fleſhe. It hath power to take fro vs our lyfe: and we haue no power to take frome it the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate couetyſe. I wolde fayne knowe of the goddis, why our dayes ſhulde haue an ende. O cruelle goddis, what is this? We can neuer paſſe one good lyfes day, we do but taſte it, and ſo paſſeth our lyfe, and lyfe is but a dreame, and dethe waketh it. Lette euery manne knowe, that the worlde taketh our wyll, and we with our good wyll gyue it therto: and it takethe our wylle, to the ende to contente vs, and prayſe that we prayſe, and the tyme paſſethe ſoo, that we lyue after the curſed tyme. To attayne vertues,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3639:121"/>
we haue good deſire: but to attayne to vices we putte to all our warkes. This haue I ſayde for you Claudyus and Claudine, that in thre ſcore yeres, ye wylle not yſſue nor goo oute of the pryſonne of the worlde: Hauynge your feete putrifyed with yrons and chaynes. What is thanne to be hoped of yonge perſonnes, whiche be of fyue and twenty yeres olde? Excepte my memorye fayle me, whan I was with you, ye hadde your neuewes, ſonnes of your chyldren maryed, and nyeces, doughters of your dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters maryed: and me thynketh, whan the guynes comme, the ſeaſon of cheryes is not comme: and whanne the newe wyne is tounned, the drye huſkes are caſte out. Canne ye ſuffre dyuers neuewes, ſonnes to your chyldren, in your howſe, and fewe yeres in your perſones? Very ſeldome we ſee fruite and the floweres togyther: for whanne the one is rype, and in ſeaſon, than the other is cleane goone and auoyded.</p>
               <p>¶In this caſe I thynke greatte meruayle, howe ye can be of manye yeres, and ſeeme to be yonge. I knowe none other thynge, but whanne ye maryed Lambert, your own doughter to Druſio, and Matryne your nyece, dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your doughter, with Lamberte, that were all lyttell and yonge chyldren: and ſythe that ye be of a good aege, and lacke good, ye maye gyue vnto eche of them twenty yeres of your aege, in ſtede of theyr dowrie. And ſoo ye ſhall vnlade you of your yeres, and charge you with other mennes goodes and ſubſtaunce. Noo leſſe this mattier paſſeth in my thoughte, than the ſhorte clothe doothe in a falſe weuers handes. Ye haue ſtrayned it on the tentours, and drawen it on the perche, for to to lengthen the lyfe.

Whan the couragious great Pompeie, and Caius Ceſar were ennemies, and beinge in cruell ciuil battailes, Rome was infamed, and them ſelf loſt.

This was ſene with the eies of Pompei, bicauſe that ſom accomplyſhed the yeres of fyftye in the campe. O golden worlde, wherin were ſuche men. O happy people, that in all the worldes to come, hath left ſuch a memorie of them. They diſpiſed the worlde, and forgatte them ſelfe. What ſtrokes gaue they to fortune? What delytes for the fleſhe? and howe lyttell ſette they by theyr lyues, and yet more, to ſet ſo ſmall ſtore by deathe? O what bridel was this for the vicious, and what hope for the vertuous, what confuſion for them that loued this lyfe, and what enſaumple, not to feare dethe, haue they left vs? And ſith they diſpiſed their owne propre lyfe: it is then to be thoughte, that they dyed, not to thentent to take other mens goodes, to thynke that our lyfe neuer ſhall haue ende, therfore our couetyſe neuer hath ende. O glorious people, and .x.M. tymes bleſſed, that lefte theyr ſenſualitie, and vanquyſhed theyr natural wyll, beleue not that ye ſe, but gyue faythe to that ye ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſawe, as they that ſe nothyng go agaynſt the fatal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenies: who goethe agaynſte the waye of fortune, gyue a wrynche to the lyfe, robbe the body at the dethe, wynne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the goddis, not that they ſhulde length your lyfe, but to take the reſte of the lyfe. Archagatus ſurgien, and Anthonius the phiſitien, and Eſculapius the father of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, I thynke wanne but lyttell in that lande. Who commaunded theſe Barbariens to take ſirope in the mornyng, and to take pylles at night, and to refreſhe them with mylke, to take clere barly to annoynt theyr lyuers, to daye to be lette blode, and to morowe to take a purgation, to eate one thing, and to abſteyn fro many thinges? Than

me thinke, that they beynge of .l. yere of aege, and you of lxxx. at the leaſte, ſhulde be egall with them in wyſedome. And if ye wyll not take deth in good worth, yet at the leeſt, amende the yll lyfe. I remembre well of a long tyme, that Fabricius, our neybour wylled vs, to beware of a mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the whiche if it be not broken, there ſhall folowe great dyſſhonour. And ſith he ſhewed me ſoo good a leſſon, I wyll paye you with the ſame money. I wyll ſhewe it you, if ye poore aged folkes doo not knowe it: ye be ſuche, that your eyes are bleared, your noſes droppynge, your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res whyte, your herynge dulle, your tongue faulterynge, your tethe waggynge, your face wrincled, your fete ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, your ſhuldres croked, and your ſtomake diſtempered, finally if the graues coude ſpeake, they myght ryghtfully calle for you to come, and inhabite in them. Of trouthe it is great compaſſion to beholde yonge ignoraunce, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen theyr eies, to knowe the infortunes of this lyfe, whan it is tyme to cloſe them and to entre into the graue. And therof cometh, that it is in vayne to giue counſaile to vain yong peple. For youth is without experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that it doth, &amp; is ſuſpect of that it hereth, &amp; wyl not beleue that is ſaid, and diſprayſeth other mens cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, &amp; is ryght pore of their owne. And therfore I ſaye Claudius and Claudyne, my frendes, I fynde without compariſon, none ſo ylle an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of goodnes, that holdethe theſe yonge perſonnes, as is the obſtinacy of theſe aged perſonnes in yll. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of yll, is a manne not to knowe that he oughte to knowe, yet it is wors to haue the knowlege of wyſedome, and to lyue lyke a brute beaſte. O ye olde goutye people, ye forgette your ſelfe, and renne in poſte after the lyfe, and ye neuer regarde whatte ſhall falle, tyll ye be ſuche as ye wolde not, and without power to retourne backe: &amp; herof cometh, that ye lacke of lyfe, ye wyll ſupplye it with foly.

Than awake ye that be ſlombringe, haue no force to ſlepe, open your ſlepy eies, and accuſtome you to do well: Take that is nedeful for you: and fynally appoynt you betimes with dethe, or he make execution of your lyfe .Lii. yeres I haue knowen them of the worlde, yet I could neuer know none ſo olde, nor ſo putrifyed in their membres, but that their hartes were hole to thynke vnhappyneſſe, and their tongues hole to make lyes. Take hede, ye poore olde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, me thynke ſyth ſomer is paſte, ye haſte forward with the tyme: and if ye tary a ſmall ſeaſon, yet ye make haaſte to take lodgynge. I meane, that though ye haue paſt the day in the ſee with peryl, the nyght of dethe wyll take you at the porte of helthe. Mockes do paſſe with mockynges, and trouth with trouthe: though I haue ſene you ryghte yonge and hardy, nowe I ſe you very olde: Though the knyght paſſe his courſe, yet it is not his faute, yf the hors be not well reyned: but at the ende of his courſe, he wylle trymme his hors. Let not that begyle you, that of cuſtom hath begyled men: That is, ye ſhalbe as wel eſtemed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as though ye had moche money. I beleue ye folow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and yet they all haue enuy at you. But truſt me, that at the ende, honour is gyuen to a yonge perſone poore and vertuous, rather than to an olde perſon ryche &amp; vycious. The ryche may haue power to be more eſtemed with pore people, and accompanyed with ryche and couetous: but the vertuous poore perſon, ſhall be better eſtemed and leſſe hated. What can be greatter confuſyon to a perſonne, or more ſhame to our mother Rome, than to ſe in dyuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the old people behaue and appoynte theym, as yonge folke, as though they lyke the vyne leaues dyd newly bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gein? What thinge is it to ſee the olde perſones, nowe in our dayes, brayde and make fayre theyr whyte heares, trymme and kembe theyr beardes, weare ſtrayte ſhowes,

their hoſen garded, their ſhurtes frounced, their clokes of ſcarlette, their bagges enbrodred, their chaynes of golde about their neckes, fringes of gold and ſyluer about their apparell, eſtrige fethers vppon their hattes lyke grekes, perles and rynges on their fyngers lyke Indiens, theyr gownes long lyke flamine priſtes, and fynally worſt of al, whan dethe hath gyuen them day, than they anſwere that newely they wyll ſerue a lady? O howe many haue I kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen in Rome, that were highly renoumed in their youth, and after through wanton lyghtnes they were but loſte in their age: and worſte of all, they loſte their renowme in their age, and the fauour of their parentes, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytte of their chyldren. Certaynly Guagyn Caten of the ancient lynage of the Catons, was in Rome, a prieſt of the lawe .v. yeres, &amp; prouoſt .iii. yeres, and Cenſure .ii. yeres, &amp; dictatour one yere, and Conſule .v. tymes, &amp; whan he was paſte the age of .lxv. yeres, than he began to ſerue Roſane doughter of Gneus Curcius, a lady ryght fayre &amp; yonge: and he doted ſo farre in her loue, that he ſpente all that he had to ſerue her, and wold wepe lyke a chyld whan he ſawe her. It fortuned this lady fell ſycke of a feuer, and ſhe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to eate newe grapes, and it was in ſpringe tyme, whan there was none rype as than in Rome. He ſent for ſome to the felde of Danubius, that was a. M. and .v.C. myle thenſe, and this was ſhewed to the ſenate, and they ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that Roſana was cloſed in with the virgins veſtales, and the old man was banyſhed perpetually out of Rome, and his chyldren lyued in greatte pouertie, and the father dyed infamed. I beleue that ye haue harde of this. There were dyuers that reputed for a greate vylanye the dede of the olde louer, and prayſed the ſentence of the ſenate. But I thynke if Guagin had had as many yonge perſones in his banyſhement, as there were old amorous perſons that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3639:124"/>
toke by hym example, I thinke there ſhuld not be ſo many men loſte, nor ſoo many women ſo yll maryed. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beſt is, that ſuche people, whan they be warned by their ſeruantes, and reproued by their parentes, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their frendes, that they make not excuſe &amp; ſay, howe they be not amorous, but in mockerye. Whan I was very yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge both of age &amp; wyt, on a night I met with a neyghbor of myn nigh to the capitoll, I was his neuewe &amp; ſon to his ſonne, &amp; ſayd to hym, My lorde Fabricius ye are amorous thus and thus. He anſwered me, I do it but for paſtyme. Certaynly I had meruayle to mete hym at that houre, and I was abaſhed of that anſwere that he gaue me. In them that be ſoore aged and of ſadnes and grauitie, ſuche reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ought not to be called amours, but rather dolours, not a paſtyme, but a loſte tyme, no mockerie but a foolyſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For in loue with mockery, foloweth the trouth of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. To the Claudius and Claudine, I demaunde of you olde louers, what is it to be polyſhed and arrayed as ye be ſo gayly, but the bronde of the tauerne, where there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge but vynegre, fayre egges and nothynge in theym, gylte pylles, and bytter in taſte, an olde botell and a newe ſtoppell, a hole wounde rancled vndernethe, the fygure of an oxe to take partriches, a ſlypper way, where no fote is ſure, and fynally an old louer is as a knyght decayd, that helpeth to leſe money, and can helpe no man fro peryll. Of trouth the old lecherous louer is as a ſwyne with a whyte heed and a grene rayle. Than me thynke ye that be my frendes and neyghbours, ye take no hede in breakyng the winges out of ſeſon, whan the fethers be gone: and yet ye begyle me not, to ſay that there is tyme ynough. Beleue me, that that may be done in the daye, leaue it not tylle the nyght of your age. For the blunt knyfe cutteth but yl with the edge, and he that is wont for to eate the fleſhe, can not
<pb facs="tcp:3639:125"/>
eate the boones. Than lette vs comme to the remedye, to redreſſe this dommage, that is, yf that the houſe begyn to falle, ſhore and ſtaye it not with pieces of ſclender tymbre, but with ſtreight pyllers of the lyfe, that we haue to yelde the goddis, and to men by good fame. And if the vyne of all our vertues, be redy to be gathered, at the leaſt lette vs gather that is lefte vs by vnderſtandynge. And ſythe the waters of our reſte, are waſted with our yll werkes, lette vs water them with newe muſte of good deſires, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the good goddis wyl be content with the ſeruyces, that we ought to do, for the merytes and rewardes that they do to vs, ſoo that if we deſire, to attayne golde for our warkes, yet to pay vs with the copper of our good deſires. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, I ſay to you Claudius and Claudine, if ye haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred the floure of your youth to vyces, offre nowe at this tyme, the branne of your age to the goddis. I haue wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thus largely to you, as I thynke: and bycauſe ye ſhall not be taken as cowardes, nor I for hardy, gyue no parte of this letter to any perſon.</p>
               <p>¶And I deſyre you to haue me recommended vnto all my neighbours in Rome, namely vnto Druſine the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wydowe.

I think wel, thou haſt ſuſpect, that I haue ſo lytel ſet by the, ſith in thy profounde and greuous hurtes, my conſolation hath ben ſloutheful. But I remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre thy noblenes, which can neuer faile: and my good wil, the which hath neuer deſired to ſerue the. I am in ſuretie that thy great vertue ſhulde put awaye the ſuſpecte. For thoughe I am the laſte to comforte the, yet I am the firſte that feleth thy dolours, and ſhal not be the laſt to remedye thy troubles. And in caſe that ignorance is the ende of all vertues, eſperance for al vices, as well ſomtime great ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure taketh away reſt from the wyſe folkes, and ſclandreth the innocentes: moche better amonge vs latyns we fynde with ignorance of vices, more than the grekes do with the knowelege of vertues. If that we be ignorant, we haue no peyne to abide it, nor ſorowe to take it. I ſay it bicauſe I haue knowen, that I wold not knowe, and that is, the tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uayles are at an ende of Claudine thy huſband, and nowe beginnethe the ſorowe of Labinia. I haue knowen it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain days, and wold not diſcouer it to the, for it ſhuld haue ben crueltie. She that hath ben in trouble ſo long a ſpace with abſence, that I ſhulde haue gyuen knowlege of the deth of ſuche an entierly deſired huſbande: and it had ben no reſon, that ſhe of whom I haue receyued ſo many good dedis, ſhuld haue of me ſo yll newes. And ſyth the houre y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I knewe, that ye wyſte therof, my peyne hath ben double.
<pb facs="tcp:3639:126"/>
I fele his dethe, and nowe I fele in his deathe my ſolyta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, and thy deſolation. Thou haſte reaſon to wepe, not for that he is with the goddis in reſte, but for vs myſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons, lyuinge in the power of ſoo many ylles, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhulde not ceſſe to take peyne and ſorowe. O La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binia, oftentymes I haue thoughte, for what thynge I myght fyrſte wepe, for the yll that lyuethe, or for the good that dieth. For as moche hurteth the yll that is found, as the good that is loſte. It is great peyne to ſee theſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes dye, and ſurely it is no leſſe peyne to ſee the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people lyue. But of that that neceſſitie muſte ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des come, whan it cometh we ought not to ſclaundre hit. Shewe me Labinia, doſte thou not knowe of howe good conuerſation the goddes be, to whom we hope to go, and howe yll the men be, with whom we are conuerſaunt, that as the yll are borne to dye, in lyke wyſe the good dyethe to lyue? For a good man alway lyueth in dyenge, and the yll alwayes dyeth in lyuynge. And than ſith the goddis haue cauſed him to come to theym, it is noo greatte thyng that they haue taken fro the. I am in certayne, thy deſyred huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban Claudyn, and my true frende, ſeing where he is, and remembrynge what he hath ſcaped, had rather to be ſtylle there as he is, than to returne agayn to the. Of trouth the remedyes for widowes is not to thynke of any company paſſed, nor of the ſolytarines preſent, but to thynke of the reſt that they hope to come to. If hither vnto thou haſt ben in peine, abidinge in thy houſe, nowe reioyce the bycauſe he abideth for the in his, for thou ſhalt be moche better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated amonge the goddis, than here amonge men: nor conſent not to thynke, that thou haſte loſte hym all onely. For ſyth we all reioyced of his lyfe, we are than bounde to wepe for his dethe. The greatteſte ſorowe to a ſycke harte amonge all other ſorowes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to ſe other reioyce, at his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3639:126"/>
and contrarye wyſe, the greatteſt eaſe amonge all greues of fortune, is to ſee that other feeleth their ſorowe. All that my frende wepeth for me with his eies, and al that he feeleth of my ſorowe, diſchargeth ſomewhat myne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde peyne. The bokes in the tyme of Auguſte the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſheweth, howe as he was nere to the ryuer of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubius, he founde a maner of people, hauynge this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome: The ſame houre whan a huſbande taketh a wyfe, or a louer, they wold ſwere by their goddis, neuer to wepe nor ſorowe for any maner of infortune, but to forget theyr owne propre troubles, and to dye to remedye theyr louer, &amp; ſo in lykewiſe eche to do with other. O glorious worlde, O right happy age, O people of eternall memorie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the men were ſo humble, and their louers ſoo true, that wolde forgette their owne ſorowe, and wepe for others. O Rome beinge Rome, O tyme yll ſpente, O lyfe ylle appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, O ſmall thoughte recheleſſe in theſe dayes, the hartes preſente ſeperate frome welthe, and aſſured withoute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in euyll, that men forgettynge that they be menne, tourne them ſelfe to be beaſtes? I deſire to gyue the lyfe, &amp; thou dyeſt to take awaye my lyfe: Thou wepeſt to ſee me laugh, and I laugh to ſe the wepe. And thus without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of any of vs we leſe, and we reioyce in leſynge of our ſelfe. By the lawe of an honeſt man I ſwere to the Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, yf thy remedy lay in my handes, as thy ſorowe dothe at my harte, thy pytiefulle wepynges ſhoulde not hurte me, nor thy heuy and wofull ſolitarynes of thy huſbande: but ſyth thy remedy and my deſyre can not be accomplyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and that with deathe, nor with them that be deed we haue no power: than remyt it into the handes of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, who can moche better delyuer vs than we can chuſe.

<pb facs="tcp:3639:127"/>
that be layde to vs, and ſome with wordes do leaue other medicines. I ſay this, bycauſe the hartes that be in peyne make a ſee of thoughtes, ſomtyme comforted with benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes done to the perſone, more than with wordes ſpoken in their eares: an other tyme the ſorowfull harte is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with wordes of a frende, than with all other ſeruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the worlde. O how ſorowfull am I, for in all theſe am I fauty, conſyderynge the hyghnes of the honourable lady Romayn, and the ſmall abilitie of me Marc of mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Celio? I ſee my ſelfe ſo vnable to comforte the, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the I lacke ſubſtance, I haue made the a ſore wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the whiche wolde be taken in worthe. I wyll not paye the with ynke and paper, that whiche I may do with my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone: for he that gyueth counſell with wordes, may reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with workes, if he ſhewe hym ſelfe a frend in tyme paſt not taken in ſuſpecte to be an ennemye in tyme to come. If thou haſt reputed me hytherto for thy neyghbour and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to thy huſbande, I praye the nowe to take me for thy huſbande in loue, and for thy father in counſayle, and for ſonne in ſeruyce, and for aduocate in the Senate, in ſuche maner that I hope thou ſhalte ſay, all that I haue loſte in many, I haue founde in Marke alone. And bycauſe that in greuous conflyctes, where as crafte and ſubtyltie is forgotten, the vnderſtandynge is altered, and the reaſone withdrawen, thanne there is as moche neceſſytie of good counſell as of a meane remedy. Claudyne nowe deed was my frende, and I Marc alyue am his, and alſo by thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruynge thou mayſte commaunde me what thou wylte: and for the loue that I haue to the, thou mayſte deſyre of me any thynge nedefull.

For in al extremities lyeth the vyce, for al ſuche werieth them ſelfe, and anoyeth the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, and leſe them that be aliue, &amp; do no profit to them that

This caſe was ſo foule, &amp; take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a great vilany, &amp; all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains there preſent were abaſhed, &amp; were in ſuſpect neuer after to beleue wydowe in Rome. I ſay not this Labinia, bycauſe thou wylt do ſo: for by the god Mars I ſwere, the hart of Marc hath of the no ſuch ſuſpect, nor thy great age wyll not ſuffre it, nor the auctoritie of ſoo ſadde a matrone wyll demande it. I require the ryght hartily, forgette nat the honeſtie that ought to be in a Romayn woman, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayte that is requiſite in a wydowe. For yf thou be a wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of ſolytarines, that thou feleſt by hym that is deed, than comfort the of the reputation that is holden of the by them that be lyuing. I wyl ſay no more to the at this tyme but that thy renome may be ſuche with all men, to caſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a brydel vpon them that be yll, to cauſe them to be ſtil, and to theym that be good to gyue theym ſpurres to ſerue the.

Shewe me I pray y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cyncinate, ſyth thou haſt euer founde me true, why haſte thou any ſuſpecte of my deſyre? The grene leus outwarde ſhewethe, that the tree is not drye inwarde: and the good werkes openly notifieth the inward hart ſecretly. Where it is not perfite, there is always breakyng and faylyng in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3639:128"/>
ſeruice: for he that perfytly loueth, perpetually and fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerueth. And I am as moche aſtonied of thy ſlouthe, in demaundynge ſomwhat of me, as of thy couwardyſe to write. I wyl confeſſe to the one trouthe, if thou haddeſte as moche hardynes as wyll and thought of the ſmalle ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte of my letter myght ſatiſfie to the greatenes of thyne vnderſtandynge, it ſhulde abyde than for yll done, but not for ſhorte, as he that throweth his ſpeare. In tyme paſte whan I was yonge, and thou old, thou in thy counſayles, &amp; I wich my money eche gaue to other: but at this houre, that thy heed is whyte, men reken the to be olde, &amp; yet thy workes accuſe the to be yonge. Reaſon is that I ſuccour thy pouertie with money, &amp; to remedy thy lyghtenes with councel. For the good wyll that I haue to the, and for the lawe of amitie that I owe to the, I wyll aduertiſe the as a vertuous man ought to do, and that is to remembre the benefites that he hath receyued, and to forget the iniuries doone to hym: eſteme moche his owne ſmalle power, and holde the greatnes of other at nothyng: fauour the good, and diſſimule with the euyll: be great with the greatteſt, and communicable with your inferiours: preſentlye doo good dedes, and alſo of them that be abſent ſpeake good wordes: The greuous loſſes of fortune, holde theym in ſmall eſtemation, and the ſmal loſſe of honour, holde that in great eſtemation, for one thynge aduenture not money, and for dyuers doubtfull aduenture not a certaintie: and finally be frende to one and ennemie to none. Theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ought he to haue, that amonge good wyll be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted good. I knowe well thou haſt lefte to be pretour of the warre, and nowe thou haſte ſette thy ſelfe by lande and by ſee to vſe marchandyſe. Thou makeſt me ſore abaſhed, to conquere thyn enmies as a Romayn, and nowe to take on the, the office, to perſecute thy frendes as a tyrant. Wylte
<pb facs="tcp:3639:129"/>
thou do yll to thy neyghbours, and leaue the ſtraungers? Wylt thou take away the liuynge fro hym that gyueth vs liuing, &amp; take away the deth fro him that taketh away our lyfe? wilt thou to them that be mouers and ſtrangers giue moderation, &amp; fro them that be ſobre take away their reſt? Thou wylt gyue to them that take awaye fro vs, and take fro them that gyue vs: delyuer them that be condemned, and condempne innocentes. Thou wylt be tyraunt to the common welth, and not defender of thy countreye. Than ſithe to all this he aduentureth hym that leaueth dedes of armes, and becometh a marchaunte: I ſtudye ſoore what hath meued the to leaue chiualrye, wherin thou haſte had great honour, and nowe to take on the an offyce, wherby foloweth ſo moche ſhame and rebuke. Surely I thynke in the none other excuſe, but that thou art olde, and canſt not clymbe the mountaynes, and nowe thou ſytteſt ſtylle, and robbeſt the playnes. To olde men olde malady, whan out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde force fayleth theym, than forthwith they arme them with malyce inwarde. I ſaye it by the ſoore couetous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as thou act now. One thynge I wyll ſay, thou haſte taken an office, wherby all thy felowes haue robbed in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers days, thou ſhalt gyue accompte therof in one howre, ye and after the tyme ſhall come, that thou ſhalt leſe all in a moment. For the goddis permyt, that one ſhall be a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyſement of dyuers, and longe tyme chaſtyſeth all. Howe is it my frende Cyncinate, that in the howſe of thy father Cyncinate were ſpeares, and not writynges hangynge? I haue ſene his halle full of armure, &amp; not of fardels: and portall and gates ful of knightes, &amp; not marchantis. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynly there haue I ſene the ſcole of noblenes, and not as it is now the denne of theues. O Cincinate, curſed be ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>layn an office, the marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tis lyue porely to dye ryche: &amp; let vs ſay ageyn, curſed be it, bycauſe the couetyſe of one that

If thou thynkeſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy vertue ſhulde holde to the ende of the worlde, as the worlde holdeth to the, as hit ſemeth by thy white heares, holde me excuſed of the trauayle in perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge the to here me.

The dongeon of this world, wherin the children of vanite do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde, is founded on the ſande. For let it be neuer ſo ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, yet a lyttell blaſte of wynde wyll cauſe it to ſhake, and a lyttell heate of proſperitie wyll open it, and a lyttell rayne of aduerſitie wyll diuide it, and within a ſhort while or ſpace, whan we leaſt take hede, it wyll fall all flatte on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> erth. If the pyllers be of ſyluer, and benches of gold, and though the benchers be kynges, and continue a thouſand yere, and rule into the entrayles of the erthe: yet they can fynde no ſtedfaſte rocke nor mountayne, wherin to clooſe the goodes of their predeceſſours, and their eſtates perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.

Howe ſtronge ſo euer the walles be, yet great age cauſeth it to fall to ruine. Two thinges ſemeth to be free, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che fortune can not ſet abacke, nor the tyme cauſe to be for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gotten, &amp; they be theſe: The good or yll renoume amonge men, and the peyne or rewarde that they that be good or yll haue of the goddis. O my frende Cyncinate, thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheueth the perſones, but the goddis neuer. What grene or rype or rotten holdeth any ſeaſon the fruyte of the tree floured? I eſteme it nothynge, bycauſe it muſte die by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Howe be it dyuers tymes in leaues and flowers we beare the froſte of ſome malady, or the blaſte of ſome enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous myſhap. Longe is the webbe in makyng: but it that is made in many days, is cut aſonder in a moment: Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably it is a piteous thing to ſee a man dye with ſo great trauayle, and to be ſette in the ſtate of honour, and after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde we, regardynge neyther the one nor the other, and yet we ſe it periſh. And without any memory of any thing abydynge. O my frende Cyncinate, for the loue betwene vs I pray the, and by the immortal goddis I coniure the, beleue not the worlde, the whiche vnder the colour of a lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell golde, hydeth moche fylthyneſſe: and vnder colour of trouthe chaungeth vs into a. M. lyes: and for a ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte gyueth vs a. M. diſpleaſures. To them whom it ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth moſte loue, it begyleth with greatteſt tromperies: to whom the worlde gyueth moſte goodes, it procureth moſt domages: to them that ſerueth it with mockeries, hit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth with true recompences: and to them that loue it truly, it gyueth them goodes of mockeries: finally whan we ſlepe mooſte ſureſt, it waketh vs with greatte perylle. What wylte thou ſay than of the worlde, ſhewe me? One thynge I wyll telle the, and me thynke thou ſhuldeſte not forgette it: and that is, we ought not to beleue the vayne vanities that we ſe with our eies, rather than the greatte
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3639:130"/>
meruayles that we here with our eres. One thing I haue regarded, and by longe experience I haue knowen it, that but a fewe howſes paynted nor ſtalles raiſed vp, we haue ſene in Rome: but of a ſmall tyme they take no thoughte for the walles, but they haue cruelle enmities with theyr neyghbours, and great anoy of their heyres, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſhame of their frendes, and double malyce of their ennemies, and enuious profite in the ſenate, &amp; ſomtyme to put a gouernour out of poſſeſſion, they ſet foure in honor: and finally all that with great thought haue be gathered for their childe, whom they loue wel with great reſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme an other heire enioyeth it, of whom they thynke leeſt. It is a iuſte ſentence, that ſuche as begyle diuers with yll dedes in their lyfe, ſhuld be begiled of their vayn though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes at their deth. Cruell ſhulde the goddis be, and ryghte greuous for men to ſuffre, that the ylle that hath gathered for one heire in the p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iudice of dyuers that be good, ſhuld enioye it many yeres. Me thinke it ſhulde be a ſouerayne folye to be borne wepynge, to dye ſyghynge, and to lyue laughynge. The rule to gouerne all partes ought to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall. O Cincinate, who hath begyled the, that for a potte full of water, thou haſte nede of a greatte laake of this world to paſſe this wretched lyfe? Wylt thou flay away the ſkynne of thy handes with the corde of thoughtes, breake thy body in bataylle with great trauayle, and aduenture thyne honour for one potte of water? What wylte thou more that I ſhulde ſay? but that to fyl a potte of thy goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des thou wylt ſuffre a. M. perylles. And in the vyle exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyſing of thy marchandyſe, thou doubteſt not for leſynge of thy credence. And fynally I ſweare to the, thou ſhalt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde deed for thurſte, as thoughe there were no water in the feldes. If thou wylt do by my counſell, deſyre deathe of the goddis, to reſte the as an aged wyſe man: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
<pb facs="tcp:3639:131"/>
not rycheſſe to lyue yll as a yonge foole. I haue ſoore wepte for many, that I haue ſene in Rome departed oute of this worlde, and for the I haue wepte droppes of blode, to ſe the retourne newly &amp; vylely to the worlde. My amitie and the credite of the ſenate, the bloude of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, the auctoritie of thy perſon, and the honour of the countreye oughte to refrayne thy couetouſneſſe. Oh frende, thy whyte heares ſheweth honour and wyſedome, the whiche ſhuld exerciſe and be occupied in noble dedes. Regarde, It auayleth more to folowe reaſon by the ways of them that be good, than the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinyon, whiche is the large way of them that be yll. For though the one be ſtrayte for the fete, it reiſeth no duſte for to blynde the eies, as the other dothe, to lyghte younge perſons, the whyche procure lyghtneſſe, ignoraunce excuſeth them: but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate couetyſe of the olde perſones, cauſeth theym to occupie their lyfe with trauayle, and to take deathe with great annoyaunce, and in the one as welle as in the other abydeth great infamy. O Cyncinate, take this counſayle of a frende: Charge not thy ſelfe with takynge of theſe vayne goodes, ſyth thou haſte ſoo ſmalle a morſelle of thy lyfe. For ſuche as thou arte, we ſee conſume, and waſte, and not to quicken. Put no truſt in frendes in the preſent proſperitie, for it is a pronoſtication of an euyll fortune. And ſythe thou arte in a haſarde lyke a foole, me thynke thou oughteſt to diſcende a foote lyke a ſage perſon. And thus euery man wyll ſaye, howe Cincinate is diſcended, and not fallen. I wyll ſay no more, but the goddis be thy ſauegarde, and defende bothe the and me frome gylefulle fortune.

A iuſte thynge it is, that the new forces of youth ſupply &amp; ſerue them that are worne by age. For theyr longe experience mocketh our tender age &amp; natural ignorance. youth is yl applied, when it ſurmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth the force of the body, &amp; faylleth the vertues of the ſoule: &amp; age is honored, wherin the force dyeth outwarde, wherby vertues quickneth the more inward. we may ſe the tre whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fruite is gadered the leues fal, and whan flowers dry,

I meane that whan the firſt ſeaſon of youth is paſſed, which is the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tyme, than cometh aege called wynter, and putrifieth the fruite of the fleſhe, and the leaues of fauour falle, and the floures of delyte are wyddered, and the vynes of hope dried outwarde, than it is right, that moche better the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of good workes within be good. They that be old and auncient ought to prayſe theyr good werkes rather than theyr white heares. For honour ought to be gyuen for the good lyfe, and not for the whyte heade. Glorious is that common welthe, and fortunate is that prince, that is lord of yonge men to trauayle, and ancient perſons to counſel. As to regarde the ſuſteynyng of the naturalitie of the life, in lykewiſe ought to be conſydered the polycie of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, the whiche is that al the fruites come nor drie not al at ones, but whan one beginneth an other fayleth. And in this maner ye that be auncient teachynge vs, and we obedient, as olde fathers and yonge pullettes, beynge in the neſte of the ſenate: Of ſome their fethers fallyng, and other yonge fethered: and where as the olde fathers can not flye, their trauaylles are maynteyned by theyr tender chyldren. Frende Catulus, I purpoſed not to write one lyne this yere, bycauſe my penne was troubled with thy ſlouthe: but the ſmalleneſſe of my ſpirite, and the greatte peryll of myn offices always called on me to demande thy counſell. This priuilege the olde wyſe men holde in their houſes where they dwelle: They are alwayes lordes ouer them that be ſymple, and are ſclaues to them that be wyſe. I thynke thou haſte forgotten me, thynkynge that ſythe the dethe of my dere ſonne Veriſſimus, the tyme hath ben ſo longe, that I ſhulde forgette it. Thou haſt occaſion to thynke ſo, for many thynges renneth in tyme, that reaſon can not helpe. But in this caſe I can not tel whiche is the

greatteſt, thy trumperie or my dolour. I ſweare to the by the goddis immortall, that the hungry wormes in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayles of the vnhappy chylde, are not ſo puiſante, as are the cruell dolours in the harte of the father ſore wounded. And it is no compariſon, for the ſon is ded but one tyme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heuy father dieth euery moment. What wilt thou more that I ſhulde ſay? but that one ought to haue enuy of his deth, &amp; compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my life, bicauſe in dienge he lyueth, &amp; in lyuinge I die. In yl fortunes in caſe of lyfe, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyl aduerſities of fortune, where as her gyles profiteth but lyttell, and her ſtrength leſſe, I thinke the beſte remedy is to fele it as a man, and diſſimule it as diſcrete and wiſe. If all thynges as they be felte at harte ſhulde be ſhewed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde with the tonge, I thynke that the wyndes ſhoulde breake the harte with ſighinges, and water all the erthe with wepynge. O if the corporall eies ſawe the hurt of the hart with a true wound, I ſwere to the, there they ſhuld ſe more of a droppe of bloudde ſweatynge within, thanne all the wepynge that is made out warde. There is no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſon of the great dolours of the bodye, to the leeſt peyne that the ſpirite feleth. For all trauayle of the body, menne may fynde ſome remedy, but if the heuy harte ſpeke, it is not harde: if it wepe, it is not ſene: if it complayne hit is not beleued. What ſhall the poore harte do?

I ſay this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though ye ſe me not now make funerall wepynges and waylynges, as I dyd at the deth of my ſonne, yet thynke not but it doth brenne my hart, ſo that with the inwarde greatte heate is conſumed the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myditie of the eies outwarde, for it brennethe all my ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites inwarde. Thou mayſte knowe what an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble father ſuffrethe to leſe a good chylde: In all thynges the goddes be lyberall, excepte in gyuynge vs vertuous chyldren. Where there is aboundaunce of great eſtates, there is greatteſt ſcarſitie of good inheritours. It is a great hurte to here, and greatter to ſee, howe theſe fathers clyme to haue ryches, and to ſee their chyldren diſcende to haue vycyouſenes: To ſe the fathers honour theyr chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the chyldren to infame theyr fathers: yea and the fathers to gyue reſt to theyr chyldren, and the children to gyue trouble to their olde fathers: yea and ſometyme the fathers dye for ſorowe that theyr children dye ſo ſoone, and we ſe the chyldren wepe bycauſe theyr fathers dye ſoo late. What ſhulde I ſaye more, but that the honour and riches that the fathers haue procured with great thought, the chyldren loſe with lyttell care. I am certayne of one thynge, that the fathers may gather ryches with ſtrength and crafte, to ſuſteyne theyr chyldren, but the goddis wyll not haue durable that that is begon with euyll intention, and is founded to the preiudice of other, and is poſſeſſed

And though the heuy deſtenies of the fader permit, that the riches be left to their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſerue them in all their vyces for their paſtyme, at laſt according to their merites, the goddis wyll that the heire &amp; heritage ſhulde peryſhe.

Alway I imagined, that while the good lyued, I ſhuld be pore: &amp; now that the yl remaineth, I thynke to be ryche. I ſhall ſhewe the why, the goddis ar ſo pitieful, that to a pore father they neuer giue yl chyld: &amp; to a riche father they neuer giue a good child. And as in al proſperite alway there falleth ſome ſiniſter fortune, either ſoone or late, ſo therwith fortune doth arme &amp; apparel vs, wherin ſhe ſeeth we ſhal fal to our greatteſt hurt. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the goddis permit, that the couetous faders in gade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng with great trauayle ſhuld die with that hurt, to leue their riches to their vicious childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yll implied. I wepe as moch for my child y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the goddis haue left me, as for him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue taken fro me.

The yl reſt &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation of them that liue, cauſe vs to ſigh for the company of them that be deed. The yll is alwaye deſired for his ilnes to be deed, &amp; the good alway meriteth to haue his deth bewailed. I ſay my frend Catulus, I thought to haue loſt my wit, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſaw my ſon Veriſſime dye: but I toke comfort ayen: for either he of me, or I of him muſt ſe the ende.

And I deſyre, ſyth they haue taken away the lyfe from this chylde, to cauſe good cuſtomes to be in the prince myne other ſonne. I knowe what heuyneſſe thou haſte take in Rome for my ſorowe.

She eateth nothynge on the daye, nor ſlepeth in the nyght. She loueth darkenes, and abhorreth lyght, and therof I haue no meruayle: for it is reaſone, that for that was nouriſhed in her entrayles, ſhe ſhulde fele ſorowe in the ſame. And the loue of the mother is ſoo ſtronge, though her chylde be deed and layde in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture, yet always ſhe hath him quicke in her harte. It is a generall rule, that the perſon that is entierly beloued, cauſeth euer great grefe at the deth. And as for me I paſſe the lyfe ryght ſorowfully: though I ſhewe a ioyfull face, yet I want myrth at my harte. And amonge wyſe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge ſorowfulle, and ſhe wynge their faces mery, is none other thynge but burienge the quicke, hauynge no ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

Why ſtyckeſt thou to her? Doeſt thou not remembre the worde, that the kyng of the Lacedemoniens hadde at his gate, ſayenge, This houſe is at the puttynge downe of fortune. In good ſothe theſe were hyghe wordes, and of greatte vnderſtandyng, he knewe fortune moche better than thou, ſith he rekeneth his houſe at fortunes diſpoſition, and not for enheritance. And if he hadde loſte any thynge, as thou haſte doone, he thoughte, that ſhe reſtored it to other as theyrs, and had

Reaſon holdeth confidence, to argue thy treaſon, by that ſhe depoſeth the fro thy heyghte, to be an heriter: for he that lyueth, heryteth deathe, and not death the lyfe, for all dyeth, and it heryteth al in theyr lyfe. Wilt thou take vengeance, of that hath giuen the ſo moch pein? Therfore take this councel: be frende to fortunes enmye, the whiche is the graue: Ouer them that be borne, and not ouer them that dye, is her empyre. O howe many greatte lordes haue ben the thoughtes of thy harte, ſoo as many wormes ſhall be in thyn entrayles? What greatter victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may be, thanne ſhe that ouercometh all lyuers, ſhall be vanquyſhed of the alonely by dethe. I ſaye one thynge to the, that all onely he that is cloſed in his graue, is aſſured of all thynges of this lyfe. Thy meſſager ſhewed me, that this ſommer thou woldeſt come to Rome, and nowe that it is wynter, thou wylte ſayle into Alexandrye. O, my frende Mercurio, whan thy lyfe draweth to an ende, thou begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to be auaritious. Thou ſhalt fynde two cities in this worlde, in two extremytes, Rome the heed of vice, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexaundry the ende of all vertues. I ſay of thy merchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſe, in Rome thou dooſt charge thy body with vices, and in Alexaundrye thy harte with thoughtes. I ſwere by the othe of a iuſte man, that thou ſhalte haue more deſyre, of that thou leaueſt, then contentation of that thou beareſte away. Thou remembreſt not, howe it is wynter, and thou muſt paſſe the ſee, &amp; but if the pylotes lye to me, the caulme ſeaſon moſt ſure, is the vigil of the more vnfortune. Thou wylt ſaye, thy ſhyppes be voyde, and therfore they ſhal go more ſurely. I beleue they ſhal go more charged with aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, thanne they ſhall come with ſylke. O what a good chaunge ſhal it be, if the auarice of Italy myght be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for ſylke of Alexandry.

is that couetyſe, whiche the ſhame of the worlde dothe not repreue, nor the feare of death ſtoppe, nor reaſon appoint. I ſay it, bycauſe that he, which in ſuch a tyme offreth him ſelfe to peryl, eyther couetiſe ſurmounteth hym, orels vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandynge fayleth hym. And bycauſe I can finde none other excuſe ſufficient to excuſe me to the, but that thou art as moche knowen by the ſee, as vnknowen to the goddis, that is, the vnſtable wawes knowe the wicked harte and vnreſtefull, and the harde rockes vnruly menne: and one wind knoweth an other wynde. I pray the ſhewe me, what thou wylte go ſerche? Wylt thou go into the gulfe of Arpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no for to ſeke thy leade? Than take hede, and thynke, how the fyſhe hath eaten thy harde leade, and let them not eate thy ſofte fleſhe. Thou wylt peraduenture go ſeke thy goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des with peryll of thy lyfe, and to leaue renowme at thy deth. Knoweſt thou not, that ſuche renoume, is a ſalue for a rewme, a baume for a ſwowning, lyght to a blynde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonne, a nyghtingale to the deafe?

For to frendes afflicted with ſorowe, we oughte to gyue remedy to their perſones, and conſolation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to their hartes. I ſwere to the by the lawe of good men, in this caſe I haue not ben vncourteys of aunciente tyme, nor cruell at this tyme, to feele it. As I redde the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thy letter, I coude not holde my handes from ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge, nor my harte from ſyghyng, nor myn eyen fro we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng, to ſe the ſmall thing that thou ſendeſt to demaunde, and moche more for lacke of power to ſende to the. The greatteſt infortune of all infortunes, is whan a man may do lyttell, and wolde do moche. And the greatteſt fortune of all fortunes is, whan a man may do moche, and wylle doo but lyttell. In this I wyll ſe, if thou haſt forgoten our amitie, and aduentureſt at one tyme, that I haue truſted in the dyuers times. Thou knoweſt wel, that in the young dais of my youth, al thinges were diſcharged fro my hart, and charged them to thyne vnderſtandynge. Than it is a iuſte thyng, that thy trauayles ſhuld be diſcharged fro thy
<pb facs="tcp:3639:138"/>
wyll, and charged vpon my hart. And in this maner, thou and other, ſhall ſee and here, that my handes ſhalbe as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to remedy the, as my teares of wepynge are for thy da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. Nowe come to the reſt of euyll fortune. Thou gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt me knowledge, that the goddis haue taken a dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fro the: And the monſtrous erthequake hath throwen downe thy howſe, and the ſenate hath gyuen a ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte the, wherby thy goodes are loſte, and thy perſone banyſhed. The goddis be to me as propyce and meke, as they haue ben cruelle to the. I am ſoore abaſſhed, of that my ſpirite hath conceyued in this, as of the loſſe, that thou &amp; thy wyfe haue felt: yet am I not abaſhed of the monſter, that feareth the people, nor of the trymblynge, that hathe ſhaken downe thy howſes, nor of the fyre, that hath brent thy goodes, nor of the goddis that haue permitted ſuche thynges to falle: But I am abaſhed, that there is ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che malyce in the, and in thy neyghbours: For the whiche iuſtely ye do deſerue to haue ſoo horrible and cruelle cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyſementes. Beleue me in oone thynge Antigonus, and doubte it not, yf men lyued lyke men, and chaunged not the rule of conditours, the goddis wolde then be always as goddis, not to cauſe vs to be borne of oure mothers, to gyue vs ſo cruel chaſtiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes by the hande of monſtrous beaſtes. Certaynely it is iuſte and mooſte iuſte, that brute beaſtes be chaſtyſed by other brute beaſtes, and the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous, by other monſterous beaſtes: and ſuch as offend with greatte fautes, to be punyſhed with great peynes. I ſay to the one thynge, the whiche ſemeth a newe thynge to the, and that is this, the euyll perſons offende more by infamy, than the goddis gyue theym peyne for it, rather than for the offence that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted ageynſt them. As the goddis naturally be pitiefull, and alwaye haue the name therof, ſo we are always euyl, and our euylnes and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3639:138"/>
werkes deſerue to haue ſore chaſtiſement. The ſymple folkes call the goddis cruell, in that they ſe theyr chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment openly, and for they ſee not our ſecrete ylneſſe. Than the goddis haue reaſon to complayn, bicauſe we with our ſinnes offend them, and they by our cruelnes are infamed. An ineffable rule it is, that the pitieful goddis do not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſſhe extremely with extreme chaſtyſementes, ſythe that fyrſte the vicious men doo extremely with extreme vyces. The tyme that Camillus was banyſhed Capue, and that the frenche men poſſeſſed Rome, Lucius Clarus conſule was ſent by the ſenate to the oracle of Apollo, to demande counſell, what the Romayne people ſhuld do to be delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of their great perylle. And there this conſule was xl. dayes within the temple on his knees before Appollo, offerynge right ſtraunge ſacrifices, and ſhedde many tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res with wepynge, and yet he coulde haue none anſwere: and ſo with no ſmal inconueniences he returned to Rome. Than the holy ſenate ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of euery temple two prieſtis, and whan they were proſtrate on the erthe, Apollo ſayde: As one beginnynge is correſpondent to an nother begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, and one place to an nother, Meruaylle thou not, though by the reaſon of an extreme demaunde, I ſhewed my ſelfe extreme to anſwere. Ye Romaynes ſythe ye faylle men, ye come to ſeke to the goddis, for the occaſion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we wyll gyue you no good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle whan ye haue nede, nor permytte that men ſhulde fauour you, whan ye goo to ſeke for them. Regarde my frendes, not for the ſacrifyces, that ye haue offred to me, but for the amitie, that I haue had with your fathers in tyme paſt, I wyl diſcouer to you a ſecrete, the whiche is, that ye ſhall ſay to the Romaynes fro me .vii. thynges. The fyrſte is, lette neuer man leaue the goddis for an other man, for feare that the goddis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part fro the myſerable man in his moſte greatteſt neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
<pb facs="tcp:3639:139"/>
The .ii. is, that more auayllethe to holde the parte of one of the goddis immortall, that is in heuen, than with all the mortall men in the worlde. The .iii. is, that menne ſhulde beware to anoye the goddis, for the yre of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des doth more domage than the iniquitie of all men. The iiii. is, the goddis neuer forgette a man at any tyme, but if the goddes be forgotten by men a. M. tymes. The .v. is, that the goddis do ſuffre, that one ſhall be perſecuted by an other that is ylle, or they haue fyrſte perſecuted one that is good. And therfore ye are ſtryke with the feates of the frenchemen: bicauſe ye haue perſecuted and banyſhed Camyllus your naturalle neyghbour. The .vi. is, if the men wyl haue the goddis fauourable in the time of warre, they muſte ſerue them fyrſte in tyme of peace. The .vii. is, that the pitiefull goddes ſendeth not to any realme ſome extreme chaſtiſement, but if it be for ſome extreme offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces commytttd in the ſame realme. And ſhewe to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that I wold make none anſwere to Lucius Clarus, bycauſe they ſent ſo yll a man to theyr god Apollo as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadur, the whiche they ought not to haue done. Ye Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns take this counſell of me, and if ye fynde it yl, take no more of me. In a ſtraunge meſſage ſende alwayes the moſt eloquent men, and in your ſenate ſet the wyſeſt men: And commytte your hoſtes to valiant capitayns: and to your goddes ſende alway the moſt innocent men. The iuſt goddes neuer appeaſe their ires ageinſte vniuſt men: but if the requirers be very innocente and meke. For a fowle veſſell is not made cleane but with fayre water. For with foule handes it is hard to make the veſſel clene. The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis be ſo iuſt, that they wyl not gyue iuſte thynges but by ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of iuſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Finally I ſay, if ye wyl driue the french men your ennemies out of your landes, fyrſte caſt out the paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fro your hartes. Thynke for trouth, that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3639:139"/>
wyll neuer driue your ennemies out of Italy, tyll Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myllus and al the gyltleſſe that be banyſhed, be returned a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geyn to Rome. Certaynly the cruell warres that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis permytte at this tyme preſente, is but a warnynge of the chaſtiſementes for offences paſſed. For that the yl men haue done to the innocentes in diuers dayes, after by the handes of other that be yl, the paime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is made in one daye. This anſwere Apollo made to the prieſtes flamynes, that were ſent to hym out of Rome, whiche thinge made the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſore abaſhed. I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, that in the boke of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of the goddis, in the annales of the capitol, there I founde it: the whiche boke the firſt day of euery monethe was red by a ſenatour, before al the other ſenatours of the ſenate. Therfore fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Antigonus, as the god Apollo ſaid, if thou wylt not beleue me, that am thy frende, beleue the god Apollo. O Antigonus, beholde howe the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of vayn men are but beſtly to the ſpirites of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, whiche are ſecret and hid: and where as they ſpeke, al other ought to be ſtylle. For one counſell of the goddis is more worth in mockerie, than al the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though they be neuer ſo erneſt. Of whens thinkeſt thou that this cometh? I ſhall ſhewe the: The goddis are ſoo perfyte in all bountie, and ſo wiſe in al wiſedome, and we are ſo yl in all malyce, &amp; ſo ſimple in all ſymplenes, that though they wolde erre, they can not bicauſe they be goddis: and we y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wolde be aſſured, erre, bycauſe we be men. And herin I ſe what a brute beaſt man is: for all theſe mortall men are ſo entier in their owne wylles, that they wyll loſe more in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowyng their owne opinion, than wynne by the counſel of an other man: and that worſt of al is, they take ſo the bytte in the teeth in doinge yll, that there is no bridell that can refrayne them. And they are ſo ſlowe to do well, that there is no pricke nor ſpourre that can dryue theym forwarde.

Thou doeſt complayne of the pytiefull goddis, and of the ſacrate ſenate. Alſo thou complayneſt of ioyfulle fortune. Thre thynges there be, that one of them is inoughe with one ſtroke of a ſtone, to take away thy lyfe, and bury thy renoume. And whan eche of them hath drawen the apart, than al together wyl ſtryke on the with ſtones. Thou haſt taken great competitours, and yet I knowe not what thy worthynes is. I ſhal ſhewe the ſome ſtrengthes and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antnes that the aunciente barons hadde, and therby thou ſhalt ſe, what they of this worlde dothe holde. ¶The felawe of Scipio Naſica toke a ſerpente in the mountayns of Egipt, whiche after it was ſlayne, flayed, and the ſkynne meſured in the felde of Mars, it was .vi. ſcore fote of length.

This was a monſtrous thynge to ſe, and nowe it ſemeth incredyble to be belued. ¶In the yere .CCCCxx. of the foundation of Rome, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio Ledent a renoumed capitayne, comynge fro Tarente agaynſt Pyrro kyng of the Epirotes: he was the firſt that brought .iiii.

<pb facs="tcp:3639:141"/>
drawen a threde from the diſtaffe: And to the intente that we ſhulde beleue ſuche thinges, as we here were done in tymes paſt, we may know it by dedes done preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly in our days. I remembre whan my lord Adrian came fro Dacie, he dydde celebrate a ſpectacle in Rome, wherin there was mo than .ii.M. wyld beſtes. And the thing moſt notable y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue ſene, there was a knyght borne by the riuer Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubio, who toke a hors, and ran into the parke, and ſlewe ſo many wylde beſtes, that there fledde fro him lyons, leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardes, beares, olyphantes, and we dyd fle fro them: and he ſlewe mo of them than they dyd of men. Theſe ſtrange thinges I haue recyted to the, that of all theſe I am not ſo abaſhed, as I am of the, to ſe the redye to doo armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinſt the goddis, and againſt the ſenate, and ageinſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Theſe thre are gyauntes in vertuous valyauntyſe, and happy at all tymes: and they be ſuche as commaund them that commande other. The goddis by their natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte and power cloſe vp the furies, and gouerne the ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: And the ſenate with their Iuſtyce ouercomethe real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and ſubdueth tyrantes: and fortune with her tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny taketh them that they leaue, and leauethe them that they take: and honoureth them that they diſhonour, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyſeth them that ſerue her: ſhe begyleth euery perſon, and no perſon begyleth her: ſhe promyſeth moche, and fulfyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth nothynge: her ſonge is wepynge, and her wepinge is ſonge, to them that be deed amonge wormes, and to them that lyue in fortunes: at them that be preſent ſhe ſpurneth with her fete, and threateth them that be abſente. All wyſe men ſhrinke fro her, but thou lyke a fole ſheweſte her thy face. Of one thynge I am abaſhed of the, to complayne of the ſenate, and yet I meruayle not: for in concluſion they be but men: yet of trouth in thinges of Iuſtice they ought to be more than men. And to complayn on fortune, I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3639:141"/>
not a lyttell: for in the ende fortune is fortune amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g mortalle men. And all the heuens is of an aunciente qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relle, and whan we are beſette with mooſte greatteſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relles, than ſhe ſtryketh vs with moſt greuous hurtes. I haue great wonder, that thou being a Romain, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineſt on the goddis, as if thou were one of the barbariens. We Romayns are not ſo moche renowmed among al nations, for the multitude of realmes that we haue ouercome, as we are for the great churches and ſeruices that we haue made. Thou complayneſt, howe the goddes haue broken thy houſes with an erthquake, and haue ſlayne thy dough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, felowe in thy banyſhemente, and al in one daye: But thou doſt not remembre the offences that thou haſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in dyuers caſes. O my frende Antigonꝰ, thou knoweſt not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out of our yl proceſſes cometh forth good ſentences: and thou knoweſt not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our wicked workes are but a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of true Iuſtice. Knoweſt thou not, that the fierſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſementes, is but a preſſe that haſteth the gret co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minges of your yonge deſires? and knoweſt thou not, that it is no thynge that the goddes do chaſtiſe openly, to that they do diſſimule in ſecrete? Doſt thou not knowe, that in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the goddis be goddis, &amp; the mortalles are mortalles, and they may do vs more good in one day, than we can do ſeruice in a. C.M. yere? Doeſt thou not knowe, that the leaſt yl done by the handes of the pitiefull goddis, is more goodnes than all the welth that may come by the handes of the cruel men? Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof doſt thou complain? I pray the be ſtyl. And ſith thou art amonge ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, ſuffre. And thou wilte haue honour, diſhonour not the goddis of the Romayns. For the vniuſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do gret iniuſtice to ſpeke yll of them that be iuſt, &amp; ſpecially of the goddis, for they are moſt iuſt. Certainly as Cicero ſayth, the greateſt faut in a man that is good, is to approue the yl rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good:
<pb facs="tcp:3639:142"/>
and the moſte greatteſt yuell in an yll man is to condemne the good for the yll. Thou knoweſt not howe iuſt the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis be. Of trouthe they chaunge not for any prayer, nor leaue nat for any thretenynges, nor mocke not by wordes: nor be not corrupt with gyftes. Great ought thyn offence to be, ſithe the erthe hath taken vengeance for the goddis: and thy innocent doughter hathe payde the faute, for the offence of her father. O Antigonus, doſte thou not know, that in all thynges the goddis may werke after their own opinyon and wylle, excepte in Iuſtyce: for in that they be goddis of all, they oughte to be egall to all? And if theyr bountie doth bynde them to rewarde vs for goodneſſe, no leſſe their iuſtyce conſtrayneth them to chaſtyſe vs for our ylles. It is a greatte cuſtome, and a ryghtouſe Iuſtyce, He that wyllyngely draweth to ſynne, agaynſt his wyll is drawen to peyne. I ſay it bycauſe thy doughter hath lefte to do ſome good openly, or elles ſhe hath done ſome ſecrete ylle, ſithe in her youth her lyfe is bereued frome her father for enſample of chaſtyſement in other. And in the ende of thy letter thou complayneſt, that the peyne that men doo to the, is more greatter than the offences that thou haſte done to the goddis. And if hit be thus frende Antygone, thou oughteſt to haue no diſpleaſure, but pleaſure, no he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynes but ioye. And I ſwere to the by the immortall god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, I wolde gladly chaunge my lybertie for thy captiuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the ſtate of Rome for thy banyſhement of Sycile. And I ſhall telle the why: He is honoured amonge theym that be honoured, that fortune abateth without faute: and he is ſhamed amonge theym that be ſhamed, that fortune inha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth without merite. For the ſhame is not in the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenientes that is done to vs by men, but it is of the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that we commytte ageynſt the goddis. And in like caſe the honourable honour reſtethe not in the dygnyties that we
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3639:142"/>
haue, but in the good workes, wherby we meryte. And therby the wordes ſeme trewe, that the .xi. emperour of Rome bare writen in a rynge on his fynger, whiche ſayde thus: More is he to be honoured, that deſerueth honour, than he that hath it and deſerueth it not. Theſe wordes are greatly to be noted, and ſpoken by a great lorde. Than retourne to the purpoſe. Thou complayneſt of the wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and greues that men do to men, and leue the goddis. I haue no meruayle: for as the goddis do neuer vniuſte thynges, ſo the menne neuer lyghtly do any thynge iuſte. Note this that I ſay, and forgette it not. The ſenate gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth an open peyne, and publyſſheth the ſecrete faulte, in ſuche maner that with the peyne they hurte vs, and with the faute they ſhame vs. The goddes are more pitiefull: for though they gyue vs pein, yet they kepe the faut cloſe. A my frende Antigone, though the goddes gather togider the ſlouthe and wyckednes, that we commytte ſecretelye, Beleue me and doubte not, the goddis gyue lyfe to many, the whiche men bereueth. Therfore I thynke, that thou ſhuldeſt thynke and wyſhe, that ſyth the goddis haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred the ylles that thou haſt done ſecretly, that thou muſt ſuffre open chaſtyſement, that men haue gyuen to the. For otherwiſe thinkynge to put away the peyne, thou ſhalt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde charged with infamy. I haue written to the this lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g epyſtle, to thentent that thou ſhuldeſt haue ſome thyng to paſſe the tyme with. Certaynly the greatteſt eaſemente to eaſe hym that is in trauayle, is to exercyſe the wauerynge harte with ſome good occupations. I wyll write no more to the at this tyme, but as touchynge thy banyſhemente, truſte me I ſhal brynge the at one with the ſenate. I ſende Panutius my ſecretarie to the, gyue as moche credence to his wordes, as to my letter. And he bryngeth a gowne to the, and therwith my harte and wylle for to comforte the.
<pb facs="tcp:3639:143"/>
Salutation, peace, and good age be with the: and theire of the goddis and yll fortune be ſeperate fro me. Marke, my houſehold, wyfe, and chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſalute the as thyn own. And we ſalute all thy family as our owne. Thoughe the halfe of my letter be not of my hande, comforte the, for my harte is entirely thyne. Thou knoweſte howe I was gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly hurte in the warres of Dacye in my hande, and in moyſte wethers one of my fyngers ſlepeth. Thus I make an ende as always thyn owne.</p>

To eſchewe the enuious trauaylles of Rome, and to ſe certayne bokes of Hebrewe, that were broughte to me fro Helya, I came hyther to Sanya: I made great haaſte in my iournayes, howe be it at Salon the feuer toke me: and the .xx. day of Iune I receyued thy ſeconde letter, and the ſame houre the feuer quartayne toke me. I thynke none of vs bothe had the better hande. For neyther my longe letter dydde put away thy trauayle, nor thy ſhorte letter dyd put away my feuer. And though as nowe the felynge of thy trauaile miniſſheth that I had, the more brenneth the deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the. Therfore I wyll ſay ſome thinge to the, but not that I fynde any conſolation that thou haſte nede therof.

then herynge the conſolation of other. Thou ſayeſt in thy letter, that the cenſures are right rigorous in that realme: and therfore al that nation hath yll wyll with the ſenate. I beleue well they haue good occaſion therof: for diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red men make the miniſters of Iuſtice to be rigorous, and namely they of that yle. For there is an ancient prouerbe, that ſayth, lyghtly all theſe ylles ar yll, and the Siciliens worſt of all. Now adays the yll are mighty in their ylnes, and the good with their vertues are kepte ſo cloſe, that yf there be not ſome bridell by iuſtyce, the yll ſhuld poſſeſſe al the world, and the good ſhuld fynyſhe ſhortly.

I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle not of the humanities that the humain people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytteth: but I am aſhamed of the cruel ſentence that our Cenſures do, not as Romayns, but as cruell tyrantes.

I am ryght ſorowful, bycauſe that I haue chaſtyſed: and am glad bycauſe that I pardoned.

For that kynge hath more glorie in that mountayne beinge deade, than all the other had in all their lyues, with al their try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes, that euer they had in Rome. I ſay not, but that the wyckednes of yll people ſhulde be chaſtyſed: for with out compariſon, he is worſe that fauoureth the ylle, than he that commytteth the yl: for the one procedeth of weke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the other of malice. But it ſemeth to me, and to al other that be wiſe, that as the ſynne is natural, &amp; the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyſement voluntarie: ſo ought the rigour of Iuſtyce to be temperate, ſo that the miniſters ſhoulde ſhewe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion rather than vengeance: wherby the treſpaſſours ſhulde haue occaſyon to amende their ſynne paſſed, and not to reuenge the iniurie preſente.

And than ye Romayns ſhulde haue ſene as the Egiptiens dyd, howe our god alone may do moch more than al your goddis togyther. And certaynely as longe as we be ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo longe ye ſhall be our lordes.

Ye know what peace hath ben betwene Rome and Iudee, and betwene Iudee and Rome, we with you, and ye with vs. In all thynges we haue obeyed you, and ye vs. Noo iuſte thyng we haue denyed you. And bicauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge more deſyred of the people, and leſſe put in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than is peace, and there is nothynge more abhorred, by the whiche abhorynge euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyueth, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is warre: I do warn you of this with truth, prouyde therfore iuſtice, put them awaye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> folowe your wylles to do vs yl: And let vs haue no ſuche malycious folke, as intyſe vs to rebell. The greatteſte ſigne and ſtrongeſte pyller of peace is to put away the perturbers of peace. What profyte is to ſaye peace peace, &amp; in ſecrete to ſay warre warre? I ſay this bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye haue baniſhed the eldeſt ſon of king Idumeo out of Lyon for his demerites, and ye haue ſente in his ſtede Campanius, Marcus, Ruffus, and Valerius Graccus for preſidentes. They be .iiii. plages. or .iiii. peſtilences, ſo that the leaſt of them were ſufficiente to enpoyſon the hole empire of Rome, than moche ſoner our myſerable realme of Paleſtyne. What thynge can be more monſtrous, than that the iudges of Rome ſhuld ſende men to put away ylle cuſtomes fro them that be yll, and they them ſelfes are the

inuentours of newe vyces? What greatter ſhame and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience is in Iuſtice, than they that haue auctoritie to chaſtiſe wanton youth, to glorifie them ſelfe to be capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes of theym that be wylde? What greatter infamye can be in Rome, than they that ought to be vertuous and iuſte, to gyue example to other to be yll and vicious? I lye if they haue not ſo writhen and enlarged the diſciplyne of Iuſtyce, that they haue taught the youthe of Iude ſuche vyces, that haue not ben harde of by our fathers, nor red in no bokes, nor ſene in our tyme. O Romayns beleue me in one thynge, what counſelles Iude hath taken of Rome at this houre, lette Rome take of Iudee. Many realmes are gotten with myghty capitaynes, and moche ſhedyng of blode, and ought to be obſerued with a good iudge, not in ſhedynge of blode, but in gettynge of hartes. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the iudge that wynneth moo good wylles than money, ought to be beloued: and he that ſerueth for moneye, and loſeth the good wylles, for euer oughte to be abhorred as peſtylence. What thynke ye is the cauſe nowe adays, that your preſidentes be not obeyed in a iuſt cauſe? Of a trouth it is bycauſe, that fyrſte they commaunde vniuſt thinges.

Beleue me in one thynge, that of the great lyghtnes and ſmall ſadnes of the iuges, is bredde lytell feare and great ſhame in the ſubiectis. We that be iewes thynk our ſelfe wel aduertiſed by the mouth of our god that ſayth, Euery prynce commyttyng charge of Iuſtice to him that he ſeeth vnable to execute the ſame, or dothe not principally for Iuſtyce ſake accomplyſhe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyce, but dothe it for his owne profyte, or els to pleaſe the

And therfore they aduenture them ſelfe into the gulfes, &amp; inflame theyr lordes, that haue gyuen them ſuche offices, to gyue them to ſuche as haue deſerued them.

O what a ſeruyce ſhuldeſt thou doo to the goddis, &amp; what profyte to Rome, that for thre barkes ful of foles to ſende one lade with wyſe men? One thyng I wyl ſay, that with the bones of the wyſe men that yle is halowed, that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently were banyſſhed by the malyce and enuye of them of Rome: if thy ſmellynge wyttes be not loſt, as Italy ſtyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of them that be ſymple, ſoo that yle ſmelleth ſwete of wyſe men. Whan I came fro the warres of the Parthes, the .iiii. yere of myn empire, I paſſed into that yle by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſees to ſee the ſepulchres of ancient wyſe men: and in the citie of Dorbite in the myddes therof, lyeth Ouide, that was banyſhed by Auguſt: and vnder the mountayne Arpines is the ſepulchre of the renomed Armeno oratour banyſhed by Sylla: at the porte of Argonaut thou ſhalte fynde the bones of Colliodorus recapituler of the antyke lawes, that was banyſſhed by Nero the cruell: and in the felde of Elinos, vnder a marble, is the pouders of Syſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo Seteno, that was ſo wel lerned in the .vii. artes liberal, as though he had newe founde them, he was banyſhed by the Marians. I ſay for trouthe thou ſhalte fynde it thus, for with my knees I haue touched their ſepulchres. And all that ſeaſon my tender eyes were as fulle of water, as theyr bones were harde in the erthe. Theſe were not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhed for no vylanies that they had done: but it was the meryte of our forefathers, that they wolde be priuated fro the company of ſo noble barons: and we theyr chylderne fro the pouder of ſo renowmed ſages.

And more ouer, Centurion knoweth by wordes, the heuy caſe, that theſe priſoners had with vs, and we with them, the day of the feaſte of mother Berecyntia.

Rome, that neuer was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, by them that were valyant and vertuous, that daye we ſawe ouergone, and troden vnder foote, by thoſe foles. The walles of Rome, that were neuer touched by the Poe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niens, had that day their lowpes ful of armed trewandes: Rome that triumphed ouer al realmes, was triumphed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that day, with tomblers and iuglers.

And in this the goddis ſhall not be diſpleaſed, that ſythe Rome laugheth at theſe trewandies and mockeries, one day ſhe ſhal wepe, with theſe tomblers and iuglers. I banyſſhe all theſe for euer fro Rome, not for the bloudde that they haue ſhedde, but for the hartes, that they haue peruerted: not for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of any that be deed, but bicauſe they were maiſters of folies.

If the greatteſt gyfte, amonge all gyftes of fortune, be, to kepe a good wit, let no manne preſume, to be of a reſtfull vnderſtandynge, that is an extreme frende to theſe trewandes.

Seynge the emperours of Rome are ful of clemency to ſtraungers, it is no reaſon, that they ſhulde be to ſharpe to theyr owne.

               <p>¶I haue redde, that in the tyme of Alexander the great, there was a renoumed pirate or a rouer on the ſee, whiche robbed and drowned all ſhyppes, that he coude gette: and by commaundement of this good kynge Alexander, there was an army ſent forthe to take hym. And whan he was taken, and preſented to Alexander, the kyng ſayd to hym: Shewe me Dionides, why doſte thou kepe the ſee in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that no ſhyp can ſayle out of the eaſt into the weſte, for the? The Pyrate anſwered, and ſayd: If I kepe the ſee in daungier, why doſte thou Alexander, kepe all the ſee and lande as loſte? O Alexander, bycauſe I fyghte with one ſhyppe in the ſee, I am callyd a theefe, and bycauſe thou robbeſt with .ii.C. ſhyppes on the ſee, and troubleſt all the worlde with two .C. thouſande men, thou arte called an emperour. I ſweare to the Alexander, yf fortune were as fauourable to me, and the goddis as extreme ageinſt the: they wolde gyue me thyne empire, and gyue the my lyttel ſhyppe, and than peraduenture, I ſhuld be a better kynge than thou art, and thou a wors thefe than I am. ¶Theſe were high wordes, and well receyued of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and of trouth, to ſe if his wordes were correſpondent to his promyſes, he made hym from a pyrate to a great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitayne of an army: and he was more vertuous on land, than he was cruell on the ſee.</p>
               <p>¶I promyſe the Catulus, Alexander dyd right well ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and Dionides was to be prayſed gretly, for that he had ſayd. Now adays in Italy, they that robbe openly, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led lordes: and they that robbe priuely, ar called theues.</p>
               <p> ¶In the yere bokes of Liuius, I haue redde, that in the ſeconde troublous warre punyke, betwene the Romaynes and Carthaginens, there camme an ambaſſadoure Luſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, ſent fro Spayne, to treate for accorde of peace.
<pb facs="tcp:3639:153"/>
Whan he came to Rome, he proued before the ſenate, that ſythe he entred into Italye, he had ben .x. tymes robbed of his goodes, and whyles he was at Rome, he had ſene one of them that robbed hym, hange vp an other, that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended hym. He ſeinge ſoo ylle a dede, and howe the thefe was ſaued without Iuſtyce, as a deſperate manne, toke a cole, and wrote on the gybet as foloweth.</p>
               <p>¶O gybet, thou art made among theues, noriſhed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g theues, cut of theues, wrought of theues, made of theues, ſet among theues, and thou arte peopled with innocentis. ¶And there as I red theſe wordis, was in the original of Lyuius, and in his hiſtories. I ſwere to the by the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall goddis, that all the Decade was written with blacke ynke, and theſe wordes with redde vermylon. I canne not tell, what wordes I ſhulde ſende the, but that euery thing is ſo newe and ſo tender, and is ioyned with ſo yll ſyment, that I feare me, all wyll fall ſodeynly to the playne erthe. I tell the, that ſome are ſodaynly ryſen within Rome vnto valour, to whom I wyll rather aſſure their fall, than their lyfe. For all buyldynge haſtely made, can not be ſure. The longer a tree is kepte in his kynde, the longer it wyll be er it be olde. The trees, whoſe fruite we eate in ſommer, doo warme vs in wynter. O howe many haue we ſeene, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue meruayled of their ryſynge, and ben abaſſhed of their falles. They haue growen as a hole piece, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deynly waſted as a ſcomme. Their felicitie hath ben but a ſhort point, &amp; their infortune as a longe lyfe. Finally, they haue are died the myll, &amp; armed it with ſtones of encreace. and after a lyttell grindinge, left it in vtyle al the hole yere after. Thou knoweſt wel, my frend Catulus, that we haue ſene Cincius Fuluius in one yere made Conſule, and his chyldren tribunes, and his wyfe a matron for yonge may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and beſyde that, made keper of the capitol, and after
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3639:153"/>
that not in one yere but the ſame day we ſaw Cincius be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeded in the place, his chylderne drowned in Tybre, his wyfe banyſſhed froo Rome, his howſe raced downe to the grounde, and all his good confyſked to the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſourie. This rigorous example we haue not redde in any boke to take a copie of it, but we haue ſene it with our eies to kepe it in our myndes. As the nations of people ar va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, ſo are the condicions of men dyuers, and appetites of mortall folke: and me thynketh this is true, ſeing that ſome loue, ſome hate, and that that ſome ſeke, ſome eſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth: And that that ſome ſetteth lytel by, other make of. In ſuch wiſe that al can not be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with one thing, nor ſome with all thinges can not be ſatisfied. Let euery man chuſe as hym lyſt, and enbrace the worlde whan he wylle, I had rather mount a ſofte pace to the fallynge, and yf I can not come therto, I wyll abyde by the way, rather than with ſweatte to mount haſtily, and than to tumble downe heedlyng. In this caſe ſith mens hartes vnderſtand it, we nede not to write further with pennes. And of this matter regarde not the lyttell that I do ſaye, but the greate deale that I wyl ſay. And ſith I haue begon, and art in ſtrange landes, I wyll write the al the newes fro hens. This yere the .xxv. day of May, there came an ambaſſadour out of Aſie, ſayinge he was of the yle of Cetyn, a barone ryghte elegant of body, ruddy of aſpect, and right hardy of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. He conſidered being at Rome, though the ſommers dayes were longe, yet wynter wolde drawe on, and than wolde it be daungerous ſaylynge into his yle: and ſawe that his beſynes was not diſpatched: On a daye being at the gate of the ſenate, ſeinge all the Senatours entre in to the Capitolle, without any armour vpon them, he as a man of good ſpirite, and zelatour of his countreye, in the preſence of vs all, ſayd theſe wordes:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3639:154"/>¶O fathers conſcripte, O happy people, I am come fro a ſtraunge countreye to Rome, onely to ſee Rome, and I haue founde Rome without Rome: The walles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is incloſed, hath not broughte me hyther, but the fame of them that gouerne it. I am not come to ſe the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſourie, wherin is the treaſure of all realmes: but I am come to ſe the ſacred ſenate, out of the whyche iſſueth the counſell for al men. I came not to ſe you, bycauſe ye van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhe all other, but bycauſe I thought you more vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than all other. I dare well ſay one thinge, excepte the goddis make me blynd, and trouble myn vnderſtanding, ye be not Romayns of Rome, nor this is not Rome of the Romayns your predeceſſours. We haue harde in our yle, that dyuers realmes ben wonne by the valya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tnes of one, and conſerued by the wyſedome of all the ſenate: and at this houre ye are more lyke to be diſtroyed, than to wynne as your fathers dydde: all their exerciſe was in goodnes, and ye that are their chyldren, paſſe all your tyme in cery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. I ſay this ye Romayns, bycauſe ye haue almoſte kylde me with laughinge at you, to ſe howe ye doo all as moche your diligence to leaue your armure withoute the gate of the ſenate, as your predeceſſours dyd to take them to defende the empire. What profyte is it to you to leaue your armes for the ſureties of your perſonnes, and putte them on, wherwith ye ſlee all the worlde? What profiteth it to the thoughtfull ſuiter, that the ſenatour entreth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed into the ſenate without ſwerde or dagger: and his harte entreth into the ſenate armed with malyce? O Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, I wyll ye knowe, that in our yle we hold you not as armed Capitayns, but as malicious ſenators: not with ſharpe grounden ſwerdes &amp; daggers, but with hard har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis and venomous tongues ye feare vs. If ye ſhuld in the ſenate put on harnes, &amp; therwith take away your lyues, it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3639:154"/>
were but a ſmall loſſe, ſeinge that ye ſuſteyn not the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes, nor diſpatche not the buſineſſes of ſuters, I can not ſuffre it. I can not telle in what ſtate ye ſtande here at Rome: for in our ile we take armour from foles, whether your armours are take awaye as fro foles or madde fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, I wote not. If it be done for ambitiouſnes, it cometh not of Romaynes, but of tyrantes, that wranglers and ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful folke ſhuld not be iuges ouer the peaſible, &amp; the ambici<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous ouer the meke, and the malicious ouer the ſymple. If it be done bicauſe ye be foles, it is not in the law of the god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dis, that .iii.C. foles ſhuld gouerne .iii.C.M. wiſe men. It is a longe ſeaſon that I haue taried for myn aunſwere and licence, and by your madnes I am now farder of, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was the fyrſt day. We brynge oyle, hony, ſaffron, wood, and timber, ſalt, ſiluer, and gold out of our yle into Rome: and ye wyl that we go elles where to ſeke iuſtice. Ye wyll haue one lawe to gather your rentes, and an other to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyne our Iuſtices. ye wyl that we pay our tributes in one day, and ye wyll not diſcharge one of our errandes in a hole yere. I require you Romayns determine your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes to take away our lyues, and ſo we ſhal ende: or els here our complayntes, to thentent that we may ſerue you. For in an other maner it may be than ye know by heringe with your eares, which peraduenture ye wold not ſe with your eien. And if ye think my wordes be out of meſure: ſo that ye wyl remedy my contrey, I ſet not by my lyfe. And thus I make an ende. Verily frend Catulo theſe be the wordes, that he ſpake to the ſenate, whiche I gat in writing. I ſay of trouth, that the hardines, that the Romaynes were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to haue in other countres, the ſame as nowe ſtraungers haue in Rome. There were that ſayde, that this ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour ſhoulde be chaſtiſed, but the goddis forbyd: that for ſayinge trouth in my preſence, he ſhulde haue ben correct.
<pb facs="tcp:3639:155"/>
It is inough and to moch to, to ſuffre theſe euyls, though we ſlee nor perſecute thoſe that aduertyſe and warne vs of them. The ſhepe ar not in ſuretie of the wolfe, but if the ſhepard haue his dogge with him. I mene, dogges ought not to leaue barkynge for to awake the ſhepardes. There is no god commaundeth, nor lawe counſayleth, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welthe ſuffreth, that they whiche are commytted to chaſtyſe lyers, ſhuld hang them that ſay trouth. And ſith the ſenatours ſhewe them ſelfe men in their lyuinge, and ſometyme more humayne than other that be ſlaues, who elles ſhulde delyuer them fro chaſtiſement? O Rome and no Rome, hauyng nothyng but the name of Rome, where is nowe become the noblenes of thy triumphes, the glorie of chy chyldren, the rectitude of thy Iuſtice, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of thy temples? for as nowe they chaſtiſe hym more that murmureth agaynſte one only Senatour, than they do them that blaſpheme al the goddes at ones. For it gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me more to ſe a Senatour or cenſure to be worſte of all other, than it diſpleaſeth me, that it ſhuld be ſaid, that he is the beſt of all other. For a trouthe I ſaye to the my frende Catulus, that as nowe we nede not to ſeke to the goddes in the temples, for the Senatours are made god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in our handes. This is the difference betwene theym that ben immortall, and they that be mortall. For the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis neuer do thynge that is yll, and the Senatours doo neuer good thynge: the goddes neuer lye, and they neuer ſay trouthe: the goddis pardon often, and they neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyue: the goddis are content to be honoured .v. tymes in the yere, and the Senatours wolde be honoured .x. tymes a day. What wylt thou that I ſhulde ſay more? but what ſo euer the goddes do, they ought to be prayſed: and the ſenatours in all theyr workes deſerue to be reproued. Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally I conclude, that the goddis aſſure and affirme eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3639:155"/>
thynge, and they erre and fayle in nothynge: and the ſenatours aſſure nothynge, but erre in all thynges: onely for one thynge the ſenatours are not of reaſone to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyſed: and that is, whan they intende not to amend theyr fautes, they wylle not ſuffre the oratours to waſte theyr tyme to ſhewe them the trouth. Be it as maye be, I am of the opinion, that what man or woman, withdraweth their eares fro heryng of trouth, impoſſible it is for them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye theyr hartes to loue any vertues: Be it cenſure that iugeth, or ſenatour that ordeyneth, or emperour that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth, or conſule that executethe, or oratour that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. No mortall man, take he neuer ſo good hede to his werkes, nor reaſon ſo well in his deſires, but that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth ſome chaſtiſement for ſome cauſe or counſaylle in his doinges. And ſith I haue written to the thus of other, I wyll ſomwhat ſpeake of my ſelfe, bycauſe of the wordes of thy letter. I haue gathered, that thou deſireſt to knowe of my perſonne. Knowe thou for certayne, that in the ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendes of Ianuarye I was made cenſure in the ſenate, the whiche offyce I deſired not, nor I haue not deſerued it. The opynion of all wyſe men is, that noo manne, without he lacke wytte, or ſurmounteth in foly, wyll gladdely take on hym the burden and charges of other menne: A great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſe it is for a ſhamefaſte man to take on hym an office to pleaſe euerye man, for he muſte ſhewe a countenaunce outwarde, contrarye to that he thynketh inwarde. Thou wylte ſaye, that the good are ordeyned to take the charge of offices. O vnhappye Rome, that hathe wylled to take me in ſuche wyſe, as to be the beſte in it. Greuous peſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ought to come for them that be good, ſith I am ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as good amonge the yll. I haue accepted this offyce, not for that I had any nede therof, but to ſatisfie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyres of my wyfe Fauſtine, and to fulfyll the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:3639:156"/>
of Anthonius my grauntfather. Haue no meruayle of any thynge that I do, but of that I leaue to be doone. For any man that is wedded to Fauſtyne, there is no vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany but he ſhal do it. I ſwere to the, that ſith the daye we were wedded, me ſemethe that I haue no wytte. I leaue weddynge for this tyme, and retourne to ſpeake of offices. Surely a peaſible man ought to be in offices, thoughe it be peynefull: for as the offyces are aſſured amonge theym that be vertuous, ſo perillouſly gothe the vertuous folke amonge offices. And for the trouthe hereof recken what they wynne, and than thou ſhalt ſe what they loſe. Saye that is good, if thou knoweſt it, and here the yl, if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre to knowe it. He that wyll take the charge to gouerne other, he ſeketh thought and trouble for hym ſelfe, enuye for his neyghbours, ſpourres for his ennemies, pouertie for his ryches, awakynge of theues, peryl for his body, an ende of his dayes, and tourmente for his good renoume. Fynally he ſeketh awaye to reiecte his frendes, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to recouer his ennemies. O an vnhappy man is he, that taketh on hym the charge of chyldren of manye mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for he ſhalbe always charged with thoughtes, how he ſhulde content them all: ful of ſighes bycauſe one hath to gyue hym: feare that one ſhulde take fro hym, wepyng if he leſe, and ſuſpection that they infame hym. He that knoweth this, without longe tarienge ought to ſette a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del at his heed. But I ſaye of one, as I ſaye of an other. For I wyll ſwere, and thou wylt not deny it, that we may finde ſome nowe adays, that had rather be in the parke to fight ayenſt the bulles, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be in ſuretie vpon the ſcaffold. Oftentimes I haue hard ſay: Go we to the Theatres to renne at the bulles: go we to chaſe the hartes and wylde boores: and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come there, they renne away, not the beſtes fro them, but they fro the beaſtes. In ſuche wyſe as
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3639:156"/>
they went runnyng, they returne agein fleinge. I ſay theſe ambicious perſones procure to gouerne: &amp; are gouerned: they commaund, and are commaunded, they rule and are ruled: and finally thinkynge to haue dyuers vnder theyr handes, theſe wretches put them ſelues vnder euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fote. For the remedy of all theſe perylles my thoughte is comforted with one thing, and that is without procuryng or offeryng my ſelfe, the ſenate of their owne wylle hathe commaunded me. In the .viii. table of our ancient lawes be theſe wordes. We commaunde that in our ſacred ſenate charge of iuſtyce be neuer giuen to him that wyllingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth hym ſelfe to it, but to ſuch as by rype deliberation be choſen. This is certainely a iuſte lawe. For men nowe be not ſo vertuous nor ſo louinge to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wyl forget their owne quietnes and reſt, doing domage to them ſelfe, to ꝓcure an other mans profite. There is none ſo folyſhe, that wyl leue his wife, childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; his owne ſwete countrey, to go into ſtrange countreis, but if he ſe him ſelf amonge ſtrange people, thinkyng vnder the colour of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to ſeke for his own vtilitie. I ſay not this without we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pyng, that the princis with their ſmalle ſtudy &amp; thought, &amp; the iuges with their couetyſe, haue vndermyned &amp; ſhaken down the high walles of the policie of Rome. O my frend Catulus, what wylte thou that I ſhulde ſay, but that our crede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſo miniſheth, our couetiſe ſo largely ſtretcheth, our hardines ſo boldeth, our ſhamfaſtnes ſo ſhameles, that we prouide for iuges to go &amp; robbe our neyghbours as capy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayns ageinſt our ennemies? I lette the to wyte, where as Rome was beloued for chaſtiſing the yl, nowe it is as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hated for diſpoylyng of innocentes. I do remembre, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I red, in the tyme of Denis Syracuſan, that ruled al Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, there came an ambaſſadour fro Rhodes to Rome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge of a good age, welle lerned, and valyaunt in armes,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:157"/>
and ryght curious to regarde euerye thynge. He came to Rome to ſe the maieſtie of the ſacred ſenate: the height of the high capitol enuironned with the Colliſet: the multy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſenatours: the wyſedome of the counſaylours, the glorie of triumphes: the correction of the yll, the peace of the inhabytauntes, the diuerſitie of nations: the haboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the mayntenaunce, the order of the offyces, and finally ſeinge that Rome was Rome, he was demaunded howe he ſemed therby: He anſwered and ſayde, O Rome in this thy preſent worlde, thou arte fulle of vertues and wyſe men, hereafter thou ſhalt be furniſhed with foles. Lo what high and very high wordes were theſe? Rome was vi.C. yeres without nycetie of howſes of foles, and now it hath ben .iii.C. yeres without one wyſe or vertuous. Loke what I ſay, it is no mockery but of trouthe, If the pitiefull goddis nowe adayes dyd reyſe our predeceſſours fro dethe to lyfe, eyther they wold not knowe vs for their chylderne, or elles attache vs for fooles. Theſe be thinges vſed in Rome, but thou ſendeſt noo worde of that is vſed in Agrippine. I wyll write nothynge to the, to put the to peyne: write to me ſome thynge to reioyce me, if thy wife Dynſilla chanced well of the flote that came out of Cetin with ſalte, oyle, and honye, I cauſed hit to be well proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for her. Wyte thou, that Flodius our vncle was caſte downe by rage of his hors, and is deceaſſed. Laertia and Collodius are frendes togyther, by occaſyon of a mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. I do ſend the a gowne, I pray to the goddis to ſende the ioy therof. My wife Fauſtin ſaluteth the. Reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende me to Iamyro thy ſonne.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Arke oratour lerninge at Rodes the arte of humanite, to you amorous ladies of Rome ſalutation to your perſones, and amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your deſyred lyfe. It is writen to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that at the feaſte of the mother of the goddes Berecynthia, all ye togyther there preſent played, and geſted on me: wherin ye layde for an example my lyfe and my renoume. It is ſhewed me, that Auilina compoſed it, Lucia Fulua wrote it, and thy ſelfe Toringula dyd ſinge it, and ye all together dyd preſent it to the Theatre: ye haue portrayed and paynted me in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers maners, with a boke in my hande, tourned contrary, as a fayned philoſopher: with a tongue alonge, as a bold ſpeker without meaſure: with a horne on my heed, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cuckolde: with a nettell in my hande, as a trembling louer: with a baner fallen downe, as a cowarde capitayn: with halfe a berde, as a femynate man: with a clothe afore myne eies, as a condempned vacabound: and yet not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this, but the other day ye portrayed me in a new maner. Ye made my figure with fete of ſtraw, my legges of ambre, my knees of wod, the thyghes of braſſe, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye of horne, the armes of pytche, the handes of mace, the heed of yeſſo, the eares of an aſſe, the eies of a ſerpente, the heares as rotes iagged, the tethe of a catte, the tonge of a ſcorpion, and the foreheed of leade: wherin was wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in two lynes theſe letters, <hi>M, N, T, N, I, S, V, S,</hi> the whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che meneth (as I do take it) The mortall man taketh not the ſtatute ſo ſtrange, as the doublenes of the lyfe: &amp; than ye went to the ryuer, and therin tyed his heed dounwarde

a hole day. And if the lady Meſſalyn had not ben, I think it had ben tyed there tyll nowe. And nowe ye amorous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes haue written to me a letter by Fuluius Fabritius, wherof I receiued no peyn, but as an amorous man, from the handes of ladyes I take it as a mockerie. And to then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente that I ſhulde haue no tyme for to thynke theron, ye ſende to wyt a queſtion of me, that is: if I haue founde in my writynges, wherof, by whom, where, whan, what, and howe the fyrſte women were made. And bycauſe my complexion is to take mockes for mockynges, and ſyth ye demaunde it, I ſhall ſhewe it: you and your frendes and myne, and ſpecially Fuluius your meſſager hath deſired me therto. There is nothyng wherof I complayne, but I wyll holde my peace, ſaue to your letter and demaunde I wyll anſwere. And ſith there hath ben none for to aſke the queſtion, I proteſt that to none other, but to you amorous women of Rome, I ſende myn anſwere. And if any other honeſt lady wyll take the demaunde of you, it is a token that ſhe hathe enuy of the office that ye be of. Certaynly if any lady ſheweth her ſelfe annoyed with your peyne open<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, fro henſforthe I condempne her, that ſhe kepe no faut that ſhe knoweth in ſecrete. They that be on the ſtage, fere not the roringe of the bulle: and he that is in a dongeon, feareth not the ſhotte of artillerie. I wyl ſaye, a woman of good lyfe, feareth no man with an yll tongue. The good Matrones may kepe me for their perpetuall ſeruant, and they that be yll for their chiefe ennemie. Nowe to anſwere the queſtion, to knowe werof the fyrſt women were made: I ſay that accordynge to the dyuerſitie of nations, that be in the worlde, dyuers opynions I fynde in this caſe. The Egiptiens ſaye, that whan the flode of Nyle ranne abrode, and watred the erth, there abode certayne pieces of erthe cleuynge to gether lyke greace, and thanne the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3639:158"/>
heate commynge in them created many wyld beaſtes: and ſo amonge them was founde the fyrſte woman. Note ye ladies, that it was neceſſarie, that the flode of Nyle ſhuld flowe ouer his brimmes, that the firſt woman myghte be made on the erthe. All creatures are bredde in the entrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of their mothers, excepte the woman that was bredde without a mother. And this ſemeth true, that without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ye were borne, bicauſe without rule ye lyue, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order ye dye. Verily he putteth him ſelfe to many tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayles, and hath many wyles to fynde, and many times to thynke, and to aſke many ſuccours, and to abyde many yeres, and to chuſe amonge many women, that wyll rule one onely wyfe by reaſon. Be the beaſtes neuer ſoo cruelle and fierce, at the laſte the lyon is ledde of his keper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any bande: The bulle is cloſed in the parke: the bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell ruleth the hors, a lyttell hooke catcheth the fyſhe, and the wolfe ſuffreth to be tyed: onely a woman is a beaſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be tamed, and neuer leſeth her boldnes for any thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that is commaunded her, nor the bridell, for not being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. The goddis haue made men as men, and beeſtis as beaſtis, and the humayne vnderſtandynge very high, and his ſtrength of a great power: but yet is there no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be he neuer ſo high, that ſhal ſcape the woman lyghtly, nor defende hym be he neuer ſo ſtronge. But I ſaye to you my ladies: There is no ſpurres that can make you goo, nor raynes that can holde you, nor brydelle that can refrayne you, nor angle or net that can take you: and fynally there is no law can ſubdue you, nor ſhame refrain you, nor feare abaſſhe you, nor chaſtyſemente amende you. O to what an yll aduenture putteth he hym ſelfe, that thynkethe to rule and correcte you. For if ye take an opynion in hande, all the worlde ſhall not drawe you from it: yf a man telle or warne you of any thynge, ye wylle neuer beleue hym:
<pb facs="tcp:3639:159"/>
If one gyue you good counſell, ye wyll not take it: if one threaten you, anone ye complayne: if one flatter you, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye waxe proude: if one reioyce not in you, ye are ſpitefull: if one forbeare you, it maketh you bolde: if ye be chaſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ye tourne to ſerpentes: Fynally a woman wyll neuer forgyue any iniurie, nor gyue thanke for any good dede. Nowe adayes the moſte ſymple of all women, I ſweare, wyll ſweare, that ſhe knoweth leſſe than ſhe dothe: and of trouthe the mooſte wyſeſt mans wytte ſhall fayle in their reaſons: and yet the wyſeſt of theym ſwarueth frome all wyſedom. Wyll ye know my ladyes, howe lytle ye knowe, and howe moche ye be ignorant? That is, ye determyne ſodenly in harde thynges of grauitie, as if ye had ſtudied for it a. M. yeres: and if any gayneſay you, ye take hym as a mortall enmy. Hardy is that woman, that dare gyue counſell to a man, but he is more hardier that taketh it of a woman. But I ſay he is a fole that taketh it, and he more foole that aſketh it, and he is moche more folyſhe that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fylleth it. Myn opinion is, that he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wyll not falle amonge ſo many ſtones, nor pricke him amonge ſo many thornes, nor blyſter hym amonge ſoo many nettyls, lette hym here what I wyll ſay, and doo as ye ſhall ſee: ſpeake welle and worke yll: In promyſinge promyſe moche, In fulfyllyng fulfyll nothynge, and fynallye allowe your wordes, and condemne your counſelles. If one ſhulde demande nowe adayes of dyuers ryght renoumed perſonnes, that benne deed, howe they dydde with the counſelle of women whan they lyued: I am ſure they wold not haue ryſen than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue them, nor at this houre to be reuyued agayne to here them. Howe was kyng Philip of Macedon with Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias? Parys with Helayne? Alexander with Roſane? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas with Dydo? Hercules with Deyanira? Hanyball with Thamyra? Nero with Agrippine? And if ye wyl not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3639:159"/>
beleue what they ſuffred with them, demande of me howe I do amonge other. O ye women, I remembryng that I am borne of one of you, abhorre my lyfe: and I, thinkyng that I lyue with you, deſyre deathe. For there is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deathe as to treate with you, and no better lyfe than to flee fro you. It is a common ſayinge amonge women, that we men be vnkynde, bycauſe we beinge borne in your entrayles, do entreate you as bond women and ſeruantis: and ye ſay, ſyth ye beare vs with peryll, and nouriſſhe vs with trauayle, that it were conuenient and iuſt that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhulde be occupied in your ſeruyces. Oftentymes I haue ſtudied, why men deſyre women ſo moche. There is no eyes, but they oughte to wepe, no harte but it ſhoulde breake, no ſpirite but it ſhulde be ſorowfull to ſe a wyſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loſte by a foolyſhe woman. The foolyſhe louer paſſeth the day to ſatisfie his ſyght, the darke nyghte to tomble with vayne thoughtes: one day heryng tidynges, an other day he offereth ſeruice: one tyme louynge darkenes, an other tyme he hateth lyght: he dyeth with company, and lyueth ſolytarie: and finally the poore foolyſhe louer may that he wyl not, and wylleth that he may not. More ouer the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of his frendes profiteth hym not, nor the ſhame of his enmies, nor loſſe of his goodes, nor the aduenture of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor looſynge of his lyfe, nor ſekynge of deathe, nor comynge nere, nor goinge ferre, nor ſeinge with eyes, nor herynge with eares, nor taſtyng with mouthe, nor yet fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge of hande: and finally to attayne vyctorie, he hathe alway warre agaynſt him ſelfe. I wold theſe louers knew fro whens loue procedeth, it is this: The entrayles that we are bredde in, is of fleſhe: the breſtes that we ſucke, are of fleſhe: the armes that we are nouriſhed in, be of fleſhe: the werkes that we doo, are of the fleſhe, by the which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions commeth the repeale of our fleſhe to their fleſſhe.
<pb facs="tcp:3639:160"/>
Many free hartes falle into the ſnares of loue. It ſemeth well my ladies, that ye are brought vp in puddels, as the Egiptie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſay: The puddels kepe no clere water to drinke, nor fruite to eate, nor fyſhe to be taken, nor veſſell to ſayle with: I do ſay ye are fowle in your lyuynge, ſhamefull in your perſons, in aduerſytie feble and lethy, in proſperitie ſubtyll and wyly: falſe in wordes, doubtfull in your wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes: In hatynge ye kepe a diſorder, extreme to loue, aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricious to gyue, vnſhamfaſte to take: and I ſaye ye are a receite of feare, where as wyſe men finde perille, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple men ſuffre. In you wiſe men holde their renomes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alowed, and the ſymple men their lyfe in penury. ¶Let vs leaue the opinyon of the Egyptiens, and come to the Grekes, whiche ſay, that in the deſertes of Arabye the ſonne ſhyneth moſte hote: and they ſay, that at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge there appered a woman alone with a byrde cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Phenyx, the whyche byrde they ſay, was created of the water, and the woman of the great heate of the ſonne, and of the corruption of the powdre that falleth fro the trees, whiche the wormes do eate. In this wyſe there was a tree ſoore eaten with wormes, and it chaunced by heate of the ſonne, and dryth of the powder, that a fyre kendled, and ſoo brente it: and than of the fyre and powder of the ſayd brent tree, the fyrſte woman was made. And though I be a philoſopher Romayne, I wyll not ſay, that the opinyon of the philoſopher greke was yll. For of truthe ye ladyes that be amorous, haue your tonges of the nature of fyre, &amp; your condicions of the rottennes of the pouder of wood. After the diuerſite of beeſtis, nature hath put ſome ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth in dyuers partis of their bodyes, as the egle in the beake, the vnicorne in the horne, the ſerpent in the tayle, the bull in the heed, the beare in the armes, the hors in the breſt, the dogge in his tethe, the hogge in the groyne, the wod doue
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3639:160"/>
in her wynges, and women in their tonges. Of trouth the flyghte of the wood doue is not ſo highe as the fantaſie of your folyes, nor the catte ſcratcheth not ſo ſoore with her nayles, as ye ſcratche foles with your importunities: nor the dogge hurteth not them, that he renneth at, as ye doo the ſorowfull louer that ſeruethe you: nor he is not in ſoo greatte perill of his lyfe that catcheth the bulle by the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as the good fame of the louer is that falleth into your handes. And finally the ſerpent hath not ſo moche poyſon in his tayle, as ye haue in your tongues. Set all the good Romayne ladyes apart: for there be many, of whom there is no complaynt of their perſones, nor ſuſpection of their good names. Of all ſuche my letter ſpeketh not, nor my penne writeth not of them, but of other: I ſpeake of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that be ſuche, that all venemous beaſtes haue not ſo moch poyſon in their bodies, as they haue in their tonges. And ſith that the goddis haue commaunded, and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenies do permyt, that the lyfe of men can not paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out women: therfore I aduertyſe theſe yonge people, and pray them that be olde, and awake wyſe men, and tech the ſymple, to flee away from women of yl name, rather than from a comon peſtilence.</p>
               <p>¶Redynge the auncient lawes of Plato, I fynde writen thus: we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al women ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly infamed, be ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly put out of the citie, to thente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that other ſeing their ſinnes not vnpuniſhed, may abhorre the ſinne for feare to fal into the ſame peyne. Alſo the ſame lawe ſayth: We command, that pardon be giuen to a woman of all the fautes commytted by her owne body, if any amendement be ſene in her: but neuer to pardon theym that haue commytted ſynne with their tonges. For commyttynge ſynne with an yl perſone, is of fragilitie, but with the tongue it is of pure malyce. ¶O diuine Plato, maſter &amp; meaſure of al vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding,
<pb facs="tcp:3639:161"/>
and prince of all philoſophers, whanne thou madeſte that lawe in the golden world, that there was neuer ſuch ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of yll women, and ſo great aboundance of good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Grece. What ſhall we doo nowe in Rome, where there be ſo many ylle openly, amd ſo fewe good in ſecrete? Naturally they were wonte to be ſhamefaſte in theyr vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, temperate in wordes, wyſe of wyt, ſobre in goinge, meke in conuerſation, pitiefull in correction, well regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge their lyuynge, not kepynge companies, ſtedfaſte in promeſſe, and conſtant in loue. Fynally let not the woman that wyll be good, truſte in the wiſedome of wiſe men, nor in the flatterie of lyghte folkes: But lette her vertuouſly regarde her renoume, and beware alwayes of any manne that maketh her any promys. For after that the flames of Venus be ſet on fire, and Cupide hath ſhot his arrowes, the ryche man offereth all that he hath, the poore man all that he may, the wyſe man ſayth he wyll be her great fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and the ſymple alway her ſeruaunt: the wyſe man wyl loſe his lyfe for her, and the foole wyll take his deathe for her. The olde man wyl ſay, he wyl be frend to her frendes: and the yong man wyl ſay, he wyl be ennemie to her enemies. Some wil promys to pay her debtes, and other to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge her iniuries. Fynally to hyde their pouertie, and to ſhewe their beautie, they leaue theſe fooles loſing their perſones and good fames. I wille leaue to ſpeake of good women, for it is not myn intent to laye any thynge to theyr charge, but to aduertyſe them well. I demaunde of you amorous ladies, if Platon was there, whan ye made a playe of my lyfe, and drewe my fygure about in Rome? No ſurely, in dede by that I ſe in you at this tyme, it is ſuſpecious that is ſayde of other. For there is but a fewe in Rome, whom Plato and his lawe dothe excuſe. One thynge ye can not deny, if I were the worſte of all menne, at the laſte ye haue
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3639:161"/>
founde the ende of my vilanies. And ye can not denye me, but ſhe that is leaſte yll of you, in all my lyfe I coude not ſhewe the malyce of her lyfe. It is greatte peryll to wyſe women, to be neyghbours to fooles: Great peryll it is to them that be ſhamefaſt, to be with them that be ſhameles: great peryl it is to them that be of a meke and ſtyll maner, to be with them that be bolde and rude: great perylle it is for them that be chaſte, to be with them that lyue in auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: great peryll it is for the honourable, to be with them that be diſfamed. For the women defamed, thinke that all other be defamed, and deſyre that they ſhulde be defamed, and procure to haue them defamed: and ſay they be yll fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And to thentent to couer theyr owne infamy, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame all other that be good. O you ladyes in amours, it is longe ſyth ye knew me and I you: and if ye ſpeke, I ſpeke, if ye knowe, I knowe: if ye be ſtyll, I am ſtyll: if ye ſpeke openly, I wyl not ſpeke in ſecret. Thou knoweſt wel Aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, that made the ieſte, how Eumedes ſolde calues deter in the boucherie, than thou ſoldeſt the innocent vyrgins in thy houſe. Thou knoweſt wel Turinga, that one day thou recknedſt all thy louers, but thou coudeſt not recken them on thy fyngers, but deſyredſt to haue a buſhell full of pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And thou Lucia Fuluia knoweſt welle, whan thou were, thou woteſt where, with Breto, and madeſt peace with thy huſbande, thou tokeſt hym a ſyde, and ſaydeſte, but if thou myghteſt lye out of thy houſe ones a weeke, he ſhuld not lye in the houſe. And thou Retoria knoweſt wel, that in thy yonge dayes, two yeres thou were appoynted on the ſee with a Pyrate, ſo that he ſhulde take no moo to ſatisfie a. C. men of warre in the galey. Thou Egna Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia knoweſt well, that whan the cenſure entred to take the, he founde .v. mens gownes, in which thou wenteſt euer by nyght: &amp; thou haddeſt but one womans gowne, that thou

And thou Camil kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt well, not beinge content with thyn owne nation, but by reaſon of the great hauntynge that thou haddeſt with ſtraungers, thou canſt ſpeake all maner of languages. I wyl marke them that haue marked me, &amp; hurte theym that haue hurte me, perſecute theym that haue perſecuted me, and infame them that haue infamed me: All other my pen doth pardon, bicauſe they haue perdoned me in their play. And bycauſe my letter hath begonne in that ye haue done to my perſon, therfore I wyl end it in that it feleth of your good names. And thus I conclude, that a man may ſcape free fro all domages, with abſteynynge fro them: But fro women there is no way, but to fle fro them. Thus I ende and demaunde of the goddis, that I may ſee of you, as ye deſyre to ſe of me. And ſythe ye be louers, I counſell you as ye haue ſent me your ieſte for a mocke, in lykewyſe for a mocke to receyue the anſwere.

I of my wyll, and thou bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou canſte do no more, we haue giuen vs to be free of our pleaſures, I thinke as wel as to make a deuorſe of our enmies. But ſuche as ye be, ſo ye do, banyſhementes of amours, and treaſures of paſſions. The loue of you al ought to be digeſted with pylles: but the paſſion of one of you wyll not be oppreſſed with al the Rubarbe in Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie. Ye ſhewe your ſelfe cruell to pardon an ennemy, and euery day light to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge louers. Curiouſly I haue kepte you al the whyle that delytes ouerpreſſed my youth: yet I coude neuer ſe in any woman no certayntie, nor reaſon in loue, but hate at the laſt. Thy preſent lightnes quarelleth with my youthe paſt: and it is bycauſe thou ſeeſt not in me the auncient will towarde the, nor the preſent ſeruice. And certaynly herynge thyn accuſation, and not my iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as iuſtly thou paieſt me with deth, as I paie the with forgetfulnes: The whiche forgettynge is as ſtraunge to be in him that ſerueth, as vngentilnes in the ladye that is ſerued. Thinkeſt thou, that I haue forgotten the lawe of Venus, where as it commandeth, that the curious louers ſhuld exerciſe their ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthes in armes, and occupie theyr hartes in loue? and alſo that their apparell be very clene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their fete well compaſſed, their bodies ſtedfaſt and not waueryng, their voyces lowe and ſofte, and ſadde in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

yet my ſpirite hathe not forgotten the art. Thou complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, bicauſe I gyue my ſelfe to reſt, &amp; that I haue greatly forgotten the. I wyll not deny the trouthe: the day of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gettynge maketh the muſter of my thoughtes, and reaſon whiche is prouiſour declareth, that it is not to my grauite to permyt, that I ſhuld loue, nor thy age to ſuffre to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued.

Whan I kepte the Cautons, I ietted in the ſtretes, I ſange balades, I gaſed to the wyndowes, I played on inſtrumentes, I ſcaled the walles, I wakened lyght per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: thinkeſt thou, that I wyſt what I dyd in my youth? and nowe that I ſe my ſelfe promoted fro theſe pleaſures, and decked with ſoo many whyte heares, and apparayled with ſoo many dolours, I thynke nowe, I was not than, or elles I dreame as nowe, not knowynge the wayes that I haue gone, not ſeinge the wayes full of ſtones, I haue fallen ere I was ware, I haue fallen in ſnares: ſeking no guyde, I was entred into the whirlepoole: and by the groſſenes of my boldnes, I was loſt, and therfore I haue deſerued pardon. And nowe that I am out of the thornes and buſhes, thou woldeſt haue me farther in than euer I was. And now that I can not take the purgations, thou offereſte to me ſyropes.

And whan I thynke thus, I take the letter agayne out of my boſom, &amp; beholde the ſeale, doubtynge if it be thy letter or not. Thou altereſt my pulces and felynges of my hart, &amp; the colour of my face chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth, imageninge, that either ſhame ſurmounteth in the, or elles grauitie fayleth in me. For ſuche lyghtnes ſhuld not be beleued, but of lyke light perſones. Thou knoweſt well, he that dothe yll, meriteth peyn ſoner than he that doth infamy.

I knowe there is no truſt in youth, nor hope in age. Thou complayneſte, that thou haſte nothynge. That is an olde quarell of the amorous ladies of Rome, whiche takynge all, ſay they haue nothynge: and that ye lacke of credence, ye do fulfylle with money.

Art thou not aduiſed, that I banyſhed my neceſſitie in the londe of forgetfulnes, and dyd ſet vp thy wyll for the requeſt of my ſeruice. In wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I went all bare, and in ſommer charged with clothes, I went on fote in the myre, and rode in the faire way: wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was heuy, I laughed: and whan I was mery, I wept.

Whan thou haddeſt nede of any thynge, I was fayne to robbe my father for it.

And thynke, that though we wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be weake, and our bodies ſone ouercome, yet wyte it for certayne, that our hartes are neuer vanquyſhed. Thou ſayeſt, that ſcapyng from a battayle thou dyddeſt receyue my letter, wherof thou were ſoore abaſhed. It is a very common thyng to theym that be weke and ſlacke, to ſpeke of loue, wanton fooles to treate of bokes, and to cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to babble of armes: I ſay it, bycauſe the anſwerynge to a letter was not of neceſſitie to reherſe to a woman as I am, whether it were before the battayle or after. I know well, thou art ſcaped fro it, for thou were not the firſt that fought, nor the laſte that fled. Whan thou were yonge, I neuer ſawe the go to the warre, that euer I dredde or had ſuſpecte of thy lyfe: for knowyng thy cowardyſe, I neuer toke care for thyne abſence, for therin I was mooſte ſure of thy perſone.

Thou ſayeſt, that takynge my letter into thy handes, thy harte toke the poyſon of malyce.

For one venyme oftentymes dyſtroyeth an other venym.

Great is the loue of the countrey, ſith that many leaue dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers welthes that they haue in ſtraunge landes, and lyue ſtraitly, for to lyue in their owne lande: but greatter is my loue, ſyth that I wolde leaue Rome with al the pleaſures, to go and ſerche for the in ſtrange landes among the cruel battayles. O malicious Marke, O ſtraunge louer, yf I leaue Rome, it were to go and ſeke my harte beynge in the battayles with the. And certaynly dyuers tymes whanne I doo thynke on thyne abſence, I ſwowne and ſorowe as my hart were not with me, and yet I fynde no perfyte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. I thynke our loue is not lyke theſe beaſtes, that ioy of their pleaſures, without to wyll, and deſyre theyr wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. I ſweare to the by the goddeſſe Veſta, and by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Berecinthia, that thou oweſt me more for one day of loue, that I haue had to the, than for the ſeruyces that I haue done to the in .xxii. yeres. Beholde vnhappy Marc, howe moche in thy preſence I haue always regarded the, and in thyn abſence I haue alwayes thoughte on the, and ſlepynge I haue alwayes dreamed of the, I haue wepte for thy trauayle, and laughed at thy pleaſure, and finally all my welthe I haue wyſhed the, and al thyn ylles I haue wyſhed me. I enſure the one thynge, that as nowe I fele not ſoo moche the perſecution that thou doeſt to me, as I do the mysknowlege that thou makeſt to me. It is a great ſorowe for an auaricious man to ſee his goodes loſte, but without comparyſon it is farre greatter for the louer to ſe his loue yll beſtowed. It is a hurt that is alway ſoore, &amp; a peyn alway peynful, a ſorow alway ſorowful, &amp; it is a deth
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3639:166"/>
that neuer endeth. O ye men, if ye knewe with what loue women loueth you in perfytenes whan they loue, &amp; with what harte they hate whan they are ſet to hate: I ſwere to you, ye wold neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in loue: or if ye do loue them, ye wold neuer leue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for feare of their hate: &amp; there is neuer gret hate, but where as moch loue was fyrſt. But thou ſhalt neuer be gretly hatid, for thou were neuer truly loued of ladies. The ſorowfull Boemia hath loued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .xxii. yere of her lyfe, &amp; now ſhe only hateth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyl after her deth. Thou ſayeſt, I may be eaten for veriuyce, and yet I wold be ſolde for wyne. I knowe wel I haue erred, as one that hath ben yonge and lyght, and whan I perceyued that I had loſte my way, and that my myſaduenture can fynd no way nor remedy: It is the greateſt loſſe of al loſſes, whan there is no remedy. I haue erred lyke a feble and a weake woman, but thou haſt erred as a ſtronge man: I haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſimple ignorance, but thou haſte erred of a prepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and wilfull malice: I haue erred, not knowinge that I ſhulde haue erred, but thou kneweſt what thou diddeſt: I haue truſted to thy wordes, as to a faythfull gentylle man, and thou haſte begyled me with a thouſande leſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as a lier.

Diddeſt thou not ſweare to be my huſbaunde, and than withdreweſt thy hande as a falſe aduoultrer? Doeſt thou not knowe, that thou neuer foundeſt villanie in my perſonne, nor I neuer founde trouthe in thy mouthe? At leaſt thou canſt not denie, but thou haſt offended the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, and arte infamed of men, &amp; odious to the Romaynes, ſclaundred of good folkes, and example to the yll folkes,

Thou dydſt eate me beinge grene. I promyſe the it hathe ſette thy tethe on an yl edge. Thou ſayeſte, I ryped by power of heate and ſtrawe. It diſpleaſeth me not ſo moche, that thou ſayeſt, as thou gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt me occaſion to ſay to the. Thy ſhame is ſo ſhamefull, and thy malyce ſo vnſhamefaſte, that I can not aunſwere the to the pourpoſe, withoute hurtynge or touchynge the quycke.

bycauſe that with thy great doctrine by day tyme thy houſe is made a ſchole of philoſophers, and the wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thy wyfe Fauſtyne by nyghte, maketh it a bordell of ruffiens. It is a iuſte iugement of the goddis, that ſith thyn onely malyce ſuffiſeth to poyſon many that be good, that one alone may ſuffiſe to vnbend and loſe thy renome. One difference there is betwene the and me, and thy wyfe Fauſtine: for my dedes are but in ſuſpecte, and yours are openly knowen in dede: myn are ſecrete, and yours are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident: I haue ſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled, but ye haue fallen. Of one thyng alone I haue merited to be chaſtiſed, but ye haue deſerued no forgyuenes: My diſhonour is deed with the faut, and is buried with myn amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but your infamie is borne with your deſyres, and is broughte vp with your wylles, and lyueth ſtyll with your werkes: finally therfore youre infamie ſhall neuer dye, for you lyued neuer well. O ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Marcus, with all that thou knoweſt, woteſt thou not, that forloſynge of a good name, an yll fame is reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: and in the ende of a good lyfe, begynnethe a good faame? Thou ceaſſeſt not to ſaye ylle onely by ſuſpicion, the whiche thy falſe iugementes ſhewe the: and yet thou woldeſt we ſhulde not ſpeake that we ſe with our eies. Of one thynge be thou ſure, that neyther of the, nor of thy wyfe Fauſtyne there is no falſe wytneſſe: for the trouth is ſo euident, that there nedeth not to inuent any lyes. Thou ſaiſt, that it is an olde quarel of amorous ladies of Rome, that in takinge fro many we are the pooreſte of all other: bicauſe we faile in credence, we are honoured for ſyluer. It is of certayntie, that we myſtruſte the hollie bicauſe of his prickes, the acornes, for his huſkes, the roſes among nettyls, and thy mouth for thy malyce. I haue curiouſlye taken hede, that thou neuer ſaydeſt well by women, nor I neuer coud fynde, that any wolde the good. What great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:3639:168"/>
correction ſhuld I haue of thy wickednes, or more ven<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geance for myn iniuries, but to be certayne, that all the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge ladies of Rome are ſorye of thy lyfe, and wolde be gladde of thy dethe? The lyfe of that man is wycked, that many bewayle, and in whoſe dethe euery body reioyſeth. It is the propertie of poore vnkynde perſons as thou art, to forgette the great goodneſſe done to them, and to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the lyttell that they gyue. As moche as noble hartis glorifie them in gyuinge to other, ſo moche are they aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to receyue ſeruices vnrewarded. For in giuinge they make them ſelfe lordes, and in receyuyng they are as ſcla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. I wolde wytte what thou haſte gyuen me, or what thou haſte receyued of me? I haue aduentured my good name, and gyuen the, poſſeſſion of my perſonne: I haue made the lorde and mayſter of all my goodes: I haue ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhed my ſelfe out of my countrey, and putte my ſelfe in peryll only for thy ſake: and in recompence of al this, thou reprocheſt me now of miſerie. Thou neuer gaueſt me any thing with thy good wyl, nor I neuer receyued it willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor it dyd me neuer profyt. Il thinges recouer a name, not for the common warke that we ſee, but for the ſecrete intention with the whiche we worke. And thou vnhappy man deſiredſt me, not to enioy my perſonne, but rather to haue my money. We ought not to cal the a clere louer, but a thefe, &amp; a wyly ſee rouer. I had a litel ringe of the, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I am determyned to caſte into the ryuer, and the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge that I had of the I haue brente in the fire. And yf that my body were any thing ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with the breade that I haue eaten of thyn, I wolde cutte my fleſhe, and let out the blode without any feare. O curſed Marke, thy darke malyce wolde not ſuffre the clerely to vnderſtande my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for I entended not to aſke moneye, to releue my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie and ſolytaryneſſe, but reknowlegynge and thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3639:168"/>
to ſatisfie my wyllyng harte. Suche vayne and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous menne as thou arte thy ſelfe, are pleaſed with gyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, but the hartis incarnate in loue are lyttell ſatisfyed with ſyluer. For loue onely is payde with loue agayne. The manne that loueth not as a manne of reaſone, but as a brute beaſte, and the woman that loueth not but for the intereſt of her perſon: ſuche ought not to be truſted in theyr wordes, nor their perſones deſyred. For the loue of her endeth, whan the goodes fayle: and the loue of hym, whan her beautie fayleth. If thy loue proceded onelye of the beautie of my face, and my loue only for the money of thy pours: it were no ryghte, that we were callyd wyſe louers, but rather very nyce perſons. O wycked Marke, I neuer loued the for thy goodes, though thou louedſt me for my beautie: with all my harte I loued the than, &amp; with all my harte I hate the now. Thou ſayſt, the goddis haue ſhewed me great pitie, to gyue me fewe chylderne, and to them many fathers. The greatteſt blame in women is to be vnſhamefaſt, and the moſte vylanie in men is to be yll ſayers. Diuers thinges ought to be ſuffred for the fragili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of women, whiche are not permitted in the wiſedom of men. I ſay this bicauſe I neuer ſawe temperaunce in the for to couer thyne owne malyces, nor wyſedome to excuſe the debilities of other. Thou ſayeſt, that my ſonnes haue dyuers fathers. I ſweare vnto the, that though thou dye, the chylderne of Fauſtine ſhall not be fatherleſſe. And of trouthe if the goddis, as thou ſayeſt, haue be pitiefull to my chyldern, no leſſe art thou to ſtrange children. For Fau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtyne kepeth the but to excuſe her blame, and to be tutour of her children. O curſed Marc, thou mayſt well reioyce &amp; take no thoughte, for thyn owne chyldren haue noo nede to be maried. For oone thynge we are bounde, that is for the example, the whiche thou doſte gyue of thy pacyence:
<pb facs="tcp:3639:169"/>
For ſithe thou ſuffreſt Fauſtine in ſo many infamies, it is no great nede that we ſuffre any ſecretes in the. I ſaye no more at this tyme, makynge an ende of my letter, deſyring the ende of thy perſon.</p>

M. maner of clothynges, bearyng purſes full of ſwete ſmelles, and bracelettes full of knackes, with perles and ſtones at the eares. Tell me what becometh of a woman, with theſe thynges, that wyl ſhewe her ſelfe at a wyndowe? The mooſte cauſe is, that I can eſteme or thynke therin, that ſith you do ſhew your bodies openly to vs at the eie, that your wylle is, that we ſhulde knowe your deſires ſecretely. And if it be ſoo, as I afferme, that it is ſo, it ſemeth me madame Matrine, thou ſhuldeſt deſire hym that deſyreth the, to enforme hym that ſercheth the, to anſwere hym that calleth the, &amp; fele that he feleth: intende to hym that intendeth to the: and ſythe I vnderſtande the, vnderſtande me, and vnderſtande ſythe thou doeſt not vnderſtande. I am aduyſed, as I went by the ſtrete Falaria to ſe theues putte to Iuſtice, myne eyen ſawe the at a wyndowe, on whome dependeth all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.

The gybet is not ſo cruell to them that neuer knew but il doing, as thou art to me that neuer thought, but howe I myghte doo the ſeruyce. The theues ſuffre but one death, and thou makeſt me to ſuffre a.

What ſhall I ſaye more to the? of trouthe they wepte watry droppes with their eyes, bycauſe they dye, and I wepe teares of bloud in my harte, bycauſe I lyue. This is the difference, theyr tourmentes ſpredeth abrode through all theyr bodies, and I kepe myn

O cruell Matrine, I canne not telle what iuſtyce it is to put men to dethe that ſteale money, &amp; ſuffre women to lyue that robbe mennes hartes: If theyr eares be cut of, that picke mens pourſes, why are women than pardoned, that robbe mens inwarde hartes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayles? By thy noblenes I pray the, and by the goddeſſe Venus I coniure the, eyther anſwere to my deſyre, or elles reſtore my harte agayne, whiche thou haſt robbed fro me. I wolde thou kneweſt the clere fayth of my harte, rather than this letter writen with my hande. If myn aduenture were ſo good, as to ſpeke with the, and that thy loue were not aſhamed therof, I wolde hope with the ſight &amp; ſpeche to wynne that whiche I am in ſuſpect to leſe by my letter.

And if thou ſaweſt me, thou ſhul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſee the cruelle teares that I offre to the by my lyfe. I wolde my mouth coulde publyſſhe myn enraged euylles, as my harte feleth, than I ſwere to the lady Matrine, that my greuous dolour ſhulde awake thy ſmall thought. And as thy beautie &amp; myn affection haue made me thyn owne, ſo the knowlege of my paſſion ſhuld make the mine. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre that thou ſhuldeſt regarde the begynnynge, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with regarde the ende. Certaynly the ſame day that thou enpriſonedſt my harte at thy wyndowe, in the doungeon of my deſyres, I had no leſſe weakeneſſe to be ouercome, thanne thou haddeſte force to conſtrayne me. And more greatter is thy power to putte thy ſelfe from me, than my reaſon is to put me fro the. I aſke no mercye of the, but that we myghte declare oure wylles togyther. But in this caſe what wylte thou that I ſhulde ſay, but that thou haſt ſo moch power ouer me, and I ſo lytel of my lybertie, that wyll I nyll I, my hart can not be but thyne?

And ſyth it may not be, but that my life muſt be condemned in thy ſeruice, be thou as ſure of my fayth as I am doubtefull of thy hope: For I ſhall haue a greatter welthe to be loſte for thy ſake, thanne to wynne any other thynge.

But conſyderynge that my trauayles are well applyed in thy ſeruyces, I ſay thoughe I myght, I wyll nat be ſeperate fro the. I wyll not denye one thynge, and that is, that curſed loue taketh away the taſte of al thynges, and yet therby alonly it gyueth vs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, the whiche gyueth vs moche yll proufyte. This is the profe of hym that loueth hartily. For one diſfauour of hym that is beloued, is more than all the fauour of this

lyfe. I thinke lady Libia thou art gretly abaſhed to ſe me outwarde as a philoſopher, and to knowe me inwarde a ſecrete louer. I praye the Lybia diſcouer me not: For yf that the goddis gyue me longe lyfe, I am mynded for to amende. And thoughe I be at this howre but a yonge foole in the arte of loue, whan I am olde I ſhall be wyſe: the goddis knowe what I deſyre, and the force that I do enforce me to: but as the fleſhe is weake, and the hart ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and hath many occaſions and fewe vertues, and the worlde ſubtyll, and the people malitious, I paſſe this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge and ſpring of floures with hope that in harueſt I ſhall haue ſome fruite. Dame Libia doeſt thou thinke, that philoſophers thought they were neuer ſo ſage, be not ſtryken with the cruelties of loue? and that vnder their cours clothes their fleſhe is not ſmoth? Certaynly among the harde bones ſofte fleſhe is bred, vnder the ſharpe huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes the cheſtnutte is nouryſſhed. I ſaye that vnder courſe apparel, is true and perfyte loue. I deny not but that our ſlacke nature reſyſteth not with vertues: nor I denye not, but there be yonge wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ton deſyres not repreſſed with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous purpoſes: I deny not, but that the bytte of youth is not refreyned with the brydell of reaſon: I denye not, but that that the fleſhe procureth, is dyuers tymes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande by wyſedome. And alſo I knowlege well, that he that is not amorous, is a foole. And thou knoweſte, that thoughe we be wyſe, we leaue not therfore to be men. All that euer we lerne in all our lyues ſuffiſeth not to knowe howe to rule the fleſhe one houre. To wyſe menne in this caſe hathe fallen many errours: there be many mayſters in vertues, and many moo hath bene, and yet they haue ben ouercome with vices: wherfore than doeſt thou mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle of me alone? I confeſſe of trouthe, that I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer myne vnderſtandyng ſo clere, as whan Cupyde fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

wind on me with his winges. There was neuer none vnto my tyme, that euer was noted wyſe, but fyrſt he was a priſoner &amp; bound with the loue of Cupide. Gratian was amorous on Tamyr: Solon Salaminus giuer of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, was amorous of Grecyane: Pytacus Mitelenus lefte his owne wyfe, and was enamoured of a bond woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he brought from the warres: Cleobulus of Caria whan he was ful .lxx. yere olde, and haddered philoſophy xlv. yere, ſcalynge the houſe of his neyghbour, felle of the ladder and dyed. Periander prince of Acaye, and a great philoſopher of Grece, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preier of one of his louers ſlewe his wyfe. Anacharſis a philoſopher a Scithian of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſyde, and a greke of his mother ſyde, was ſo enamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a woman of Thebes, that he taught her al his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge: and whan he was ſycke in his bedde, ſhe redde in the ſchole for hym. Epimenides of Crete, that ſlepte .xv. yeres without waking, and though he was .x. yere a great worſhypper of the goddis, yet he was banyſſhed frome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes for the loue of women. Archyta Tarentyn, may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Plato, and diſciple of Pythagoras, occupied his mynde more to inuente the kindes of loue, than his forces in doctrines of vertues. Gorgio Cleontino, borne in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyll, kepte rather concubines in his chambre, than bokes in the ſcholes. All theſe were wyſe men, and yet we maye ſe, howe at the laſte they were ouercome with the fleſſhe. Than blame not me alone: for as I haue tolde of ſo fewe in noumbre, ſo I coude recyte of other a holle armye. Of trouth he ought to haue many thynges, that wylle be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as curious in loue. He muſte haue his eien diſplayed on her that he loueth, his vnderſtandynge fore altered in that he thinketh, his tonge troubled in that he ſhulde ſay: So that in ſeinge he be blynded, in thoughtes wandring, and in ſpeakynge troubled. O lady Libia, the louynge in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3639:174"/>
mockerie paſſeth by mockerie: but where as the true hart is, there is the grefe and no mockerie. Loue ſhedeth her poyſone, and cruell Cupydo fyxeth his arowes vppe to the fethers. Than the eien wepe, the harte ſyghethe, the fleſſhe trymbleth, the ſynewes ſhrynke, the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge waxeth groſſe, reaſon fayleth, and ſo all falleth to the erthe, ſo that fynally the heuy louer abydynge in hym ſelfe, holdeth lyttell or nothynge of hym ſelfe. All this I ſay, bicauſe that knowlege to loue fayleth in me: yet be ye ſure, that the workes faile me not to worke in thy ſeruice. And ſyth it was myn aduenture to ſee the, nowe it is my chaunce to knowe the, I demaunde nothyng elles of the, but that thou wylte loue me truely, ſyth I loue the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute feynynge. And if thou haſte harde, that I am ſycke at my harte, I deſyre the to do me ſome good: for ſythe it is all onely in the, it is reaſon that thou all onely ſeke for remedy. I was greatly comforted, whan Fabius Carly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus deſyred me in thy behalfe to be a priſoner, and I dyd incontinent all that thou dyddeſt deſyre, to thentente that thou on ſome day ſhuldeſt do that I deſyre. And beholde lady Lybia, the woman that is ſerued with ſeruyces, it is reaſonne that ſhe receyue ſome prayers. And though my ſtrengthes haue no power to open the gates of thy pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as not to agree to thy demaunde, yet all my labours be bycauſe of thy renoume. I praye the diſcouer not the one, nor begyle me nat with the other. For now thou ſeeſt that in grauntynge is remedy, and in truſte is comforte, but promeſſe is deceyuable, the delayenge is peryllous, and the entreatynge byndeth. I ſee verye welle, that the haſty demaunde deſerueth a longe aunſwere: but I wold not that thou ſhuldeſt do ſoo: but as I deſyre the, ſoo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre me. I ſaye agayne, I am all thyne, and not myne owne. And as for my ſelfe in al thynges I wyll ſerue the.
<pb facs="tcp:3639:175"/>
And lady Libia regard, that it were as moche honour for the, as profytable for me, to tourne thy diſordinate deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and pourpoſes. For thou ſeeſt well it is moch better to heale ſhortly than to late with faylynge of thy pourpoſe. All women kepe one daungerous opynyon, that is, they wyll neuer receyue counſell that is gyuen them in a great cauſe: and if it be ſo, as I thynke, ſyth thou arte prayſed and eſtemed of great beautie, than be eſtemed to receyue good counſell. And in this maner in caſe that my domage be very great, and thy pacience very lyttell, I ſhalbe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wiſe to gyue the ſuche counſell, and thou ryghte gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to folowe it. One thynge I ſaye, and pardone me, though I ſhewe it to the, howe that women be greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed, that wyll take no counſell, and ſuche as wylle aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their renoume by the opinion of other, as moche as though they were determyned ſo to doo their ſelfe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wolde ye ſhuld do one thyng for an other, as I cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle you. And if thou fyndeſt any ylle therby, withdrawe thy hande. I wyll ſay no more to the, but that I doo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the al my vnhappy troubles, my deſperate ſyghes, and my ſeruyces as thy ſeruaunt: My troubled dolours, my wordes of philoſophy, and my amorous teares. Alſo I ſende the a gyrdelle of golde, and I gyue it the on the condition, that thou ſette thyn eies theron, and apply thy harte to me. I pray the goddis to gyue me to the, and the to me. Marcus Aurelius the philoſopher writeth this in very great ſecrete.</p>

Certainly as great prayſe as ought to be gyuen to the auctour, is to be gyuen to the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, that haue laboriouſly reduced this treatyſe oute of Greke into latyn, and out of latyn into Caſtilian, and out of Caſtilyan into frenche, and out of fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che into engliſhe, writen in high and ſwete ſtyles. O ryght happy trauayle, ſythe that ſuche fruyte is iſſued therof. And alſo bleſſyd be the handes that haue wrytten hit. A ryghte precyous meate is the ſentences of this boke: But finally the ſauce of the ſayd ſwete ſtyle moueth the appetite. Many bokes there be of ſubſtancial meates, but they be ſo rude and ſo vnſauery, and the ſtyle of ſo ſmal grace, that the fyrſte morſell is lotheſome and noyful: And of ſuche bokes foloweth to lye hole and ſounde in Lybraries, but I truſte this wylle not. Of trouthe great prayſe is due to the auctour of his trauayle. And ſyth there can be no grace equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polent in erthe, lette vs pray to god to gyue hym grace &amp; rewarde in heuen. Amen. Graces to god.</p>
