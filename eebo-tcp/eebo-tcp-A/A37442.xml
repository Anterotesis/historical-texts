            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>THE End of Satyr is Reformation: And the Author, tho he doubts the Work of Conversion is at a general Stop, has put his Hand to the Plow.</p>
            <p>I expect a Storm of Ill Language from the Fury of the Town, and especially from those whose <hi>English</hi> Talent it is to Rail: And without being taken for a Conjurer, I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to foretell, That I shall be Cavil'd at about my <hi>Mean Stile, Rough Verse,</hi> and <hi>Incorrect Language</hi>; Things I might indeed have taken more Care in. But the Book is Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and tho I see some Faults, 'tis too late to mend them. And this is all I think needful to say to them.</p>
            <p>Possibly somebody may take me for a <hi>Dutchman</hi>; in which they are mistaken: But I am one that would be glad to see <hi>Englishmen</hi> behave themselves better to Strangers, and to Governors also; that one might not be reproach'd in Foreign Countries, for belonging to <hi>a Nation that wants Manners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I assure you, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> Strangers use us better abroad; and we can give no reason but our Ill Nature for the contrary here.</p>
            <p>Methinks an <hi>Englishman,</hi> who is so proud of being call'd <hi>A Goodfellow,</hi> shou'd be civil: And it cannot be denied but we are in many Cases, and particularly to Strangers, the Churlishest People alive.</p>
            <p>As to Vices, who can dispute our <hi>Intemperance,</hi> while an <hi>Honest Drunken Fellow</hi> is a Character in a man's Praise?
<pb facs="tcp:51969:3"/>
All our Reformations are Banters, and will be so, till our Magistrates and Gentry Reform themselves by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; then, and not till then, they may be expected to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish others without <hi>blushing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to our <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> I desire to be understood of that particular People, who pretending to be Protestants, have all along endeavour'd to reduce the Liberties and Religion of this Nation into the Hands of King <hi>James</hi> and his Popish Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: Together with such who enjoy the Peace and Protection of the present Government, and yet abuse and affront the King who procur'd it, and openly profess their Uneasiness under him: These, by whatsoever Names or Titles they are digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or distinguish'd, are the People aim'd at: Nor do I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own, but that it is so much the Temper of an <hi>Englishman</hi> to abuse his Benefactor, that I could be glad to see it rectified.</p>
            <p>They who think I have been guilty of any Error, in exposing the Crimes of my own Countrymen to themselves, may among many honest Instances of the like nature, find the same thing in Mr. <hi>Cowly,</hi> in his Imitation of the second Olympick Ode of <hi>Pindar</hi>: His Words are these;
<q>
                  <l>But in this Thankless World, the Givers</l>
                  <l>Are envi'd even by th' Receivers:</l>
                  <l>'Tis now the Cheap and Frugal Fashion,</l>
                  <l>Rather to hide than pay an Obligation.</l>
                  <l>Nay, 'tis much worse than so;</l>
                  <l>It now an <hi>Artifice</hi> doth grow,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Wrongs</hi> and <hi>Outrages</hi> to do,</l>

               <l>Fierce as the <hi>Britain,</hi> as the <hi>Roman</hi> Brave;</l>
               <l>And less inclin'd to Conquer than to Save:</l>
               <l>Eager to fight, and lavish of their Blood;</l>
               <l>And equally of <hi>Fear and Forecast</hi> void.</l>

               <l>What Honesty they have, the <hi>Saxon</hi> gave them,</l>

               <l>By their Infirmity, and not design.</l>
               <l>From whence the Learned say it does proceed,</l>

               <l>Good Drunken Company is their Delight;</l>

            <head>The Conclusion.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>THen let us boast of Ancestors no more,</l>
               <l>Or Deeds of Heroes done in days of Yore,</l>
               <l>In latent Records of the Ages past,</l>
               <l>Behind the Rear of Time, in long Oblivion plac'd.</l>
               <l>For if our Virtues must in Lines descend,</l>
               <l>The Merit with the Families would end:</l>
               <l>And Intermixtures would most fatal grow;</l>
               <l>For Vice would be Hereditary too;</l>
               <l>The Tainted Blood wou'd of necessity,</l>
               <l>Involuntary Wickedness convey.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Vice, like Ill Nature, for an Age or two,</l>
               <l>May seem a Generation to pursue;</l>
               <l>But Virtue seldom does regard the Breed;</l>
               <l>Fools do the Wise, and Wise Men Fools succeed.</l>

               <l>What is't to us, what Ancestors we had?</l>
               <l>If Good, what better? or what worse, if Bad?</l>
               <l>Examples are for Imitation set,</l>
               <l>Yet all men follow Virtue with Regret.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Cou'd but our Ancestors retrieve their Fate,</l>
               <l>And see their Offspring thus degenerate;</l>
               <l>How we contend for Birth and Names unknown,</l>
               <l>And build on their past Actions, not our own;</l>
               <l>They'd cancel Records, and their Tombs deface,</l>
               <l>And openly disown the vile degenerate Race:</l>
               <l>For Fame of Families is all a Cheat,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>'Tis Personal Virtue only makes us great.</hi>
