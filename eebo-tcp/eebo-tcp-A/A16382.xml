            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Directions concerning Preachers.</head>
               <p n="1">1 THat no Preacher, vnder the degree and calling of a Bishop, or Deane of a Cathedrall or Collegiate Church, and they vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Kings dayes, and set Festiuals, doe take occasion by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of any text of Scripture whatsoeuer, to fall into any set discourse or Common-place (otherwise then by opening the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and diuision of his Text) which shall not be comprehended and warranted, in essence, substance and effect, or naturall inference, within some one of the Articles of Religion set forth 1562. or in some of the Homelies set forth by authoritie in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> not onely for a helpe for the <hi>Non</hi>-preaching, but withall for a patterne and a bundarie (as it were) for the preaching Ministers, and for their further instructions: for the performance hereof, that they forthwith peruse ouer, and read diligently the said Articles, or the two bookes of Homilies.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That no Parson, Vicar, Curate, or Lecturer, shall preach any Sermon or Collation vpon Sunday and Holy-dayes in the afternoone in any Cathedrall or Parish Church throughout the Kingdome, but vpon some part of the Catechisme, or some text taken out of the Creed, tenne Commandements, or Lords Prayer, (funerall Sermons onely excepted) and that those Preachers be most encouraged and approoued of, who spend these afternoone Exercises in examining the children in their Catechisme, and in expounding of the seuerall points and heads of the Catechisme, which is the most auncient and laudable custome of teaching in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 That no Preacher of what title soeuer, vnder the degree of a Bishop or Deane at the least, do from henceforth presume to preach in any populous auditorie, the deepe points of Predestination, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Reprobation; of the Vniuersalitie, Efficacie, Resistabilitie, or Irresistabilitie of Gods grace, but leaue those Theames to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the learned men, and that moderately, and modestly, by way of vse and application, rather then by way of positiue doctrine, as beeing fitter for the Schooles and Vniuersities, then for simple auditories.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That no Preacher of what title or denomination soeuer, shall presume from hence forth in any auditorie in this Kingdome, to declare, limit, or bound out by positiue doctrine, in any Lecture or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21121:2"/>
Sermon, the Power, Prerogatiue, Iurisdiction, Authoritie, or Duty of Soueraigne Princes; or otherwise meddle with these matters of State, and the references betweene Princes and the People, then as they are instructed and presidented in the Homilie of obedience, and in the rest of the Homilies and Articles of Religion, set forth as is before mentioned by publike authoritie; but rather confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues for those two heads, Faith and good Life, which are the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of auncient Sermons and Homilies.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That no Preacher of what title or denomination soeuer, shall causlesly, and without inuitation from the Text, fall into bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiues, and vndecent rayling speeches, against the persons of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papist or Puritan, but modestly, and grauely when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited or occasioned thereunto by their text of Scripture, free both the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from the aspersion of either Aduersarie, especially where the auditorie is suspected to be tainted with the one or the other infection.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Lastly, the Archbishops and Bishops of this kingdome (whom his Maiestie hath good cause to blame for their former remisnes) be more warie and choice in licensing Preachers, and reuoke all grants made to any Chancellor, Officiall, or Commissary to licence in this kind. And that all the Lecturers throughout the kingdome (a new body seuered from the auncient Clergie of England, as beeing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parson, Vicar, nor Curate) be licensed henceforth in the Court of faculties, onely vpon recommendation of the party from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the Diocesse, vnder his hand and seale with a <hi>Fiat</hi> from the L. Archbish. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and a confirmation of the great seale of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and that such as transgresse any of these directions, bee suspended by the L. Bish. of the Diocesse; in his default by the L.

            <p>I doubt not but before this time, you baue receiued from me the Directions of His most excellent Maiesty concerning Preaching and Preachers, which are so graciously set downe, that no godly or discreet man, can otherwise then acknowledge, that they doe much tend to edification, if he doe not take them vpon report, but do pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually consider the tenor of the words as they lie; and doe not giue an ill construction to that, which may receiue a fairer interpretation. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, because some fewe Churchmen, and many of the People haue si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterly conceiued (as we doe here find) that those Instructions doe tend to the restraint of the Exercise of Preaching, and doe in some sort abate the number of Sermons, and so consequently by degrees, doe make a breach to let in Ignorance and Superstition: His Maiestie in his Princely wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath thought fit, that I should aduertise your Lordship of the graue and waighty reasons which induce His Highnesse to prescribe that which is done. You are therefore to know, That His Maiestie being much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and grieued at the heart, to heare euery day of so many defections from our Religion, both to Poperie and Anabaptisme, or other points of Separation in some parts of this Kingdome, and considering with much admiration, what might be the cause thereof, especially in the Reigne of such a King, who doth so constantly professe himselfe an open Aduersary to the superstition of the one, and madnesse of the other: His Princely wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome could fall vpon no one greater probabilitie, then the lightnes, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctednes, and vnprofit ablenesse of that kind of Preaching, which hath been of late yeares too much taken vp in Court, Vniuersitie, Citie, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The vsuall scope of very many Preachers, is noted to bee a soaring vp in points of Diuinitie, too high for the capacities of the people, or a mustering of much reading, or displaying of their wit, or an ignorant med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Ciuill matters, aswell in the priuate of seuerall Parishes &amp; Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, as in the publike of the Kingdome: or a venting of their owne distastes, or a smoothing vp of those idle fancies, which in this blessed time of so long a peace, doe boyle in the braines of vnaduised people. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21121:3"/>
by an euill and vndecent rayling, not onely against the Doctrine (which when the Text shall occasion the same, is not onely approoued, but much commended by his Maiestie) but against the persons of Papists and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes. Now the people bred vp with this kind of teaching, and neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the Catechisme and Fundamentall points of Religion, are for all this aiery nourishment, no better then <hi>abrasae tabulae,</hi> new Table-books, ready to be filled vp either with the Manuals or Catechismes of Popish Priests, or papers and pamphlets of Anabaptists, Brownists, and Puritanes. His Maiestie euer calling to mind that saying of <hi>Tertullian, Id verum quod primum,</hi> and remembring with what doctrine the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in her first and most happy reformation, did driue out the one, and kept out the other from poisoning and infecting the people of this Kingdome, did find that the whole scope of this Doctrine is contained in the Articles of Religion, the two Bookes of Homilies, the lesse and the greater Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme, which his Maiestie doth therefore recommend againe in these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, as the proper subiect of all sound and edifying Preaching. And so farre are these Directions from abating, that his Maiestie doth expect from our hands, that it should encrease the number of Sermons, by renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon euery Sunday in the afternoone in all Parish Churches through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdome, the primitiue and most profitable exposition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme, wherewith the people, yea very children may be timely seasoned &amp; instructed in all the heads of Christian Religion. Which kind of teaching (to our amendment be it spoken) is more diligently obserued in all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches of Europe, then of late it hath bin here in England. I find his Maiesty much moued with this neglect; &amp; resolued, that if wee which are his Bishops do not see a reformation hereof (which I trust wee shall) to recommend it to the care of the Ciuill Magistrate, so far is he from giuing the least discouragement to solid Preaching, and Religious Preachers.</p>
            <p>To all these I am to adde, that it is his Maiesties Princely pleasure, that both the former Directions, and these reasons of the same, bee fairely written in euery Registers Office. To that ende, that euery Preacher of what denomination soeuer, may if he be pleased take out Copies of either of them with his owne hand <hi>gratis,</hi> paying nothing in the name of Fee, or Expedition. But if he doe vse the paines of the Register his Clerks, then to pay some moderate Fees, to be pronounced in open Court by the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and Commissaries of the place, taking the direction and approbation of any the Lords the Bishops.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that from henceforth a course may be taken, that euery Parson, Vicar, or Curate, or Lecturer, doe make exhibite of these his Maiesties
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21121:4"/>
directions and reasons of the same, <unclear>in</unclear> the next ensuing Visitation of the Bishops and Archdeacons, paying to the Register by <unclear>way</unclear> of Fee two pence onely at the time of the  exhibite.</p>
            <p>And so wishing, and  in his Maiesties Name requiring your Lordsh. to <unclear>haue a speciall</unclear> and extraordinarie care of the  pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
