            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongest the rest of sinnes where-with the perfection of God is most of all displeased in the corruption of man, There is none (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) more distastfull or detestable to his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then this damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Deuillish sinne of Witchcraft; For that it seemes to make an eternall seperation, and an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliable diuorce betwixt the pure Mercies of God, and the tainted soules of such miserable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Who for the most part, as they are of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and the basest sort both in birth and br√©eding, so are they the most vncapeable of any instruction to the contrary, and of all good meanes to reclaime them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15496:3"/>But as there are many, that remaine yet in doubt whether there be any Witches, or no, or any such spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who offer their seruice vnto them, or rather who by fained seruice doe tyrannize ouer them: So to answere their doubts, would aske a greater labour, and perhaps more art, and better experience then I intend, or happily can shew. Onely this, that if neither those confutations that are already lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly set forth, Nor ancient records of the Witches called <hi>Druides,</hi> in old time confinde into the Isle of <hi>Man,</hi> nor the ordinary reportes of the strange mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes done by the Witches of <hi>Norway</hi> might s√©eme sufficient proofes of this matter: Yet mee thinkes that the common experience, which our learned and Reuerend Iudges of the Land, finde daily in their y√©erely Circuites by the conuictions of suth offendors, and the plaine and manifest Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces brought in against them, who being in this this kinde dangerously infected, haue from time to time stood foorth vpon their Arraignement, and as their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ues haue b√©ene held to b√©e the most dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, so their deathes haue b√©ene obserued to proue the most desperate, might put it out of question, that some such there be abroad in the world, who by the damnable practise of Witch-craft haue sold themselues to the Deuils seruies. In regard whereof I may conclude, that either it must be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that there are Witches both in name, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or else the <hi>Oppositors,</hi> that being (I suppose) more precise then wise, standing rather vpon the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of their owne opinions, then the certainty of Reason or Iudgement, must needs doe palpable wrong and open Iniury to the discretions, or consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb facs="tcp:15496:3"/>
of our learned Iudges, and the power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of our Lawes, in the excecution of Iustice, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that hated, and vnheard off Tyranny, which is done by the lawfull power and vertue both of the <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> and Subordinate authority.</p>
            <p>Some doe maintaine (but how wisely let the wiser iudge) that all Witchcraft spoken of either by holy writers, or testified by other writers to haue b√©ene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the heathen or in later daies, hath b√©ene and is no more but either m√©ere Cousinage, or Collusion, so that in the opinion of those men, the Deuill hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer done, nor can do any thing by Witches. It may be, some will say, what hurt can grow from this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? The hurt that may ensue and grow thereof, none can tell that hath not first s√©ene somewhat by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. W√©e all s√©e that one kernell of Wheat b√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sowne, a whole eare growes vp, and sometimes brings forth an hundreth kernils in it. If an error be planted, who can tell what increase it<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> may yeild in time? The ground doth not bring forth the corne with such increase as the heart of Man doth errors. If we draw in one linke of a Chaine, anether followes, and is by and by in sight, which draweth w√©e knowe not how many after it, vntill we s√©e the last. There is no Error that goeth alone, or that is not linked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another. That holy Wrytte therefore (which makes the Man of God perfect and perfectly instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto euery good worke) must iudge and decide the controuersie in this case. Let vs then sticke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same for testimony and proofe.</p>

               <head>What a Witch is, and the Antiquity of Witchcraft.</head>
               <p>TO know things aright and perfectly, is to know the causes thereof. A <hi>Definition</hi> doth consist of those causes which giue the whole Essence, and containe the perfect nature of the thing defined: where that is therefore found out, there appeares the very cl√©ere light. If it be perfect, it is much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though it be not fully perfect, yet it giueth some good light.</p>
               <p>For which respect though I dare not say, I can giue a perfect Definition in this matter, which is hard to doe euen in knowne things, because the Essentiall forme is hard to be found, yet I doe giue a Definition, which may at the least giue notice, and make knowne what manner of Persons they be, of whom I am to speake. A Witch is one that worketh by the Deuill, or by same Deuillish or Curious Art, either hurting or healing, reuealing things secret, or foretelling things to come, which the Deuill hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised to entangle, and snare mens soules withall, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to damnation. The <hi>Coniurer,</hi> the <hi>Enchaunter,</hi> the <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> the <hi>Deuiner,</hi> and whatsoeuer other sort there is, are ind√©ed compassed within this circle. The Deuill doth (no doubt) after diuers sorts, and diuers formes deale in these: But no man is able to shew an Essentiall difference in each of them from the rest.
<pb facs="tcp:15496:4"/>
I hold it no wisedome, or labour well spent to trauell much therein; One Artificer hath deuised them all<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> They are all to one end and purpose, howsoeuer they much differ in outward Rules for practise of them, that is little or nothing besides meere delusion. Euery Man will confesse that the father of lies is not to be trusted. Euery man knowes that all his dooings are hidden vnder coulorable shewss. Shall w√©e then seeke for stedfastnes in his wayes? Shall w√©e be so foolish as to imagine that things are effected by the vertue of words, gestures, figures, or such like? All those are doubtlesse but to deceiue, and draw men forward, and so plung them more d√©epely into sinnes, and errors.</p>
               <p>Touching the Antiquity of Witchcraft, w√©e must n√©eds confesse that it hath b√©ene of very ancient time, because the Scriptures doe testifie so much, for in the time of <hi>Moses</hi> it was very rife in <hi>Egipt,</hi> Neither was it then newly sprong vp, beeing common, and growne vnto such ripenes among the Nations, that the Lord reckoning vp diuers kinds, saith that the Gentiles did commit such abhominations, for which h√©e would cast them out before the Children of <hi>Israel.</hi> How long it was before that time cannot for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be discussed: Sauing that (as is sayd) it was not young in those daies when <hi>Moses</hi> wrote. If w√©e mainetaine that it was before the flood, there is great reason to iustify the Assertion. W√©e know that the Deuill was exc√©eding crafty from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, alwaies laboring to seduce, and deceiue after the worst manner. If he fayled of his desire, it was because Men had not procured Gods displeasure to
<pb facs="tcp:15496:5"/>
come vpon them, to deliuer them ouer vnto strange delusions, but God complaineth, that men had won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully corrupted their waies, long before the Flood: God beeing then prouoked by the wickednesse of the world, what should make vs doubt but that through his Iust iudgement the Deuill had power giuen him and was let loose, that he might seduce, and lead the prophane Nations into the depth and gulfe of all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable sinnes? Thus much concerning the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety of Witches, and the Antiquity of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, This that followes shall in some sort shew their Diuil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>This <hi>Ioane</hi> was so well brought vp vnder her mothers elbow<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that shee hangd with her for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany vnder her mothers nose. But to the purpose. This <hi>Ioane</hi> one day happening into the company
<pb facs="tcp:15496:6"/>
of one Mistris <hi>Belcher,</hi> a vertuous and godly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of the same towne of <hi>Gilsborough.</hi> This <hi>Ioane Vaughan,</hi> whether of purpose to giue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of anger to the said Mistris <hi>Belcher,</hi> or but to continue her vilde, and ordinary custome of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, committed something either in sp√©ech, or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, so vnfitting, and vns√©eming the nature of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-hood, that it displeased the most that were there present: But especially it touched the modesty of this Gentlewoman, who was so much mooued with her bold, and impudent demeanor, that sh√©e could not containe her selfe, but sodainely rase vp and strooke her, howbeit hurt her not, but forced her to auoide the company: which this Chicken of her Dammes hatching, taking disdainefully and b√©eing also enraged (as they that in this kind hauing power to harme, haue neuer patience to beare) at her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out told the Gentlewoman that shee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this iniury, and reuenge it: To whom Mistris <hi>Belcher</hi> answered, that sh√©e neither seared her nor her mother: but bad her doe her worst.</p>
               <p>This trull holding her selfe much disgraced, hies home in all hast to her mother, and telles her the wrong, which sh√©e suggested Mistris <hi>Belcher</hi> had done vnto her: Now was the fire, and the tow met, all was enflamed: Nothing but rage and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Had they had an hundred Spirits at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the worst, and the most hurtfull had b√©ene called to this counsell, and imployed about this businesse.

               <p>The matter thus sl√©eping (but rage and reuenge doe neuer rest) within a while was awaked, which Mistris <hi>Belcher</hi> to her intollerable paine too soone felt: For being alone in her house, she was sodainely taken with such a griping, and gnawing in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that sh√©e cried out, and could scarce bee held by such as came vnto her, And being carried to her bed her face was many times so disfigured by b√©eing drawne awrie that it bred both feare, and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to all the beholders, and euer as shee had breath, she cried, <hi>Heere comes <hi>Ioane Uaughan,</hi> away with <hi>Ioane Uaughan.</hi>

               <p>This Gentlewoman b√©eing a long time thus strangely handled, to the great griese of her friends, it happened that her brother one Master <hi>Auery,</hi> hearing of his Sisters sicknesse and extremity came to s√©e her, and b√©eing a sorrowfull beholder, of that which before h√©e had heard, was much moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in his minde at his Sisters pittifull condition, and the rather for that as h√©e knew not the nature of her disease, so h√©e was vtterly ignorant of any direct way to minister cure or helpe to the same. H√©e often heard her cry out against <hi>Ioane Vaug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> alias <hi>Varnham,</hi> and her mother, and heard by report of the neighbours that which before had happened betwixt his Sister, and the said <hi>Ioane:</hi> In so much as hauing confirmed his suspition that it was nothing else but Witch-craft that thus

Upon this, they both hyed them home, still praysing God for their escape, and were neuer troubled after.</p>
               <p>I had almost forgotten to tell you before, that M. <hi>Auery</hi> was by the Iudges themselues in y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> Castle yard of <hi>Northampton,</hi> s√©ene in the middest of his fits, and that he strangely continued in them vntill this <hi>Ioane Vaughan</hi> was brought vnto him.</p>

And when they were asked what they could say for themselues, why y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death should not be pronounced against them, they stood stiffely vpon their Innocence. Wherevpon Iudgement b√©eing giuen, they were carried backe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gaole, where they were neuer heard to pray, or to call vppon God, but with bitter curses and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations spent that little time they had to liue, vntill the day of their Execution, when neuer asking pardon for their offences either of God, or the world, in this

               <p>This <hi>Arthur Bill</hi> was accused that he should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch the body of one <hi>Martha Aspine</hi> alias <hi>Ieames,</hi> the daughter of one <hi>Edward Aspine</hi> of the same towne, to death.

               <p>And hereby the way, it is a speciall thing worthy generall noting and obseruation, that there are two signes or tokens which are tokens as more certaine, then others, to detect and find out Witches by. The one is the marke where the Spirits sucke, and the trying of the insensiblenesse thereof. The other is their fl√©eting on the water.

               <p>Her Neighbours often hearing her bitter execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions bad her call vpon God, and to be sorry for the sinnes which sh√©e had committed, But shee could in no case endure to heare it: And hauing thus for 3. or 4. daies tormented herselfe in this Agony, at last she made good the Deuils word, and to preuent the Iustice of the Law, and to saue the hangman a labour, cut her owne throat.</p>
               <p>Her Sonne beeing all this while in prison, and

hearing of his Mothers death, and that his Father was become a witnesse against him, was much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plered in his minde, that his Mother was dead, in whom he most trusted, and his Father liuing, whom he most feared, Howbeit hee stiffly stood still in the deniall of euery thing, pleading nothing but his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noceney, Notwithstanding that hee had before at vnawares confest, that he had certaine Spirits at commaund, which b√©eing imployed, would doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mischiefe to any man, woman or child that h√©e would appointe.</p>
               <p>It said is that hee had thr√©e Spirits to whom h√©e gaue thr√©e speciall names, the Diuell himselfe sure was godfather to them all, The first h√©e called <hi>Grissill,</hi> The other was named <hi>Ball,</hi> and the last <hi>Iacke,</hi> but in what at shapes they appeered vnto him I cannot learne. For Diuels can app√©ere both in a bodily shape, and vse sp√©ech and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with men. Dur Sauiour saith, <hi>That a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath neither flesh nor bones:</hi> A Spirit hath a substance, but yet such as is inuisible, whereupon it must n√©edes b√©e granted, that Deuils in their owne nature haue no bodily shape nor visible forme, it is moreouer against the<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Truth and against Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to bel√©eue, that Deuils can create, or make bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or change one body into another, for those things are proper to God.</p>
               <p>It followeth therefore that whensoeuer they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in a visible form, it is no more but an apparition and counterfeit sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:15496:11"/>
to beare the likenes of another, it is but a colour. Some man will say, what reason is there to shew they can doe so much, beeing of an essence inuisible? Wee may not stay heere within the limits of our owne reason, which is not able to comprehend, what way Deuills should be able to worke such operations. W√©e may not (I say) measure their power, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties in working for our owne capacity and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: But w√©e must looke what the Cannon of Scripture doth testify in this behalfe. W√©e haue manifest proofe that the Deuill can take a bodily shape. For when <hi>Aaron</hi> had cast downe his staffe, and it was turned into a Serpent, The enchaunters of <hi>Egypt</hi> cast downe their staues, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Serpents, which was ind√©ed but in shew, and appearance, which the Deuill made, For he deluded the Sences both in hiding the forme of the Staues, which ind√©ed were not any way changed: As also in making a shew of such bodies, as were not. This was done openly, otherwise it might be thought to be a m√©ere illusion. For w√©e see that men in extreame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

man) lying in prison from the 29 day of May to the 22 of Iuly following, many resorted to him, willing him to leaue off all colour and dissimulation, and not to suffer his Conscience to double with his Tongue, But to cleere his heart and his thoughts before the Maies<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But his Conscience b√©eing feared, and his heart st√©eld, could receiue no impression, but stood like an Image of Adamant, more easy to be broken in p√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then b√©e peirced.

               <p>Uppon the verdict whereof, his countenance chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and he cried out, that he had now found the Law to haue a Power aboue Iustice, for that it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned an Innocent.</p>
               <p>It s√©emes to me that these vilde Spirits, which these Witches haue at commaund, and by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment are suffred to haue power to hurt the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes of others, haue a greater Power ouer them that set them a worke, For they doe not onely f√©ed vppon them participating with the blood of humane

               <p>But to conclude with this <hi>Arthur Bill,</hi> that se ill concluded with the world, He b√©eing brought to the place of Execution, and standing vppon that fatall stage for offenders, pleaded still his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that Authority was turned to Tyranny, and Iustice into extreame Iniury, to the great wonder, and disdaine of all the lookers on.</p>
               <p>Thus with a dissembling Tongue and a corrupted Conscience, hee ended his course in this world, with little hope or respect (as it s√©emd) of the world to come.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Helen</hi> was apprehended for bewitching of a Child to death, and committed to <hi>Northampton</hi> Gaole the 11 of May last by Sir <hi>Thomas Brooke</hi> of <hi>Okeiy</hi> Knight. A little before whose apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, one Mistris <hi>Moulsho</hi> of the same Towne (after she was so strongly suspected) getting her by a wyle into a place conuenient would n√©eds haue her sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, to s√©e if they could find that insencible marke which commonly all Witches haue in some priuy place or other of their bodies.

them forth to dry, spyed the Cloathes, but especially Mistris <hi>Moulshoes</hi> Smocke to be all bespotted with the pictures of Toades, Snakes, and other ougly Creatures, which making her agast, she went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently and told her Mistris, who looking on them, smild, saying nothing else but this; Heere are fine Hobgoblins ind√©ed: And b√©eing a Gentlwoman of a stout courage, went immediately to the house of the sayd <hi>Helen Ienkenson,</hi> and with an angry counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance told her of this matter, threatning her that if her Linnen were not shortly cl√©ered from those foule spots, she would scratch out both her eyes: and so not staying for any answere went home, and found her linnen as white as it was at first. This <hi>Helen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the barre, and b√©eing indicted of the murther of the Child, pleaded thereunto not guilty, but the verdict b√©eing giuen vp against her, sh√©e cryed out, woe is mee, I now cast away, But (like the rest) did stoutly deny the accusations, and sayd that she was to die an Innocent, I thinke as Innocent as the rest: And at the place of Execution made no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confession but this, That she was guiltlesse, and neuer shewd signe of Contrition for what was past, nor any sorrow at all, more then did accompany the feare of death. Thus ended this woman her misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life, after she had liued many yeares poore, wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, scorned, and forsaken of the world.</p>
