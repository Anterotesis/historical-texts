            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ONNE, The vertuous inclination of thy matchleſſe Mother, by whoſe tender and godly care thy Infancy was gouerned, together with thy education vnder ſo godly and zealous a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, puts me rather in aſſurance then hope, that thou art not ignorant of that ſummary bond, which is onely able to make thee happy, aſwell in thy life as death. I meane the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy Creator and redeemer, without which all things are vaine and miſerable. So that thy youth being guided by ſo al-ſufficient a teacher, I make no doubt but he will furniſh thy life both with Diuine and morall documents; yet that I may not caſt of the care beſeeming a parent towards his child, or that thou ſhouldeſt haue cauſe, to deriue thy whole felicity and welfare rather from others, then from whom thou receiuedſt thy birth and being, I thinke it fit and agreable to the affection I beare, to giue thee ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſements and rules for the ſquaring of thylife, as are gayned rather by long experience, then much reading, to the end, that thou entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this exorbitant age maiſt be the better prepared to ſhun thoſe caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous courſes, whereinto this world, and thy lacke of experience may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw thee. And becauſe I will not confound thy memory, I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them into ten precepts, if thou imprint them in thy mind, thou ſhalt reape the benefite, and I the contentment. And theſe are they.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="precept">
               <head>The firſt Pecept.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, when it ſhall pleaſe God, to bring thee to mans eſtate, vſe great prouidence and circumſpection in the choice of thy wife: for from thence may ſpring all thy future good or ill. And it is an action like to a Stratagem in warre, where man can erre but once. If thy eſtate bee good, match neere home and at leaſure: if weak, then farre off and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, enquire diligently of her diſpoſition, and how her parents haue bene inclined in their youth. Let her not be poore, how generous ſoeuer: for a man can buy nothing in the market with gentility. Neither chooſe a baſe or vncomely creature: for that will breed contempt in others, and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in thee. Make not choice of a dwarfe or a foole: for from the one thou maiſt beget a race of Pigmies, the other may be thy daily diſgrace. For it will yrke thée to heare her talke, and thou ſhalt finde (to thy great griefe) that there is nothing ſo fulſome as is a ſhee foole.</p>
               <p>Touching the gouernment of thy houſe, let thy hoſpytality bee mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, according to the meaſure of thine owne eſtate, rather plentifull then ſparing, (but not too coſtly) For I neuer heard nor yet knew any man grow poore by keeping an orderly Table, But ſome conſume them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with ſecret vices, and their hoſpitality muſt beare the blame. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſwyniſh drunkards out of thy houſe, which is a vice that impaires health, conſumes much, and makes no ſhew, beſides I neuer heard any commendations aſcribed to a drunkard more then the well bearing of his drinke which is a commendation fitter for a brewers horſe or a dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then for either a Gentleman or Seruingman.</p>
               <p>Beware that thou ſpend not aboue three of the foure parts of thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes, nor aboue one third part thereof in thy houſe, for the other two parts will but defray thy extraordinaries, which will alwaies ſurmount thy ordinaries by much, for otherwiſe thou ſhalt liue like a rich beggar in a continuall want, and the needy man can neuer liue happily nor conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for then euery leaſt diſaſter makes him ready to morgage or ſell. And that Gentleman that then ſels an aker of land, looſeth an ounce of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, for Gentility is nothing but auncient riches, ſo that if the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do ſinke, the buildings muſt needs conſequently faile.</p>

               <p>BRing thy children vp in obedience and learning yet without auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, praiſe them openly, reprehend them ſecretly, giue them good countenance, and conuenient maintenance according to thy ability, for otherwiſe thy life will ſeeme their bondage, &amp; then what portion thou ſhalt leaue them, they may thanke death and not thee for it. Marry thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters betimes leaſt they marry themſelues. Suffer not thy ſonnes to paſſe the Alpes, for they ſhall learne nothing but pride, blaſphemy, and Atheiſme. And if by chance they attaine to any broken languages, they will profite them no more, then to haue one meate ſerued in diuers diſhes, Neither by my aduiſe ſhalt thou traine them vp to warres, for he that ſets vp his reſt to liue by that profeſſion, can hardly be an honeſt man, or a good Chriſtian, for euery warre is of it ſelfe vniuſt, the good cauſe may make it iuſt, beſides it is a ſcience no longer in requeſt then vſe, for ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in peace, are like to chimnies in ſommer,</p>

               <p>Be not willingly attended or ſerued by kinſmen or friends, or men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to ſtay, for they will expect much, and do little, neither by ſuch as are amorous, for their heads are commonly intoxicated, keepe rather two too few, then one too many, feede them well and pay them with the moſt.
