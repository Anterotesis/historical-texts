         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

out of the <hi>Woods</hi> into the <hi>Fields</hi> a little, and to consider
what Advancement may be <hi>there</hi> likewise made by the
planting of <hi>FRUIT-TREES.</hi> For after the
<hi>Earth</hi> is duly cultivated, and pregnant with a Crop of
<hi>Grain;</hi> it is only by the Furniture of such <hi>Trees</hi> as
bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> that it becomes capable of any farther <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</hi>
If then by discovering how <hi>this</hi> may best be effected I can but
raise a worthy emulation in our <hi>Country-men;</hi> this addition of noble <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,</hi>
as well as of <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Pleasure, Food</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> may (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume)
obtain some grateful admittance amongst all Promoters of Industry.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed, I must, and do ingenuously acknowledge, that I
present my <hi>Reader</hi> here with very little of my <hi>own,</hi> save the pains of
<hi>collecting</hi> and <hi>digesting</hi> a few dispers'd <hi>Notes</hi> (but such as are to me
exceedingly precious) which I have receiv'd; <hi>some</hi> from worthy, and
most experienc'd<note n="*" place="margin">Especially, from the most excellently learned Dr. <hi>Beale</hi> of <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> in <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set-shire,</hi> a Member of the Royal Society.</note> 
                  <hi>Friends</hi> of mine; and <hi>others,</hi> from the well-fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
<hi>Registers,</hi> and <hi>Cimelia</hi> of the <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY.</hi>
Especially, those <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> and <hi>Treatises</hi> relating to the <hi>History</hi> of
<hi>Cider,</hi> which by express commands they have been pleas'd to injoyn I
should publish with my <hi>Sylva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is little more than an <hi>Age,</hi> since <hi>Hops</hi> (rather a <hi>Medical,</hi> than
<hi>Alimental</hi> Vegetable) transmuted our wholesome <hi>Ale</hi> into <hi>Beer;</hi> which
doubtless much alter'd our <hi>Constitutions: That</hi> one <hi>Ingredient</hi> (by
some not unworthily suspected) preserving <hi>Drink</hi> indeed, and so by custom
made agreeable; yet repaying the pleasure with tormenting Diseases, and
a shorter life, may deservedly abate our fondness to it; especially, if
with <hi>this</hi> be consider'd likewise, the <hi>casualties</hi> in planting it, as seldom
succeeding more than <hi>once</hi> in <hi>three</hi> years; yet requiring constant charge
and culture; Besides that it is none of the least devourers of young
<hi>Timber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what if a like <hi>care,</hi> or indeed one quarter of it, were (for the
future) converted to the propagation of <hi>Fruit-trees,</hi> in all parts of this
<hi>Nation,</hi> as it is already in <hi>some,</hi> for the benefit of <hi>Cider?</hi> (one <hi>Shire</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:40289:4"/>
alone within <hi>twenty</hi> miles compass, making no less, <hi>yearly,</hi> than <hi>Fifty
thousand Hogsheads)</hi> the <hi>commutation</hi> would (I perswade my self)
rob us of no great Advantage; but present us with one of the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
and wholesom <hi>Beverages</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>It was by the plain <hi>Industry</hi> of one <hi>Harris</hi> (a <hi>Fruiterer</hi> to King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the <hi>Eighth)</hi> that the <hi>Fields,</hi> and <hi>Environs</hi> of about thirty <hi>Towns,</hi> in
<hi>Kent</hi> only, were planted with <hi>Fruit,</hi> to the universal benefit, and general
Improvement of that <hi>County</hi> to this day; as by the noble example of
my Lord <hi>Scudamor,</hi> and of some other publick-spirited <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in
those parts, all <hi>Herefordshire</hi> is become, in a manner; but one intire <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard;</hi>
And when his <hi>Majesty</hi> shall once be pleas'd, to command the
<hi>Planting</hi> but of some <hi>Acres,</hi> for the best <hi>Cider-fruit,</hi> at every of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>Mansions,</hi> amongst other of his most laudable <hi>Magnificences; Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
wealthy Purchasers,</hi> and <hi>Citizens</hi> will (doubtless) follow the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi>
till the preference of <hi>Cider,</hi> wholesom, and more natural <hi>Drinks,</hi>
do quite vanquish <hi>Hopps,</hi> and banish all other <hi>Drogues</hi> of that nature.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>Improvement</hi> (say some) would be generally obstructed by the
<hi>Tenant,</hi> and <hi>High-shoon-men,</hi> who are all for the <hi>present profit;</hi> their
expectations seldom holding out above a year or two at most.</p>
               <p>To this 'tis answer'd; That therefore should the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Mannour</hi>
not only encourage the <hi>Work</hi> by his own <hi>Example,</hi> and by the Applause of
such <hi>Tenants</hi> as can be courted to <hi>delight</hi> in these kinds of <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
but should also oblige them by <hi>Covenants</hi> to <hi>plant</hi> certain <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions</hi>
of them, and to <hi>preserve</hi> them being planted.</p>
               <p>To fortifie this profitable <hi>Design,</hi> It were farther to be desir'd, that
(if already there be not <hi>effectual provision</hi> for it, which wants only due
<hi>execution</hi> and <hi>quickning)</hi> an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> might be procur'd for
the Setting but of two or three <hi>Trees</hi> in every <hi>Acre</hi> of Land that shall
hereafter be enclosed, under the Forfeiture of Six-pence <hi>per</hi> Tree, for
some <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>charitable Work,</hi> to be levy'd on the <hi>Defaulters.</hi> To
what an innumerable multitude would <hi>this,</hi> in few years, insensibly
mount; affording infinite proportions, and variety of <hi>Fruit</hi> throughout
the <hi>Nation,</hi> which now takes a <hi>Potion</hi> for a refreshment, and drinks its
very <hi>Bread-corn!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have seen a <hi>Calculation</hi> of twenty <hi>Fruit-trees</hi> to every <hi>Five-</hi> pounds
of yearly Rent; forty to <hi>Ten;</hi> sixty to <hi>Fifteen;</hi> eighty to <hi>Twenty;</hi> and
so according to the proportion. Had all our <hi>Commons,</hi> and <hi>Waste-lands</hi>
one <hi>Fruit-tree</hi> but at every <hi>hundred foot</hi> distance, planted, and fenc'd
at the publick charge, for the benefit of the <hi>Poor,</hi> (whatever might dy
and miscarry) enough would escape able to maintain a <hi>Stock,</hi> which would
afford them a most incredible relief. And the <hi>Hedg-rows,</hi> and the <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion-grounds,
Land-divisions, Mounds,</hi> and <hi>Head-lands</hi> (where the
<hi>Plough</hi> not coming, 'tis ever abandon'd to <hi>VVeeds</hi> and <hi>Briars)</hi> would
add yet considerably to these <hi>Advantages,</hi> without detriment to any man.</p>
               <p>As touching the <hi>Species,</hi> if much have been said to the preference of
the <hi>Red-strake</hi> before other <hi>Cider-Apples,</hi> this is to be added; That as
the best <hi>Vines,</hi> of richest <hi>liquor,</hi> and greatest <hi>burden,</hi> do not spend much
in <hi>wood</hi> and unprofitable <hi>branches;</hi> so nor does this <hi>Tree:</hi> for though

renders yet the difficulty more arduous. But to make good the <hi>Experiment</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About thirty years since one M. <hi>Taylor</hi> (a person well known in <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-shire)</hi>
challeng'd a <hi>London-Vintner</hi> (finding him in the <hi>Country)</hi>
That he would produce a <hi>Cider</hi> which should excel his best <hi>Spanish</hi> or
<hi>French-wine:</hi> The <hi>Wager</hi> being deposited, <hi>He</hi> brings in a good <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strake</hi>
to a private House: On that <hi>Scene,</hi> all the <hi>Vintner</hi> could call to
be <hi>Judges</hi> pronounce against his <hi>Wine;</hi> Nor would any man there drink
<hi>French-wine</hi> (without the help of <hi>Sugar)</hi> nor endure <hi>Sack</hi> for a full
draught; and to those who were not accustomed to either, the more racy
<hi>Canaries</hi> were no more agreeable than <hi>Malaga,</hi> too luscious for the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But this <hi>Wager</hi> being lost, our <hi>Vintner</hi> renews his <hi>Chartel,</hi> upon these
express terms, of Competent and Indifferent <hi>Arbitrators:</hi> The <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

                  </gap>
must be debated who were Competent <hi>Judges,</hi> and absolutely Indifferent.
M. <hi>Taylor</hi> proposes <hi>Three,</hi> whereof the <hi>odd Number</hi> should by <hi>Vote</hi>
determine: They must be of the fittest <hi>Ages</hi> too, or rather the fittest of all
<hi>Ages,</hi> and such as were inur'd neither to <hi>Cider</hi> nor any <hi>Wine;</hi> and so
it was agreed. The <hi>Judges</hi> convene; <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>Youth</hi> of ten years old, a
<hi>Man</hi> of thirty, and a <hi>Third</hi> of sixty; and by <hi>All these</hi> also our <hi>Vintner</hi>
lost the Battel. But this is not enough; 'Tis assay'd again by Nine <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi>
the <hi>Ternary</hi> thrice over; and there 'tis lost also: <hi>To this</hi> we could add
another, even of the <hi>Cider</hi> of <hi>Ledbury</hi> (which is not yet the best of
<hi>Herefordshire)</hi> which, when an experienced <hi>London-Vintner</hi> had
tasted, he wish'd had been <hi>Poyson;</hi> for that if it were <hi>known</hi> where
he dwelt, it would utterly undo his <hi>Trade.</hi> And here I will conclude;
for I think never was fairer <hi>Duel;</hi> nor can more be reasonably preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to vindicate this <hi>Blessing</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and our Native <hi>Liquor</hi> from

by His late <hi>Majesty,</hi> and <hi>Court,</hi> and there referr'd to all the <hi>Gentry</hi> of
the invironing <hi>Country,</hi> (no strangers to the best <hi>VVines)</hi> when for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Summers</hi> in the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Hereford</hi> (so encompass'd with store of
it, and brought thither without <hi>charge,</hi> or extraordinary <hi>subductions)</hi>
it was sold for <hi>six-pence</hi> the <hi>VVine-Quart,</hi> not for the <hi>scarcity,</hi> but the
<hi>excellency</hi> of it: And for the <hi>Red-strake,</hi> that it has been seen <hi>there</hi>
hundreds of times (with vehement and engaged competition) compar'd
with the <hi>Cider</hi> of other the most celebrated Fruit, when after a while of
vapour, no man stood for any other <hi>Liquor</hi> in comparison.</p>
               <p>But it is from these <hi>Instances</hi> (may some say) when the <hi>VVorld</hi> shall
have multiplied <hi>Cider-Trees,</hi> that it will be time enough to give <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
for the right <hi>Pressing</hi> and <hi>Preserving</hi> of the <hi>Liquor.</hi> The Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is fair: But there are already more <hi>Persons</hi> better furnish'd with
<hi>Fruit,</hi> than with <hi>Directions</hi> how to <hi>use</hi> it as they should; when in plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
years so much <hi>Cider</hi> is impair'd by the ignorant <hi>handling,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
dead and sowr, that many even surfeit with the <hi>Blessing;</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rarely seen in most <hi>Countries,</hi> that any remains good, to supply the
defects of another year; and the <hi>Royal Society</hi> would prevent all this
hazard by this free Anticipation. And yet when all this is said, we
undertake not to divine what excellent <hi>Cider</hi> other <hi>soils</hi> may bear; nor
do we positively extol the <hi>Red-strake</hi> farther then the bounds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines

because there are doubtless many such <hi>soils</hi> sparsedly throughout this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
why should it not incite our <hi>Industry</hi> to its almost <hi>effort,</hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40289:5"/>
the commendable emulation of endeavouring to raise a yet <hi>kindlier Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-fruit</hi>
if it be possible, and which may prove in it self as good, and
as agreeable to the <hi>Soil</hi> where we plant it? And certainly, much of this
may fairly be expected, from the Trials, Culture, and Propagation of
<hi>Kernel-Fruits</hi> of innumerable sorts, and from hopeful <hi>VVildings,</hi> and
the <hi>peculiarity</hi> of Grounds.</p>
               <p>It now remains, that I should make some <hi>Apology</hi> for my self, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
the tumultuary <hi>Method</hi> of the ensuing <hi>Periods.</hi> Indeed it was
not intended for a queint or elaborate piece of <hi>Art;</hi> nor is it the design

avoided; and therefore in an <hi>Argument</hi> so much beaten as is that of
dressing the <hi>Seminary, Planting,</hi> and modes of <hi>Graffing,</hi> it has been with
Industry avoided; such rude, and imperfect <hi>draughts</hi> being far better

                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Beale <hi>of</hi> Yeavil <hi>in</hi> Somerset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</note> had
not a most worthy <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> (to whom we
have infinite Obligations) furnished us with some things very
<hi>particular</hi> and <hi>remarkable,</hi> in order to the <hi>improvement</hi> of our <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries,
Stocks,</hi> &amp;c. which are indeed the very <hi>Basis</hi> and <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>
of <hi>Cider-Orchards.</hi> It is from those precious <hi>papers</hi> of <hi>his,</hi>
and of some <hi>others</hi> (whose Observations also have richly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to this <hi>Enterprize)</hi> that we shall chiefly entertain our <hi>Planter</hi>
in most of the following Periods.</p>
               <p>Whosoever expects from the <hi>kernel</hi> of a rich or peculiar <hi>Apple</hi> or
<hi>Pear</hi> to raise <hi>Fruit</hi> of the <hi>same kind,</hi> is likely to find many obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and disappointments: For the <hi>Wilding, (Crab</hi> or <hi>Pear) Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
Sylvestris,</hi> being at the best the natural product of the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>kernel</hi> in the firmest land, and therefore the gust of the <hi>Fruit</hi>
more strongly austere, fierce, and sharp, and also the <hi>Fruit</hi> less and
more woody; and the pleasanter or plumper and larger <hi>Apple</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the effect of some inteneration, which inclines to a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement
of the natural strength of the Tree; the best choice of
<hi>kernels</hi> for <hi>Stocks</hi> indefinitely, (and on which we may graff what
we please) should be from the soundest <hi>Wilding.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>A <hi>kernel</hi> taken from any <hi>graffed-Apple,</hi> as <hi>Pepin, Pear-main,</hi> &amp;c.
does most naturally propend to the wildness of the <hi>Stock</hi> on which
'twas inserted, as being the natural mother of the <hi>kernel,</hi> which
is the very heart of the <hi>Apple;</hi> and also from a more deep and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<hi>Reason,</hi> to be hereafter unfolded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears</hi> requiring rather a vulgar and ordinary <hi>Field-land,</hi>
than a rich <hi>Garden-mould,</hi> (as has been often seen to succeed
by frequent Observations) it has been found that <hi>kernels</hi> sowed in
a very high <hi>compost,</hi> and rank earth, have produced <hi>(large</hi> indeed)
but <hi>insipid</hi> Fruit, hastily rotting on the Trees, before all the parts
of it were mature. <hi>Vid. Aphor.</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>And sometimes when they seemed in outward <hi>figure</hi> to bear the
shape of graffed <hi>Apples,</hi> from whence the <hi>kernels</hi> came, yet the
gust did utterly deceive, wanting that vivacity and pungent agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40289:7"/>
If the <hi>kernels</hi> of natural <hi>Apples</hi> (or of <hi>ungraffed Trees)</hi> should
produce the same, or some other variety of <hi>Apples,</hi> (as sometimes
it succeeds) yet would this care be seldom <hi>operae pretium,</hi> and at
best but a work of <hi>Chance,</hi> the disappointment falling out so often
through the fickleness of the <hi>Soil:</hi> Or admit <hi>that</hi> the most proper
and constant, yet would the very <hi>dews</hi> and <hi>rain,</hi> by various and
mutable Seasons, and even by the <hi>Air</hi> it self, (which operates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
vulgar perception, in the very changes as well of the <hi>mould,</hi>
as of the <hi>seeds</hi> and <hi>fruit)</hi> create almost infinite alterations: And
the choice having been in all places (apparently for some <hi>thousands</hi>
of years) by propagating the most delicate of <hi>Fruits</hi> by the <hi>Graffs,</hi>
'tis almost a desperate task to attempt the raising of the <hi>like,</hi> or
<hi>better</hi> Fruit from the rudiments of the <hi>Kernel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet since our design of relieving the want of <hi>Wine,</hi> by a <hi>Succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneum</hi>
of <hi>Cider,</hi> (as lately improv'd) is a kind of <hi>Modern Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
We may encourage and commend their patience and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
who endeavour to raise several kinds of <hi>Wildings</hi> for the
tryal of that excellent Liquor; especially since by late experience
we have found, that <hi>Wildings</hi> are the more proper <hi>Cider-Fruits;</hi>
some of them growing more speedily, bearing sooner, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
and in greater abundance in leaner Land, much fuller of
<hi>juice,</hi> and that more masculine, and of a more <hi>Winy</hi> vigour.</p>
               <p>Thus the famous <hi>Red-strake</hi> of <hi>Hereford-shire</hi> is a pure <hi>Wilding,</hi>
and within the memory of some now living sirnamed the <hi>Scuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores
Crab,</hi> and then not much known save in the <hi>Neighbourhood,</hi> &amp;c.
Yet now it would be difficult to shew that <hi>Red-strake</hi> which grew
from a <hi>kernel</hi> in that whole <hi>Tract,</hi> all being since become <hi>graffed</hi>
Trees. Thus 'tis also believed, That the <hi>Bromsbury Crab</hi> (which
carries the fame in some parts of <hi>Glocester-shire)</hi> and many of the
White <hi>Musts,</hi> and Green <hi>Musts,</hi> are originally <hi>Savages;</hi> as now in
<hi>Somerset-shire</hi> they have a generous <hi>Cider</hi> made of promiscuous
<hi>kernels,</hi> or <hi>ungraffed</hi> Trees, which fills their confidence that no
other <hi>Cider</hi> does exceed it; and 'tis indeed strong, and of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
vigour.</p>
               <p>Nor dare we positively deny, but that even the best of our <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-fruit</hi>
came also originally from the <hi>kernel:</hi> For it is truly noted
by my L. <hi>Bacon, That the</hi> Fruit <hi>does generally obey the</hi> Graff, <hi>and
yields very little to the</hi> Stock; yet some little it does.</p>
               <p>The famous <hi>Bezy de Hery,</hi> an excellent Musky <hi>Pear,</hi> was brought
into the best <hi>Orchards</hi> of <hi>France</hi> from a <hi>Forest</hi> in <hi>Bretainy,</hi> where it
grew <hi>wild,</hi> and was but of late taken notice of.</p>
               <p>But now to the deep <hi>Reason</hi> we lately threatned: We have by
an Experiment found some neer affinity between the <hi>Kernel</hi> of the
<hi>Apple</hi> and the <hi>heart</hi> or interiour of the <hi>Stock: For I saw</hi> (says Dr.
<hi>Beale) an old rotten</hi> Kernel-Tree <hi>bearing a delicate</hi> Summer-fruit,
<hi>yielding store of smooth</hi> Cider, <hi>('tis call'd the</hi> French-Kernel-Tree,
<hi>and is also a</hi> Dwarf, <hi>as is the</hi> Red-strake;) <hi>and examining divers</hi>
Kernels, <hi>many years successively, of that hollow and decayed Tree, I
found them always very small of growth, and empty, meer skins of</hi>
Kernels, <hi>not unlike to the emasculated</hi> Scrotum <hi>of an</hi> Eunuch; <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40289:7"/>
younger Tree, issuing from the sounder part of a</hi> Root <hi>of the same
old Tree, had full and entire</hi> Kernels.</p>
               <p>And from some such Observation might the production of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries,</hi>
&amp;c. without <hi>Stones,</hi> be happily attempted; an <hi>Instrument</hi>
fitted to take out the <hi>marrow</hi> or <hi>pith</hi> of the <hi>Branches<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> (as the same
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Beale</hi> perform'd it;) for from the <hi>numerical</hi> Bush of that <hi>Fruit</hi>
he found <hi>some</hi> Branches produce <hi>Berberies</hi> that had no stones, <hi>others</hi>
which had; and in searching for the <hi>cause</hi> of the <hi>effect,</hi> perceived,
that the pith or heart was taken from the <hi>radicat,</hi> or main Branches,
as the other was full of pith, and consequently the fruit in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
of all which (he writes me word) he made several tryals on other
fruit, but left the place before he could see the event. But he adds;</p>
               <p>These many years (almost <hi>twenty</hi>) I have yearly tri'd <hi>Kernels in</hi>
Beds of clean <hi>Earth, Pots,</hi> and <hi>Pans,</hi> and by the very <hi>leaves</hi> (as
they appear'd in first springing for one moneth) I could discern how far
my <hi>Essays</hi> had <hi>civiliz'd</hi> 'em: The <hi>Wilder</hi> had shorter, stiffer, brown,
or fox-colour'd leaves, The more <hi>ingenuous</hi> had more tender, more
spreading leaves; and approaching the lighter verdure of the <hi>Berbery</hi>
leaf when it first appears. <hi>He adds,</hi>

                  <hi>Some</hi> Apples <hi>are call'd</hi> Rose-Apples, Rosemary-Apples, Gilly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower-Apples,
Orange-Apples, <hi>with several other adjuncts, deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
them, from what</hi> Reason <hi>I know not.</hi> But if we intended
to try such <hi>infusions</hi> upon the <hi>Kernels</hi> (as should endeavour to alter
their <hi>kinds)</hi> we should not approve of the bedabbling them with
such infusions, (for over-<hi>moisture</hi> would rather enervate than
strengthen them) but rather prepare the <hi>Earth</hi> the <hi>year before,</hi> with
such <hi>insuccations,</hi> and then hinder it from producing any <hi>Weeds,</hi>
till ready for the Kernels, and then in dewy times, and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
when our <hi>Climate</hi> were surcharg'd with <hi>rain,</hi> cover the
<hi>Beds</hi> and <hi>Pots</hi> with the small leaves of <hi>Rosemary, Gillyflowers,</hi> or
other oderiferous <hi>Blossomes,</hi> and repeat it often, to the end the <hi>dews</hi>
may <hi>meteorize,</hi> and <hi>emit</hi> their finer <hi>Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. Or if any shall
please to be so liberal of their <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Calcinations</hi> of peculiar
<hi>Virtues</hi> (though possibly the <hi>Essay</hi> may indanger their <hi>seeds)</hi> yet
the mixture of such <hi>Salts</hi> finely reduc'd and strewed discreetly on
their <hi>Beds,</hi> may be a more probable means, than those <hi>Liquid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions</hi>
which have hitherto been so confidently boasted. For thus
also we are in this <hi>Age</hi> of ours provided of more vigorous <hi>Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi>
for <hi>trials</hi> than were known to the <hi>Ancients.</hi> Finally,</p>
               <p>From what has been deduc'd from the <hi>Wilding</hi> of several parts,
it may manifestly appear, how much more <hi>congeneal</hi> some <hi>soil</hi> is
than other, to yield the best <hi>Cider-fruit</hi> from the <hi>Kernel;</hi> and the
<hi>hazzle</hi> ground, or quicker mould, much better than the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
<hi>clay</hi> or ranker earth: In hot <hi>Gravelly-Grounds,</hi> where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
no sort of <hi>Fruit</hi> will grow, <hi>Pears</hi> will thrive; and a Friend of
mine assures me, of <hi>One</hi> that clave a <hi>Rock,</hi> and filling it with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
good Earth, planted a <hi>Pear-tree</hi> therein, which prosper'd exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly:
I add this, that none may go hence without encouragement.</p>

               <p>THe former thus establish'd, after all <hi>humours</hi> and <hi>varieties</hi>
have been sufficiently wearied, we shall find the <hi>Wilding</hi> to
be the hardiest and most proper <hi>Stock</hi> for the most delicate <hi>Fruit:</hi>
This confirm'd by <hi>Varro,</hi> lib. 1. cap. 40. <hi>In quamcun<expan>

&amp;c. and 'tis with reason: However they do in <hi>Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
both in practice, and opinion, limit this <hi>Rule;</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the gust of any delicate <hi>Apple</hi> (as of the <hi>Pear-main, Quince-Apple,
Stockin,</hi> &amp;c.) rather graff upon a <hi>Gennet-Moyle</hi> or <hi>Cydod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din-Stock,</hi>
(as there call'd) than a <hi>Crab-stock;</hi> but then indeed
they conclude the Tree lasts not so long; and 'tis observ'd, That
<hi>Apples</hi> are better tasted from a clean, light land, &amp;c. than from
stiffer clay, or the more pinguid and luxurious soil, whence we
may expect some assistance from the civility of the <hi>Stock,</hi> which is
a king of prepared <hi>Soil,</hi> or foundation to the <hi>Graff;</hi> even as our
very <hi>Transplantations</hi> into better ground is likewise a kind of
<hi>Graffing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus in like manner our Master <hi>Varro, loco citato</hi> concerning
<hi>Pears; Si in Pyrum Sylvaticam</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Wild-stock</hi> does enliven
the dull and phlegmatic <hi>Apple,</hi> and the Stock of a <hi>Gennet-Moyle</hi>
sweeten and improve an <hi>Apple</hi> that seems <hi>over-tart,</hi> as the <hi>Pome-roy,</hi>
or some <hi>Greening,</hi> &amp;c. or may rather seem to abate at least some
<hi>Apple</hi> over-tart and severe.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Crab-stock</hi> would be planted about <hi>October,</hi> at thirty two
Foot distance, and not <hi>graffed</hi> till the third <hi>Spring</hi> after, or at least
not before the <hi>second.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if your design be for <hi>Orchard</hi> only, and where they are to
abide, an <hi>interval</hi> of sixteen Foot shall suffice for the <hi>Dwarfish</hi>
kind, or in the Grounds where the <hi>Red-strake,</hi> or other <hi>Fruit-trees</hi>
are of small bulk, provided the ground be yearly turn'd up with
the <hi>Spade,</hi> and the distance quadrupled where the <hi>Plough</hi> has pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge;
this being the most expedite for such as have no <hi>Nursery</hi>

               <p>MAke choice of your <hi>Graffs</hi> from a constant and well-bearing
Branch.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Stock</hi> hath a more verdant rind, and is capable to
yield more plenty of <hi>juice,</hi> so let the <hi>Graff</hi> have more <hi>Eyes</hi> or
<hi>Buds:</hi> Ordinarily three or four <hi>Eyes</hi> are sufficient to give issue to
the <hi>Sap;</hi> but as well in <hi>Apples,</hi> and <hi>Pears,</hi> as in <hi>Vines,</hi> those <hi>Graffs</hi>
or <hi>Cions</hi> are preferr'd in which the <hi>buds</hi> are not too far asunder,
or distant from the foot thereof: and such a number of <hi>buds</hi> usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
determining the length of the <hi>Graff,</hi> there may divers <hi>Cions</hi>
be made of one <hi>Branch,</hi> where you cannot procure plenty of them
for severals.</p>
               <p>As to the success of <hi>graffing<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> the main point is, to joyn the inward
<hi>rind</hi> of the <hi>Cion</hi> to the inward rind of the <hi>Stock,</hi> so that the <hi>sap</hi> of
the <hi>One,</hi> may <hi>there</hi> meet with the sap of the <hi>Other,</hi> and these parts
should be joyn'd closely, but not too forceably; that being the
best and most infallible way, by which most of the quick and jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
parts are mutually united, especially towards the bottom.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Stock</hi> be so big as to endanger the pinching of your <hi>Graff,</hi>
when the <hi>wedge</hi> is drawn out of the <hi>cleft,</hi> let the inner side of the
<hi>Graff,</hi> which is within the wood of the <hi>Stock,</hi> be left the thicker,
that so the <hi>woody</hi> part of the <hi>Cion</hi> may bear the stress, and the <hi>sappy</hi>
part be preserved from bruising. Some by an happy-hand, do
with good success <hi>Graff</hi> without cleaving the <hi>Stock</hi> at all, only by
<hi>Incisions</hi> in the <hi>Rind,</hi> as the <hi>Industrious</hi> Mr. <hi>Austin</hi> teaches us:
But since this is not for every <hi>Rustic</hi> hand, nor seems to fortifie
so strongly against impetuous <hi>Winds,</hi> before the Union be <hi>secure,</hi>
there had need be some extraordinary <hi>defence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Choose the streightest and smoothest part of the <hi>Stock</hi> for the
place where you intend to <hi>graff:</hi> if the <hi>Stock</hi> be all knotty (which
some esteem no impediment) or crooked, rectifie it with the fittest
posture of the <hi>Graff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a <hi>Graff</hi> covet not a <hi>Cions</hi> too slender; for the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Wind</hi>
will sooner enforce it to wither: Yet are we to distinguish, that
for <hi>Inoculation,</hi> we take the <hi>Bud</hi> from a sprig of the last years
sh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ot; and most allow that the <hi>Cions</hi> should also have some of the
former with it, that it may be the stronger to <hi>graff,</hi> and abide to
be put close into the <hi>Stock,</hi> which is thought to advance it in
bearing.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Hereford-shire</hi> they do frequently choose a <hi>Graff</hi> of several
years growth; and for the <hi>graffing</hi> of such large <hi>Stocks</hi> as are taken
out of the <hi>Woods</hi> or <hi>Nurseries,</hi> and fitted into rows for <hi>Orchards,</hi>
they choose not the <hi>Graffs</hi> so small as in other Countries they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40289:9"/>
them; which has, it seems, occasion'd some complaint from
them that understand not the Reason of the first branch of this
Note. Once for all, the stumpy <hi>Graff</hi> will be found much supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the slender one, and make a much nobler and larger Shoot.
This upon experience.</p>
               <p>Graff your <hi>Cions</hi> on that side of the <hi>Stock</hi> where it may receive
the least hurt from the <hi>South-west</hi> Wind, it being the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and most violent that blows in <hi>Summer;</hi> so as the <hi>wind</hi> may
blow <hi>it</hi> to the <hi>Stock,</hi> not from it: And when the <hi>Zephyres</hi> of the
<hi>Spring</hi> are stirring, choose that <hi>Season</hi> before all others for this
work.</p>
               <p>Some there are who talk of removing the <hi>Stock</hi> about <hi>Christmas,</hi>
and then also <hi>graff</hi> it; which there be that glory they can succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
do even by the fire side, and so not be forc'd to expect a two
or three years rooting of the <hi>Stock;</hi> But in this <hi>Adventure</hi> 'tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseable
to plunge the <hi>Graff</hi> three or four inches deep in the <hi>Stock.</hi>
Lastly,</p>
               <p>Be careful that the <hi>Rain</hi> get not into the <hi>clefts</hi> of your young
graffed <hi>Stocks:</hi> Yet it has been noted, That many old Trees (quite
decay'd with an inward hollowness) have born as full burdens, and
constantly, as the very soundest, and the Fruit found to be more
delicate than usually the same kind from a perfect and more entire
Stock.</p>
               <p>Except some former case requires it, leave not your <hi>Graffs</hi> above
four, five, or (at most) six inches of length above the <hi>Stock;</hi> for
by the length it draws more feebly, and is more expos'd to the
shocks of the <hi>Wind,</hi> or hurt by the <hi>Birds;</hi> and you shall frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive the summities and tops of such young <hi>Graffs</hi> to be
mortified and die.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genet-moyle</hi> is commonly propagated by cutting off the
<hi>Branch</hi> a little below a <hi>Burr-knot,</hi> and setting it without any more
Ceremony; but if they be also <hi>graffed</hi> first as they grow on the
<hi>Tree,</hi> and when they have <hi>covered</hi> the <hi>head,</hi> cut off below the
<hi>Burr,</hi> and set, it is far better: In this separation cut a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the <hi>Burr,</hi> and <hi>peel</hi> off, or <hi>prick</hi> the <hi>Bark,</hi> almost to the <hi>knot:</hi>
Thus also if the <hi>Branch</hi> have more <hi>knots</hi> than <hi>one,</hi> you may <hi>graff,</hi>
and <hi>cut off</hi> yearly, till within half a foot of the very <hi>stem,</hi> which
you may <hi>graff</hi> likewise, and so let stand.</p>
               <p>Now for encouragement in transporting <hi>Graffs</hi> at great distance,
we find that with little care (their tops uncut and unbruis'd) they
will hold good, and may support the transportation by <hi>Sea</hi> or
<hi>Land</hi> from <hi>October</hi> or <hi>November</hi> to the very end of <hi>March: See
Sir H. Plat</hi>'s <hi>Offers,</hi> Paragr. 75. To which may be added, That if
the <hi>Graff</hi> receives no hurt by lying in the <hi>Stock</hi> expos'd to all rain,
dews, and severities of <hi>Winter</hi> frosts from <hi>December</hi> to <hi>Spring,</hi> (as
has been experimentally noted); then (by a stronger presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
in oyled, or rather waxen Leather, it may undoubtedly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape.
Some prescribe, That the <hi>ends</hi> shall be stuck in a <hi>Turnip:</hi>
and many excellent <hi>Graffers (Gentlemen</hi> some of very good credit)
have assured us, That the <hi>Graffs</hi> which seemed withered, and fit
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40289:9"/>
to be cast away, have proved the best when tri'd. Thus in honest
<hi>Barnaby Googes</hi> noble <hi>Heresbachius</hi> you will find it commended to
gather your <hi>Cions</hi> in the <hi>wane</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> at least ten days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you <hi>graff</hi> them; and <hi>Constantine</hi> gives this reason for it, That
the <hi>Graff</hi> a little withered, and thirsty, may be the better recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the <hi>Stock:</hi> I know some who keep them in <hi>Earth,</hi> from
the end of <hi>October,</hi> till the <hi>Spring,</hi> and will hardly use them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
There are also other inducements for this practice, as <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Harwood, pag.</hi> 4. has shew'd us; but none beyond our own
<hi>experience,</hi> who have known <hi>Graffs</hi> gathered in <hi>December</hi> thrive
and do perfectly well.</p>
               <p>The best expedient to <hi>convey</hi> Graffs is to stick the <hi>cut-ends</hi> in
<hi>Clay,</hi> envelop'd with a <hi>clout</hi> to preserve it from falling off; and to
wrap the other part of the Twigs in dry <hi>Hay</hi> or <hi>straw-bands,</hi> which
will secure them both from the Winds, Galling, and other inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in Transportation: Nay, I have known them sent many
<hi>hundred Miles</hi> from <hi>beyond</hi> the <hi>Seas</hi> accommodated to an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Letter, and though somewhat short, and with very few <hi>Buds,</hi>
yet with excellent success; and if this course were more universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider'd, we might be furnish'd with many great <hi>Curiosities</hi>
with little difficulty or charge.</p>

               <p>IF any man would have <hi>variety</hi> of unexpected and unknown
<hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears,</hi> for the improvement of <hi>Cider,</hi> or <hi>Palate-fruit,</hi>
there is more hope from <hi>Kernels</hi> rais'd in the <hi>Nursery</hi> (as has
already been directed) than from such tryals of <hi>graffings</hi> as we have
yet seen in present use.</p>
               <p>But if we would recover the patience, and the sedulity of the
<hi>Antient</hi> (of which some brief account will follow) or listen to
some unusual Proposals, then may we undertake for some variety
by <hi>Insitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To delude none with Promises, we do much rather recommend
the diligence of enquiring from all <hi>Countries</hi> the best <hi>Graffs</hi> of
such <hi>Fruits</hi> as are already found excellent for the purpose we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
As from the <hi>Turgovians</hi> for that Pear of which Dr. <hi>Pell</hi> gives
so good and weighty informations; and of which I had presented
me some <hi>Graffs,</hi> together with a tast of the most superlative <hi>Perry</hi>
the <hi>World</hi> certainly produces; both which were brought near 800
Miles, without suffering the least diminution of Excellency, by my

1666, and tasting as high, and as rich as ever to the <hi>present</hi> year I
am writing this <hi>Paragraph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as some sorts are to be enquired after for the <hi>Palate</hi> and the

                  <hi>Table,</hi> so 'tis now our main business to search after such as are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for their <hi>Liquor,</hi> either as more <hi>pleasant,</hi> more <hi>winy,</hi> or more
<hi>lasting;</hi> of which sort the <hi>Bosbury bare-land</hi>-Pear excels. The

call'd the <hi>Oaken-pin,</hi> as the best for <hi>Cider;</hi> though for suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

                  </hi> to oblige the <hi>emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of other <hi>Countries,</hi> 'till they find out a <hi>Fruit</hi> which shall excell
it, and which we do most heartily wish.</p>
               <p>But to pursue the diligence of the <hi>Antients,</hi> we direct the eye
to a general expedient for all kinde of <hi>varieties</hi> imaginable, and
which we hold far better than to present the World with a <hi>List</hi> of
the particulars either known, or experimented: For who indeed
but a <hi>Fool</hi> will dare to tell <hi>Wonders</hi> in this severe <hi>Age,</hi> and upon an
<hi>Argument</hi> which is so environ'd with <hi>Imposture</hi> in most <hi>Writers</hi> old
or new? Much less pretend to <hi>Experiments</hi> which may fail to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
by default of an unhappy <hi>occasion,</hi> when the <hi>conclusion</hi> must
be <hi>Penes Authorem sit fides!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly men receive no small discouragement from the ugly
affronts of <hi>Clowns,</hi> and less cultivated persons, who laugh and scorn
at every thing which is above their understanding: For example;
<hi>I knew a man</hi> (writes Dr. <hi>Beale</hi> to me) <hi>and he a most diligent</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>and</hi> Graffer, <hi>who for thirty or fourty years made innumerable</hi> Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says
<hi>to produce some</hi> change <hi>of an</hi> Apple <hi>by Graffing: It seems he was
ambitious to leave his</hi> Name <hi>on such a</hi> Fruit, <hi>if</hi> he <hi>could have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it; but always fail'd; for he perpetually made his</hi> Trials <hi>upon</hi>
Crab-stocks, <hi>or such (at least) as did not greatly differ from the</hi> kind;
<hi>and he ever found that the</hi> Graff <hi>would</hi> praedominate. And how
infinitely such Men having lost their own aims, will despise better
<hi>Advice,</hi> we leave to observation.</p>
               <p>However, let us add, That where nothing is more facile than
to raise new kinds of <hi>Apples (in infinitum)</hi> from <hi>Kernels:</hi> Yet in that
<hi>Apple-Country</hi> (so much addicted to <hi>Orchards)</hi> we could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
more than <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> persons that did believe it: But in
other places we meet with many that, on the other side, repute
<hi>Wildings,</hi> or (as they call them) <hi>Kernel-fruit,</hi> at all adventure, and
without choice, to be the very best of <hi>Cider-fruit,</hi> and to make
the most noble Liquor. So much does the common judgment dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in several <hi>Countries,</hi> though at no considerable distance, even
in <hi>matters</hi> of visible <hi>Fact,</hi> and <hi>epidemical</hi> experience.</p>
               <p>It has been soberly affirmed, that by <hi>graffing</hi> any <hi>White Apple</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an <hi>Elm,</hi> it changes the <hi>Apple,</hi> and particularly to a <hi>red</hi> colour:
I have a Direction where we may be eye-witnesses of the proof;
whatever the Truth of it be, we are not over-hastily to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<hi>Hercules</hi>'s <hi>Pillars;</hi> but rather to encourage the <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To gratifie yet the <hi>Ingenious,</hi> instruct others, and emancipate
us all from these <hi>bastinado Clowns,</hi> we are furnish'd with many <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi>
and proofs to assure a good success, at least for <hi>variety</hi> and
<hi>change,</hi> if not for infinite <hi>choice:</hi> Two or three antient <hi>References</hi>
being duly praemis'd; namely, First,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:40289:10"/>
1. That 'tis in vain to expect change of <hi>Apples</hi> from <hi>Graffing</hi>
upon differing <hi>Stocks</hi> of <hi>Crabs</hi> or <hi>Apples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In vain also are we to look for a kind Tree from a very much

               <p>It is one thing to find the kindest <hi>Stock</hi> for the Improvement

<hi>Vine,</hi> (whose root makes best shift for relief) to accept the <hi>Graff</hi>
of the more delicate <hi>Vine;</hi> the <hi>White Pear-Plum Stock,</hi> for the <hi>Abri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot,</hi>
&amp;c. And another thing it is to seek the <hi>Stock</hi> which begets the
wonder, variety, and that same transcendent and particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
we inquire after: For this must be at more remote di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
and we offer from the <hi>Ancients</hi> to shew, how it may be at
any distance whatsoever: But the whole expedient seems to be
hinted by Sir <hi>H. Plat, pag.</hi> 72. where he affirms, that <hi>If two Trees
grow together, that be apt to be graffed one into another, then let one
branch into another, workmanly joyning Sap to Sap.</hi> This our <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
call <hi>Graffing by Approach,</hi> and is explicated at large by <hi>Columella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in this express <hi>Rule</hi> he is too narrow for our purpose, and
far short of old experience; as we find in <hi>Parag.</hi> 63. where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
<hi>We may not graff a contrary Fruit thereon.</hi> Against <hi>this</hi> we
urge; That any contrary <hi>Fruit</hi> may be adventured, and any
Fruit upon any fruitless <hi>Stock</hi> growing in propinquity in the same
<hi>Nursery;</hi> as it is not only affirm'd, but seriously undertaken, and
experimentally proved by the sober <hi>Columella,</hi> in several of his
Treatises; Turn to the <hi>eleventh</hi> Chapter of his <hi>fifth</hi> Book, <hi>(Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi>
Edition:) <hi>Sed cum antiqui negaverint posse omne genus surcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum
in omnem Arborem inseri, &amp; illam quasi finitionem, qua nos
paulÃ² ante usi sumus, veluti quandam legem sanxerint, eos tantÃ¹m
surculos posse coalescere, qui sint cortice, ac libro, &amp; fructu consimiles
iis arboribus quibus inseruntur, existimavimus errorem hujus opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis
discutiendum, tradendÃ¡mque posteris rationem, qua possit omne
genus surculi omni generi Arboris inseri.</hi> And the example follows
in a <hi>Graff</hi> of an <hi>Olive</hi> into a <hi>Fig-stock</hi> by <hi>Approach</hi> (as we call it,)
which he also repeats in the twenty seventh <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Book
<hi>De Arboribus,</hi> without altering a syllable. But possibly in this
<hi>check</hi> at the <hi>Ancient</hi> he might aim at old <hi>Varro,</hi> whom we find
threatning no less than <hi>Thunderbolts</hi> and <hi>Blasts</hi> to those who should
attempt these strange <hi>Marriages,</hi> and did not sort the <hi>Graff</hi> with
the <hi>Tree;</hi> consult <hi>lib. 1. cap.</hi> 40. And yet you may see this <hi>Art</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
by <hi>Columella</hi> for his own invention (1500 years since) to be
no news to <hi>Varro</hi> 200 years older; where he goes on, <hi>Est altera
species ex arbore in arborem inserendi nuper animadversa in arboribus
propinquis,</hi> &amp;c. Though here again we may question our Masters
<hi>nuper animadversa</hi> too; since before he was born <hi>Cato</hi> relates it
as usual to <hi>Graff</hi> Vines in the manner by them prescribed, <hi>cap.</hi> 41.
<hi>Tertia insitio est: Terebra vitem quam inseres,</hi> &amp;c. Which by the
way makes us admire how the witty <hi>Walchius</hi> in his Discourse <hi>De
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40289:11"/>
vitibus fructuariis,</hi> pag. 265. could recount the <hi>graffing</hi> of <hi>Vines</hi>
amongst the wonders of <hi>Modern Inventions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it seems <hi>Varro</hi> and his <hi>Contemporaries</hi> did extend the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
beyond <hi>Cato;</hi> and <hi>Columella</hi> proceeded further than <hi>Varro,</hi>
even to all sorts of Trees, however differing in nature, quality,
bark, or season: And then <hi>Palladius</hi> assumes the result, and gives
us the particulars of the success in his <hi>Poem, De Insitionibus.</hi> And
to these four as in chief (no phantastical or counterfeit persons) we
refer the Industrious.</p>
               <p>But be pleas'd to take this note also: As soon as your <hi>Graff</hi> hath
attained to a <hi>second,</hi> or at farthest a <hi>third</hi> years growth, take it
off the <hi>Stock,</hi> and then graff it upon a <hi>Stock</hi> of a more <hi>natural</hi>
kind: For in our own <hi>Trials</hi> we have found a <hi>graff</hi> prosper the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
year exceeding well; yet the third the whole growth at once
blasted quite to the very <hi>Stock,</hi> as if <hi>Varro</hi>'s Augurs had said the
word.</p>
               <p>To this add, the making use of such <hi>Stocks</hi> as in this <hi>Experiment</hi>
may contribute some special aid to several kinds of humane <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities:</hi>
As suppose the <hi>Birch</hi> Tree for the <hi>Stone,</hi> the <hi>Elm</hi> for
<hi>Fevers,</hi> &amp;c. For 'tis evident, that by such <hi>Insitions,</hi> the <hi>Branch</hi>
may convert the <hi>Sap</hi> of the <hi>Root</hi> even of another <hi>species</hi> into its
own nature, and alter all its <hi>properties;</hi> though in <hi>some</hi> they <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi>
as the <hi>Branch</hi> of the <hi>Apple</hi> in the <hi>Rhamnus,</hi> or <hi>Mezerea,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a <hi>Purgative</hi> quality. And by these means why may not the
<hi>Fruit</hi> by effectual <hi>Marriages</hi> be rendred <hi>Cordial, Astringent, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
Sudorific, Soporiferous,</hi> and even <hi>Deliterious</hi> and Mortal:
But this we only hint.</p>
               <p>Moreover, To <hi>graff</hi> rather the <hi>Wilding,</hi> or <hi>Crab,</hi> than the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi>
because the <hi>Wilding</hi> is the more natural; and <hi>Nature</hi> does
more delight in <hi>progress,</hi> than to be <hi>Retrograde</hi> and go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>I should also expect far more advance from a more <hi>pungent sap,</hi>
than from <hi>Insipid;</hi> as generally we see the best and vigorous <hi>juices</hi>
to salute our <hi>Palats</hi> with a more agreeable <hi>piquancy</hi> and tartness;
for so we find the rellish of the <hi>Stocking-Apple, Golden Pepin, Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
Eliot, Harvy,</hi> and all (both <hi>Russetings</hi> and <hi>Greenings)</hi> to be
more poignant than of others.</p>
               <p>And here we note from <hi>Palladius,</hi> That the <hi>Ancients</hi> had the
success which we all, and particularly Sir <hi>H. Plat,</hi> does so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny, as in the particular of <hi>graffing</hi> the <hi>Apple</hi> on the <hi>Pear, &amp;

               <p>Lastly, We did by unexpected chance find the facility of <hi>graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing</hi>
the very youngest <hi>Stocks,</hi> even of one years growth, by the
<hi>Root:</hi> At a second removal of the <hi>Stocks</hi> (being then of two years
growth) we observed some <hi>Roots</hi> so fast closed together into one,
as not to be divorced: Hereupon we concluded, If casualty, or
negligence, chance of spade, or oppression of neighbourhood did
this, by <hi>Art</hi> it might be done more effectually, and possibly to
some desirable purpose; for that then the <hi>stock</hi> was more apt to
receive a mastering <hi>Impression;</hi> and any <hi>Garden</hi> Plant whatsoever
might by this <hi>process</hi> interchange and mingle their <hi>Roots.</hi> But this
can extend no farther than the <hi>Stock</hi> may prevail with the <hi>Graff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we have presented our diligent <hi>Ciderist</hi> with what Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
and Arguments of Encouragement, grounded on fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<hi>Experience,</hi> we have received from our most ingenious <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondents,</hi>
especially the Learned and truly Candid D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Beale,</hi> in
whose <hi>Person</hi> we have so long entertain'd you: and to these we
could add sundry others, were it not now time (whiles we discourse
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40289:12"/>
of <hi>possibilities</hi>) to conclude with something <hi>certain,</hi> and to speak
of what we have.</p>
               <p>For the kinds then of <hi>Cider-Apples</hi> in being; <hi>Glocester-shire</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
the <hi>Bromsbury Crab;</hi> It affords a smart, winy <hi>Liquor,</hi> and is
peculiarly hardy, but not so proper for a cold and late-bearing
<hi>Climate,</hi> it being not <hi>ripe</hi> in <hi>hot Land</hi> till the end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> nor
fit to be ground for <hi>Cider</hi> till <hi>Christmas,</hi> lying so long in heaps and
preparation.</p>
               <p>It is in the same <hi>Shire</hi> that they likewise much esteem of the
<hi>white</hi> and <hi>red Must-Apple,</hi> the sweetest as well as sowrest <hi>Pepin,</hi> and
the <hi>Harvy-Apple,</hi> which (being boyl'd) some prefer to the very best
of all <hi>Ciders;</hi> though from any experience we have yet seen, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
recommend it, and it will want more particular and infallible
<hi>Directions</hi> before we can be reconciled to the <hi>Adventure,</hi> which we
have observed so frequently to miscarry.</p>
               <p>But about <hi>London,</hi> and the more Southern <hi>Tracts,</hi> the <hi>Pepin,</hi> and
especially the <hi>Golden,</hi> is esteemed for the making of the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
of that <hi>Liquor,</hi> most wholesom, and most restorative; and
indeed it may (in my poor judgment) challenge those <hi>perfections</hi>
with very good reason.</p>
               <p>By others the <hi>Pearmain</hi> alone is thought to come in competition
with the best; but, say they, the <hi>Cider</hi> is for the most part found
of the weakest, unless encourag'd with some agreeable <hi>Pepin</hi> to
inspirit it; whereas <hi>this</hi> is to be taken according to the constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Fruit;</hi> for even <hi>Pepins</hi> do differ as much from <hi>Pepins</hi> in
Tast and Liquor, as the <hi>Kind,</hi> and the <hi>Soil</hi> dispose them; nay,
though of the same <hi>Species;</hi> so as the <hi>Cider</hi> of the <hi>Pearmain</hi>
(though likewise very different) does not seldom exceed it in that
briskness which others attribute to the <hi>Pepin,</hi> which is for the
most part more smooth and less <hi>poinant:</hi> I conceive a good way
of extracting the <hi>Spirits</hi> of these <hi>Fruits,</hi> might prove a likely <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion</hi>
to ground our judgments on in all these niceties; whilst by
the way, we may note, that of all <hi>Apples,</hi> that bear one general
Name, the <hi>Pepin</hi> seems the most to differ; and the <hi>Cider</hi> from the
genuine <hi>Cider-Fruit,</hi> keeps nearest to the same strength and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</p>
               <p>Some commend the <hi>Fox-Whelp;</hi> and the <hi>Gennet-Moyle</hi> was once
preferr'd to the very <hi>Red-strake,</hi> and before the <hi>Bromsbury-Crab;</hi>
but upon more mature consideration, the very <hi>Criticks</hi> themselves
now <hi>Recant,</hi> as being too effeminate and soft for a <hi>judicious</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Red-strake</hi> then amongst these accurate <hi>Tasters</hi> hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the absolute praeeminence of all other <hi>Cider-fruit,</hi> especially in
<hi>Hereford-shire,</hi>

                     <hi>See</hi> Aph. 42, 45, 37.</note> as being the richest and most <hi>vinous</hi> Liquor, and
now with the more earnestness commended to our practice, for its
celerity in becoming an <hi>Orchard,</hi> being ordinarily as full of <hi>Fruit</hi> at
<hi>ten</hi> years growth as other Trees are at <hi>twenty;</hi> the <hi>Pepin</hi> or <hi>Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi>
at thirty: And lastly, from that no contemptible quality,
That though the smiles of it intice even on the <hi>Tree,</hi> as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
better than most other <hi>Table-fruits</hi> whilst hanging, yet it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40289:12"/>
needs no <hi>Priapus</hi> for Protector, since (as beautiful as 'tis) it has
no such temptation to the <hi>Tast,</hi> 'till it be either <hi>baked,</hi> or convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>Cider.</hi> The same may be affirmed also of the <hi>Broms-bery-Crab,
Bareland-Pear,</hi> and many other <hi>Wildings,</hi> who are no less at
their <hi>Self-defence;</hi> yet the <hi>Gennet-Moyle</hi> at due <hi>maturity,</hi> has both
a gentle, and agreeable relish; their unagreeableness to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
(as else-where noted) proceeding only from the separation
the <hi>juice</hi> makes from the <hi>Pulp,</hi> which even <hi>Children</hi> do remedy by
<hi>contusing</hi> them on their sharpned Elbows; which (if throughly
weigh'd) seems to <hi>dispute,</hi> if not <hi>overthrow</hi> some <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of
<hi>Fermentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In sum, The <hi>Red-strake</hi> will at three years <hi>graffing</hi> give you fair
hopes, and last almost an hundred years; if from sundry mens
<hi>Experience</hi> of more than 60 years, we may divine, and that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with the <hi>Soyl.</hi> And the <hi>Gennet-Moyles</hi> hasten to an <hi>Orchard</hi>
for <hi>Cider</hi> without trouble of <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Graffing:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See C. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>'s Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
                  </note> But note, That this
<hi>Tree</hi> is very apt to contract a <hi>bur-knot</hi> near its Trunk, where it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to divide; and being cut off under that <hi>boss,</hi> commonly
grows (if so set) and becomes speedily a Tree, except it encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an extraordinary dry <hi>Summer</hi> the first year to give it check.
And though the knack of <hi>graffing</hi> be so obvious, yet this more
appearing facility does so please the lazy <hi>Clowns,</hi> that in some
places they neither have nor desire any other <hi>Orchards;</hi> and how
this humour prevails you may perceive by the hasty progress of
our <hi>Kentish Codlin</hi> in most parts of <hi>England.</hi> But this hasty growth
and maturity of the <hi>Tree</hi> is by another <hi>Instance</hi> confirm'd to us
from that worthy <hi>Gent.</hi> Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> of <hi>Orleton,</hi> who writes me
word, that some of the rejected Spray, or Prunings of the <hi>Gennet-Moyle,</hi>
taken by chance to <hi>rice</hi> a Plot of <hi>Pease</hi> (though stuck into
the Earth but at <hi>April)</hi> put forth root, grew, blossom'd, and bore
<hi>Apples</hi> the same year.</p>
               <p>But to advance again our <hi>Red-strake,</hi> even above the <hi>Pepin,</hi> and
the rest (besides the celerity of the improvement and constant
burthen) consider we the most incredible product, since we may
expect from each <hi>Apple</hi> more than double the quantity; so as in the
same <hi>Orchard,</hi> under the same <hi>culture,</hi> thirty <hi>Red-strake</hi> Trees shall
at ten years <hi>graffing</hi> yield more <hi>Cider</hi> than a <hi>hundred</hi> of those <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins,</hi>
and surmount them in proportion during their period at least
sixty or seventy years: So that granting the <hi>Cider</hi> of the <hi>Golden-Pepin</hi>
should excel, (which with some is precarious) yet 'tis in no
wise proper for a <hi>Cider-Orchard,</hi> according to our general design,
not by half so <hi>soon bearing,</hi> nor so <hi>constantly,</hi> nor in that <hi>quantity,</hi>
nor <hi>fulness</hi> or <hi>security.</hi>

               <p>Concerning <hi>Perry,</hi> the <hi>Horse-Pear</hi> and <hi>Bare-land-Pear</hi> are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

<hi>vinous</hi> Liquor.<note place="margin">Aph. 43.</note> The Experienced prefer the <hi>tawny</hi> or <hi>ruddy</hi> sort,<note place="margin">Aph. 34.</note>
as the colour of all other most proper for <hi>Perry:</hi> They will grow

harsh that there is nothing more safe from plunder, when even a

it may assume the Ornament of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and flourish in the <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunx.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be <hi>shallow</hi> Land, or must be rais'd with high <hi>Ridges,</hi> then
'tis necessary to have more regard of planting on the <hi>tops</hi> of those
eminencies, and to excuse the unavoydable breach of the <hi>decussis,</hi>
as my Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> excuseth the defect of our humane <hi>Phansies</hi> in
the <hi>Constellations,</hi> which obey the <hi>Omnipotent</hi> order rather than
ours: Add to this the rigour of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> which approves
more of <hi>plainness</hi> and <hi>usefulness,</hi> than of <hi>niceness</hi> and <hi>curiosity;</hi>
whiles many putting themselves to the vast charge of levelling their
grounds, oftentimes make them but the worse; since where the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are full of gastly inequalities, there may be planted some sorts
of <hi>Cider-fruit,</hi> which is apt by the great burden to be press'd down
to the ground, and there (whiles it hides <hi>Irregularities)</hi> to bear
much better, and abundantly beyond belief; for so have been seen
many such recumbent <hi>Pear-trees</hi> bear each of them <hi>two, three,</hi> yea,
even to <hi>six</hi> or more <hi>Hogsheads</hi> yearly.</p>
               <p>And for this <hi>Cider,</hi> whiles we prefer some sorts of <hi>Wildings</hi>
which do not tempt the <hi>palate</hi> of a <hi>Thief,</hi> by the caution we shall not
provoke any man to repent his charge from the necessity of richer
and more reserv'd <hi>Enclosures;</hi> Though we have frequently seen
divers <hi>Orchards</hi> successfully planted on very poor <hi>Arable,</hi> and even
in stony <hi>Gleab, gravel</hi> and <hi>clay,</hi> and that pretty high, on the sides
and declivities of <hi>Hills,</hi> where it only bears very short grass, like
to the most ordinary <hi>Common,</hi> not worth the charge of <hi>Tillage:</hi>
And yet even there the <hi>Tenants</hi> and <hi>Confiners</hi> sometimes enclose it
for the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and find their reward, though not equally to such
<hi>Orchards</hi> as are planted on better ground, and in the Vallies.
Hence we suggest, That if there be no <hi>Statute</hi> for it, 'twere to be
wished there were a <hi>Law</hi> which should allow <hi>endeavours</hi> of this
nature out of the <hi>Common-field,</hi> to enclose for these <hi>Encouragements,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:40289:13"/>
since both the <hi>Publick</hi> and the <hi>Poor</hi> (whatever the clamour is) are
advantaged by such <hi>Enclosures,</hi> as <hi>Tusser</hi> in his old Rhimes, and
all indifferent observers apprehend with good reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>True indeed it is, That all Land is not fit for</hi> Orcharding, <hi>so as
even where to form just</hi> Inclosures<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>being either too</hi> shallow <hi>and</hi> dry,
<hi>or too</hi> wet <hi>and</hi> sterving: But this <hi>(saith the judicious M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  </hi> Buckland)
we may aver, That there are few <hi>Parishes,</hi> or <hi>Hamlets</hi> in <hi>England</hi>
where there are not some fat and deep <hi>Headlands</hi> capable of <hi>Rows</hi> of
<hi>Trees;</hi> and that (as hath been said) the raised <hi>Banks</hi> of all <hi>Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
generally by the advantage of the depth, fatness, and health of
their Mould, yield ready opportunity for planting; (yea, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Countrys</hi> multitudes of <hi>Crab-stocks</hi> fit to be <hi>graffed;)</hi> in which
latter <hi>(saith he)</hi> I have frequently observed very goodly Fruit-bearing
Trees, when in the same soil <hi>Trees</hi> in <hi>Orchards</hi> have been poor and
worth nothing. <hi>To conclude,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the soil be very bad and unkind, any other <hi>Fruit</hi> (which it
may more freely yield without requiring much depth, and less
<hi>Sun</hi>) may be planted instead of <hi>Apples.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Of Transplanting, and Distance.</head>
               <p>THe most proper season for <hi>Transplanting</hi> is before the hard
Frosts of <hi>Winter</hi> surprize you, and that is a competent
while before <hi>Christmas:</hi> And the main point is, to see that the
<hi>Roots</hi> be larger than the <hi>Head;</hi> and the more ways that extends,
the better and firmer.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Stock</hi> seems able to stand on its own three or four legs (as
we may call 'em,) and then after settlement some stones be heaped
or laid about it, as it were gently wedging it fast, and safe from
Winds (which <hi>stones</hi> may after the second or third year be removed)
it will salve from the main danger: For if the <hi>Roots</hi> be much sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the first <hi>Spring,</hi> it will hardly recover it.</p>
               <p>You may transplant a <hi>Fruit-Tree</hi> almost at any tolerable <hi>season</hi> of
the <hi>Year,</hi> especially if you apprehend it may be spent before you
have finish'd your work, having many to remove: Thus, let your
<hi>Trees</hi> be taken up about <hi>Allhallontide,</hi> (or as soon as the <hi>leaf</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to fall); then having trimm'd and quickned the <hi>Roots,</hi> set
them in a <hi>Pit,</hi> forty, fifty, or a hundred together, yet so as they
may be covered with mould, and kept very fresh: By the <hi>Spring</hi>
they will be found well cured of their <hi>wounds,</hi> and so ready to
strike <hi>root</hi> and put forth, that being <hi>Transplanted</hi> where they are
to stand, they will take suddenly, and seldom fail; whereas being
thus cut at <hi>Spring</hi> they recover with greater hazard.</p>
               <p>The very <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Trees</hi> planted in the ground, and buried
within a quarter of an Inch, or little more, of the level of the <hi>Bed,</hi>
will sprout, and grow to be very good <hi>Stocks.</hi> This and the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40289:14"/>
other being Experiments of our own, we thought convenient to
mention.</p>
               <p>By the oft removal of a <hi>Wild-stock,</hi> cutting the ends of the
<hi>Roots,</hi> and dis-branching somewhat of the <hi>Head</hi> at every <hi>change</hi>
of <hi>place,</hi> it will greatly abate of its natural <hi>wildness,</hi> and in time
bring forth more <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>ingenuous</hi> Fruit: Thus <hi>Gillyflowers</hi> do
(by oft removals, and at <hi>full-Moon</hi> especially) increase and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
the leaves.</p>
               <p>Plant not too <hi>deep;</hi> for the <hi>over-turf</hi> is always richer than the
<hi>next</hi> Mould. How material it is to keep the <hi>coast</hi> or side of the
<hi>Stock,</hi> as well in <hi>Fruit-trees</hi> as in <hi>Forest,</hi> we have sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss'd;
nor is the Negative to be prov'd.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>distance</hi> in <hi>Fields,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Aph.</hi> 35.</note> they may be set from <hi>thirty two</hi> to <hi>sixty</hi>

               <p>We have in our <hi>Sylva</hi> treated in particular of this, as of one of
the most material <hi>obstacles;</hi> wherein yet we did purposely omit
one <hi>Expedient,</hi> which came then to our hands from the very Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Mr. <hi>Buckland</hi> to the Learned Dr. <hi>Beal:</hi> You shall have it in
his own words.</p>
               <p>This of <hi>Fencing</hi> single <hi>Trees</hi> useth to be done by <hi>Rails</hi> at great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
or by <hi>Hedges</hi> and <hi>Bushes,</hi> which every other year must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd,
and the <hi>materials</hi> not to be had in all places neither. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prefer and commend to you the ensuing form of <hi>Planting</hi> and
<hi>Fencing,</hi> which is more cheap and easie, and which hath other <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages</hi>
in it, and not commonly known. I never saw it but <hi>once,</hi>
and that imperfectly perform'd; but have practis'd it <hi>my self</hi> with
<hi>success:</hi> Take it thus.</p>
               <p>Set your <hi>Tree</hi> on the <hi>Green-swarth,</hi> or five or six <hi>inches</hi> under it
if the <hi>soil</hi> be very healthy; if <hi>moist</hi> or <hi>weeping,</hi> half a foot above it;
then cut a <hi>Trench</hi> round that <hi>Tree,</hi> two foot or more in the <hi>cleare</hi>
from it: Lay a rank of the <hi>Turfs,</hi> with the <hi>grass</hi> outward, upon the
<hi>inner</hi> side of the <hi>Trench</hi> towards your <hi>Plant,</hi> and then a <hi>second</hi> rank
upon the former, and so a <hi>third,</hi> and <hi>fourth,</hi> all orderly plac'd, (<hi>as</hi>

a <hi>Pyramide,</hi> or larger <hi>Hop-hill:</hi> Always as you place a row of <hi>Turfs</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:40289:14"/>
in compass, you must fill up the <hi>inner</hi> part of the <hi>Circle</hi> with the loose
Earth of the second <hi>spit</hi> which you dig out of your <hi>Trench,</hi> and which
is to be two foot and half wide, or more, as you desire to mount the
<hi>hillock,</hi> which by this means you will have rais'd about your <hi>Plant</hi>
near three foot in heighth. At the <hi>point</hi> it needs not be above two

                  <item>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> The <hi>grazing bank</hi> will recompence the nigardly <hi>Farmer</hi> for
the waste of his <hi>Ditch,</hi> which otherwise he will sorely bethink.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In the <hi>second</hi> or <hi>third</hi> year (by what time your <hi>Roots</hi> spread) the
<hi>Trench,</hi> if the <hi>Ground</hi> be moist, or <hi>Seasons</hi> wet, will be neer fill'd
up again by the treading of <hi>Cattel;</hi> for it need not be cleansed; but
then you must renew your <hi>Thorns:</hi> Yet if the <hi>Planter</hi> be curious, I
should advise a casting of some small quantity of <hi>rich Mould</hi> into the
bottom of the <hi>Trench</hi> the second year, which may improve the growth,
and invite the <hi>Roots</hi> to spread.</p>
               <p>In this manner of <hi>Planting,</hi> where the <hi>soil</hi> is not rich, the exact
<hi>Planter</hi> should add a little quantity to each Root of Earth from a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
<hi>High-way,</hi> or <hi>Yard</hi> where <hi>Cattel</hi> are kept; One <hi>Load</hi> will
suffice for six or seven <hi>Trees;</hi> this being much more proper than rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>soil</hi> or <hi>loose-Earth;</hi> the fat Mould best agreeing with the <hi>Apple
Tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The broader and deeper your <hi>Ditch</hi> is, the higher will be your <hi>Bank,</hi>
and the securer your <hi>Fence;</hi> but then you must add some good Earth in
the second year, as before.</p>
               <p>I must subjoyn, That only <hi>Trees</hi> of an <hi>upright growth</hi> be thus
planted in <hi>open grounds;</hi> because spreading of low growing <hi>Trees</hi>
will be still within reach of <hi>Cattel</hi> as they encrease: Nor have I met
with any inconvenience in this kind of <hi>Transplanting</hi> (which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to all sorts of <hi>Trees)</hi> but that the <hi>Mole</hi> and the <hi>Ant</hi> may find
ready entertainment the first year, and sometime impairs a weak rooted
<hi>Plant;</hi> otherwise it rarely miscarries. In sum,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This manner of</hi> Fencing <hi>is soon executed by an indifferent</hi> Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>who will easily set and guard</hi> six Trees <hi>in a</hi> Winter <hi>day.</hi> Thus
far Mr. <hi>Buckland:</hi> To which we shall only add, That those which
are planted in the <hi>Hedg rows</hi> need none of these defences; for (I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40289:15"/>
am told) in <hi>Hereford-shire</hi> in the Plantations of their <hi>Quick-sets,</hi> or
any other, all men did so <hi>superstitiously</hi> place a <hi>Crab-stock</hi> at every
<hi>twenty foot</hi> distance, as if they had been under some rigorous <hi>Statute</hi>
requiring it; and I am of Opinion, that 'twere better to be content
with <hi>Fruit</hi> in the bordering <hi>Mounds,</hi> than to be at all this trouble
to raise <hi>Tumps,</hi> or temporary banks in the midst of an <hi>Inclosure;</hi> or
if <hi>Pears</hi> will thrive in the Plain of the <hi>Ortyard,</hi> as we frequently

pag. 23. <hi>In a</hi> graffed plant <hi>every</hi> Bough <hi>should be lopped at the very
tops, in</hi> Apples <hi>and</hi> Pears, <hi>as in</hi> Cherries <hi>and</hi> Plums, if <hi>Transplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
without violation of <hi>Roots,</hi> which only indeed renders it less
necessary.</p>
               <p>In most kinds of natural <hi>Plants</hi> the <hi>Boughs</hi> should not at all be
<hi>lopped,</hi> but some taken off close to the <hi>Trunk,</hi> that the Root at first
<hi>Transplantation</hi> be not engaged to maintain too many <hi>Suckers, this
to be understood, though of such as grow naturally from the</hi> Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
<hi>or the</hi> Bur-knot; <hi>especially if</hi> removed <hi>after they are well
rooted.</hi> And this must be done with such discretion, that the <hi>Top-branches</hi>
be not too close together; for the natural <hi>Plant</hi> is apt to
grow <hi>spiry,</hi> and thereby fails of fruitfulness. Therefore let the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<hi>Branches</hi> be divided at a convenient roundness.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Branches</hi> of those we call natural Plants (for usually the
<hi>Graffed</hi> generally fail) that are cut off, may be set, and will grow,
though slowly.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Top</hi> prove <hi>spiry,</hi> or the fruit <hi>unkind,</hi> then the due remedy

Canaries,</hi> and <hi>Montefiasco;</hi> so neither will the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of <hi>Bromyard</hi> and <hi>Ledbury</hi> equal that of <hi>Ham lacy,</hi> and <hi>Kings-Capell,</hi>
in the same small County of <hi>Hereford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Yet the choice of the <hi>Graff</hi> or <hi>Fruit</hi> hath so much of preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
that the <hi>Red-strake-Cider</hi> will every where excel common
<hi>Cider,</hi> as the <hi>Grape</hi> of <hi>Frontignac, Canary,</hi> or <hi>Baccharach,</hi> excels the
common <hi>French Grape;</hi> at least, till by time and traduction it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generateth.</p>
            <p>3. I cannot divine what <hi>Soil</hi> or what <hi>Fruit</hi> would yield the best
<hi>Cider;</hi> or, how excellent <hi>Cider</hi> or <hi>Perry</hi> might be if all <hi>Soils</hi> in
common and all <hi>Fruit</hi> were tried; but for <hi>thirty years</hi> I have tried
all sorts of <hi>Cider</hi> in <hi>Hereford-shire,</hi> and for three years I have tried
the best <hi>Cider</hi> in <hi>Somerset-shire;</hi> and for some years I have had the
best <hi>Cider</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Essex</hi> at my call; yet hitherto I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
found the <hi>Cider</hi> of <hi>Hereford shire</hi> the best, and so adjudged
by all good <hi>Palates.</hi> But I shall rejoice to be better informed, and
truly from all other <hi>Countries;</hi> and do both wish and hope, that
in a short time, we shall every where be <hi>rich</hi> in many <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I cannot undertake to particularize all kind of <hi>Soil,</hi> no more
than to compute how many <hi>syllables</hi> may be drawn from the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet;</hi>
the number of Alphabetical <hi>Elements</hi> being better known
than the <hi>Ingredients</hi> and <hi>Particles</hi> of <hi>Soil,</hi> as <hi>Chalk, Clay, Gravel,
Sand, Marle,</hi> (the tenaciousness, colour, and innumerable other
qualities, shewing endless diversities;) and the Fruit of <hi>Crabs, Apples,</hi>
and <hi>Pears,</hi> being as various as of <hi>Grapes, Figs,</hi> and <hi>Plums.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Yet in gross, this I note; That as <hi>Bacchus amat colles,</hi> and
a light ground, so our best <hi>Cider</hi> comes from the hot <hi>Rie-Lands:</hi>
In fat <hi>Wheat-Land</hi> it is more sluggish; and in white, stiff <hi>Clay-Land</hi>
(as in <hi>Woollhope</hi> in <hi>Hereford-shire)</hi> the common <hi>Cider</hi> retains a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40289:18"/>
thick whey-colour, and not good: Only such as riseth there (by
the diligence or some <hi>Art</hi> of the <hi>Inhabitants</hi>) is bright and clear,
and so lively, that they are apt to challenge the best.</p>
            <p>6. Some <hi>Cider</hi> mixeth kindly with <hi>Water</hi> in the <hi>Cider-mill,</hi> and
will hold out a good small <hi>Wine,</hi> and less inflaming, all the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Summer.</hi> Some <hi>Cider</hi> (as of <hi>Long-hope,</hi> a kind of four <hi>Wood-Land</hi>
Country of <hi>Herefordshire)</hi> will not bear any mixture of <hi>Water,</hi>
but soon decay, and turn more harsh and four: And thus we noted
in <hi>France,</hi> some course <hi>Wines</hi> stuck like paint in the <hi>Grass,</hi> unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to incorporate with the Water: <hi>Vin d' Aye,</hi> and other delicate
Wines, did spread themselves more freely, as <hi>gold</hi> is more <hi>ductile</hi>
than baser <hi>metals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Some would, for a fit, extol the <hi>Cider</hi> of <hi>Pearmains,</hi> some
of <hi>Pepins;</hi> (and of <hi>Pepins</hi> I have found a congenial <hi>Liquor,</hi> less af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
<hi>splenetick</hi> persons, as in mine own experience I conceived:)
And Sir <hi>Henry Lingen</hi> once extolled the <hi>Cider</hi> of <hi>Eleots</hi> (as richly
bedewing the Glass like the best <hi>Canaries;</hi>) and full Hogsheads of
the <hi>Stocking-Apple</hi> have been tried amongst us, but disappointing
our expectation, though perhaps by evil ordering: Yet Mr. <hi>Grit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
highly boasted a Mixture of <hi>Stocking-Apples</hi> and <hi>May-Pears,</hi>
tried (as I take it) by himself: After many years trial of those and
many other kinds, the <hi>Red-strake</hi> carried the common fame, and
from most of those reduced admirers. The <hi>Gennet-Moyl Cider</hi>
was indeed more acceptable to tender <hi>Palats;</hi> and it will require
<hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Iudgment</hi> to understand the preferrency of the <hi>Red-strake,</hi>
whose mordicant sweetness most agreeably gives the fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,
endearing the rellish to all flagrant <hi>Palats;</hi> which both ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges,
whets, and sharpens the <hi>stomach</hi> with its masculine and <hi>winy</hi>
vigour; and many thousands extol it for exceeding the ordinary
<hi>French-Wine:</hi> But grant it should not be so strong as <hi>Wine;</hi> let
me ask how many sober persons abroad addict themselves to meer
<hi>Wine?</hi> Then compare <hi>this</hi> with diluted <hi>Wine,</hi> as usually for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
men, and then let the trial be made, whether the <hi>Pepin-Cider</hi>
or <hi>Red-strake</hi> will retain the <hi>winy</hi> vigour in greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Water.</hi> Add to this, That they commonly mingle <hi>Water</hi>
in the <hi>Press</hi> with <hi>Apples</hi> (a good quantity) whiles they grinde the
<hi>Apple;</hi> and the <hi>Water</hi> thus mixed, at that time, does so pleasingly
incorporate in the grinding, fermentation, and maturity of Vessel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that 'tis quite another and far more pleasant thing than if so
much or half so much <hi>Water</hi> were mingled in the <hi>Cup</hi> at the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
time; as <hi>Salt</hi> on the <hi>Trencher</hi> will not give <hi>Beef, Pork,</hi> or
<hi>Neats-Tongue,</hi> half that same rellish which duly <hi>powder'd</hi> and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
season'd.</p>
            <p>8. I did once prefer the <hi>Gennet-moyl Cider,</hi> but had only the
<hi>Ladies</hi> on my side, as gentler for their sugary <hi>palats,</hi> and for one
or two sober draughts; but I saw cause to recant, and to confess
the <hi>Red-strake</hi> to warm and whet the <hi>Stomach,</hi> either for <hi>meat</hi> or
more <hi>drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. The right <hi>Cider-fruit</hi> is far more <hi>succulent,</hi> and the <hi>Liquor</hi>
more easily divides from the <hi>pulpe</hi> of the <hi>Apple,</hi> than in best <hi>Table-fruit,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:40289:18"/>
in which the juice and the pulp seem friendly to dissolve
together on the tongues end.</p>
            <p>10. The Liquor of best <hi>Cider-fruit</hi> in the <hi>Apple,</hi> in best season
of ripeness, is more brisk and smart than that which proves duller
<hi>Cider:</hi> And generally the fiercest <hi>Pears,</hi> and a kind of tamer <hi>Crabs,</hi>
(and such was the <hi>Red-strake</hi> called in my memory) makes the
more winy <hi>Cider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. <hi>Palladius</hi> denieth <hi>Perry</hi> to bear the heat of <hi>Summer;</hi> but
there is a <hi>Pear</hi> in <hi>Bosbury,</hi> and that Neighbourhood, which yields
the <hi>Liquor</hi> richer the <hi>second</hi> year than the <hi>first,</hi> and so by my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
very much amended the <hi>third</hi> year: They talk much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
but that's beyond my account.</p>
            <p>12. As <hi>Cider</hi> is for some time a sluggard, so by like care it may
be retained to keep the <hi>Memorials</hi> of many <hi>Consuls;</hi> and these
smoaky bottles are the <hi>nappy Wine.</hi> My Lord <hi>Scudamore</hi> seldome
fails of three or four years; and he is nobly liberal to offer the
Trial.</p>
            <p>13. As <hi>red Apples,</hi> so <hi>red Pears</hi> (and amongst them the red
<hi>Hors-pear</hi> next to the <hi>Bosbury</hi>) have held out best for the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and durance: But <hi>Pears</hi> do less gratifie the stomach than
<hi>Apples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. The season of <hi>grinding</hi> these <hi>harsh Pears</hi> is after a full matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
not till they have dropt from the Tree, and there lain under
the Tree, or in heaps, a <hi>week,</hi> or thereabouts.</p>
            <p>15. And so of <hi>Cider-Apples,</hi> as of <hi>Grapes,</hi> they require full <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,</hi>
which is best known by their natural <hi>fragrancy;</hi> and then
also, as ripe <hi>Grapes</hi> require a few mellowing days, so do all <hi>Apples,</hi>
as about a week or little more, so they be not bruised, which soon
turns to rottenness; and better sound from the Tree than rotten
from the heap; though yet the juice of <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears</hi> (yea, of
<hi>Cherrys</hi> or <hi>Grapes</hi>) is not altogether destroy'd, or quite putrified,
as soon as the <hi>Pulp</hi> seems to be <hi>corrupted;</hi> neither haply needs
there such curiosity, to cull and pick them so accurately, as some
prescribe, though doubtless the cleaner, and less contaminated, the
better.</p>
            <p>16. That due maurity, and some rest on the heap, does make
the <hi>Liquor</hi> taste rather of <hi>Apples</hi> than <hi>winy,</hi> hath no more truth, (if
the <hi>Cider</hi> be kept to fit age) than that very <hi>old Cheese</hi> doth taste of
a <hi>Posset.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. The harsher the <hi>wild-fruit</hi> is, the longer it must lye on
heaps; for of the same fruit, suddenly ground, I have tasted good
<hi>Ver-juice;</hi> being on heaps till near <hi>Christmas,</hi> all <hi>good-fellows</hi> called
it <hi>Rhenish-wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18. The <hi>Grinding</hi> is somewhat considerable, rather too much
than too little; here I saw a <hi>Mill</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire</hi> which grinds half
a <hi>Hogshead</hi> at a <hi>grist,</hi> and so much the better ground for the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
rolling.</p>
            <p>19.<note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> Soon after <hi>grinding</hi> it should be <hi>prest,</hi> and immediately be

and then also in fermenting time the <hi>Vent-hole</hi> should not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40289:19"/>
be so wide as to allow a prodigal waste of the <hi>spirits;</hi> and as soon
as the ferment begins to allay, the <hi>Vessels</hi> should be <hi>filled</hi> of the <hi>same,</hi>
and well stopped.</p>
            <p>20. Of late 'tis much <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>mmended, that before it be <hi>prest</hi> the
<hi>Liquor</hi> and <hi>Must</hi> should for four and twenty hours ferment together
in a <hi>Vat</hi> for that purpose, covered, as <hi>Ale</hi> or <hi>Beer</hi> in the <hi>Yest-vat,</hi>
and then tunned up. This is said to enrich the liquor, and to give
it somewhat of the <hi>tincture</hi> of some <hi>red Apples,</hi> as I have seen, and
very well approved.</p>
            <p>21. As <hi>Sulphur</hi> hath some use in <hi>Wines,</hi> so some do lay <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi>
on a <hi>ragge,</hi> and by a <hi>wire</hi> let it down into the <hi>Cider-Vessel</hi> and
there <hi>fire</hi> it; and when the Vessel is full of the <hi>smoak,</hi> the liquor
speedily poured in ferments the better. I cannot condemn this,
for <hi>Sulphur</hi> is more kind to the <hi>Lungs</hi> than <hi>Cider,</hi> and the impurity
will be discharged in the ferment.</p>
            <p>22. <hi>Apples</hi> over-long hoarded before <hi>grinding</hi> will for a long
time hold the liquor <hi>thick;</hi> and this liquor will be both pleasant,
and as I think, wholesome; and we see some rich <hi>Wines</hi> of the later
<hi>Vintage,</hi> and from <hi>Greece,</hi> retain a like crassitude, and they are both
<hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>23. I have seen thick harth <hi>Cider</hi> the second <hi>Summer</hi> become
clear and very richly pleasant; but I never saw clear <hi>acid Cider</hi>
recover.</p>
            <p>24. <hi>Wheat</hi> or <hi>Leven</hi> is good and kind in <hi>Cider,</hi> as in <hi>Beer; Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper-berries</hi>
agree well and friendly for <hi>Coughs,</hi> weak Lungs, and
the aged, but not at first for every Palate: The most infallible and
undiscerned improver, is <hi>Mustard</hi> a <hi>Pint</hi> to each <hi>Hogshead,</hi> bruised,
as for sauce, with a mixture of the same <hi>Cider,</hi> and applied as soon
as the Vessel is to be closed after fermenting.</p>
            <p>25. <hi>Bottleing</hi> is the next <hi>improver,</hi> and proper for <hi>Cider;</hi> some
put two or three <hi>Raisins</hi> into every <hi>Bottle,</hi> which is to seek aid
from the Vine<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Here in <hi>Somersetshire</hi> I have seen as much as a
<hi>Wal nut</hi> of <hi>Sugar,</hi> not without cause, used for this Country <hi>Cider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>26. <hi>Crabs</hi> do not hasten the decay of <hi>Perry,</hi> but preserve it, as
<hi>Salt</hi> preserves <hi>flesh.</hi> But <hi>Pears</hi> and <hi>Crabs</hi> being of a thousand kinds
require more <hi>Aphorisms;</hi> this only I would <hi>Note,</hi> that <hi>Land</hi> which
refuses <hi>Apples,</hi> is generally civil to <hi>Pears,</hi> and <hi>Crabs</hi> mingled with
them, make a rich and wholsome <hi>Cider,</hi> and has sometimes chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
even the best <hi>Red-strake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>27. Neither <hi>Wheat, Leven, Sulphur,</hi> nor <hi>Mustard,</hi> are used but
by very few; and therefore are not necessary to make <hi>Cider</hi> last
well, for two, three, or four years.</p>
            <p>28. The time of drawing <hi>Cider</hi> into <hi>Bottles</hi> is best in <hi>March,</hi>
it being then clarified by the <hi>Winter,</hi> and free from the heat of the
<hi>Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>29. In drawing, the <hi>best</hi> is neerest the <hi>heart</hi> or middle of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
as the <hi>Yelk</hi> in the <hi>Egge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>30. <hi>Red-strakes</hi> are of divers kinds, but the name is in <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire</hi>
appropriated to one kind, which is fair and large, of a
high <hi>purple</hi> colour, the smell <hi>Aromatical,</hi> the <hi>Tree</hi> a very <hi>shrub,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:40289:19"/>
soon bearing a full burden, and seldom or never failing till it decays,
which is much sooner than other <hi>Apple-trees.</hi> 'Tis lately spread
all over <hi>Hereford-shire;</hi> and he that computes speedy return, and
true <hi>Wine,</hi> will think of no other <hi>Cider-Apple,</hi> till a better be
found.</p>
            <p>31. I said the <hi>Red strake</hi> is a small <hi>shrub,</hi> 'tis of small growth
where the <hi>Cider</hi> proves richest, for ought we have yet seen in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refordshire,
viz.</hi> in light quick land; and if the <hi>land</hi> be very dry,
jejune and shallow, <hi>that</hi> and other <hi>Cider fruit</hi> (especially the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net-moyle</hi>)
will suspend the store of fruit alternatively every other
year; except some <hi>Blasts</hi> or surprising <hi>Frosts</hi> in the <hi>Spring</hi> alter that
<hi>Method;</hi> for two bad years seldom come together, very hardly
three.</p>
            <p>32. In good soil, I mean of <hi>common field</hi> (for fat land is not best
for <hi>Cider</hi>-fruit, but common <hi>arable</hi>) I have seen the Trees of good
growth, almost equalling other <hi>Cider-trees,</hi> the <hi>Apple</hi> larger and
seldom failing of a good <hi>burthen:</hi> thus in the <hi>Vales</hi> of <hi>Wheat-lands,</hi>
in strong <hi>Glebe</hi> or <hi>Clay,</hi> where the <hi>Cider</hi> is not so much extolled:
but still <hi>Sack</hi> is <hi>Sack,</hi> and <hi>Canary</hi> differs from <hi>Claret;</hi> so does the
<hi>Red-strake-Cider</hi> of the <hi>Vale</hi> excell any other <hi>Cider</hi> of the foresaid
soil, such as is already celebrated for its kindness to good <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>33. <hi>Yet this distinction of</hi> Soil <hi>requires much</hi> experience, <hi>and

very <hi>stony, hungry, gravelly-land,</hi> such as <hi>Apples</hi> will not bear in;
and I have seen <hi>Pears</hi> bear in a tough binding hungry <hi>Clay,</hi> when
<hi>Apples</hi> could not so well bear it (as the smooth rinds of the <hi>Pear-trees,</hi>
and the <hi>Mossie</hi> and <hi>cankered rinds</hi> of the <hi>Apple trees</hi> did
prove) the <hi>root</hi> of a <hi>Pear-tree</hi> being it seems more able to pierce a
stony and stiff ground. And <hi>Cherries, Mulberries</hi> and <hi>Plums</hi> can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in a richer soil, though by the smalness of the <hi>Roots,</hi> the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
soil will suffice them. And the <hi>Quinces</hi> require a deeper
ground, and will bear with some degrees of hungry land, if they be
supplied with a due measure of <hi>succulency,</hi> and neighbouring moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture;
and the other <hi>shrubs,</hi> according to the smalness of their <hi>roots,</hi>
do generally bear a thinner land. I have seen a <hi>soil</hi> so much too ran<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>

due strength to bear a full <hi>crop.</hi> And therefore, whereas the <hi>Red-strake</hi>
might otherwise without much injury be planted at <hi>fifteen</hi> or
<hi>twenty</hi> foot <hi>distance,</hi> and the best <hi>distance</hi> for other <hi>Cider-fruit</hi> hath
heretofore been reputed <hi>thirty,</hi> or <hi>two</hi> and <hi>thirty</hi> foot; very good
husbands do now allow in their largest <hi>Inclosures</hi> (as of 20, 40 or
100 <hi>Acres) fifty</hi> or <hi>sixty</hi> foot distance, that the Trees may not much
hinder the <hi>Plow,</hi> and yet receive the benefit of <hi>Compost;</hi> and a
<hi>Horse-teem</hi> well governed will (without any damage of danger)
<hi>plow</hi> close to the <hi>Trees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>36. In such soil as is here required, namely of good <hi>Tillage,</hi> an
<hi>Orchard</hi> of <hi>graffed Red-strakes</hi> will be of good growth, and good
burthen, within <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>twelve years,</hi> and branch out with good
store to begin an encouragement at three years <hi>graffing;</hi> and (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the land be very unkind) will not yield to any decay within
<hi>sixty</hi> or <hi>eighty years,</hi> which is a mans age.</p>
            <p>37. In some <hi>sheets</hi> I rendred many Reasons against Mr. <hi>Austi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> why we should prefer a peculiar <hi>Cider fruit,</hi> which in
<hi>Herefordshire</hi> are generally called <hi>Musts;</hi> (so we name both the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
and the <hi>Liquor,</hi> and <hi>Pulpe</hi> as mingled together in the contusion)
as from the Latine <hi>Mustum. White-Musts</hi> of divers kinds, <hi>Red-cheek'd</hi>
and <hi>Red-strak'd Musts</hi> of several kinds, <hi>Green-Musts</hi> called
also <hi>Green-fillet,</hi> and <hi>Blew-spotted:</hi> Why, I say, we should prefer
them for <hi>Cider,</hi> before <hi>Table-fruit,</hi> as <hi>Pepins, Pearmains, &amp;c.</hi> And I
do still insist on them: 1. The Liquor of these <hi>Cider-fruits</hi> and of
many kinds of austere fruit, which are no better than a sort of full
succulent <hi>Crabs,</hi> is more sprightful, brisk and <hi>winy.</hi> For Essay, I
sent up many <hi>bottles</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> that did me no discredit. Secondly,
One bushel of the <hi>Cider-fruit</hi> yields twice or thrice as much liquor.
Thirdly, The <hi>Tree</hi> grows more in three or four years than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in ten years, as I oft times remarked. Fourthly, The <hi>Tree</hi>
bears far greater store, and doth more generally escape <hi>Blasts</hi> and
<hi>Frosts</hi> of the <hi>Spring.</hi> I might add, that some of these, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
such <hi>Pears</hi> as yield the best <hi>Perry,</hi> will best escape the hand
of the <hi>Thief,</hi> and may be trusted in the open field.</p>
            <p>38. By the <hi>first, second</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> of these Reasons, I must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the <hi>Gennet-Moyle</hi> from a <hi>right Cider-fruit,</hi> it being dry and
very apt to take <hi>frosty blasts;</hi> yet it is no <hi>Table-fruit,</hi> but properly
a baking fruit, as the ruddy colour from the <hi>Oven</hi> shews.</p>
            <p>39. I said that the right <hi>Cider-fruit</hi> generally called <hi>Musts,</hi> and
deserving the <hi>Latine</hi> name <hi>Mustum,</hi> is of divers <hi>kinds;</hi> and I have
need to note more expresly that there is a <hi>Red-strak'd Must</hi> (as I
have often seen) but not generally known, that is quite differing
from the famous <hi>Red-strake,</hi> being much less, somewhat oblong
and like some of the white <hi>Musts</hi> in shape, and full of a very good
<hi>winy</hi> liquor. I could willingly name the <hi>persons</hi> and <hi>place</hi> where
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40289:20"/>
the distinct kinds are best known: it was first shewed me by <hi>Iohn
Nash</hi> of <hi>Ashperton</hi> in <hi>Herefordshire;</hi> and for some years they did in
some places distinguish a <hi>Red-strake,</hi> as yielding a richer <hi>Red-strak'd
Cider</hi> of a more <hi>fulvous</hi> or <hi>ruddy</hi> colour; but this difference,
as far as I could find, is but a choice of a better <hi>insolated</hi> or ruddy
fruit of the best kind, as taken from the <hi>South part</hi> of the <hi>Tree,</hi> or
from a <hi>soil</hi> that renders them richer. But my Lord <hi>Scudamore</hi>'s
is safely of the best sort; and M. <hi>Whingate</hi> of the <hi>Grange</hi> in <hi>Dimoc,</hi>
and some of <hi>King's-capel,</hi> do best know these and other differences,
<hi>Straked-Must, right Red-strake, Red-Redstrake,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>40. The greenish <hi>Must,</hi> (formerly called in the <hi>Language</hi> of the
<hi>Country,</hi> the <hi>Green-fillet</hi>) when the <hi>Liquor</hi> is of a kindly ripeness,
retains a <hi>greeness</hi> equal to the <hi>Rhenish-glass;</hi> which I note for them
that conceive no <hi>Cider</hi> to be fit for use till it be of the <hi>colour</hi> of <hi>old
Sack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>41. To direct a little more <hi>caution,</hi> for enquiry of the right <hi>Red-strake,</hi>
I should give notice that some <hi>Moneths</hi> ago, M. <hi>Philips</hi> of
<hi>Mountague</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> shewed me a very fair large <hi>Red-strake
Apple,</hi> that by smell and sight seemed to me and to another of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refordshire</hi>
then with me to be the best <hi>Red strake;</hi> but when we
did cut it, and taste it, we both denied it to be <hi>right</hi> (the other
with much more confidence than my self) but M. <hi>Philips</hi> making
<hi>Cider</hi> of it, this week invited me to it, assuring that already it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals
or resembles <hi>High-country-wines.</hi> It had not such plenty of
juice as our <hi>Red strakes</hi> with us, and it had more of the pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Table-fruit,</hi> which might be occasioned, for ought I know,
by the purer and quicker soil. This <hi>Apple</hi> is here call'd <hi>Meriot-Ysnot,</hi>
and great store of them are at <hi>Meriot,</hi> a <hi>Village</hi> not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant:
Possibly, this <hi>Meriot</hi> may prove to be the <hi>Red-strake</hi> of
<hi>Somerset shire,</hi> when they shall please to try it apart with equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and constancy as they do in <hi>Hereford-shire:</hi> This <hi>fruit</hi> is
of a very lovely <hi>hue,</hi> and by some conceived to be of Affinity to
the <hi>Red-Iersey Apple,</hi> which is reported to <hi>tinge</hi> so deeply: In
truth, there can hardly be a deeper <hi>Purple,</hi> than is our right <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire
Red-strake,</hi> having a few <hi>streaks</hi> towards the <hi>Eye,</hi> of a
<hi>dark</hi> colour, or <hi>Orange-tawny</hi> intermingled: But, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if an <hi>Apple</hi> should change its <hi>Name</hi> in travelling so far beyond
the <hi>Severn,</hi> when even in this <hi>Country,</hi> most sorts of <hi>Apples,</hi> and
especially, <hi>Cider-fruit,</hi> loseth the Name in the next <hi>Village.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>42. I may now ask why we should talk of other <hi>Cider-fruit</hi> or
<hi>Perry,</hi> if the best <hi>Red strake</hi> have all the aforesaid pre-eminencies
of richer and more <hi>winy</hi> liquor, by half sooner an <hi>Orchard,</hi> more
constantly bearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An <hi>Orchard</hi> of <hi>Red-strakes</hi> is commonly
as full of fruit at <hi>ten</hi> years, as other <hi>Cider-fruit</hi> at <hi>twenty</hi> years, or
as the <hi>Pepin</hi> and <hi>Pearmain</hi> at <hi>thirty</hi> or thereabout.</p>
            <p>43. To this may be Answered, that all <hi>soils</hi> bear not <hi>Apples,</hi> and
to some <hi>soils</hi> other <hi>Apples</hi> may be more kind, and if we be driven
to <hi>Perry,</hi> much we may say both in behalf of the <hi>Perry,</hi> and of the
<hi>Pear,</hi> of the <hi>fruit,</hi> and of the <hi>Tree;</hi> It is the goodlier Tree for
a <hi>Grove,</hi> to shelter a house and walks from <hi>Summers heat</hi> and <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40289:21"/>
cold Winds,</hi> and far more <hi>lasting;</hi> the pleasantest <hi>Cider-pear</hi>
of a known name amongst them, is the <hi>Horse-pear.</hi> And it is much
argued, whether the <hi>White-horse-pear,</hi> or the <hi>Red-horse-pear</hi> be the
better; where <hi>both</hi> are <hi>best,</hi> within two <hi>Miles</hi> they differ in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The <hi>Pear</hi> bears almost its <hi>weight</hi> of sprightful <hi>winy Liquor;</hi>
and I always preferred the <hi>tawny</hi> or <hi>ruddy Horse-pear,</hi> and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>that colour</hi> in all <hi>Pears</hi> that are proper for <hi>Perry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>44. I rejected <hi>Palladius</hi> against the durableness of <hi>Perry;</hi> his
words are, <hi>Hyeme durat, sed prima acescit aestate, Tit. 25. Febr.</hi> possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
so of common <hi>Pears,</hi> and in hotter Countries; but from good
<hi>Cellars</hi> I have tasted a very brisk lively and <hi>winy liquor</hi> of these
<hi>Horse-pears</hi> during the end of <hi>Summer;</hi> and a <hi>Bosbury-pear</hi> I have
named and often tried, which without <hi>bottleing,</hi> in common <hi>Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads</hi>
of vulgar and indifferent <hi>Cellars,</hi> proves as well pleasanter
as richer the <hi>second</hi> year, and yet also better the <hi>third</hi> year. A
very honest, worthy and witty <hi>Gentleman</hi> of that neighbourhood
would engage to me, that in good <hi>Cellars,</hi> and in careful custody, it
passeth any account of decay, and may be <hi>heightned</hi> to a kind of
<hi>Aqua-vitae.</hi> I take the information worthy the <hi>stile</hi> of our modern
<hi>improvements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pear-tree</hi> grows in <hi>common fields</hi> and wild <hi>stony ground,</hi> to
the largeness of bearing one, two, three or four <hi>Hogsheads</hi> each
year.</p>
            <p>45. This <hi>Bosbury-tree,</hi> and such generally that bear the most
lasting <hi>Liquor</hi> and <hi>winy,</hi> is of such <hi>unsufferable</hi> taste, that hungry
<hi>Swine</hi> will not <hi>smell</hi> to it; or if <hi>hunger</hi> tempt them to taste, at
first crush they shake it out of their <hi>mouths;</hi> (I say not this of the
<hi>Horse-pear</hi>) and the Clowns call other <hi>Pears,</hi> of best Liquor, <hi>Choak-pears,</hi>
and will offer money to such as dare adventure to taste
them, for their <hi>sport;</hi> and their <hi>mouths</hi> will be more <hi>stupified</hi> than
at the root of <hi>Wake-robin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>46. A row of <hi>Crab-trees</hi> will give an improvement to any kind
of <hi>Perry;</hi> and since <hi>Pears</hi> and <hi>Crabs</hi> may be of as many <hi>kinds</hi> as
there are <hi>kernels,</hi> or different kinds or mixtures of <hi>soils;</hi> in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Character</hi> I would prefer the largest and fullest of all austere
juices.</p>
            <p>47. M. <hi>Lill</hi> of <hi>Mark-hill</hi> (aged about 90 years) ever observed
this Rule, to grass no <hi>wild Pear-tree</hi> till he saw the <hi>fruit;</hi> if it
proved <hi>large, juicy,</hi> and <hi>brisk,</hi> it failed not of good <hi>Liquor.</hi> But I
see cause to say, that to <hi>graff</hi> a young tree with a riper <hi>graff,</hi> and
<hi>known excellency,</hi> is a sure gain and hastens the return.</p>
            <p>48. M. <hi>Speke</hi> (last <hi>high Sheriff</hi> of <hi>Somersetshire</hi>) shewed me in
his <hi>Park</hi> some store of <hi>Crab-trees,</hi> of such huge <hi>Bulk,</hi> that in this
fertile year he offered a <hi>wager,</hi> that they would yield one or two
<hi>Hogsheads</hi> of <hi>Liquor</hi> each of them; yet were they small dry
<hi>Crabs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>49. I have seen several sorts of <hi>Crabs</hi> (which are the natural
<hi>Apple,</hi> or at worst but the <hi>Wild-Apple</hi>) which are as large as many
sorts of <hi>Apples,</hi> and the Liquor <hi>winy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>50. I have disclaimed the <hi>Gust</hi> of <hi>Iuniper-berries</hi> in <hi>Cider;</hi> I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40289:21"/>
tried it only <hi>once</hi> for <hi>my self,</hi> and drank it before <hi>Christmas:</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
in more time the rellish had been subdued or improved, as of
<hi>Hops</hi> in <hi>stale Beer,</hi> and of <hi>Rennet</hi> in good <hi>Parmasan.</hi> Neither was
the <hi>Gust</hi> to me otherwise unpleasant than as <hi>Annise-seeds</hi> in <hi>Bread,</hi>
rather <hi>strange</hi> than <hi>odious;</hi> and by custom made grateful, and it
did hasten the <hi>clarification,</hi> and increase the briskness to an endless
<hi>sparkling:</hi> thus it indulgeth the <hi>Lungs,</hi> and nothing more <hi>cheap;</hi>
where <hi>Iuniper</hi> grows a <hi>Girl</hi> may speedily fill her lap with the
<hi>Berries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>Barbados</hi> Ginger be good, cheaper, and a more pleasant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server
of Beer, it must probably be most kind for <hi>Cider:</hi> For first,
of all the improvers that I could name, bruised <hi>Mustard</hi> was the
best; and this <hi>Ginger</hi> hath the same quick, mordicant vigour, in a
more noble and more <hi>Aromatique</hi> fragrancy. Secondly, <hi>Cider</hi> (as
I oft complain) is of a sluggish and somewhat windy nature; and
for some <hi>Moneths</hi> the best of it is chain'd up with a cold <hi>ligature,</hi>
as we fancy the fire to be lock'd up in a cold <hi>Flint.</hi> This will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>prisoner.</hi> And thirdly, will assist the <hi>winy</hi> vigour for
them that would use it instead of a sparkling <hi>VVine.</hi> Fourthly,
'Tis a good sign of much kindness, and great friendship: it will
both enliven the <hi>ferment</hi> for speedier maturity, and also hold it
out for more duration, both which offices it performs in Beer.</p>
            <p>51. <hi>Cider</hi> being <hi>windy</hi> before maturity, some that must not
wait the leisure of best <hi>Season</hi> do put sprigs of <hi>Rose-mary</hi> and <hi>Bays</hi>
in the <hi>Vessel;</hi> the <hi>first</hi> good for the <hi>head,</hi> and not unpleasant; the
<hi>second,</hi> an <hi>Antidote</hi> against <hi>Infections;</hi> but less pleasant till time
hath incorporated the Tastes.</p>
            <p>52. <hi>And why may we not make mention of all these</hi> Mixtures,
<hi>as well as the</hi> Ancients <hi>of their</hi> Vinum Marrubii, Vinum Abrotonites,
Absynthites, Hyssopites, Marathites, Thymites, Cydonites, Myrtites,
Scillites, Violaceum, Sorbi, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>53. And, for <hi>mixtures,</hi> I think we may challenge the <hi>Ancients,</hi>
in naming the <hi>Red-raspy;</hi> of which there is in this County a <hi>Lady</hi>
that makes a <hi>Bonella,</hi> the best of <hi>Summer drinks.</hi> And more yet
if we name the <hi>Clove-july-flower,</hi> or other <hi>Iuly-flowers,</hi> a most
grateful <hi>Cordial,</hi> as it is infused by a <hi>Lady</hi> in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> of the
Family of the <hi>Devereux</hi>'s, and by some <hi>Ladies</hi> of this Country.</p>
            <p>54. I could also give some account of <hi>Cherry-wine,</hi> and Wine
of <hi>Plums;</hi> the <hi>last</hi> of which (in the best Essay that I have yet seen)
is hardly worthy to be named: But, I conceive, and have ground
for it, that some good <hi>Liquor</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> may be drawn from some
sorts of them, and in <hi>quantity:</hi> And the vast store of <hi>Cherrys</hi> in
some places, under a <hi>peny</hi> the <hi>pound,</hi> and of <hi>Plums</hi> that bend the
<hi>Trees</hi> with their <hi>burdens,</hi> and their expedite growth makes it cheap
enough, and as in the other, so in these, the large <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi>
sharp <hi>Cherry,</hi> makes the <hi>Cherry-wine,</hi> and the full black, tawny
<hi>Plum,</hi> as big as a <hi>Walnut</hi> (not the kind of <hi>Heart-Cherrys,</hi> nor the
<hi>Plum</hi> which divides from the <hi>stone</hi>) make the <hi>Wine.</hi> Their cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
should recommend them to more general use at <hi>Tables,</hi> when
<hi>dryed</hi> like <hi>Prunellas</hi> (an easie art) and then wholesomer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:40289:22"/>
55. To return for <hi>Red-strake;</hi> 'tis a good drink as soon as well
<hi>fermented,</hi> or within a <hi>Moneth,</hi> better after some <hi>Frosts,</hi> and
when <hi>clarified;</hi> rich <hi>Wine,</hi> when it takes the <hi>colour</hi> of <hi>old Sack.</hi>
In a good <hi>Cellar</hi> it improves in <hi>Hogsheads</hi> the second year; in
<hi>Bottles</hi> and <hi>sandy Cellars</hi> keeps the <hi>Records</hi> of late <hi>revolutions</hi> and
old <hi>Majoralties. Quaere</hi> the manner of laying them up in <hi>sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>56. I tried some <hi>Bottles</hi> all a <hi>Summer</hi> in the bottom of a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi>
and I prefer that way where it may be had. And 'tis some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
strange if the Land be neither dry for a <hi>sand-house,</hi> nor <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous</hi>
for this better expedient. When <hi>Cider</hi> is settl'd, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or almost <hi>clarifi'd,</hi> then to make it <hi>sprightful</hi> and <hi>winy,</hi> it
should be drawn into well <hi>cork'd</hi> and well bound <hi>bottles</hi> and kept
some time in <hi>sand</hi> or water; the longer the better, if the kind be
good. And <hi>Cider</hi> being preserved to due <hi>age, bottl'd</hi> (and kept in
cool places, <hi>conservatories,</hi> and <hi>refrigerating</hi> springs) it does almost
by time turn to <hi>Aqua-vitae;</hi> the <hi>Bottles</hi> smoak at the opening, and
it catches <hi>flame</hi> speedily, and will burn like <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>VVine,</hi> with a
fiery taste; and it is a laudable way of trying the vigour of <hi>Cider</hi>
by its promptness to <hi>burn,</hi> and take <hi>fire,</hi> and from the quantity of
<hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> which it yields. <hi>Cider</hi> affords by way of <hi>Distillation,</hi>
an incomparable and useful <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that in such plenty, as from
<hi>four Quarts,</hi> a full <hi>Pint</hi> has been extracted.</p>
            <p>57. I must not prescribe to other <hi>Palats,</hi> by asserting to what
degree of <hi>Perfection</hi> good <hi>Cider</hi> may be raised, or to compare it
with <hi>VVines:</hi> But when the late <hi>King</hi> (of blessed memory) came
to <hi>Hereford</hi> in his distress, and such of the <hi>Gentry</hi> of <hi>VVorcestershire</hi>
as were brought thither as <hi>Prisoners;</hi> both <hi>King, Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
did prefer it before the best <hi>VVines</hi> those parts afforded; and
to my knowledge that <hi>Cider</hi> had no kind of <hi>Mixture.</hi> Generally
all the <hi>Gentry</hi> of <hi>Herefordshire</hi> do abhor all mixtures.</p>
            <p>Yet if any man have a desire to try <hi>conclusions,</hi> and by an harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>Art</hi> to convert <hi>Cider</hi> into <hi>Canary-wine;</hi> let the <hi>Cider</hi> be of the
former year, <hi>Masculine</hi> and in full body, yet pleasant and well tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
into such <hi>Cider</hi> put a <hi>spoonful,</hi> or <hi>so,</hi> of the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Clary,</hi> it
will have so much of the <hi>race</hi> of <hi>Canary,</hi> as may deceive some who
pretend they have discerning <hi>Palats.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N obedience to the <hi>Commands</hi> of this <hi>Honourable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi>
I have at length endeavoured to give this brief
<hi>Account</hi> of that little which I know concerning the
<hi>Ordering</hi> of <hi>Cider;</hi> and in <hi>that</hi> I shall propound to
my self <hi>six</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> To shew that <hi>Cider</hi> made of the best <hi>Eating-apples</hi> must
needs be <hi>once</hi> the best; (that is to say) the pleasantest <hi>Cider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That hitherto the general opinion hath been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and that the reason of that mistake was the not apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the true cause why the <hi>Pepin-cider, &amp;c.</hi> did not retain its sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
when the <hi>Hard-apple-cider</hi> did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What is the true cause that <hi>Pepin-cider,</hi> used in the

            <p>Nor what <hi>sort</hi> of <hi>fruit</hi> will yield the greatest store of <hi>Cider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor what <hi>Cider</hi> will <hi>keep</hi> the longest, and be the strongest, and

The only thing I shall endeavour, being to prescribe a way to
make a sort of <hi>Cider</hi> pleasant and quick of taste, and yet whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som

best; which yet are so wholesom, that a man may drink a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
quantity of them without prejudice.</p>
            <p>Nor shall I at all concern my self, whether this sort of <hi>Cider</hi> I
pretend to is so <hi>vinous</hi> a liquor; and consequently will yield so
much <hi>spirit</hi> upon <hi>Distillation,</hi> or so soon make the <hi>Country-man</hi>
think himself a <hi>Lord,</hi> as the <hi>Hard-apple-cider</hi> will do: nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it will <hi>last</hi> so long; for it is no part of my <hi>design</hi> to perswade
the <hi>World</hi> to lay by the making of <hi>Hard-apple-cider;</hi> but rather in
a degree to shew how to improve that in point of pleasantness, and
that by the making and rightly ordering of <hi>Cider</hi> of the best <hi>Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Apples;</hi>
as <hi>Golden-pepins, Kentish-pepins, Pear-mains, &amp;c.</hi>
there may be made a more pleasant <hi>liquor</hi> for the time it will last,
than can be produced from those <hi>Apples</hi> which I call <hi>Hard-Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
that is to say, <hi>Red-strakes, Gennet-moyles,</hi> the <hi>Broms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ury-Crab,</hi>
&amp;c. which are so <hi>harsh</hi> that a <hi>Hog</hi> will hardly eat
them.</p>
            <p>Nor shall I at all meddle with the making of <hi>Perry,</hi> or of any
mixed drink of the juyce of <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears;</hi> though possibly
what I shall say for <hi>Cider</hi> may be aptly applied to <hi>Perry</hi> also.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>first</hi> particular, I <hi>asserted</hi> that the best <hi>Apples</hi> would
make the pleasantest, which in my sence is the best <hi>Cider;</hi> (and I
account those the best Apples, whose juyce is the pleasantest at the
time when first pressed, before fermentation) I shall need (besides
the experience of the last <hi>ten</hi> years) only to say, that it is an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
thing in all <hi>Wines,</hi> that the pleasantest <hi>Grapes</hi> make the
richest and pleasantest <hi>Wines;</hi> and that <hi>Cider</hi> is really but the
<hi>Wine</hi> of <hi>Apples,</hi> and not only made by the same way of <hi>Compressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
but left to it self hath the same way of <hi>Fermentation;</hi> and
therefore must be liable to the same measures in the choice of the
materials.</p>
            <p>To my second <hi>Assertion,</hi> that this truth was not formerly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by reason that in <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> and those Countries where they
abound both with <hi>Pepins</hi> and <hi>hard-apples</hi> of all sorts, they made
<hi>Cider</hi> of both sorts, and used them alike; that is, that as soon as
they <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>pressed</hi> the <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>strained</hi> the <hi>Liquor,</hi>
they put it into their <hi>Vessels</hi> and there let it lye till it had wrought,
and afterwards was setled again and <hi>fined;</hi> as not thinking it
wholesom to drink till it had thus (as they call it) <hi>purg'd</hi> it self,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40289:23"/>
and this was the frequent use of most men in the more <hi>Southern</hi>
and <hi>Western</hi> parts of <hi>England</hi> also. Now when <hi>Cider</hi> is thus used,
it is no wonder that when they came to broach it, they for the
most part found their <hi>Pepin-cider</hi> not so pleasant as their <hi>Moyle</hi> or
<hi>Red strake cider;</hi> but to them it seemed a wonder, because they
did not know the <hi>reason</hi> of it (which shall be my next work to
make out) for till they knew the <hi>reason</hi> of this <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ffect,</hi> they had no
cause but to think it was the nature of the several <hi>Apples</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
it; and consequently to prefer the <hi>Hard-Apple-cider,</hi> and
to use the other Apples (which were good to eat <hi>raw</hi>) for the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
which was an use not less necessary, and for which the <hi>hard-apples</hi>
were totally improper.</p>
            <p>To my <hi>third</hi> Assertion, which is, that in <hi>Herefordshire</hi> they knew
not what was the true cause why their <hi>Pepin-cider</hi> (for by that
name I shall generally call all sorts of <hi>Cider</hi> that is made of <hi>Apples</hi>
good to eat raw) was not, as they used it, so good as the <hi>Cider</hi>
made of <hi>hard-apples</hi> (for by that name, for brevities sake, I shall
call the <hi>Cider</hi> of <hi>Moyle, Red-strake,</hi> and all other sorts of <hi>harsh Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
not fit to eat raw.) <hi>First,</hi> I say, for all <hi>liquors</hi> that are <hi>Vinous,</hi>
the cause that makes them sometimes harder or less pleasant to the
taste, than they were at the first pressing, is the too much <hi>ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
If <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Cider</hi> by any <hi>accidental</hi> cause do <hi>ferment</hi>
twice, it will be harder than if it had <hi>fermented</hi> but once;
and if it <hi>ferment</hi> thrice, it is harder and worse than if it had
<hi>fermented</hi> but twice: and so onward, the oftner it <hi>ferments</hi>
and the longer it <hi>ferments,</hi> it still grows the harder. This being
laid as a <hi>foundation,</hi> before we proceed further we must first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what is the cause of <hi>fermentation</hi> in <hi>Wine, Cider,</hi> and all
other <hi>Vinous Liquors.</hi> Which (in my poor opinion) is the gross
part of the <hi>Liquor,</hi> which scapes in the straining of the <hi>Cider</hi> (for
in making of <hi>Wine,</hi> I do not find that they use the curiosity of
straining) and which is generally known by the name of the <hi>Lee</hi>
of that <hi>(Wine</hi> or) <hi>Cider.</hi> And this <hi>Lee</hi> I shall, according to
its thickness of parts, distinguish into the <hi>gross Lee,</hi> and the <hi>fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, according to the old method of making and putting up
of <hi>Cider,</hi> they took little care of putting up <hi>only</hi> the clear part of
the <hi>Cider</hi> into their Vessels or <hi>Cask;</hi> but put them up thick and
thin together, not at all regarding this <hi>separation;</hi> for experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
they found that how thick soever they put it up, yet after it
had throughly wrought or <hi>fermented</hi> and was setled again, it
would still be clear; and perchance that which was put up the
soonest after it was pressed and the thickest, would, when the <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi>
was over, be the clearest, the briskest, and keep the
longest. This made them confidently believe that it was not only
not inconvenient to put it up quickly after the <hi>pressing,</hi> but in
some degree necessary also to put it up soon after the <hi>pressing,</hi> so
that it might have so much of the <hi>Lee</hi> mixed with it, that it might
certainly, soon, and strongly put it into a <hi>fermentation,</hi> as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
means to make it <hi>wholsom, clean</hi> and <hi>brisk;</hi> and when it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40289:24"/>
did not (or that they had reason to doubt) that it would not
work or <hi>ferment</hi> strongly enough, they have used to put in <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard</hi>
or some other thing of like nature to increase the <hi>fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that which in <hi>Cider</hi> of <hi>Pepins</hi> hath been a cause of greater
<hi>fermentation</hi> than in <hi>Cider</hi> of <hi>Hard-Apples,</hi> being both used after
the former method, is this, that the <hi>Pepins</hi> being a softer fruit are
in the <hi>Mill</hi> bruised into smaller <hi>particles</hi> than the harder sorts of
<hi>Apples;</hi> and consequently more of those small parts pass the strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the <hi>Pepin-Cider</hi> than in the <hi>Cider</hi> of <hi>Hard-apples,</hi> which
causeth a stronger <hi>fermentation,</hi> and (according to my former
<hi>principle</hi>) a greater loss of the native sweetness than in that of
<hi>Hard-app<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e-cider;</hi> and not only so, but the <hi>Lee</hi> of the <hi>Hard-apple-cider</hi>
being compounded of greater <hi>particles</hi> than the <hi>Lee</hi> of the
<hi>Pepin-cider,</hi> every individual <hi>particle</hi> is in it self of a greater weight
than the particles of the Lee of the <hi>Pepin-cider;</hi> and consequently
less apt to rise upon small motions, which produceth this effect;
that when the <hi>fermentation</hi> of the <hi>Hard-apple-cider</hi> is once over,
unless the Vessel be stirred, it seldom falls to a second <hi>fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
but in <hi>Pepin-cider</hi> it is otherwise: For if the <hi>gross Lee</hi> be still
remaining with the <hi>Cider,</hi> it needs not the motion of the Vessel
to cause a new <hi>fermentation,</hi> but every motion of the <hi>Air</hi> by a
change of <hi>weather</hi> from dry to moist will cause a new <hi>fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and consequently make it work till it hath destroyed it self by
losing its native sweetness. And this alone hath been the cause,
why commonly when they <hi>broach</hi> their <hi>Pepin-cider</hi> they find it so
unpleasant, that generally the <hi>Hard-apple-cider</hi> is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, although at first it was not so pleasant as the <hi>Pepin-cider.</hi>
Yet after this mischief hath prevailed over the <hi>Pepin-cider,</hi> it is no
wonder to find the <hi>Hard-apple-cider</hi> remaining not only the
stronger, but even the more pleasant tasted. This to me seems sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
for the discovery of the <hi>cause,</hi> why in <hi>Herefordshire</hi> the
<hi>Hard-apple-cider</hi> is preferred before the <hi>Pepin-cider.</hi> But perhaps
it may be some be <hi>objected,</hi> that they have before the <hi>ten years,</hi>
in which you pretend you found this to be the cause of spoiling
the <hi>Pepin-cider,</hi> been in <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> and tasted the best <hi>Cider</hi>
that <hi>Country</hi> did afford; and yet it was not like the <hi>Pepin-cider</hi>
they had before then tasted in other parts. To this I do <hi>answer,</hi>
at present, briefly, that by some mistake, or chance, the maker of
this <hi>Pepin-cider,</hi> which proved good, had done that, or somewhat
like that, which under the next <hi>Assertion</hi> I shall set down, as a
<hi>Method</hi> to cure the inconveniences which happen to <hi>Pepin-cider,</hi>
by the suffering it to <hi>ferment</hi> too often, or too strongly; but till
that be explained it would be improper to shew more fully what
these particular <hi>accidents</hi> might possibly be, which (without the
intention of those persons which made the <hi>Cider</hi>) caused it to
prove much better than their expectation, or indeed better than
any could afterwards make: they possibly assigning the goodness
of that <hi>Cider</hi> to somewhat that was not really the <hi>cause</hi> of that
<hi>effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:40289:24"/>
To justifie my fourth <hi>Assertion,</hi> and shew a <hi>Method</hi> how to <hi>cure</hi>
the inconveniency which happens to <hi>Pepin-cider</hi> by the over-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I must first take notice of some things which I have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
told concerning <hi>Wine,</hi> and which indeed gave me the light to
know what was the <hi>cause</hi> which had made <hi>Pepin-cider</hi> that had
wrought long, <hi>hard</hi> when it came to be <hi>clear</hi> again. The thing
I mean, is, that in divers <hi>parts,</hi> and even in <hi>France</hi> they make <hi>three
sorts</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> out of one and the same <hi>Grapes;</hi> that is, they first
take the <hi>juice</hi> of the <hi>Grapes</hi> without any more pressing than what
comes from their own weight in the <hi>Vat,</hi> and the bruising they
have in putting into Vessel, which causeth the ripest of those
<hi>Grapes</hi> to break, and the <hi>juice</hi> without any pressing at all makes
the pleasantest and most delicate <hi>Wine:</hi> And if the <hi>Grapes</hi> were
<hi>red,</hi> then is this first <hi>Wine</hi> very <hi>pale.</hi> The second sort they press
a little, which makes a <hi>redder Wine,</hi> but neither so pleasant as the
first, nor so harsh as the last, which is made by the utmost pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the very <hi>skins</hi> of the <hi>Grapes,</hi> and is by much more harsh,
and of deeper colour than either of the other two. Now I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the <hi>cause</hi> of this (at least in part) to be, that in the first sort
of <hi>Wine,</hi> which hath little of the substance, beside the very <hi>juice</hi> of
the <hi>Grape,</hi> there is little <hi>Lee,</hi> and consequently little <hi>fermentation;</hi>
and because it doth not work long, it loseth but little of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
sweetness it had: The second sort being a little more pressed
hath somewhat more of the substance of the <hi>Grape</hi> added to the
<hi>juice;</hi> and therefore having more of that part which causeth <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi>
put with it, <hi>ferments</hi> more strongly, and is therefore<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
when it hath done working, less pleasant than the first sort, which
wrought less. And for the same reason the <hi>third sort</hi> being most
of all pressed, hath most of the substance of the <hi>Grape</hi> mingled
with the <hi>Liquor,</hi> and worketh the longest: but at the end of the
working when it <hi>settles</hi> and is <hi>clear,</hi> it is much more harsh than
either of the two first sorts. The thought of this made me first
apprehend that the <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>Apple</hi> mingled with the <hi>juice,</hi>
was the cause of <hi>fermentation,</hi> which is really nothing else but an
endeavour of the <hi>Liquor</hi> to free it self from those <hi>Heterogeneous</hi>
parts which are mingled with it: And where there is the greatest
proportion of those <hi>dissimilar</hi> parts mingled with the <hi>Liquor,</hi> the
endeavour of <hi>Nature</hi> must be the stronger, and take up more time
to perfect the <hi>separation:</hi> which when finished leaves all the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor</hi>
clear, and the gross parts settled to the bottom of the <hi>Vessel;</hi>
which we call the <hi>Lee.</hi> Nor did this apprehension deceive me; for
when I began (according to the <hi>Method</hi> which I shall hereafter set
down) to separate a considerable part of the <hi>Lee</hi> from the <hi>Cider</hi>
before it had <hi>fermented,</hi> I found it to retain a very great part of
its original sweetness, more than it would have done if the <hi>Lee</hi> had
not been taken away before the <hi>fermentation;</hi> and this not once,
but constantly for <hi>seven years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Method</hi> which I used, was this: When the <hi>Cider</hi> was
first strained, I put it into a great <hi>Vat,</hi> and there let it stand <hi>twenty
four hours</hi> at least (sometimes more, if the <hi>Apples</hi> were more ripe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40289:25"/>
than ordinary) and then at a <hi>tap</hi> before prepared in the <hi>Vessel</hi> three
or four <hi>inches</hi> from the bottom I drew it into <hi>pails,</hi> and from
thence filled the <hi>Hogshead</hi> (or lesser <hi>Vessel)</hi> and left the greatest
part of the <hi>Lee</hi> behind; and during this time that the <hi>Cider</hi> stood
in the <hi>Vat,</hi> I kept it as close covered with <hi>hair-clothes</hi> or <hi>sacks</hi> as I
could; that so too much of the <hi>spirits</hi> might not evaporate.</p>
            <p>Now possibly I might be asked why I did not, since I kept it so
close in the <hi>Vat,</hi> put it at first into the <hi>Vessel?</hi> To which I answer,
that had I put it at first into the <hi>Vessel,</hi> it would possibly (especially
if the <hi>weather</hi> had chanced to prove wet and warm) have begun to
<hi>ferment</hi> before that time had been expired; and then there would
have been no possibility to have separated any part of the <hi>gross
Lee,</hi> before the <hi>fermentation</hi> had been wholly finished; which
keeping it only covered with these clothes was not in danger: For,
though I kept it warm in some degree, yet some of the <hi>spirits</hi> had
still liberty to <hi>evaporate;</hi> which had it been in the <hi>Hogshead</hi> with
the <hi>Bung</hi> only open, they would not so freely have done; but
in the first 24 <hi>hours</hi> it would have begun to <hi>ferment,</hi> and so my
design had been fully lost: For those <hi>spirits</hi> if they had been too
strongly <hi>reverberated</hi> into the <hi>Liquor,</hi> would have caused a <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi>
before I could have taken away any part of the <hi>gross Lee.</hi>
For the great <hi>mystery</hi> of the whole thing lies in this, to let so many
of the <hi>spirits</hi> evaporate, that the <hi>liquor</hi> shall not <hi>ferment</hi> before
the <hi>gross Lee</hi> be taken away; and yet to keep <hi>spirits</hi> enough to
cause a <hi>fermentation</hi> when you would have it. For if you put it
up as soon as it is <hi>strained,</hi> and do not let some of the <hi>spirits</hi> eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate,
and the <hi>gross Lee</hi> by its weight only to be separated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>fermentation,</hi> it will <hi>ferment</hi> too much and lose its sweetness;
and if none be left, it will not <hi>ferment</hi> at all; and then the <hi>Cider</hi>
will be dead, flat and soure.</p>
            <p>Then after it is put into the <hi>Vessel,</hi> and the <hi>Vessel</hi> fill'd all but a
little (that is, about a <hi>Gallon</hi> or thereabout) I let it stand (the <hi>Bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole</hi>
being left only covered with a <hi>paper,</hi> to keep out any dust or
filth that might fall in) for 24 <hi>hours</hi> more; in which time the <hi>gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest</hi>
part of the <hi>Lee</hi> being formerly left in the <hi>Vat,</hi> it will not <hi>ferment,</hi>
but you may draw it off by a <hi>Tap</hi> some two or three inches from
the bottom of the <hi>Vessel,</hi> and in that second <hi>Vessel</hi> you may stop it
up, and let it stand safely till it be fit to <hi>Bottle;</hi> and possibly that
will be within a day or more: but of this time there is no certain
measure to be given; there being so many things that will make
it longer, or less while before it be fit to <hi>bottle.</hi> As for <hi>Example,</hi> If
the <hi>Apples</hi> were <hi>over-ripe</hi> when you stamped them, or ground them
in the <hi>Mill,</hi> it will be the longer before it will be clear enough to
<hi>Bottle;</hi> or if the <hi>weather</hi> prove to be warmer or moister than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary:
or that your <hi>Apples</hi> were of such kinds, as with the same
force in the stamping or grinding they are broken into smaller <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
than other <hi>Apples</hi> that were of harder kinds.</p>
            <p>Now, for knowing when it is fit to <hi>Bottle,</hi> I know no certain <hi>Rule</hi>
that can be given, but to <hi>broach</hi> the <hi>Vessel</hi> with a small <hi>Piercer,</hi> and
in that <hi>hole</hi> fit a <hi>peg,</hi> and now and then (two or three times in a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40289:25"/>
day) draw a little, and see what fineness it is of; for when it is
<hi>bottled</hi> it must not be perfectly <hi>fine;</hi> for if it be so, it will not <hi>fret</hi>
in the <hi>bottle,</hi> which gives it a fine quickness, and will make it
<hi>mantle</hi> and sparkle in the <hi>glass,</hi> when you pour it out: And if it
be too thick when it is <hi>bottled,</hi> then, when it hath stood some time
in the <hi>bottles</hi> it will <hi>ferment</hi> so much that it may possibly either
drive out the <hi>Corks,</hi> or break the <hi>bottles,</hi> or at least be of that sort
(which some call <hi>Potgun-drink)</hi> that when you open the <hi>bottles</hi> it
will fly about the house, and be so <hi>windy</hi> and <hi>cutting</hi> that it will be
inconvenient to drink: For the right <hi>temper</hi> of <hi>Bottle-Cider</hi> is, that
it <hi>mantle</hi> a little and <hi>sparkle</hi> when it is put out into the <hi>glass;</hi> but if
it <hi>froth</hi> and <hi>fly,</hi> it was <hi>bottled</hi> too soon: Now the <hi>temper</hi> of the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
is so nice, that it is very hard when you <hi>bottle</hi> it to foretell
which of these two conditions it will have: but it is very easie
within a few days after (that is to say, about a <hi>week,</hi> or so) to find
its <hi>temper</hi> as to this point. For first, if it be <hi>bottled</hi> too soon; by
this time it will begin to <hi>ferment</hi> in the <hi>Bottles,</hi> and in that case
you must open the <hi>Bottles,</hi> and let them stand open two or three
<hi>minutes,</hi> that that abundance of <hi>spirits</hi> may have <hi>Vent,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
kept in would in a short time make it of that <hi>sort</hi> I called
before <hi>Potgun-drink;</hi> but being let out, that danger will be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and the <hi>Cider</hi> (without danger of breaking the <hi>bottles)</hi> will
<hi>keep</hi> and <hi>ferment,</hi> but not too much. Now this is so easie a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi>
that I would advise all men rather to erre on the hand of
<hi>bottling</hi> it too soon, than let it be too <hi>fine</hi> when they <hi>bottle</hi> it; for
if so, it will not <hi>fret</hi> in the <hi>bottle</hi> at all; and consequently, want
that <hi>briskness</hi> which is desirable.</p>
            <p>Yet even in this case there is a <hi>Remedy,</hi> but such a one as I am
always very careful to avoid, that so I may have nothing (how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
soever) in the <hi>Cider</hi> but the <hi>juice</hi> of the <hi>Apple:</hi> But the <hi>remedy</hi>
is, in case you be put to a necessity to use it, that you open every
<hi>bottle</hi> after it hath been <hi>bottled</hi> about a week or so, and put into
each <hi>bottle</hi> a little piece of <hi>white Sugar,</hi> about the bigness of a <hi>Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg,</hi>
and this will set it into a little <hi>fermentation,</hi> and give it that
<hi>briskness</hi> which otherwise it would have wanted. But the other
way being full as easie, and then nothing to be added but the
juice of the <hi>Apple</hi> to be simply the substance of your <hi>Cider,</hi> I
chuse to prefer the errour of being in danger to <hi>bottle</hi> the <hi>Cider</hi>
too soon, rather than too late: Nay sometimes in the <hi>bottling</hi> of
one and the same <hi>Hogshead</hi> (or other <hi>Vessel)</hi> of <hi>Cider,</hi> there may the
first part of it be too <hi>fine;</hi> the second part <hi>well;</hi> and the last not
<hi>fine</hi> enough: and this happens when it is <hi>broached</hi> first <hi>above</hi> the
<hi>middle,</hi> and then <hi>below;</hi> and then when it begins to run low, <hi>tilted</hi>
or raised at the further end, and so all drawn out. But to avoid
this inconvenience, I commonly set the <hi>bottles</hi> in the order they
were filled, and so we need not open all to see the condition of
the <hi>Cider;</hi> but trying one at each end, and one in the middle,
will serve the turn: And to prevent the inconveniency,
<hi>broach</hi> not at all above the <hi>middle,</hi> nor too <hi>low;</hi> and when
you have drawn all that will run at the <hi>Tap,</hi> you may be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40289:26"/>
secure it is so far of the same <hi>temper</hi> with the first <hi>bottle.</hi> And
then <hi>tilt</hi> the <hi>Vessel;</hi> but draw no more in three or four hours at
the least after, and set them by themselves, that so, if you please,
you may three or four days after pour them off into other <hi>bottles,</hi>
and leave the <hi>gross</hi> behind: And by this means though you have a
less number of <hi>bottles</hi> of <hi>Cider</hi> than you had, yet this will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
good, and neither be apt to <hi>fly,</hi> nor have a <hi>sediment</hi> in the
<hi>bottle,</hi> which after the first <hi>glass</hi> is filled will render all the rest of
the <hi>bottle</hi> thick and muddy.</p>
            <p>By all this which I have said, I think it may be made out that
those persons which I mentioned in the end of the last <hi>Paragraph,</hi>
that sometimes had <hi>Pepin-cider</hi> better than ordinary, and indeed
then they could make again, were beholding to <hi>chance</hi> for it;
either that their <hi>Apples</hi> were not so full ripe at that as at <hi>other</hi>
times, and so not bruised into so small parts; but the <hi>fermentation</hi>
was ended in the <hi>Vessel,</hi> and the <hi>Lee</hi> being then <hi>gross</hi> setled before
the <hi>Cider</hi> had <hi>fermented</hi> so long as to be hard.</p>
            <p>Or else, by some <hi>Accident</hi> they had not put it so soon into the
<hi>Vessel,</hi> but that in part it was setled before they put it up, and the
grossest part of the <hi>Lee</hi> left out of the <hi>Vessel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or else, the <hi>Bung</hi> being left <hi>open</hi> some part of the <hi>spirits</hi> evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated;
and that made the <hi>fermentation</hi> the weaker, and to last
the less time.</p>
            <p>Or else, they put it up in such a <hi>season</hi> that the <hi>weather</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<hi>cold</hi> and <hi>frosty</hi> till the <hi>fermentation</hi> was quite over; and then
it having wrought the less time, and with the less violence, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
more pleasant and rich than otherwise it would have
done.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>time</hi> of making <hi>Pepin-cider,</hi> I chuse to do it in the
<hi>beginning</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> after the <hi>Apples</hi> had been gathered and
laid about three weeks or more in the <hi>loft,</hi> that so the <hi>Apples</hi>
might have had a little time to <hi>sweat</hi> in the house before the <hi>Cider</hi>
was made, but not too much; for if they be not full <hi>ripe</hi> before
they be <hi>gathered,</hi> and not suffered to lye a while in the <hi>heap,</hi> the
<hi>Cider</hi> will not be so pleasant; and if they be <hi>too ripe</hi> when they
are <hi>gathered,</hi> or lye too long in the <hi>heap,</hi> it will be very difficult
to separate the <hi>Cider</hi> from the <hi>gross Lee</hi> before the <hi>fermentation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins:
and in that case it will work so long, that when it <hi>fines</hi> the
<hi>Cider</hi> will be <hi>hard;</hi> for when the <hi>Apples</hi> are too <hi>mellow,</hi> they
break into so small <hi>particles,</hi> that it will be long before the <hi>Lee</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
by its <hi>weight</hi> only: and then the <hi>fermentation</hi> may begin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be <hi>separated,</hi> and so destroy your intention of taking away
the <hi>gross Lee.</hi> And if the <hi>Apples</hi> be not <hi>mellow</hi> enough, the <hi>Cider</hi>
will not be so pleasant as it ought to be.</p>
            <p>This being said for the time of making the <hi>Pepin-Cider,</hi> may
<hi>(mutatis mutandis)</hi> serve for all other sorts of <hi>Summer-fruit;</hi> as
the <hi>Kentish-codling, Marigolds, Gilly-flowers, Summer-pearmains,
Summer-pepins, Holland-pepins, Golden-pepins,</hi> and even <hi>Winter-pearmains.</hi>
For though they must not be made at the same <hi>time</hi>
of the <hi>year,</hi> yet they must be made at the <hi>time</hi> when each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40289:26"/>
               <hi>fruit</hi> is in the same condition that I before directed that
the <hi>Winter-pepin</hi> should be. Nay, even in the making of that <hi>Cider,</hi>
you are not tied to that time of the <hi>year</hi> to make your <hi>Cider;</hi> but
as the condition of that particular <hi>year</hi> hath been, you may make
your <hi>Cider</hi> one, two, three or four weeks later; but it will be
very seldom that you shall need to begin to make <hi>Kentish-pepin-Cider</hi>
before the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> even in the most <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi>
parts of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing I shall mention, is, the ordering of your <hi>bottles</hi>
after they are <hi>filled;</hi> for in that consists no small part of causing
your <hi>Cider</hi> to be in a just condition to <hi>drink:</hi> For, if it does <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
too much in the <hi>bottle,</hi> it will not be so convenient to <hi>drink,</hi>
neither for the taste, nor wholsomness; and if it <hi>ferment</hi> not at
all, it will want that little <hi>fret</hi> which makes it <hi>grateful</hi> to most <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</hi>
In order to this, you must observe, first, whether the <hi>Cider</hi>
were <hi>bottled</hi> too early, or too late, or in the just time: If too ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and that it hath too much of the <hi>flying Lee</hi> in it, then you must
keep it as cool as you can, that it may not work too much, and if
so little that you doubt it will not work at all, or too little; you
must by keeping it from the inconvenience of the external <hi>air,</hi>
endeavour to hasten and increase the <hi>fermentation.</hi> And this I do,
by setting it in <hi>sand</hi> to cool, and by covering the <hi>bottles</hi> very well
with <hi>straw,</hi> when I would hasten or increase the <hi>fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if I find the <hi>Cider</hi> to have been <hi>bottled</hi> in its just time, then I
use <hi>neither,</hi> in ordinary weather; but content my self that it stands
in a close and cool <hi>Cellar,</hi> either upon the <hi>ground,</hi> or upon <hi>shelves;</hi>
saving in the time that I apprehend <hi>frost,</hi> I cover it with <hi>straw,</hi>
which I take off as soon as the <hi>weather</hi> changeth; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
about the time that the cold <hi>East winds</hi> cease; which usually
with us, is in the beginning of <hi>April;</hi> I set my <hi>bottles</hi> into <hi>sand</hi> up
to the necks. And by this means I have kept <hi>Pepin-cider</hi> without
change till <hi>September,</hi> and might have kept it longer, if my store
had been greater: For by that time the heats were totally over,
and consequently, the <hi>cause</hi> of the <hi>turn</hi> of <hi>Cider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having now declared what is (according to my opinion) to be
done to preserve <hi>Cider,</hi> if not in it's original sweetness, yet to let
it lose as little as is possible; I shall now fall upon my <hi>fifth Assertion,</hi>
which is, that it is probable that somewhat like the former <hi>Method</hi>
may in some degree mend <hi>Hard-Apple-cider, Perry,</hi> or a drink
made of the mixtures of <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears;</hi> and not impossible
that somewhat of the same nature may do good to <hi>French-wines</hi>
also.</p>
            <p>First, for <hi>French-wines,</hi> I think what I have in the beginning
of this <hi>discourse</hi> declared, as the hint which first put me upon the
conceit, that the over-<hi>fermenting</hi> of <hi>Cider</hi> was the cause that it
lost of its original sweetness <hi>(viz.</hi> the making of <hi>three</hi> sorts of
<hi>Wine,</hi> of <hi>one</hi> sort of <hi>Grapes)</hi> is a testimony that the first sort of
<hi>Wine</hi> hath but little of the <hi>gross Lee,</hi> and consequently, <hi>ferments</hi>
but little, nor loseth but little of the original sweetness; which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40289:27"/>
makes it evident that the same thing will hold in <hi>Wine,</hi> which doth
in <hi>Cider;</hi> but the great difficulty is (if I be rightly informed)
that they use to let the <hi>Wine</hi> begin to <hi>ferment</hi> in the <hi>Vat</hi> before
they put it into the <hi>Hogsheads</hi> or other <hi>Vessels;</hi> and thus they do,
that the <hi>Husks</hi> and other <hi>Filth</hi> (which in the way they use, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be mingled with the <hi>Wine</hi>) may rise in a <hi>skum</hi> at the top,
and so be taken off: Now if they please, as soon as it is <hi>pressed,</hi>
to pass the <hi>Wine</hi> through a <hi>strainer,</hi> without expecting any such
<hi>purgation,</hi> and then use the same <hi>Method</hi> formerly prescribed for
<hi>Cider,</hi> I do not doubt but the gross part of the <hi>Lee</hi> of <hi>Wines,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus taken away, there will yet be enough left to give it a <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi>
in the <hi>bottles,</hi> or second <hi>vessel,</hi> where it shall be left to
stand, in case you have not <hi>bottles</hi> enough to put up all the <hi>Wine</hi>
from which you have thus taken away the <hi>gross Lee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Wine</hi> I know not whether it will last so long as the other
used in the ordinary way, or not; but this I confidently believe,
it will not be so harsh as the same would have been if it had been
used in the ordinary way; and the pleasantness of <hi>Taste,</hi> which is
not unwholsome, is the chief thing which I prefer both in <hi>Wine</hi>
and <hi>Cider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Hard-apple-Cider,</hi> that it will receive an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by this way of ordering, hath been long my opinion; but
this year an accident happened, which made it evident that I was
not mistaken in this conjecture. For there was a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of
<hi>Herefordshire,</hi> this last <hi>Autumn,</hi> that by accident had not provided
<hi>Cask</hi> enough for the <hi>Cider</hi> he had made; and having six or seven
<hi>Hogsheads</hi> of <hi>Cider</hi> for which he had no <hi>Cask,</hi> he sent to <hi>Worcester,
Glocester,</hi> and even to <hi>Bristol,</hi> to buy some, but all in vain; and
when his <hi>servants</hi> returned, the <hi>Cider</hi> that wanted <hi>Cask</hi> had
been some five days in the <hi>Vat</hi> uncovered; and the <hi>Gentleman</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then dispatching a <hi>Barque</hi> for <hi>London</hi> with <hi>Cider,</hi> and having
neer hand a conveniency of getting <hi>Glass-bottles,</hi> resolved to put
some of it into <hi>bottles;</hi> did so, and filled seven or eight <hi>Hampers</hi>
with the clearest of this <hi>Cider</hi> in the <hi>Vat,</hi> which had then never
wrought, nor been put into any other <hi>Vessel</hi> but the <hi>Vat;</hi> the <hi>Barque</hi>
in which his <hi>Cider</hi> came had a tedious passage; that is, it was at
least seven weeks before it came to <hi>London,</hi> and in that time most
of his <hi>Cider</hi> in <hi>Cask</hi> had wrought so much that it was much hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than it would have been if it had according to the ordinary way
lain still in the <hi>Country,</hi> in the place where it was first made and put
up, and consequently, wrought but once.</p>
            <p>But the other, which was in <hi>Bottles,</hi> and escaped the breaking,
that is, by accident, had less of the <hi>Lee</hi> in it than other <hi>bottles</hi> had, or
was not so hard stopped, but either before there was force enough
from the <hi>fermentation</hi> to break the <hi>bottle,</hi> or that the <hi>Cork</hi> gave
way a little, and so the <hi>air</hi> got out; or that the <hi>Bottles</hi> were not
originally well <hi>corked,</hi> was excellent good, beyond any <hi>Cider</hi>
that I had tasted out of <hi>Herefordshire;</hi> so that from this <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
I dare confidently say, that the using <hi>Hard-apple-cider</hi> after
the former <hi>Method,</hi> prescribed for <hi>Pepin-cider,</hi> will make it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40289:27"/>
a considerable part of sweetness more than it can do after the
<hi>Method</hi> used hitherto in <hi>Herefordshire.</hi> Nor do I doubt but my
<hi>Method</hi> will in a degree have the same effect in <hi>Perry,</hi> and the
drink (as yet without a name that I do know of) which is made
of the <hi>Iuice</hi> of <hi>Wardens, Pears,</hi> and <hi>Apples,</hi> by several persons, in
several proportions; for the <hi>Reason</hi> being the same, I have no
cause to doubt, but the <hi>effect</hi> will follow, as well in those <hi>Drinks,</hi>
as in <hi>Cider</hi> and <hi>Wines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now come to my last <hi>Assertion;</hi> that <hi>Cider</hi> thus used can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be <hi>unwholesom,</hi> but may be done to what degree any mans <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
desires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It cannot be <hi>unwholesome,</hi> upon the same measure that
<hi>stummed Wine</hi> is so; for that unwholesomness is by leaving the
cause of <hi>fermentation</hi> in the <hi>Wine,</hi> and not suffering it to produce
its <hi>effect</hi> before the <hi>Wine</hi> be drank, and it <hi>ferments</hi> in mans body:
and not only so, but sets other <hi>humours</hi> in the body into <hi>fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi>
and this prejudiceth their <hi>health</hi> that drink such <hi>Wines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though <hi>Cider</hi> used in my <hi>method</hi> should not <hi>ferment</hi> at all,
till it come into the <hi>bottle,</hi> and then but a little; yet the cause of
<hi>fermentation</hi> being in a great degree taken away, the rest can do
no considerable harm to those which drink it, being in it self but
little, and having wrought in the <hi>bottle</hi> before men drink it; nor
indeed do I think, nor ever find, that it did any inconvenience to
my self, or any person that drank it when it was thus used.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> because the difference of mens <hi>palates</hi> and <hi>constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
is very great; and that accordingly men like or dislike drink
that hath more or less of the <hi>fret</hi> in it; and that the consequences
in point of health are very different, in the <hi>method</hi> by me former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prescribed: it is in your <hi>power</hi> to give the <hi>Cider</hi> just as much
<hi>fret</hi> as you please, and no more; and that by several ways: for
either you may <hi>bottle</hi> it sooner or later, as you please: or you
may <hi>bottle</hi> it from two <hi>Taps</hi> in your <hi>Vessel,</hi> and that from the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
Tap will have less <hi>fret,</hi> and the <hi>lower</hi> more: or you may <hi>bottle</hi>
your <hi>Cider</hi> all from one <hi>Tap,</hi> and open some of the <hi>bottles</hi> about a
week after for a few <hi>minutes,</hi> and then stop them up again; and
that which was thus stop'd will have the less <hi>fret:</hi> or, if your <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
be <hi>bottled</hi> all from one <hi>Tap,</hi> if you will (even without opening
the <hi>bottles</hi>) you may make some difference, though not so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
as either of the former ways, by keeping part of the <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi>
warmer, for the first two <hi>Months,</hi> than the rest; for that
which is kept warmest will have the most <hi>fret.</hi>

            <head>Sir PAVL NEILE'S second Paper.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Paper which by the Command of the <hi>Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>
I delivered in the last year, concerning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of <hi>Cider,</hi> I have by this years experience
found defective in one particular, of which I think
fit by this to give you notice, which is thus: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the former <hi>Paper</hi> I mention, that after the <hi>Pepin-Cider</hi> hath
stood 24 hours in the <hi>Vat,</hi> it might be drawn off into Pails, and so
put into the Vessel; and that having stood a second 24 hours in
that Vessel, it might be drawn into another Vessel, in which it
might stand till it were fit to <hi>Bottle;</hi> for the particulars of all
which proceeding I refer to the former Paper; and shall now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mention, That this last year we were fain to draw it off into
several Vessels, not only as is there directed, <hi>twice,</hi> but most of
our <hi>Cider</hi> five, and some <hi>six</hi> times; and not only so, but we were
after all this fain to <hi>precipitate</hi> the <hi>Lee</hi> by some of those ways
mention'd by Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> in the 7th <hi>Chap.</hi> of his Treatise <hi>De fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatione.</hi>
Now though this be more of trouble than the
Method by me formerly mention'd; yet it doth not in the least
destroy that <hi>Hypothesis</hi> which in the former Discourse I laid down,
<hi>(viz.)</hi> That it was the leaving too much of the <hi>Lee</hi> with the
<hi>Cider,</hi> which upon the change of air, set it into a new <hi>fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and consequently made it lose the sweetness; for this change
by the indisposition of the <hi>Lee</hi> to settle this year more than
others, hath not hindred the goodness of the <hi>Cider;</hi> but that
when it was at last mastered, and the <hi>Cider</hi> bottled in a fit temper,
it was never more pleasant and quick than this year: but I find
that this year our <hi>Cider</hi> of Summer-Apples is already turned
sowre, although it be now but the first of <hi>Ianuary;</hi> and the last
year it kept very well till the beginning of <hi>March;</hi> which makes
me fear that our <hi>Pepin-Cider</hi> will not keep till this time twelve-moneth,
as our <hi>Pepin-Cider</hi> of the last year doth till this day, and
still retains its original pleasantness without the least turn towards
sowreness.</p>
            <p>And I am very confident, the difference of time and trouble,
which this year we found in getting the <hi>Cider</hi> to <hi>fine</hi> and be in a
condition to Bottle, was only the effect of a very bad and wet
Summer, which made the Fruit not ripen kindly; and to make
it yet worse, we had just at the time when we made our <hi>Cider,</hi>
this year, extream wet and windy weather, which (added to the
unkindliness of the Fruit) was the whole cause of this alteration:
And however my <hi>Hypothesis</hi> as yet remains firm, for if by taking
any part of the <hi>Lee</hi> from the <hi>Cider</hi> you can preserve it in its
original sweetness, it is not at all material whether it be always to
be done by twice drawing off from the <hi>Lee,</hi> or that it must some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

               <p>IF the <hi>Apples</hi> are made up immediately from the <hi>Tree,</hi> they
are observ'd to yield <hi>more,</hi> but not so <hi>good</hi> Cider, as when
<hi>hoarded</hi> the space of a Moneth so six weeks; and if they
contract any unpleasing taste (as sometimes 'tis confess'd
they do) it may be imputed to the Room they lie in,
which if it hath any thing in it, of either too sweet or unsavoury
smell, the <hi>Apples</hi> (as things most susceptible of impression) will
be easily tainted thereby.</p>
               <p>One of my acquaintance, when a child, hoarding <hi>Apples</hi> in a
Box where <hi>Rose-Cakes</hi> and other sweets were their companions,
found them of so unsavoury taste, and of so rank a relish deriv'd
from the too near neighbour-hood of the Perfumes, that even a
childish palate (which seldom mislikes any thing that looks like an
<hi>Apple</hi>) could not dispense with it.</p>

               <p>It is therefore observ'd by prudent <hi>Fruiterers,</hi> to lay their <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
upon clean new made <hi>Reed,</hi> till they grind them for <hi>Cider,</hi>
or otherwise make use of them. And if, notwithstanding this
caution, they contract any rottenness before they come to the
<hi>Cider-press,</hi> the damage will not be great, if care be had before
the <hi>Apples</hi> be ground, to pick out the finnewed and the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotten;
the rest, though somewhat of putrefaction hath pass'd
upon them, will not render the <hi>Cider</hi> ill condition'd, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of taste, or duration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:40289:29"/>
A Friend of mine having made provision of <hi>Apples</hi> for <hi>Cider,</hi>
whereof so great a part were found rotten when the time of grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them came, that they did, as 'twere wash the Room with their
Juice, through which they were carried to the <hi>Wring,</hi> had <hi>Cider</hi>
from them not only passable, but exceeding good; though not
without previous use of the pre-mention'd Caution. I am also
assured by a Neighbour of mine, That a Brother of his who is a
great <hi>Cider-Merchant</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> is by frequent experience
so well satisfied of the harmlesness of <hi>Rotten-Apples,</hi> that he
makes no scruple of exchanging with any one that comes to his
<hi>Cider-press,</hi> a Bushel of <hi>sound-Apples</hi> for the same measure of the
other. Herein, I suppose, (if in other respects they be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial)
he may be a gainer by the near compression of the taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Fruit, which, as we speak in our Country Phrase, will
go nearer together than the other. His advantage may be the
greater, if the conceit which goes current with them be not a
bottomless fancy, That a convenient quantity of <hi>rotten-Apples</hi>
mixt with the sound, is greatly assistant to the work of <hi>fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and notably helps to clarifie the <hi>Cider.</hi>

               <p>It matters not much whether the <hi>Cider</hi> be forc'd to purge it
self by working downwards in the Barrel, or upwards at the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Vent, so there be matter sufficient left on the top for a thick
skin or film, which will sometimes be drawn over it when it
works, after the usual manner, as when 'tis presently stopt up
with space left for <hi>fermentation,</hi> to be perform'd altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Vessel.</p>
               <p>The thick skin, or <hi>Leathern-coat,</hi> the <hi>Cider</hi> oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
as well after it hath purged it self after the usual manner,
as otherwise, is held the surest preservation of its <hi>spirits,</hi> and
the best security against other inconveniences incident to <hi>this,</hi>
and other like <hi>vinous</hi> Liquors, of which the <hi>Devonshire Cider-Merchants</hi>
are so sensible, that, beside the particular care they
take, that matter be not wanting for the Contexture of this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
garment by stopping up the Vessel as soon as they have fill'd
it; (with the allowance of a Gallon or two upon the score of
<hi>Fermentation</hi>) they cast in Wheaten Bran, or Dust, to thicken
the Coat, and render it more certainly Air-proof. And I think
you will believe their care in this kind not impertinent, if you
can believe a story which I have to tell of its marvellous efficacy:
A near neighbour of mine assures me, that his Wife having this
year filled a Barrel with <hi>Mead,</hi> being strong, it wrought so boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously
in the Vessel, that the good Woman casting her eye that
way, accidentally, found it leaking at every chink, which ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the strength of the Liquor, she thought immediately by
giving it vent, to save both the Liquor and the Vessel, but in
vain; both the Stopples being pulled out, the leakage still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
and the Vessel not at all reliev'd, till casually at length
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40289:30"/>
putting in her finger at the top, she brake the premention'd film;
which done, a good part of the <hi>Mead</hi> immediately flying out,
left the residue in peace, and the leakage ceased. It may seem
incredible that so thin a skin should be more coercive to a muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Liquor, than a Barrel with Oaken-Ribs, and stubborn
Hoops: But I am so well assur'd of the veritableness of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Relation, that I dare not question it: The reason of it let
wiser men determine.</p>

               <p>If the <hi>Apples</hi> be abortive, having been (as it usually happens)
shaken down before the time by a violent Wind, it is observ'd to
be so indispensably necessary that they lie together in hoard, at
least till the usual time of their maturity, that the <hi>Cider</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
is seldom, or never found worth the drinking.</p>
               <p>A Neighbour told me, That making a quantity of <hi>Cider</hi> with
<hi>Wind-falls</hi> which he let ripen in the Hoard, near a month inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
between the time of their decussion, and that which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
intended for their maturity; his <hi>Cider</hi> prov'd very good,

               <p>No Liquor is observ'd to be more easily affected with
the savour of the <hi>Vessel</hi> it is put into, than <hi>Cider;</hi> therefore sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
care is taken by discreet <hi>Cider-Masters,</hi> That the <hi>Vessel</hi> be
not only <hi>tasteless,</hi> but also well prepar'd for the <hi>Liquor</hi> they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to fill it with. If it be a new <hi>Cask,</hi> they prepare it by
scalding it with Water, wherein a good quantity of <hi>Apple-pomice</hi>
hath been boil'd: if a tainted <hi>Cask,</hi> they have divers ways of
cleansing it. Some boil an <hi>Ounce</hi> of <hi>Pepper</hi> in so much Water as
will fill an <hi>Hogshead,</hi> which they let stand in a Vessel of that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
two or three days, and then wash it with a convenient
quantity of fresh Water scalding hot, which they say is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
cure for the most dangerously infected <hi>Vessel.</hi> A Friend
and Neighbour of mine herewith cured a Vessel of so extream ill
savour, as it was thought it would little less than poyson any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
that was put into it. Others have a more easie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
no less effectual Remedy. They take two or three stones
of quick-Lime, which in six or seven Gallons of Water they set
on work in the <hi>Hogshead</hi> being close stopt, and tumbling it up and
down till the commotion cease, it doth the feat. Of Vessels that
have been formerly used, next to that which hath been already
acquainted with <hi>Cider,</hi> a <hi>White-Wine,</hi> or <hi>Vinegar Cask</hi> is esteem'd
the best; <hi>Claret</hi> or <hi>Sack</hi> not so good. A Barrel newly tenanted
by small <hi>Beer</hi> suits better with <hi>Cider</hi> than a strong-<hi>Beer</hi> Vessel.</p>

               <p>Half a peck of unground Wheat put to <hi>Cider</hi> that is harsh and
eager, will renew its <hi>fermentation,</hi> and render it more mild and
gentle. Sometimes it happens without the use of any such means
to change with the season, and becomes of <hi>sharp</hi> and <hi>sour</hi> unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
<hi>benigne</hi> and <hi>pleasant.</hi> Two or three <hi>Eggs</hi> whole put into

               <p>A Neighbour <hi>Divine,</hi> of my acquaintance, assured me, That

it might, if he remember'd the old <hi>Proverb, He mends as sour

               <p>The latter running of the <hi>Cider</hi> bottled immediately from the

with the first running.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Devonshire</hi> where their <hi>Wrings</hi> are so hugely great, that
an <hi>Hogshead</hi> or two runs out commonly before the <hi>Apples</hi> suffer
any considerable pressure, they value this before the other, much
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40289:31"/>
after the rate which we set upon <hi>life-honey</hi> (that which in like

it self without <hi>compression.</hi> In <hi>Iersey</hi> they value it a <hi>Crown</hi> upon
an <hi>Hogshead</hi> dearer than the other: (This I take from
the Relation of one of my Neighbours, who sometimes lived
in that <hi>Island,</hi> which for <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Cider</hi> is one of the most
famous of all belonging to his <hi>Majesties</hi> Dominions) Yet even
upon <hi>this,</hi> and their choicest <hi>Ciders,</hi> they commonly bestow
a <hi>pail</hi> of <hi>water</hi> to every <hi>Hogshead,</hi> being so far (it seems) of
<hi>Pindar</hi>'s mind, that they fear not any prejudice to their
most excellent <hi>Liquors</hi> by a dash of that most excellent <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
Insomuch that it goes for a common saying amongst
them, That if any <hi>Cider</hi> can be found in their <hi>Island,</hi> which
can be prov'd to have no mixture of <hi>Water,</hi> 'tis clearly
forfeited. It seems they are strongly conceited, that this
addition of the most useful <hi>Element,</hi> doth greatly meliorate

               <p>About seven years since I gave my self the Experience of <hi>Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-scale

seemingly as good, if not better, than the <hi>boiled.</hi> But, having
stopt up the <hi>boil'd,</hi> I took it to task again about ten Months after.
At which time, I found it so excessively strong, that five persons
would hardly venture upon an ordinary Glass full of it. My
friends would hardly believe but I had heightned it with some of
my <hi>Chymical Spirits.</hi> The truth is, I do not remember that I

            <head>CONCERNING
CIDER,</head>
            <byline>By Doctor SMITH.</byline>
            <p>THE best time to <hi>grind</hi> the <hi>Apples</hi> is immediately
from the <hi>Tree,</hi> so soon as they are throughly ripe:
for, so they will yield the greater quantity of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,</hi>
the <hi>Cider</hi> will drink the better, and last long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than if the <hi>Apples</hi> were hoarded: For <hi>Cider</hi> made
of hoarded <hi>Apples</hi> will always retain an unpleasing taste of the
<hi>Apples,</hi> especially if they contract any rottenness.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cider</hi> that is ground in a <hi>Stone-case</hi> is generally accused to
taste unpleasantly of the <hi>Rinds, Stems,</hi> and <hi>Kernels</hi> of the <hi>Apples;</hi>
which it will not if ground in a <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Wood,</hi> which doth not
bruise them so much.</p>
            <p>So soon as the <hi>Cider</hi> is made, put it into the <hi>Vessel</hi> (leaving it
about the space of one <hi>Gallon</hi> empty) and presently stop it up ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
close: This way is observed to keep it longer, and to preserve
its <hi>spirits</hi> better than the usual way of filling the <hi>Vessel</hi> quite full,
and keeping it open till it hath done <hi>fermenting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cider</hi> put into a new Vessel will often taste of the <hi>Wood,</hi> if it be
pierced early; but the same stopped up again, and reserved till
the latter end of the year, will free it self of that taste.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Cider</hi> be sharp and thick it will recover it self again: But
if sharp and clear, it will not.</p>
            <p>About <hi>March</hi> (or when the Cider begins to sparkle in the glass)
before it be too fine, is the best time to bottle it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cider</hi> will be much longer in clearing in a mild and moist, then
in a cold and dry <hi>Winter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To every <hi>Hogshead</hi> of <hi>Cider,</hi> designed for two years keeping,
it is requisite to add (about <hi>March,</hi> the first year) a quart of <hi>Wheat</hi>
unground.</p>
            <p>The best <hi>Fruit</hi> (with us in <hi>Glocester-shire</hi>) for the first years <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
are the <hi>Red-strake;</hi> the White and Red <hi>Must-apple,</hi> the sweet
and sour <hi>Pepin,</hi> and the <hi>Harvey-apple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pearmains</hi> alone make but a small liquor, and hardly clearing
of it self; but, mixed either with sweet or sour <hi>Pepins,</hi> it becomes
very brisk and clear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Must-apple-cider</hi> (though the first made) is always the last ripe;
by reason that most of the <hi>pulp</hi> of the <hi>Apple</hi> passeth the <hi>strainer</hi> in
pressing, and makes it exceeding thick.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cider</hi> of the <hi>Bromsbury-Crab,</hi> and <hi>Fox-whelp,</hi> is not fit for
drinking, till the <hi>second year,</hi> but then very good.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cider</hi> of the <hi>Bromsbury-Crab</hi> yields a far greater proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>spirits,</hi> in the distillation, than any of the others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crabs</hi> and <hi>Pears</hi> mixed make a very pleasing Liquor, and much
sooner ripe than <hi>Pears</hi> alone.</p>

            <head>OF
CIDER.</head>
            <byline>By Capt. SYLAS TAYLOR.</byline>
            <p>
               <hi>HErefordshire</hi> affords several sorts of <hi>Cider-apples,</hi> as
the two sorts of <hi>Red strakes,</hi> the <hi>Gennet-moyle,</hi>
the <hi>Summer-violet,</hi> or <hi>Fillet,</hi> and the <hi>Winter-fillet;</hi>
with many other sorts which are used only to make
<hi>Cider.</hi> Of which some use each sort <hi>simply;</hi> and
others <hi>mix</hi> many sorts together. This <hi>County</hi> is very well
stored with other sorts of <hi>Apples;</hi> as <hi>Pepins, Pearmains, &amp;c.</hi>
of which there is much <hi>Cider</hi> made, but not to be compared
to the <hi>Cider</hi> drawn from the <hi>Cider-apples;</hi> among which
the <hi>Red-strakes</hi> bear the Bell; a <hi>Fruit</hi> in it self scarce <hi>edible;</hi>
yet the <hi>juice</hi> being pressed out is immediately pleasant in taste,
without any thing of the <hi>restringency</hi> which it had when incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
with the <hi>meat,</hi> or <hi>flesh</hi> of the <hi>Apple.</hi> It is many times
<hi>three Months</hi> before it comes to its <hi>clearness,</hi> and <hi>six Months</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it comes to a ripeness fit for <hi>drinking;</hi> yet I have tasted of it
<hi>three years, old,</hi> very pleasant, though dangerously strong. The
<hi>colour</hi> of it, when <hi>fine,</hi> is of a sparkling <hi>yellow,</hi> like <hi>Canary,</hi> of
a good full body, and <hi>oyly:</hi> The <hi>taste,</hi> like the <hi>Flavour</hi> or
<hi>perfume</hi> of excellent <hi>Peaches,</hi> very grateful to the <hi>Palate</hi> and
<hi>Stomach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gennet-moyles</hi> make a <hi>Cider</hi> of a smaller body than the former,
yet very pleasant, and will last a <hi>year.</hi> It is a good eating plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
sharp fruit, when ripe, and the best <hi>Tart-apple</hi> (as the <hi>Red-strake</hi>
also) before its ripeness. The <hi>Tree</hi> grows with certain knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>extuberancies</hi> upon the <hi>branches</hi> and <hi>boughs;</hi> below which <hi>knot</hi>
we cut off boughs the thickness of a mans <hi>wrist,</hi> and place the
knot in the ground, which makes the <hi>root;</hi> and this is done to
raise this <hi>fruit;</hi> but very rarely by <hi>graffing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of <hi>Fillets</hi> of both sorts (<hi>viz.</hi> Summer and Winter) I have made
<hi>Cider</hi> of that proportionate taste and strength, that I have decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
several experienced <hi>Palates,</hi> with whom (simply) it hath pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for <hi>White-Wine;</hi> and <hi>dashing</hi> it with <hi>Red-Wine,</hi> it hath passed
for <hi>Claret;</hi> and mingled with the <hi>Syrupe</hi> of <hi>Rasp'yes</hi> it makes an
excellent <hi>womans wine:</hi> The fruit is not so good as the <hi>Gennet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyle</hi>
to eat: The <hi>Winter-fillet</hi> makes a <hi>lasting Cider,</hi> and the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40289:33"/>
               <hi>Summer-fillet</hi> an <hi>early Cider,</hi> but both very strong; and the <hi>Apples</hi>
mixt together make a good <hi>Cider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These <hi>Apples</hi> yield a <hi>liquor</hi> more grateful to my <hi>Palate</hi> (and so
esteem'd of in <hi>Herefordshire</hi> by the greater <hi>Ciderists)</hi> than any
made of <hi>Pepins</hi> and <hi>Pearmains,</hi> of which sorts we have very good
in that <hi>Country;</hi> and those also both <hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> of both
sorts, and of which I have drank the <hi>Cider;</hi> but prefer the
other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grounds</hi> separated only with a <hi>Hedge</hi> and <hi>Ditch,</hi> by reason of
the difference of <hi>Soils</hi> have given a great alteration to the <hi>Cider,</hi>
notwithstanding the Trees have been graffed with equal care,
the same <hi>Graffs,</hi> and lastly, the same care taken in the making of
the <hi>Cider.</hi> This as to the <hi>Red-strake;</hi> I have not observ'd the
same <hi>niceness</hi> in any other <hi>fruit;</hi> for <hi>Gennet-moyles,</hi> and <hi>Fillets</hi>
thrive very well over all <hi>Herefordshire.</hi> The <hi>Red-strake</hi> delights
most in fat soil: <hi>Hamlacy</hi> is a rich intermixt soil of <hi>Red-fat-clay</hi>
and <hi>Sand;</hi> and <hi>Kings-capel</hi> a low hot sandy ground, both well
defended from noxious <hi>Winds,</hi> and both very famous for the
<hi>Red-strake-cider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Pear</hi> in <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Worcester-shires,</hi> which is called
<hi>Bareland-pear,</hi> which makes a very good <hi>Cider.</hi> I call it <hi>Cider</hi>
(and not <hi>Perry</hi>) because it hath all the <hi>properties</hi> of <hi>Cider.</hi> I have
drank of it from half a year old to two years old. It keeps it self
without <hi>Roping</hi> (to which <hi>Perry</hi> is generally inclined) and from
its taste: Dr. <hi>Beal,</hi> in his little <hi>Treatise</hi> called the <hi>Herefordshire-Orchard,</hi>
calls it deservingly a <hi>Masculine Drink;</hi> because in raste
not like the sweet <hi>luscious feminine</hi> juice of <hi>Pears.</hi> This <hi>Tree</hi>
thrives very well in barren ground, and is a fruit (with the <hi>Red-strake</hi>)
of which <hi>Swine</hi> will not eat; therefore fittest to be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Hedge-rows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Red strakes</hi> and other <hi>Cider-apples</hi> when <hi>ripe</hi> (which you may
know partly by the blackness of the <hi>Kernel's,</hi> and partly by the
<hi>colour</hi> and <hi>smell</hi> of the fruit) ought to be gathered in <hi>Baskets</hi> or
<hi>Bags,</hi> preserved from bruising, and laid up in heaps in the <hi>Orchard</hi>
to <hi>sweat;</hi> covered every night from the <hi>dew:</hi> Or else, in a <hi>Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floor</hi>
(or the like) with some <hi>Wheat</hi> or <hi>Rye-straw</hi> under them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kept so long till you find, by their <hi>mellowing,</hi> they are fit for
the <hi>Mill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that grind, or bruise their <hi>Apples</hi> presently upon their <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering,</hi>
receive so much <hi>liquor</hi> from them, that between <hi>twenty</hi>
or <hi>twenty two Bushels</hi> will make a <hi>Hogshead</hi> of <hi>Cider:</hi> but this <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
will neither <hi>keep</hi> so well, nor <hi>drink</hi> with such a <hi>fragrancy</hi> as is
desired and endeavoured.</p>
            <p>They that keep them a <hi>month</hi> or <hi>six weeks</hi> hoarded, allow
about <hi>thirty bushels</hi> to the making of a <hi>Hogshead;</hi> but this hath
also an inconvenience; in that the <hi>Cider</hi> becomes not <hi>fine,</hi> or fit
for drinking, so conveniently as a <hi>mean</hi> betwixt these two will
afford.</p>
            <p>Keep them then about a <hi>fort-night</hi> in a <hi>hoard,</hi> and order
them to be of such a <hi>cast</hi> by this <hi>Mellowing,</hi> that about <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40289:33"/>
five Bushels</hi> may make a <hi>Hogshead,</hi> after which mellowing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
thus.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Pick</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> your <hi>Apples</hi> from their <hi>stalks, leaves, moazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
or any thing that tends toward <hi>rottenness</hi> or decay.</p>
            <p>2. Lay them before the <hi>stone</hi> in the <hi>Cider-Mill,</hi> or else beat
them small with <hi>Beaters</hi> (such as <hi>Paviers</hi> use to fix their pitching)
in deep <hi>troughs</hi> of <hi>Wood</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> till they are fit for the <hi>Press.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Having laid clean <hi>wheat straw</hi> in the bottom of your <hi>Press,</hi>
lay a heap of bruised <hi>Apples</hi> upon it, and so with small handfuls
or <hi>wisps</hi> of <hi>straw,</hi> which by twisting takes along with it the ends
of the <hi>straw</hi> laid first in the bottom, proceed with the bruised
<hi>Apples,</hi> and follow the heaps with your twisted <hi>straw,</hi> till it comes
to the height of two foot, or two foot and a half; and so with
some <hi>straw</hi> drawn in by <hi>twisting,</hi> and turned over the top of it
(so that the bruised <hi>Apples</hi> are set as it were into a deep <hi>Chees-vat</hi> of
<hi>straw,</hi> from which the Country people call it their <hi>Cider-Cheese)</hi>
let the <hi>board</hi> fall upon it <hi>even</hi> and <hi>flat,</hi> and so engage the force of
your <hi>skrew</hi> or <hi>Press</hi> so long as any <hi>Liquor</hi> will run from it. Instead
of this <hi>Cheese</hi> others use <hi>baggs</hi> of <hi>Hair-cloth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Take this <hi>Liquor</hi> thus forced by the <hi>Press,</hi> and <hi>strain</hi> it tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
a <hi>strainer</hi> of <hi>hair</hi> into a <hi>Vat,</hi> from whence straight (or that
day) in <hi>pails</hi> carry it to the <hi>Cellar,</hi> tunning it up presently in such
<hi>Vessels</hi> as you intend to preserve it in; for I cannot approve of a
long <hi>evaporation</hi> of <hi>spirits,</hi> and then a disturbance after it settles.</p>
            <p>5. Let your <hi>Vessels</hi> be very tight and clean wherein you put
your <hi>Cider</hi> to settle: The best form is the <hi>Stund</hi> or <hi>Stand,</hi> which
is set upon the lesser end, from the top <hi>tapering</hi> downwards;
as suppose the <hi>head</hi> to be <hi>thirty</hi> inches <hi>diametre,</hi> let then the <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom</hi>
be but <hi>eighteen</hi> or <hi>twenty</hi> inches in <hi>diametre;</hi> let the <hi>Tun-hole</hi>
or <hi>Bung-hole</hi> be on the one side <hi>outwards,</hi> towards the <hi>top.</hi> The
reason of the goodness of this <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Vessel</hi> is, because <hi>Cider</hi> (as all
strong Liquors) after <hi>fermentation</hi> and working, contracts a <hi>cream</hi>
or <hi>skin</hi> on the <hi>top</hi> of them, which in this form of <hi>Vessel</hi> is as it
sinks <hi>contracted,</hi> and fortified by that contraction, and
will draw fresh to the last drop; whereas in our ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Vessels,</hi> when drawn out about the half or middle, this
skin <hi>dilates</hi> and <hi>breaks,</hi> and without a quick draught decays and
dies.</p>
            <p>6. Reserve a <hi>Pottle</hi> or <hi>Gallon</hi> of the <hi>Liquor</hi> to fill up the <hi>Vessel</hi>
to the brim of the <hi>Bung-hole,</hi> as oft as the <hi>fermentation</hi> and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lessens the <hi>Liquor,</hi> till it hath done its work.</p>
            <p>7. When it hath compleated its work, and that the <hi>Vessel</hi> is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up to the <hi>bung-hole,</hi> stop it up close with well mix'd <hi>clay,</hi> and
well tempered, with a handful of <hi>Bay-salt</hi> laid upon the top of the
<hi>clay,</hi> to keep it moist, and renewed as oft as need shall require;
for if the <hi>clay</hi> grows dry it gives <hi>vent</hi> to the <hi>spirits</hi> of the <hi>Liquor,</hi>
by which it suffers decay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:40289:34"/>
I am against either the <hi>boyling</hi> of <hi>Cider,</hi> or the hanging of a bag
of <hi>Spices</hi> in it, or the use of <hi>Ginger</hi> in drinking it; by which
things people labour to correct that <hi>windiness</hi> which they fancy
to be in it: I think <hi>Cider</hi> not <hi>windy;</hi> those that use to drink it are
most free from <hi>windiness;</hi> perhaps the <hi>virtue of</hi> it is such, as that
once ripened and mellowed, the drinking of it in such strength
combates with that <hi>wind</hi> which lies insensibly latent in the body.
The <hi>Cider</hi> made and sold here in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Bottles</hi> may have that
<hi>windiness</hi> with it as <hi>Bottle-beer</hi> hath, because they were never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to <hi>ferment:</hi> But those that have remarked the strength and
vigour of its <hi>fermentation,</hi> what weighty things it will cast up
from the bottom to the top, and with how many bubbles and
bladders of <hi>wind</hi> it doth <hi>work,</hi> will believe that it clears it self
by that operation of all such injurious <hi>qualities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To preserve <hi>Cider</hi> in <hi>Bottles</hi> I recommend unto you my own
<hi>Experience,</hi> which is, Not to <hi>bottle</hi> it up before <hi>fermentation;</hi> for
that incorporates the <hi>windy quality,</hi> which otherwise would be
ejected by that operation: This violent suppression of fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
makes it <hi>windy</hi> in drinking, (though I confess <hi>brisk</hi> to the
<hi>taste,</hi> and <hi>sprightly</hi> cutting to the <hi>Palate:</hi>) But after <hi>fermentation,</hi>
the <hi>Cider</hi> resting two, three, or four Months, draw it, and <hi>bottle</hi>
it up, and so lay it in a <hi>Repository</hi> of cool <hi>springing water,</hi> two or
three foot, or more, deep; this keeps the <hi>spirits,</hi> and the best
of the <hi>spirits</hi> of it together: This makes it drink quick and lively;
it comes into the <hi>glass</hi> not <hi>pale</hi> or troubled, but bright <hi>yellow,</hi>
with a speedy vanishing <hi>nittiness,</hi> (as the <hi>Vintners</hi> call it) which
<hi>evaporates</hi> with a <hi>sparkling</hi> and <hi>whizzing</hi> noise; And than this I
never tasted either <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Cider</hi> that pleased better: Insomuch
that a <hi>Noble-man</hi> tasting of a <hi>Bottle</hi> out of the <hi>water</hi> (himself a
great <hi>Ciderist</hi>) protested the excellency of it, and made with
much greater charges, at his own dwelling, a <hi>water Repository</hi> for
his <hi>Cider,</hi> with good success.</p>

            <head>An ACCOUNT of
Perry and Cider
Out of GLOCESTER-SHIRE,</head>
            <byline>Imparted by
DANIEL COLLWALL <abbr>Esq</abbr>
            </byline>
            <p>ABout <hi>Taynton,</hi> Five Miles beyond <hi>Glocester,</hi> is a mixt sort of
<hi>land,</hi> partly <hi>Clay,</hi> a <hi>Marle,</hi> and <hi>Crash,</hi> as they call it there, on
all which sorts of <hi>land,</hi> there is much <hi>Fruit</hi> growing, both for
the <hi>Table</hi> and for <hi>Cider:</hi> But it is <hi>Pears</hi> it most abounds in, of
which the <hi>best</hi> sort, is that they name the <hi>Squosh-Pear,</hi> which
makes the best <hi>Perry</hi> in those Parts. These <hi>Trees</hi> grow to be very
large, and exceeding fruitful, bearing a fair round <hi>Pear,</hi> red on
the one side, and yellow on the other, when fully ripe: It of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
falls from the <hi>Tree,</hi> which commonly breaks it; but it is
of a nature so <hi>harsh,</hi> that the <hi>Hogs</hi> will hardly <hi>eat them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They usually plant the <hi>stocks</hi> first, and when of competent
bigness (and tall enough to prevent <hi>Cattel) graff</hi> upon them:
'Tis observed, that where <hi>land</hi> is <hi>Plow'd</hi> and dress'd for <hi>Corn,</hi> the
<hi>Trees</hi> thrive much better than in the <hi>Pasture-grounds,</hi> so as divers
<hi>Orchards</hi> are yearly plow'd and sown with Corn, which for the
most part, they suffer their <hi>Swine</hi> to eat upon the ground, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cutting; and such <hi>Plantations</hi> seldom or never fail of plentiful
<hi>Crops<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> especially in the <hi>Rye-land,</hi> or light Grounds.</p>
            <p>About <hi>Michaelmas</hi> is made the best <hi>Cider,</hi> and that of such
<hi>Fruit</hi> as drops from the <hi>Trees,</hi> being perfectly mature; and if any
are gathered sooner, they let them lye in the <hi>house</hi> 8 or 9 days for
the better mellowing.</p>
            <p>The best <hi>Mills</hi> to grind in, are those of <hi>Stone,</hi> which resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
a <hi>Mill stone</hi> set <hi>edge</hi>-ways, moved round the <hi>Trough</hi> by an
<hi>Horse</hi> till the <hi>Fruit</hi> be bruised small enough for the <hi>Press:</hi> This
done, then put it up into a <hi>Crib</hi> made with strong studds, and
<hi>Oken</hi> or <hi>Haisel</hi> twigs about 3 <hi>foot</hi> high, and 2 Â½ wide, which is
placed on a <hi>Stone</hi> or Wooden <hi>Cheese-fat,</hi> a <hi>foot</hi> broader than the
<hi>Crib,</hi> fitted to a round <hi>Trough</hi> for the <hi>Liquor</hi> to pass into the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi>
which is a large Vessel: When the <hi>Crib</hi> is filled with the
foresaid ground <hi>Fruit,</hi> they put a <hi>Stone</hi> upon it, but first they
fit a <hi>Circle</hi> of fresh <hi>straw</hi> about the <hi>Crib,</hi> to preserve the <hi>Must</hi>
(which is the bruised <hi>Fruit</hi>) from straining through the <hi>Crib</hi> when
they apply the <hi>Skrews,</hi> which being <hi>two</hi> in number, and of a
good size, turn in a great <hi>beam,</hi> and so are wrung down upon
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40289:35"/>
the <hi>Crib,</hi> within which they place two wide and thick <hi>Cheese-fats,</hi>
and several <hi>blocks</hi> upon the <hi>Fruit,</hi> to crush it down with the
more force, by which means it is wrung so <hi>dry,</hi> as nothing can
be had more out of it. A <hi>Crib</hi> will contain at <hi>once,</hi> as much
ground <hi>Fruit,</hi> as will make above an <hi>Hogs-head</hi> of <hi>Cider,</hi> and
there may be dispatched <hi>six</hi> or <hi>seven</hi> such <hi>Vessels</hi> in one day.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Pressing</hi> is finished, they take out the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and put
it into a great <hi>Fat,</hi> pouring several <hi>Payls</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> to it, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well <hi>impregn'd,</hi> is ground again sleightly in the <hi>Mill,</hi> to make
an ordinary <hi>Cider</hi> for the <hi>servants;</hi> this they usually drink all the
<hi>Year</hi> about.</p>
            <p>When the best <hi>Liquor</hi> is tun'd up, they commonly leave the
<hi>Bung-hole</hi> open, for <hi>nine</hi> or <hi>ten</hi> days, to <hi>ferment</hi> and <hi>purifie;</hi> for
though in most places they adde <hi>straining</hi> to all this, yet some of
the <hi>Husks</hi> and <hi>Ordure</hi> will remain in it. The <hi>Vessel</hi> after a day or
two standing, is fill'd up, and still as the <hi>Cider</hi> wastes in working,
they supplie it again, till no more <hi>filth</hi> rises; and then <hi>stop</hi> it up ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
accurately close, leaving only a small <hi>breathing</hi> hole to give it
air for a <hi>Moneth</hi> after, and to prevent the <hi>bursting</hi> of the
<hi>Vessel.</hi>

<hi>hoarded</hi> a little within doors. The <hi>longer</hi> you would <hi>keep,</hi> the
<hi>longer</hi> you must <hi>hoard</hi> your <hi>Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Red-strake</hi> of <hi>Kings-Capel,</hi> and those parts, is in great
variety: Some make <hi>Cider</hi> that is not of continuance, yet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and good; others, that lasts long, inclining towards the

            </p>
            <p>5. A long pale <hi>Apple,</hi> called the <hi>Coleing,</hi> about <hi>Ludlow,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
bearer.</p>
            <p>6. The <hi>Arier-Apple,</hi> a constant <hi>bearer,</hi> making a strong and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Cider;</hi> some call them <hi>Richards,</hi> some <hi>Grang-apples;</hi> and indeed
they make so excellent a <hi>Drink,</hi> that they are worthy to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
into use.</p>
            <p>7. The <hi>Olive,</hi> well known about <hi>Ludlow,</hi> may, I conceive be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of the <hi>Winter-Cider Apples,</hi> of which 'tis the constant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
that an <hi>Hogs-head</hi> of the <hi>Fruit</hi> will yield an <hi>Hogs-head</hi> of
<hi>Cider.</hi>

               <head>The <hi>Summer-Ciders</hi> are,</head>
               <p>1. The <hi>Gennet-Moyl</hi> of one year: The best <hi>Baking-Apple</hi> that
grows, and keeps long <hi>baked;</hi> but not so <hi>unbaked</hi> without growing
<hi>mealy:</hi> it <hi>drys</hi> well in the <hi>Oven,</hi> and with little trouble. The <hi>Gennet-Moyl
Cider,</hi> when the <hi>Fruit</hi> is well <hi>hoarded</hi> and mellow, will body,

               <p>2. The Summer <hi>Red-strake,</hi> of a wonderful <hi>fragrant</hi> and <hi>Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique</hi>
quality.</p>
               <p>3. Sir <hi>Ed. Harley</hi>'s <hi>little Apple,</hi> esteemed to make one of the
richest <hi>Ciders</hi> in the World. Also, his,</p>
               <p>4. Great Summer-Apple, <hi>resembling the</hi> Red-strake, <hi>juicy and</hi>
Aromatique.</p>
               <p>5. The <hi>White-Must, streaked Must,</hi> &amp;c. great bearers, and their
<hi>Cider</hi> early ripe.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Pearmains,</hi> have made excellent <hi>Cider,</hi> as good, if not supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to any other in some years; and though it be true, that every
sort of <hi>Fruit</hi> makes better <hi>Drink</hi> some years than others; yet, for
the most part, the goodness and perfection of <hi>Cider</hi> results from the
lucky, or intelligent <hi>Gathering,</hi> or <hi>Hoarding</hi> of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> or from
both; and this <hi>knowledge</hi> must be from <hi>Experience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Generally, the <hi>Cider</hi> longest in <hi>fining,</hi> is strongest and best last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
especially if the <hi>fruit</hi> have been well <hi>hoarded</hi> for some time.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Cider</hi> made of <hi>Green,</hi> and immature <hi>Fruit,</hi> will not <hi>fine</hi> kindly,
and when it does, it abides not long good, but suddenly becomes
<hi>eagre.</hi>

good: But the best <hi>Drink</hi> is that which <hi>fines</hi> of it self, preserved

               <p>10. All <hi>Cider,</hi> suffers <hi>Fermentation</hi> when Trees are <hi>blossoming,</hi>
though it be never so old; and <hi>Cider</hi> of very ripe <hi>Fruit,</hi> if <hi>Bottl'd</hi> in

               </p>
               <p>11. New <hi>Cider,</hi> and all <hi>diluted</hi> and watred <hi>Ciders,</hi> are great
