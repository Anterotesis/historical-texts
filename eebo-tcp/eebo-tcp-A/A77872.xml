         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I find him at <hi>Bristow</hi> giving order to his Myrmydons to rob the Cathedral there, the Ornament of that City, of which the Mayor having timely notice, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went to him with the reſt of his Brethren to deſire him to ſpare that Place; at whoſe earneſt Requeſt he promiſed them not to deface it: But mark, this ſacrilegious thief and lyar at that very time he gave private order and directions for plundering and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing that Cathedral, and before the Mayor went from him one of his cropear'd Amſterdammers came to him and told him that the work was done, (meaning that the Church was defac'd and plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) at which words this villanous Rogue and Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of God roſe out of his Chair and held up his hands uſing this Expreſsion, <hi>Even the Lord be thanked;</hi> as if the Lord were to be thanked for ſacriledge, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbid in his Holy Writ: he was a diſſembler and a lyar, a Monſter of men, and the ſon of Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he tore out and rent in pieces the bowels of his Mother the Church; he was at Court Treacherous; in the Field a Coward; a Sycophant to his Friend; and a Hot-brain'd Coxcomb in Council; he was a Day-bed for the Devil to ſlumber on, and his malice ſuckt up the greateſt part of his own Venome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he impoiſoned himſelf, his greateſt ſtudy was to contemn Obedience and practiſe Treaſon, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, Church-robbing and other his cruelties made him challenge his own Damnation by the way of purchaſe; he was a great lover of Church-Plate and Surplaſes, for he alwayes gave 'em fair quarter at his own houſe; he ruined more Families in the time of his Tyranny, than ever his generation was or will be worth; he was a Moath to the Church, a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to every mans Eſtate that he ſeiz'd on, and a Moule to the poor Colliers of Newcaſtle, who will curſe his memory; the very bowels of the Earth could not eſcape or ſatiate his plunderage and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, nothing as he thought could put a ſtop to his careering appetite, in being a ſecond <hi>Oliver,</hi> till he was Garriſon'd in the Tower, the end of all his Projects, where had he liv'd a little longer, 'tis poſsible <hi>Dun</hi> might have dubd him one of the Knights of the Halter; but he is gone to his place where I leave him with <hi>Zacharies</hi> flying roll of curſes 20 cubits long and 10 cubits broad, <hi>Zach.</hi> 5. 2, 3.

Thus have I given you a taſte of this unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſacrilegious Wretch, till an abler and more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pen ſhall enlarge his Character with his Crimes.</p>
