         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie</hi>
(in its splendor, as well
as integrity) there is none so
proper for my Addresse,
as your Noble selves:
Were it otherwise, I should
not step forth of our own
<hi>Island;</hi> which though it
have yet (blessed be God)
many Heroical and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Souls, yet their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

clouded and besieged by
the iniquity of our distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that their Thoughts
are took up rather to <hi>seek</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56354:3"/>
then <hi>bestow</hi> Protection.
And (to lay my soul na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked)
I confess I do not send
this Book to your Honours
because I knew not to whom
else to inscribe it; but I first
undertook it, to testifie to the
world, how happy the name
of <hi>Scotland</hi> is (even now
when the waves seem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

fame and flourishing estate
of your <hi>Regiments.</hi> For

Should I now offer to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
particulars, who will
pity me for falling short,
when they see me enterprise
things almost impossible? I
confess I was so vain to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
some such thoughts,
and was beginning with the
Great name of <hi>Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las;</hi>
but I found my self
plunged in such a Gulf of
Honourable Actions, as all
my life would not serve for
the History of that Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Family; because at all
places and occasions, where
<pb facs="tcp:56354:4"/>
the work is Magnificent,
they are <hi>Jamais Arriere.</hi>

            <p>I offered then at the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Rutherford:</hi> but his
vast Intellectuals (with the
weight of his Acquests on
the <hi>Austrian</hi> powers at
<hi>Arras, Montmedy, Grav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
and other places)
did so overpress me, that
(without more Forehead
then Wit) I could attempt
no further. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I sate down with this
safe resolution, that it was
little less then phrensie to
<pb facs="tcp:56354:5"/>
grasp at all, when I saw the
Principals were grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible.
You are so
many, and there are so few
Noble Families in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to whom you are not
allied, that to speak of you
all, were to undertake the
whole <hi>Nation.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi>
Atchievements in the
<hi>French</hi> Wars are legible in
all their Histories; and
were it possible to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged,
you would record it
over again by your personal
Actions. And (which is
<pb facs="tcp:56354:5"/>
the grand comfort of now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drooping
<hi>Scotland</hi>) your
two <hi>Regiments</hi> are the
Nurseries of all future &amp;
succeeding Honour that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to our Country.</p>
            <p>As for my self and Book
(I call it mine, though I be
but its Translator) I made
particular choice of this, as
well for the subject-Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as for the <hi>Author. I</hi>
see the world so shuffled

            </p>
            <p>My chiefest aim
(next to my particular

is to mind the World, that

COMICAL HISTORY
Of the
WORLD
In the
MOON</head>
            <p>THe Moon was at the full,
the Sky unclouded, and
the hour of the night
was nine; when return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Clamard,</hi> not far
from <hi>Paris</hi> (where <hi>Monsieur Cuigy's</hi>
son, who is Lord of the place, had
nobly treated some of my Friends
and my self) the different opinions
that <hi>Saffron-Circle</hi> caus'd, serv'd large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to entertain us upon our journey:
Fixing our eyes on that great Star,
some took it for the Loop-hole of
<pb facs="tcp:56354:8"/>
Heaven; others protested, it was a
French Platine whereon <hi>Diana</hi>
smooth'd <hi>Apollo's</hi> Bands; and there
were some, who would rather have
it the Sun, who having disrob'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of his glorious Rayes, peept
through a hole, to spy what the
World was doing in his supposed
absence: and I said, I who am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to mingle my <hi>Enthusiasmes</hi> with
yours, doe beleeve, without amusing
my self with those sharp conceits
with which you tickle the time into
a speedier pace, that the Moon is a
World like this, and by which ours
is interchangeably beleeved a Moon.
Some of the Company presented me
with a loud laughter: May be, said
I, now there is some one, who is as
much jeer'd in the Moon for belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this Globe a World. But it
was in vain to alleadge many grave
Authors who were of the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
it did but more efficaciously
move their splenetick lungs to a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
merriment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56354:8"/>
In the mean time, this opinion (the
boldness whereof) went half against
my stomack; but confirmed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
plunged it self so deeply
into my fancy (the rest of the way)
that I conceived a thousand definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Moon, whereof I could not
well be delivered; so that striving to
inforce this odd fancy, by almost se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Arguments, I wanted but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of being quite confirmed in my
opinion; when by miracle or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
Providence, Fortune, or what
one may term a Vision, Fiction or
Chimaera, or folly if you please, I
was opportunely furnisht with occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for this discourse: for being come
home, I went into my Study, where
I found upon the table, a Book open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without my help, written by <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;</hi>
which though I had no design
to read, yet as it were forcibly, I
cast my eyes upon a story of that
Philosopher, who relates, that stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
one night by a Candle, he
saw two great old men come
<pb facs="tcp:56354:9"/>
through the doors, though bolted;
who after many Questions he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to them, answered finally,
that they were Inhabitants of the
Moon, and then vanished. I was so
surprized, First, to finde a Book
brought thither of it self: Secondly,
at the time and leaf, where I found
it opened; that I took the connexion
of Accidents, for an inspiration to
learn Mankinde the truth of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable
Moon: What's this, said I,
after having talked of a thing all
day, and a Book which may be the
onely one that treats so particularly
of that matter, to fly from my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
upon my table, and be so far
capable of Reason, as to open it self,
just where so wondrous an accident
is related; to have mine eyes as it
were forcibly attracted upon it; and
finally, to furnish my Fancy with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions,
and my Will with the
designs I hold!</p>
            <p>Without doubt (continued I) the
two old men which appeared to that
<pb facs="tcp:56354:9"/>
learned man, have taken down this
Book, and opened it in this place,
that they might spare themselves the
trouble of so long a conference they
had with <hi>Cardan:</hi> But straight added
I, I can never be fully cleared of this
doubt without ascending thither. But
I presently asked my self, Why not?
<hi>Prometheus</hi> heretofore durst steal fire
out of Heaven it self; Am I less da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
then he? Then why should I
fear a less favourable success?</p>
            <p>To these conceits (which may be
perchance called the effects of a feve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
distemper) succeeded the hopes
of effecting this fine journey; so that
I shut my self up in a Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
distant from any resort, to
accomplish my wishes; where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
flattered my Fancy with some
means proportionate to that subject,
at last I resolved upon these for my
Heavenly voyage.</p>
            <p>I had fastned about me a many
small vials filled with Dew; upon
which the Sun darting most violent
<pb facs="tcp:56354:10"/>
Beams, the heat whereof attracting,
as it doth the grossest Clouds, drew
me insensibly above the middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
but as this attraction was
somwhat too rapid, and in stead of
approaching the Moon, as I preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
I found my self further off, then
at my departure; I began to break
some of my glasses, till I found that
my weight had mastered the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
so that I began to descend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Earth. I was not mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
for a little after I landed; and to
reckon the hour I departed at, it
should have been midnight; yet
there I perceived the Sun in the
height of the Horizon, which made
it noon: I leave you to imagine
how my astonishment was really so
great, that not knowing to what I
should attribute this wonder, I was
tempted to beleeve, that in favour of
my boldness, God had repeated that
Miracle, and once more fixt the Sun
to the Hemisphere, to give light to
so worthy an enterprize: but what
<pb facs="tcp:56354:10"/>
more amazed me, was, that I knew
not the Countrey where I was; for
ascending in a direct line, as I
thought, I did imagine, that I should
have fallen just where I took my
rise: yet equipaged as I was, I
walked towards a kinde of desart
ground, from whence I perceived
some smoak; I was hardly within
pistol-shot, when I saw my self
surrounded by a number of naked
men; they seemed much startled at
the rencountre, for I beleeve I was
the first they had ever seen garnished
with bottles: and to overthrow all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
might have been given
to that clothing, they saw that in my
march I scarce touched the ground;
for they did not know, that with the
least shake of my Body, the ardor of
the Midday-Beams, drew me and my
dew upwards; and had not most of
my bottles been broak, I might have
soared into the Air before their eyes.
I would have accosted them; but in a
moment, as if their fear had lent them
<pb facs="tcp:56354:11"/>
wings, they flew into the next fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
yet I catcht one, whose legs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
his heart: I askt him with a
great deal of trouble (for I was
quite out of breath) how far he reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
it from thence to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
how long people had gone naked in
<hi>France,</hi> and why they so frightfully
avoyded me? This old man to whom
I talkt, was of an Olive-colour, who
presently cast himself at my feet, and
joyning his hands behinde his head,
opened his mouth, and shut his eyes;
he mumbled a great while betwixt
his teeth, but I could perceive no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
articulation; so that I fancied
his discourse to be like the confused
blattering of a dumb-man.</p>
            <p>A small while after, I perceived a
company of Souldiers marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, to the sound of a Drum,
some of which did separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to take a view of me: when
they were neer enough to hear what
I said, I humbly interrogated where
I was: You are in <hi>France,</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:56354:11"/>
they; But who the Devil hath put
you in this condition? and how
comes it, that we are not acquainted
with your Worship? Are the Ships
arrived? and are you going to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise
the Governour? And pray
why have you divided your <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae</hi>
into so many bottles? To which
I answered, that it was not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
that had put me in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that they did not know me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they could not be acquainted
with all men; and that I never knew
that the River of <hi>Seine</hi> was naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>Paris;</hi> that I had nothing to
say to the <hi>Marshal de l'Hospital;</hi> and
that I was not laden with <hi>aqua-vitae.</hi>
Ho, ho, Blade, cry they, You're
a merry Gentleman; the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
will go neer to know you
i'faith. Then they conducted me to
their squadron by the arm, where I
was given to understand that I was
really in <hi>France,</hi> but with the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Novella:</hi> so that some while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I was presented to the <hi>Viceroy,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56354:12"/>
who enquired of my Country, my
name, and quality; and after I had
satisfied him in all, and related the
agreeable success of my Voyage;
whether he beleeved me, or whether
he onely seemed to beleeve me, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he had the goodness to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
me to be lodg'd in his own
Appartement: it was no small ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of my good fortune, to meet
with a man capable of lofty imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and who was not amazed
when I said, that the world had tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
about in the time of my elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being that I rose within two
leagues of <hi>Paris,</hi> and fell as it were
in a perpendicular line in <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At night, when I was just going to
bed, he came into my chamber, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I should not have come to disturb
your rest, if I had not beleeved that a
man who had found out the secret of
riding so much way in half a day,
could not be ignorant of a means not
to be tired. But you know not
(continued he) the pleasant quarrel,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:12"/>
which I have had about you with
our Fathers, who will needs have
you to be a <hi>Magician;</hi> nay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
favour they can allow you, is to
beleeve you an <hi>Impostor:</hi> and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that Notion which you attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the Earth, is a nice <hi>Paradox:</hi>
and for my part I tell you truly, the
reason why I am not of your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is, that though you parted from
<hi>Paris</hi> but yesterday, yet you might
arrive as you did in this Countrey
without the motion of the Earth:
for the Sun that drew you up by the
means of your bottles might bring
you hither, since (according to <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
and the modern Philosophers)
he hath that Circular motion which
you attribute to the Earth: and what
solid Reason can you give for the
Suns stability when we see his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
or for the rapid motion of the
Earth, when we find it so firm under
us? Sir, (answered I) these are the
reasons (as neer as I can judge)
which tie us to this belief. First
<pb facs="tcp:56354:13"/>
of all, Common sense obliges us to
beleeve, that the Sun is placed in the
Centre of the Universe, being that
all the Bodies which are in nature,
have need of that Radical heat; and
that he inhabits the heart of the
whole, that he might the radier sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
each part; and that the cause of
Generation is placed in the midst
of all Bodies, to act with more equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and agility: So Wise Nature
placed the Privities of man; the cores
of apples in their Centre, the kernel
in the middest of all fruit; and the
Onyon conserves (with an hundred
rindes) the precious germe, from
whence ten millions of others must
draw their Original. For this apple
is a little Universe of it self; and the
kernel thereof, hotter then any of the
other parts, is its Sun, which casts
round about it the conservatory heat
of that Globe; and the Germ or
sprout of the Onyon, is the little
Sun of that small World, which
doth warm and nourish the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getive
<pb facs="tcp:56354:13"/>
salt of that body: which
being supposed, I say, the world
having need of the light, the
heat and influence of that great
fire, turns round about it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the vertues which conserves
it, equally in all its parts: for it
would be as ridiculous to beleeve,
that great Luminous Body should
wheel about a <hi>Punctum,</hi> which it hath
no need of, as to beleeve when we
see a rosted Lark, that it was turned
by the Chimney: otherwise for
the Sun to <hi>Carracole</hi> thus, would look
as if the Physitian had need of the
Patient; and that the strong ought
to submit to the weak; and the great
serve the little; and that in stead of
a Ships coasting round an Island, the
Island should turn about the Ship.
If it be difficult for you to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
how so heavy a Mass can
move; Pray tell me, are the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and Stars which you affim so
solid, lighter? nay, it is easier for us
(who are assured of the World's
<pb facs="tcp:56354:14"/>
roundness) to conclude its Motion
by its Figure. But why must we
suppose the Heaven's round, and we
doe not know it; and that of all Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
if it have any other, it must
want that motion? I doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
you, your <hi>Excentriques,</hi> nor
your <hi>Concentriques,</hi> nor your <hi>Epicycles,</hi>
all which you can but confusedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate,
and I save my <hi>Systeme;</hi> let
us onely speak of the Natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of this Motion: you are fain to
fly to Intelligences, which move and
govern your Globes; but I without
disquieting the most Soveraign Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
(who without doubt, hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Nature perfect, and with whose
Wisdome it must stand to have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
it; so that having accomplished
it for one thing, it would not leave
it defective in another) say, that
the Beams of the Sun, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,
coming to strike upon it
by their Circulation, makes it turn,
as we doe a Globe by a stroke of
our hands; or as the fumes which it
<pb facs="tcp:56354:14"/>
breaths from its breast continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
on the side the Sun is of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percussed
by the cold of the Middle
Region, breaths back upon their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whom they cannot hit but
slopingly; by which means she is
turned.</p>
            <p>The explication of the other two
Motions, are less knotty: for pray
consider a little:—At these
words the <hi>Viceroy</hi> interrupted me. I
had rather dispense with you for
that trouble (for I have read some
Books of <hi>Gassendi</hi> upon that Subject)
but upon condition that you will
hear what one of our Fathers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
me one day, who maintained
your opinion; in effect, said he, I
imagine that the Earth turneth, not
for the Reasons which <hi>Copernicus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadges,
but because the fire of Hell
being inclosed in the Centre of the
Earth, the Damned, who would fly
the ardor of its flames, crawl up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the
vault, and so turn the
Earth, as a turn-spit Dog doth
<pb facs="tcp:56354:15"/>
when he is shut up in a wheel.</p>
            <p>We were some while praysing
the zealous conceit of the good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and in the end the <hi>Viceroy</hi> told
me, he wondred much, that the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme</hi>
of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (being so unlikely)
should be so generally received. Sir,
answered I, the greatest part of
mankind, who judge by their senses,
let themselves be perswaded by their
eyes; and as he who sayls in a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ship, beleeves himself fixt, and
that the land moves; so men wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Earth about the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
did beleeve that it was the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
that mov'd about them. To
which we may add the insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
arrogance of Mankinde, which
fancies, that Nature was onely crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to serve it; as if it were likely,
that the Sun, whose Body is four
hundred and thirty times bigger then
the Earth, should onely have been
lighted to ripen their Medlars, or
inlarge the Sphere of their Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
For my part (far from consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:56354:15"/>
to their insolence) I beleeve that
the Planets are Worlds above the
Sun, and that the fixt Stars are Suns
which have Planets about them,
which is to say, Worlds which we
see not: from hence, because of
their smallness, is the cause that
their borrowed light cannot reach
us. And in good faith, why should
we imagine that such spacious
Globes as those, should be uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
deserts; and that ours, because
we live in it, has been built for a
dozen of little proud things? Must
we, because the Sun directs our
Dayes and Years, beleeve that it
was onely made, that we might not
break our heads against the Walls?
No, no, If that visible Deity give
its light to mankinde, it is by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
as the Kings torch may light
a beggar, that's passing the street
at the same time. But Sir, said he,
if the fixt Stars are so many Suns, as
you assure me, one may conclude
from thence, that the World is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;
<pb facs="tcp:56354:16"/>
being that it is probable, that
the People of that World which is
above a fixt Star, which you take for
a Sun, doe discover above them other
fixt Stars; which we cannot perceive
from hence, and that in this sort we
may judge <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doe not doubt it, answered I; as
God could create the soul immortal,
he could in the same manner make
the World infinite; if Eternity be
nothing else but a lasting without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
and infinity an unbounded
reach: and God himself would be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
supposing the World not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
being he could not be where
nothing is; and he cannot increase
the World, without adding some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to his own existence, by begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to be, where he was not before.</p>
            <p>We must therefore beleeve, that
as we behold <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> from
hence; so if we were in either of
them, we should discover many
Worlds of which we are ignorant;
and that the infinity of the Universe
<pb facs="tcp:56354:16"/>
is thus form'd. 'Faith, answered he,
you may say what you please, but I
cannot comprehend this infinity.
Why, pray, answered I, doe you
comprehend that Nothing, which is
beyond it? No certainly, for when
you think of that Nothing, your i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination
represents it to you like
Winde or Air, and that's something.
But infinity, if you doe not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it in general, you do at least in
parts, being that it is not difficult to
suppose to our selves, other Earth,
Air, or Fire, then what we just see;
now infinity is nothing but an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
contexture of all these. But
if you ask me, how these Worlds
were created, since the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
mention but one of Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
my answer is, that I dispute
no longer; for if you will oblige
me to give you an account of my i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations,
that stops my mouth,
and makes me confess, that in such
things, I shall always submit my
reason to faith. He told me that
<pb facs="tcp:56354:17"/>
his Question was to be blam'd; but
I reassumed my Idea, and added, that
all those other Worlds which we do
not see, or which we but imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeve, are nothing but the froth
or foam of the <hi>Suns</hi> purgations: for
how could those great fires subsist, if
they were not fastned to some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
capable of their nourishment?
as fire rejects the ashes that smother
it; or as gold doth separate it self in
the crucible, when it grows to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
from the Marcasite which
lessens his Carat; or again, as our
hearts disingage themselves by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
from the indigested humors
which assault them: so those <hi>Suns</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day disgorge, and purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of all matter obnoxious to
their fires; but when they have quite
consumed that matter which enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
them, you need not doubt but
they will scatter themselves about
to seek a new pasture, and fasten
upon the Worlds they have formed
heretofore, and particularly, to the
<pb facs="tcp:56354:17"/>
neerest: then those great fires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
afresh all those bodies,
will eject them <hi>higgledy-piggledy</hi> from
every part as before; and so purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves by little and little,
begin to serve for <hi>Suns</hi> to those little
Worlds they have created by the
vomit of their own spheres; which
was certainly the cause why the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans</hi>
foretold the general confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
This is no ridiculous imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
for this new frame where we
are, produceth a convincing reason;
the vast continent of <hi>America,</hi> is the
one half of the Earth, which in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
of our Forefathers, (who had
rounded the Ocean a thousand
times) was not discovered. Neither
was it any more then many Isles and
Peninsula's, and mountains, which
have swell'd in our Globe, when the
<hi>Sun</hi> hath purged himself of Rusts,
which have been rejected, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd
into bodies capable of attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from our Centre, may be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after in less particles, or may be
<pb facs="tcp:56354:18"/>
all together in a mass: this is not so
unreasonable, but that <hi>St. Augustine</hi>
would have given his applause to it,
if these countreys had been discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his dayes; since he, whose geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
was very clear sighted, assures us,
that in his time, the Earth was flat
like an Oven, and that it swam on
the water like half an Orange. But
if I have ever the honour to meet
you in <hi>France,</hi> I will let you see by
the means of an admirable glass, that
certain obscurities which from
hence seem spots, are Worlds that
are framing.</p>
            <p>My eyes which were almost clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the period of this discourse,
obliged the <hi>Viceroy</hi> to leave me: the
next day, and some other days fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
we had entertainments of
the like nature; but some while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the troublesome affairs of the
Province disturbed our Philosophy,
and I revived my curiosity of visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Moon.</p>
            <p>Assoon as she appeared in our
<pb facs="tcp:56354:18"/>
Nocturnal Hemisphere, I went mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up and down the Woods, my
fancy still agitating my propounded
enterprise; and at last, one Midsum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Eve, when they were at Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
in the Fort, to determine whether
they should succour the Savages of
the Countrey against the <hi>Europeans;</hi>
I stole behind our habitation, to the
top of a small hill; where you shall
hear what I executed: I had fram'd
a Machine, which I did suppose ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of raising me as high as I
pleased; so that nothing of what I
thought was necessary being want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I placed my self in it, and
precipitated my self from a Rock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Air; but because I had not
well taken my measures, I rudely sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
the valley with my Bulk; yet
all bruised as <hi>I</hi> was, without being
abashed, <hi>I</hi> returned to my chamber;
where <hi>I</hi> took beef-marrow, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
my Body; for <hi>I</hi> was morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
from the Noddle to the Heel:
and after having fortifyed my heart
<pb facs="tcp:56354:19"/>
with a bottle of cordial Essence, <hi>I</hi>
returned to seek my Engine, but in
vain, for cerain Souldiers who were
sent into the Forrest to cut wood for
the Bon-fire of that day, having
found it by chance, had brought it
to the Citadel; where after many
explications of what it could be, and
at last having found out the spring,
some were of opinion that fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
should be fastned unto it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their rapidity, and the springs
agitating its large wings, would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levate
it mightily; so that none
should see it, without beleeving it a
fiery flying Dragon. In the mean
time <hi>I</hi> sought it with all diligénce;
and for a period to my labour, found
it in the Market place of <hi>Lebee,</hi> just
as they were giving fire to their
squibs. The grief of finding the
labour of my hands in so imminent
danger, did so transport me, that <hi>I</hi>
'gan to seize the arm of the Souldier
who was to be engineer; <hi>I</hi> snatcht
his match from him, and flung my
<pb facs="tcp:56354:19"/>
self furiously into my Engine, to
dash in pieces the Artifice with
which they had adorn'd it: But I
arrived too late, for scarce were
both my leggs in, when I was snatcht
up in a Cloud: the horrour with
which I was surrounded, did not so
much confound the faculties of my
soul, but that I remember every
thing that happened in that instant:
for assoon as the flame had devoured
one rank of crackers, which they
had disposed by six and six, and a
priming to each half dozen; another
rank began to play the Devil, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
so that the Salt-petre taking
fire, did by increasing, avoyd the
danger: the consuming of the matter
was the reason that the Artifice fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and when I thought of nothing
but leaving my head upon the top of
some mountain, I found (without
stirring my self at all) my Elevation
continued; and my Engine taking a
farewell of me, <hi>I</hi> perceived it to fall
towards the Earth again. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb facs="tcp:56354:20"/>
adventure did swell my
heart with so high a joy, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visht
to see my self delivered from
certain danger, <hi>I</hi> had the impudence
to Philosophy upon it; so as exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with my eyes and thoughts,
what should be the cause, <hi>I</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
my skin all puft up and greasie,
with the Marrow <hi>I</hi> had applyed to
the bruises of my last plunge: <hi>I</hi> found
that the Moon being in the decline,
and in that quarter using to exhale
the Marrow of Animals, she suckt
mine (with which <hi>I</hi> was anointed)
with so much the more force as her
Globe was neerer to me, and that no
interposition of Clouds did weaken
her vigor.</p>
            <p>When <hi>I</hi> had shot thorow, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the calculation, I had more
then three parts of the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Earth and the Moon; <hi>I</hi>
found my feet turn over of a sudden,
without any apparent jerk; nay, <hi>I</hi>
had not perceived it, if <hi>I</hi> had not
found my head loaden with the rest
<pb facs="tcp:56354:20"/>
of my body: truly, <hi>I</hi> found that <hi>I</hi>
did not tumble towards our World,
for though <hi>I</hi> found my self betwixt
two Moons, and that <hi>I</hi> noted, how <hi>I</hi>
in going from the one, approached
the other, yet <hi>I</hi> was certain that the
biggest was our Globe; because
that after a day or two's voyage, the
distant refractions of the Sun com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to confound the diversity of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and climates, it appeared to me
like a large Holland-Cheese gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>This made me imagine, that <hi>I</hi> by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ass'd
towards the Moon; and <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
my self in that opinion, when
<hi>I</hi> remembred that <hi>I</hi> had but begun
to fall after three quarters of the
way; for, said <hi>I,</hi> that mass being
less then Ours, it must follow,
that the Sphere of its activity is of
less reach, and that consequently <hi>I</hi>
felt the force of its Centre later.</p>
            <p>In fine, after having been a great
while falling, as you may judge;
for the violence of my precipitation
<pb facs="tcp:56354:21"/>
did hinder me from marking it; the
last effigies of my memory was, that
<hi>I</hi> found my self intangled upon a
tree, with two or three large boughs
which <hi>I</hi> in my fall had broken, and
my face plaistered with an Apple: so
that you may easily guess, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this hazard, <hi>I</hi> had been dead a
thousand times. <hi>I</hi> have often made
reflexion since upon the vulgar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
which affirms, that precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ones self from a high place, one
is suffocated before he comes to
ground; and <hi>I</hi> concluded from my
adventure, that they ly'd, or that by
the means of that efficacious juyce
of the Apple which had watered my
mouth, my soul was recall'd, who
could not yet be far from my carcase,
which was tyte, and well disposed to
the faculties of life: in effect, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon
as <hi>I</hi> toucht the ground, my pain
vanisht, before it could be imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in my memory; and the hunger
which <hi>I</hi> had sustained during my
voyage, left nothing behinde it, but
<pb facs="tcp:56354:21"/>
a slight remembrance of having lost
it.</p>
            <p>I was scarce got up, and had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the largest of certain great
Rivers, which finally compose a
Lake; when the spirits or invisible
souls of the simples exhal'd in that
Countrey, came to <hi>re-gall</hi> my smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
and <hi>I</hi> found that the stones
were not hard nor craggy, but did
carefully soften, when feet opprest
them: <hi>I</hi> straight lighted upon a
star-like Platform of five Avenues,
whose trees kiss'd the Heavens with
their lofty Foresterial tops; sending
my eyes post from their feet to their
heads, and then recalling them the
same way back, <hi>I</hi> was in doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Earth bore them, or whether
they did not rather hang by the
Roots: their elevated fronts seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to groan under the weight of the
Coelestial Globes, and their arms
stretcht to Heaven, imbracing to beg
of the Stars the pure benignity of
their influences, &amp; to receive it in the
<pb facs="tcp:56354:22"/>
bed of the Elements, before it had
lost any thing of its innocence: there
on every side, the flowers, without
the help of any Gardiner, but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
breath so rich (though wild)
a sent, that it would awaken the
most dull, and satisfie the nicest
smell. There th'incarnadine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of a Rose, lolling upon the Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantine,
or the bright azure of a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
lurking under the rushes, leave
us no liberty of choice, but make us
judge them both handsome. There
the Circle of the Year's composed of
an endless Spring; there no venemous
Plant is bred, for its breath betrays
its conservation, and the Brooks
with a delightful murmur, relate
their voyages to the Pebbles; there
a thousand plum'd Choristers fill
the Forest with Ecchoes of
their melodious tunes; and the
tottering assembly of those Divine
Musicians is so general, that one
would beleeve each leaf in the wood
had assum'd the tongue and figure of
<pb facs="tcp:56354:22"/>
a Nightingale: Nay, Eccho plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
her self so much in their Aires,
that to hear her repeat them, one
would imagine she had a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to learn them. On the side of
this Wood there are two Meadows,
whose continual greenness com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
an Emerauld, which outlasts
your sight: the confused paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that the Spring bestows on a
hundred little flowers, disperses
their shadows into one another,
with such an agreeable confusion,
that one knows not whether being
agitated with sweet Western winds,
they are in chase of one another; or
whether they fly the imbraces of the
wanton <hi>Zephyrus:</hi> Nay, one might
take this Meadow for the Ocean, for
it was like a Sea, which affords
no shoar to the sight; so that my eye
frighted to have wandered so far
without finding a harbour, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
sent my thoughts to its suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
which did beleeve it the end of
the World; perswading themselves
<pb facs="tcp:56354:23"/>
that such delicious places were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of charming Heaven to their
conjuncture. In the midst of so vast
and pleasant a Carpet, runs a sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Brook, whose shore is crown'd
with a verdant Bank, stuck with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
and Primroses, and a hundred
other little flowers, that seem to
crowd which should first behold
themselves in that Crystal stream:
it was yet in the Cradle, for it was
but new born, and that young and
polished Visage retain'd no srown;
the large Circles it makes, in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still to its self, shew how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
it is to leave its native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
and as if it were asham'd to be
courted so neer her its Mother, it's
murmuring thrust back my hand
that would have toucht it. The
Beasts that came thither to quench
their thirst (more rational then
those of our World) seem'd surpris'd
to see day break towards the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
whilst they might behold the
Sun with the Antipodes, and durst
<pb facs="tcp:56354:23"/>
not bow forwards upon the shore, for
fear of falling into the Firmament.</p>
            <p>I must confess that at the sight of
so many splendid things, I found my
self tickled with those agreeable
pains, they say, the <hi>Embryon</hi> feels at
the effusion of its soul: my old
hair fell off, to give place to other
hair, which grew thicker, and was
softer; I found my youth resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
my face changed to a vermili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hue; and my natural heat by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, to mingle with my Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
humidity; in fine, I retired into
fourteen yeers of age.</p>
            <p>I had scarce gone a mile through
a Forest of Jessemins and Myrtles,
when I perceived lying in the shade,
something that stirr'd; it was a yong
man, whose Majestick beauty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
compelled me to adoration; but
he rose to hinder me, crying out, It is
not to me, but to God you owe these
humiliations. Sir, answered I, you see
a person amazed with so many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
that I know not how to repell
<pb facs="tcp:56354:24"/>
my wonder; for coming from a
World which you here without
doubt take for a Moon, I thought
that I was arrived in another, which
those in my Countrey call also a
Moon; when I finde my self in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
and (to appearance) at the
feet of a God, who will not be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped.</p>
            <p>Except what you say of a God,
whose Creature I am, the rest is
truth; for this Land is the Moon,
which you behold in your Globe,
and this place you stand upon, is—
For in those times the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man was so strong, being not
yet corrupted, neither by debauches
nor the crudity of his sustenance, nor
by the alterations of sickness; and he
being excited by a violent desire of
approaching this Sanctuary, and his
Mass growing light, by the fire of
this <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> he was elevated in
the same sort, as some Philosophers
have been seen, whose imagination
was strongly fixt upon something,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:24"/>
carried into the Air by ravishments,
which you term Extasies.</p>
            <p>The Woman, th'infirmity of
whose sex rendred her weaker and
less hot, would without doubt not
have had th'imagination vigorous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to overcome, by the contention
of her will, the ponderousness of
the matter; but being there was very
little—The sympathy by
which this half was ty'd to its whole,
drew her to him as he ascended, as
Amber doth a straw; as the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
turns to the North, from
whence it was dig'd; so he drew that
part of himself, as the Sea draws the
flouds which are issued from her.</p>
            <p>When they were arrived in your
Land, they inhabited the Countrey
betwixt <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> and <hi>Arabia;</hi>
some people knew them by the name
of—; and others, under that
of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> whom the Poets feign
to have stole Coelestial fire, because
of the Posterity he begat, indued with
as perfect a soul as that he possest
<pb facs="tcp:56354:25"/>
himself; so that to inhabit your
World, this Man abandoned Ours:
but the Most Wise would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
so happy a Mansion without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
permitting some Ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
—: wearied with the
company of men, whose primitive
innocence was corrupted, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to leave them: yet this Person
thought no place a secure retreat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
th'ambition of his kindred,
which was already at daggers draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
about the partition of your
World, but the happy abode his
Great Grand-father had so oft spoke
to him of, unto which no body yet
had observed the way; but his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
supplied that, for as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marqu'd,
—He fill'd two
great vessels, which he glew'd closely
up, and fastned them under his arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits;
the smoak presently (whose
property was to ascend, and which
could not penetrate the Metal)
raised those vessels (and with them,
that great man) into the Air: when
<pb facs="tcp:56354:25"/>
he was come so far as the Moon, and
had cast his eyes upon this fine Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
an usual shivering with joy,
made him easily see, that this was
the blessed abode his Great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
had so often mentioned to
have lived in; he quickly unloosed the
vessels which he had fastned like
wings about his shoulders, and that
so happily, that he was scarce four
fathoms in the Air above the Moon,
when he dismist his Fins; yet this was
high enough to have hurt him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the great compass of his Robe,
which the Winde swelled, and so su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
him in a gentle descent to the
Earth; for the two vessels, they flew
to a certain place, where they have
remained yet, and it is those which
you this day term, <hi>The Balance</hi>
—.</p>
            <p>I must now relate unto you in
what manner I came hither; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
you have not forgot my nurse,
in regard it is not long since I told it
you: you must then know, that I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb facs="tcp:56354:26"/>
by the Bank of one of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mousest
Rivers of the World, where
amongst my Books, I led a life unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
although it glided away:
in the mean time, as the light of my
understanding augmented, so did
my knowledge of what I was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of before. Our Wise men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
put me in minde of th'Illustrious
<hi>Mada,</hi> but I sigh at the remembrance
of his high and perfect Philosophy;
I despaired of ever acquiring it,
when one day, after having muz'd a
great while, I took a Loadstone about
two foot in square, which I put in a
small Oven, and after it was well
purged, precipitated, and dissolved,
I drew the attractive calcin'd, and
reduced it to the bigness of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
siz'd ball.</p>
            <p>After these preparations, I caused
a Machine to be made of Iron, but
very light, into which I entred; and
being well seated in the seat, I cast
my Magnetique Bowl into the Air.
Now this Machine which I had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
<pb facs="tcp:56354:26"/>
made more heavy in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
then in any of the extremities,
was presently elevated in an equal
balance; for the middle was the most
efficaciously attracted; so that assoon
as I arrived whither my Load-stone
had drawn me, I cast it up again into
the Air. But Sir, said I (interrupting
him) how could you direct your
bowl so justly, that it did not fall on
one side of your Chariot? I do not
at all wonder at that, replyed he, for
the Load-stone being cast into the
Air, did draw the iron to it directly;
so that it was impossible to mount
on the one side thereof; nay, give
me leave to tell you, that holding
my bowl in my hand, I ascended,
sin ce the Chariot it self followed
the bowl that was above it: But the
jerk of the iron, to unite it self to the
bowl was so violent, that it made me
bend double, so that I durst but once
attempt this new experience. Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it was a most admirable sight to
behold, for the steel of this flying
<pb facs="tcp:56354:27"/>
house, which I had carefully polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
did so dartingly and briskly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
<hi>Apollo's</hi> beams, that I thought
my self all on fire. In fine, after of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
flinging and flying, I at last arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
(as I doubt not but you did) to
a condition of tumbling towards this
World; and because in that instant
I held my bowl in my hand, my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
(the seat whereof prest me to
approach its attractive) did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
me; all that I now fear'd was,
the breaking of my neck; to hinder
the which, I now and then would
toss up my bowl, so that my Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot
(stayed by this Magnetique ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue)
did mitigate the fall; for in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as it happened afterwards,
when I perceived my self within two
or three hundred fathoms of the
Earth, I launcht my bowl on all sides
of the Chariot, sometimes here,
sometimes there, till I perceived my
self within a certain distance; then
did I fling it up with all my force,
and my Engine following it, I gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:56354:27"/>
slipt on one side, to fall as softly as
I could upon the sand; so that my
fall vvas no ruder, then if I had fell
my own height: I need not tell you
the amazement that the sight of so
many Wonders procured me, being
it vvas so like that I lately beheld
you possest withall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had scarce tasted of it, vvhen a
thick cloud involved my soul, I saw
not any one neer me, and my eyes
could not grow acquainted vvith the
least tract in all the Hemisphere of
my Voyage; and yet I forgot no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of vvhat had happened unto
me: vvhen I have since made reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon this Miracle, I did fancy to
my self, that the fruit vvhich I had
bitten, had not quite rendred me
brutish, for my teeth piercing it,
found themselves moistned by the
liquor, vvhose efficacy had dispers'd
the malignity of the rinde. I was
extreamly surpriz'd to find my self
in an unknown Countrey all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
I gained nothing by eagerly
<pb facs="tcp:56354:28"/>
viewing the fields about me, no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
presented me with the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their sight: in fine, I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to travel till Fortune should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
me to the company of some
Beasts, or the period of my days.</p>
            <p>She gratiously heard my prayers,
for vvithin half a quarter of a league
I met two mighty Beasts, one of the
vvhich stopt just before me, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fled swiftly to its den (at least
as <hi>I</hi> then thought) because <hi>I</hi> saw
him return a vvhile after accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
vvith more then seven or eight
hundred of the same kinde, vvhich
invironed me: vvhen <hi>I</hi> beheld them
neer hand, <hi>I</hi> perceived they vvere
formed like unto us; this adventure
made me remember stories <hi>I</hi> had
heard my Nurse relate of <hi>Syrens,
Fauns,</hi> and <hi>Satyres;</hi> ever now and
then, they raised such shouts (caus'd
<hi>I</hi> suppose by the admiration of my
sight) that <hi>I</hi> beleeved my self al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
grown monstrous; at last, one
of these Beast-like men taking me by
<pb facs="tcp:56354:28"/>
the neck (as a Wolf that plunders a
Sheep) flung me upon his back, and
so carried me to their Town, where
I was more confounded then before,
when I knew them to be men; and
yet I met not one, which did not
walk upon all four.</p>
            <p>When these people saw me so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
(for the most of them are twelve
cubits long) and my body only su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
by two leggs, they could not
beleeve me a man; for they held, that
Nature having bestowed upon man
(as well as Beasts) two legs and two
arms, they ought as well as they to
make use of them: and in effect, when
I have since made reflexion upon this
subject, I did not find this situation
of the body very extravagant, when
I remember that Children who have
no other tutors then Nature, would
march upon all four, and doe not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
themselves upon two feet, but
by the busie care of their nurses; who
(to that effect) use little Chariots,
and swath them in such sort, as they
<pb facs="tcp:56354:29"/>
should not fall upon all four, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
or aptest seat for the repose of
our bodies.</p>
            <p>I have since demanded the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of what they then said,
which was, that I was certainly the
female of the Queens little Animals;
so I was in that quality carried to
the town-house, where I observed by
their murmurings and postures, that
they were consulting what I was:
when they had a long time confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
one of the Burgers, who had the
keeping of all the extraordinary
Beasts, did beseech the Maior and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen,
to commit me to his charge,
till the Queen should send for me to
accompany my Male; which was
easily granted him: who straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
carried me to his lodging, where
he instructed me in many odd tricks,
as tumbling, and making of mouths;
and in the afternoons, he would fix
a certain price at the door, for those
that would see me: but the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
pitying my griefs, and angry to
<pb facs="tcp:56354:29"/>
see the Temple of their Master pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned,
permitted me one day, as I
was tied to a chain (with which that
cursed Mountebank made me whisk
up and down to divert the company)
to hear the voice of a man, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me in Greek, who I was. I
was extreamly astonished to hear
him talk there, as they did in our
World; after he had questioned me
some time, I answered him, and in
fine, I related to him in general the
whole success of my enterprise and
voyage; he did consolate me; and I
remember he said to me, Well, my
son, in short, you must submit to
the Errors of your own World; the
vulgar sort here as well as there, will
not be acquainted with what they
doe not understand: but know, that
you are but justly serv'd; for if any
of this World had ascended into
yours, with the confidence of stiling
themselves humane, your learned
men would strangle him for a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
after which he promised me
<pb facs="tcp:56354:30"/>
to advertise the Court of my disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
and added he, as soon as I heard
the rumor that run of you, I came to
see you, whom I found to be (what
you said) a man of the other world,
wherein I have heretofore travelled:
for he had frequented <hi>Greece,</hi> where
he was called the Spirit of <hi>Socrates;</hi>
and after the death of that great
Philosopher, he had governed and
instructed <hi>Epaminondas</hi> at <hi>Thebes;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which (passing over to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>)
justice obliged him to fix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
young <hi>Cato;</hi> after whose decease
he dedicated himself to <hi>Brutus.</hi> All
these great Persons leaving behinde
them nothing but the Fantasms of
their vertues; he had retired with
the rest of his companions into Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and solitary places. At last, said
he, the people of your World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
so gross and stupid, that I
and my Companions lost all the
pleasure ve took heretofore in instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
them: I beleeve you have
heard discourse of us, for they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:56354:30"/>
us <hi>Oracles, Nymphs, Genius's, Fauns,
Foresterial Gods, Lemur's, Larva's, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias,
Farfadits, Nayades, Incubus's,
Shades, Manes, Visions,</hi> and <hi>Chimera's:</hi>
we abandoned your World in the
Reign of <hi>Augustus;</hi> a little after, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to <hi>Drusus,</hi> son to <hi>Livia,</hi> (who
waged war in <hi>Germany</hi>) and forbid
him to proceed. It is not long since
I arrived the second time; within this
last hundred years, I had a commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to make one voyage more: I
have roved up and down <hi>Italy,</hi> and
conversed it may be with some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of your acquaintance: One day
amongst others, I appeared to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
as he studied, I instructed him
in a great many things; in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
whereof, he promised me, to
leave to Posterity the knowledge
from whom he learned those secrets
he treated of in his writings: I visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> the <hi>Abbot Triteme,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Faustus, La Bross, Caesar,</hi> and a
certain <hi>Cabal</hi> of young Fellows, who
were vulgarly called, <hi>The Knights of
<pb facs="tcp:56354:31"/>
the Red Cross,</hi> whom I instructed in
a great many knacks, and Natural
Sciences, which without doubt hath
made them beleeved to be great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians:
I was acquainted with
<hi>Campanella;</hi> it was I that counselled
him, whilst he was in the Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at <hi>Rome,</hi> to frame his face and
body to the ordinary postures of
those whose interiors he had need of
knowing, that he might raise in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by the same figure, the thoughts
that the same situation had raised
in his Adversaries, and so that he
might better manage their Souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acquainted with them; and he at
my request began a Book, which he
stiled, <hi>De Sensu Rerum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I likewise frequented in <hi>France,
La Mothe, Le Vayer,</hi> and <hi>Gassendi;</hi> the
second is one who hath writ as much
in Philosophy, as the other under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood:
I have known many more,
whom your World call <hi>Divines,</hi> but
really I finde nothing in them, but a
great deal of babble &amp; sensless pride.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56354:31"/>In fine, as I past from your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to <hi>England,</hi> to study the manners
and disposition of the inhabitants,
I met a man, the shame of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
for it is a shame to the great
ones of your World, to finde so rich
a vertue enthron'd in one man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
adoring him: for, to abridge his
Panegyricks, he is all Wit, all Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and possesses all those quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which speak a worthy <hi>Heroe:</hi>
it was <hi>Tristram</hi> the <hi>Hermite;</hi> really,
when I beheld such great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
I apprehended it should not be
acknowledged; wherefore I indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to make him accept three lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Vials; the first was filled with
oyl of Talk; the other with Powder
of Projections; and the third with
<hi>Aurum Potabile:</hi> but he refused them
with as generous a disdain, as <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
did the Complements of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander:</hi>
to be short, I can add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the Eulogy of this great
man, except, that he is the only Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
the only Philosopher, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:56354:32"/>
Free-man, you have amongst you.
These are the considerable persons I
convers'd withal; all the rest, at least
that I knew, are so much below hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
that I have known beasts
something above them. Now I am
not born, neither in your Countrey,
nor this; for my birth I owe to the
Sun: but because that sometimes our
World is over-peopled, in respect of
the length of the inhabitants lives,
and that it is almost exempted from
Wars and Diseases; from time to
time our Magistrates send Colonies
to the World about them: for my
part, I was commanded to go to
yours, and declared Chief of the
people that did accompany me: <hi>I</hi>
since came to this, for the causes <hi>I</hi>
told you; and the reason why <hi>I</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
stay here, is, that the men are
lovers of Truth, and that no Pedants
are seen, and that the Philosophers
will not be perswaded but by reason,
and that the Authority of a Wise
man, nor a multitude, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
<pb facs="tcp:56354:32"/>
the opinion of a Thrasher, if he
reason as well as they: in brief, in
this Countrey none are counted
mad, but Sophisters and Orators. <hi>I</hi>
asked, how long they lived? he told
me three or four thousand years, and
in this sort continued.</p>
            <p>Though the inhabitants of the
Sun are not so numerous, as those of
this World; yet the Sun makes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
emissions, because that the
people are of a very hot temper, stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and ambitious, and digest
much: what <hi>I</hi> tell you, need not
seem strange; for though that our
Globe be very vast, and yours little;
and though that we die but after
two or three thousand years, and you
in half an Age: Know, that in the
same manner, as there is not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
stones, as clods of Earth; nor so
many plants, as stones; nor so many
Animals, as Plants; nor so many ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
as irrational Creatures: so
there ought not to be so many Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riti
as men, becouse of the difficult
<pb facs="tcp:56354:33"/>
conjunction of things fit for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of so perfect a Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> demanded of him, if they were
bodies like us: He answered me,
that they were bodies, but not like
us, not any thing which we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
were bodies: for we vulgarly
onely called them so which we can
touch; besides, there is nothing in
Nature, but what is material; and
though they be so of themselves, yet
they were forced, when they would
represent themselves to us, to take
bodies proportionate to what our
senses are capable to conceive; which
was without doubt the reason, that
a great many beleeved, that the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which are told of them, was an
effect of an idle fancy, because they
appeared but in the night: to which
he added, that being forced to form
those bodies (they intended to make
use of) in haste, they had not time
often to accommodate them proper
for above one sense at once; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:56354:33"/>
the Hearing, as the voices of
Oracles; sometimes the Sight, as
Fires and Visions; sometimes the
Feeling, as <hi>Incubusses:</hi> and these bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
being but condens'd Clouds, in
this or that shape, the light by its
heat disperses them, as we see it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipate
a Mist.</p>
            <p>The explication of many fine
things, gave me the curiosity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogating
him about his Birth and
Death; and if in the Country of
the Sun the <hi>Individuum</hi> came to light
by the ways of Generation? And if
it were extinguished by the disorder
of its Temperament, or the fraction
of its Organs? There is too little
alliance (said he) betwixt your sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and the explication of these
Mysteries, that you imagine, that
what you cannot comprehend, is
spiritual, or that it is not at all: but
your consequence is very false, and it
shews, that may be there is in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse
a million of things, which
would require in you a million of
<pb facs="tcp:56354:34"/>
different Organs to be understood.
I, for example, know by my senses
the reason of the sympathy betwixt
the Load-stone with the Pole; and
of the flowing of the Sea; and what
becoms of a Beast after his Death:
you cannot arrive at these high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
but by faith, because the
proportions of these Miracles are
unknown to you; a blinde man may
as well imagine the beauty of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Meadow, the colours of a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
or the streaked Rainbow; for
he will fancy it sometimes palpable,
as something of eating, or hearing,
or a fragrant smell; in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
if <hi>I</hi> should go about to explicate
things to you, which <hi>I</hi> behold by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
you want, you would imagine it
something that might be heard, seen,
smelt, or tasted; and yet it is none of
all these.</p>
            <p>He was in this part of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse,
when my Juggler, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that the company was weary
of my gibberish, because they did
<pb facs="tcp:56354:34"/>
not understand it, and that they took
it for a grumbling not articulated;
he began to pluck the cord again, to
make me leap and skip, till the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators
were satisfied with laughing;
who affirmed, that I had almost as
much wit, as the Beasts of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
so they retired to their homes.</p>
            <p>The visits of this officious Spirit,
were singular solacements to the
hardships of my usage, for to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
my self with those that came to
see me; besides, that they beleeved
me but for an Animal of the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningest
sort, in the <hi>Cathegorick</hi> of
Beasts; neither could I speak their
tongue, nor they mine, and by that
you may judge the proportions: for
you must know, there are two <hi>Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms</hi>
used in that Countrey; one the
great ones make use of, the other is
generally used by the vulgar: that of
the great ones, is nothing else but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
tones not articulated, almost
like our Musick, when the words are
not added to the Air: and really, it is
<pb facs="tcp:56354:35"/>
an invention which is both useful and
pleasant: for when they are weary
with talking, or when they disdain
to prostitute their throats to that
use, they take a Lute or some other
instrument, with which, as well as
with their voices, they communicate
their thoughts to one another; so
that sometimes you shall have 15 or
20 of them in company, who will
discourse a point of Divinity, or
the difficulties of a Process, by
the most harmonious consent of
Musick that ever tickled the Ear.</p>
            <p>The second, which the Common
People use, is by the motion of the
Members, but not may be as we
imagine; for some parts of the body
signifie a whole Discourse: as for
example, the agitation of a finger, of
a hand, of an ear, of a lip, of an
arm, of an eye, or of a cheek; each
will signifie an Oration in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
or at least a Period, with all
these members; the rest do but serve
to design the words, as a wrinkle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:56354:35"/>
the fore-head, the several quive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of the muscles, the reversion of
the hands, the stampings of the feet,
the contorsion of the arms; so that
when they Dialogue with the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
they have of going quite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and their members accustomed
to gesticulate their conceptions, they
stir with such alacrity, that it is not
like a man that speaks, but like one
that trembles.</p>
            <p>My Spirit came almost daily to
see me, whose excellent entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made me forget the rigor of
my captivity: at last, one morning
I perceived a man entring my cabin,
whom I did not know; who having
lickt me all over, took me with his
mouth up by the breech, and with
one of his paws lifted me upon his
back, where I was so easily and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seated, that with the affliction
that the usage of a Beast caused in
me, I had no desire of escaping: and
withall, those men that goe on all
four, are much swifter then we, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:56354:36"/>
that the most indisposed of them,
make nothing of running down a
Stagg.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time, I was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
afflicted to have no news of my
courteous Spirit: and the first dayes
Journey ended; and coming to our
purposed lodging, I walked the
Court of the Inn, whilst supper was
making ready; when a young man
very beautiful came smiling to my
face, and casting his two fore-leggs
about my neck, (after <hi>I</hi> had a
while considered him,) What, says
he in <hi>French,</hi> have you so soon forgot
your friend? <hi>I</hi> leave you to guess
at my astonishment; which really
was so great, that from that time, <hi>I</hi>
imagined all the Globe of the Moon
that had happened to me, and all
that <hi>I</hi> saw to be nothing but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments;
when this Beast-like
man, who was the same <hi>I</hi> had rid all
day, continued speaking in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
You promised me, that the good
offices <hi>I</hi> did you, should never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten;
<pb facs="tcp:56354:36"/>
and yet you look as if you
had never seen me before now: But
seeing that <hi>I</hi> remained in my asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
in fine, said he, <hi>I</hi> am that
Spirit of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who diverted you
in the time of your imprisonment,
and who, to continue my service to
you, did take upon me the body
which you mounted to day: But <hi>I</hi>
interrupting him, How can this be,
seeing that this day you were of an
excessive long stature, and that now
you are very short? That to day you
had a feeble broken voice, and that
now it is clear and vigorous? And
that in short, you were to day an
old rawbon'd man, and now you are
a youth. How's this? As in our cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
we from our cradles begin a
progress towards death; the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of this World from old age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trace
the steps of youth. Assoon as
<hi>I</hi> had spoken to the Prince (said he)
and had received order of condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
you to the Court, <hi>I</hi> went to
you where you were; and having
<pb facs="tcp:56354:37"/>
brought you hither, <hi>I</hi> found the
bulk <hi>I</hi> inhabited so overcome with
wearisomness, that all its Organs
refused me their ordinary functions,
so that <hi>I</hi> enquired the way to the
Hospital; which when <hi>I</hi> entered, <hi>I</hi>
found the body of a young man new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expired, by a mad accident, and
yet common enough in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
<hi>I</hi> approacht him, feigning to
perceive some motion, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
to the assistants that he was not
yet dead, and that what they believed
had killed him, was nothing but a
lethargy; so that without being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<hi>I</hi> approached my mouth to
his, and so entred him as through a
trunk: then down fell my old Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case,
and <hi>I</hi> rose, as if <hi>I</hi> had been that
young man, and came to seek you
out; leaving the people, crying, A
Miracle, a Miracle: Upon which,
they came to fetch us to supper, and <hi>I</hi>
followed my conduct or into a parlor
richly furnished, but where <hi>I</hi> saw
no preparation for the belly; so great
<pb facs="tcp:56354:37"/>
a scarcity of meat (when <hi>I</hi> was ready
to die with hunger, obliged me to ask
him where the cloath was laid: <hi>I</hi> did
not hear his answer; for at the same
time three or four young Boys of the
house approacht me with a great deal
of civility, and stript me to my shirt:
this new Ceremony did so astonish
me, that <hi>I</hi> durst not ask the reason of
my lovely <hi>Valet de Chambres,</hi> &amp; <hi>I</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my Guide, who askt me where <hi>I</hi>
would begin, could get these two
words from me, <hi>Un Pottage:</hi> But <hi>I</hi> had
scarce pronounced them, but <hi>I</hi> found
the Odor of the most admirable bisk,
that ever fum'd into <hi>Dives</hi> his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils;
<hi>I</hi> would have risen from my
seat, to find out by the sent, the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
of that favour, but my bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
hindred me;
Where will you go?
said he, we will go a walking by and
by; but now it is fit to eat a little:
make an end of your Pottage, that
we may call for something else. And
where the Devil is this Pottage?
answered <hi>I,</hi> half angry) have you
<pb facs="tcp:56354:38"/>
resolved to jeer me all this day? <hi>I</hi>
thought, said my guide, that you had
seen at the Town from whence
you came, your Master, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at their Meals, which is the
reason <hi>I</hi> did not inform you they
sed themselves here: being then
that you doe not know, <hi>I</hi> must tell
you, we live here by fumes. The
Art of our Kitchins, is to shut up in
Vessels made for the purpose, the
exhalations which proceed from the
Meat when it is dressing; and when
they have ramast many of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
kindes and tastes, according to
the appetite of those they treat, they
open one vessel, and then another,
and so till the company be fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
            <p>And if you have not been accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to live in this sort, you cannot
beleeve, that a Nose without Teeth
or Throat, could doe the office of
the Mouth, to nourish its Master;
but <hi>I</hi> will let you see it by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
he had no sooner ended, but <hi>I</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56354:38"/>
found enter into the Parlor so many
agreeable and nourishing vapours,
that in less then half quarter of an
hour, <hi>I</hi> found my self quite satisfied
before we rose. This ought not,
said he, to be any wonder to you; for
you cannot have lived so long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
observing, that in your World
the Pastry-Cooks, who eat less then
people of other Vocations, yet are
much fatter; and whence doe you
beleeve comes their good case, but
by the fume they are continually
invironed with, and which pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
and nourisheth their Bodies?
Now the People of this World en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
a health less interrupted, and
more vigorous; because that their
nourishment ingenders hardly any
excrements, which are commonly the
Originals of all Diseases. May be
you were surprised, that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed
you before our Meal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in your Countrey they do not
use this Custome; but it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Mode here, that the fumes
<pb facs="tcp:56354:39"/>
might the easier invade the pores: Sir,
said I, ther's great likelihood of what
you say, for <hi>I</hi> my self have lately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
it; but <hi>I</hi> must confess, that
not being yet quite unbruited, I should
be very glad to feel a bit grinded
betwixt my teeth: which he promised
me; but it was the next day; for he said
that eating so soon after our Meal,
would procure me an indigestion: we
discoursed a while longer, after
which, we went up into our chamber
to take our rests.</p>
            <p>A man presented himself to us at
the stairs head; and after having
eyed us attentively, he brought me
to a chamber, whose boards were
strawed with Orange-flowers three
foor deep; and my Spirit into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which was likewise strawed
with Gilly-flowers and Jessemin:
he told me (when he saw that I
wondered at this magnificence) that
those were the Beds of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
In fine, we coucht each of us
in his Cabin; and assoon as I was
<pb facs="tcp:56354:39"/>
stretcht upon my flowers, I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the light of about 30 Glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms
which were inclosed in a
Cristal (<hi>Charon</hi> makes use of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
candles) those 3 or 4 boys who
had disrobed me for supper, one of
which began to tickle my feet, th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my thighs, another my flanks,
the other my arms; and all with
such delicate wantonness, that in a
moment sleep had mastered me.</p>
            <p>The morning beams had not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
me, before they propitiously
had lighted my guide to my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
who entring, said, I will keep
my promise with you, of treating
you more solidly at your Break-fast,
then last night. At these words I
rose, and he conducted me by the
hand, by the garden of the house,
where one of the children waited
our coming, with an Engine in his
hand, much like our fowling-peeces:
he ask'd my guide, if I would have
a dozen of Larks, because <hi>Baboons</hi>
(whereof he beleeved me one) nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht
<pb facs="tcp:56354:40"/>
themselves with that sort of
meat: I had scarce answered, Yes,
when our Fowler discharged his
peece, and twenty or thirty Larks
ready rosted fell at our feet. 'Slife
there is a Proverb with us (cryed I
straight) of a Countrey where
Larks fall ready rosted; sure the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
came from hence: Well, Sir,
doe you eat; these people have the
wit to mingle with their shot and
powder a certain composition, which
kills plumes ready rosted, &amp; seasons
the foul: I gathered some, with which,
upon his word, I made bold; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
in all my life time, I never eat
any thing more delicious. After this
Break-fast, we prepared for our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
and with a thousand mops and
mews, which they use when they
would testifie any great affection,
our Landlord received a peece of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
from my Guide: I askt him if
it were an obligation for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our reckoning; he answered
me, No, for he owed him nothing,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:40"/>
and that those were verses: How?
verses, said I? are the Inn-keepers
here very curious of Rhymes? Sir,
said he, it is the money of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
and the expence that we made
here, amounted to a <hi>Stanza</hi> of six
verses, which I now paid him: I did
not fear over-shooting our selves in
the reckoning; for though we should
here Epicurize a week together, we
could not spend a <hi>Sonnet,</hi> and I have
four about me, with two <hi>Epigrams,
2 Odes,</hi> and an <hi>Eclogue.</hi> I wish to God
(said I) it were so in our Countrey; I
know many an honest Poet, that is
ready to starve, and would make
good chear, if they might pay the
treat in this money. I then askt
him, if those verses would always
serve if they were transcribed; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
me, No; and continued in this
manner: The author having compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them, goes to the Mint, where
the sworn Poets of the Kingdom
hold their places; there these versi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
officers put the compositions
<pb facs="tcp:56354:41"/>
to the proof; and if they be judged
good Metal, they tax them not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their prizes (that is, a Sonnet
is not always worth a Sonnet) but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the merit of the piece; so
that when any one starves, it is a sign
he is a block-head; for people of wit
make good chear: I admired in an
extrasie, the judicious policy of that
countrey; and he proceeded in this
sort: There are others, that keep ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
at anothergessrate then there;
for when one is going from them,
they demand according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the expences, an acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for the next World; which
when one hath given them, they
write in a great Register, which they
call the accounts of the great day, in
this manner: <hi>Item,</hi> the value of so
many verses delivered such a day, to
such a one, who is at the sight of this
acquittance to pay me out of the
first cash he hath: and when they
finde themselves in danger of death,
they chop these Registers into pieces,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:41"/>
and so swallow them; for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
if they were not thus digested,
they would be of no use to them.</p>
            <p>This entertainment put no obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to our making way, my guide go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on all four, and I bestriding him.
I will no more particularize the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
of our Journey; but in fine,
we arrived at the Town, where the
King makes his residence: I was no
sooner arrived, but I was conducted
to the Court, where the Grandees re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
me with more moderate admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
then the people had done, as
I past in the streets; but they, as well
as the people, concluded, that I was
the female of the Queens little Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal:
which my guide interpreted to
me; and yet he himself did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this AEnigma, and knew
not what that little Animal of the
Queens might be.</p>
            <p>But we were both quickly satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for the King after having a while
considered me, commanded it to be
brought forth; and half an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:42"/>
I perceived amongst a troop of
Monkeys and Apes (who handed
his Ruffe, Cloak, and Breeches, a
little man entring, almost like to my
self, for he went upon two leggs: as
soon as he beheld me, he accosted
me, with a <hi>Criado de Vuestra Merced;</hi>
and I retorted his salute almost in
the same terms.</p>
            <p>But alas! they no sooner saw us
tattle together, but beleeved they had
guest right; and it was impossible
this conjecture should have a better
success, for he of the Spectators that
made the most favourable constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of us, protested, that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
was a grumbling, which
our natural instant meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
made us mutter. This little
man told me, he was an <hi>European,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of <hi>Old-Castile,</hi> and that he had
found a means by Birds to arrive at
the Moon, where we then were; and
being fallen into the Queens hands,
she had taken him for an Ape; for
as Fortune would have it, they cloath
<pb facs="tcp:56354:42"/>
their Apes in that Countrey in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
cloathes; and finding him at his
arrival in that habit, she doubted
not but that he was of the same kind.
You may even as well say, answered
I, that having try'd all fashion'd
cloaths upon them, they found none
so ridiculous as those; and for that
reason, they accoutre them in this
sort, since these Animals are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
but for divertisement: This
shews, said he, that you know not
our Nation, in favour of which the
Universe produceth men, to afford
us slaves, and for whom Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
engender any thing, but subjects
of laughter. After which, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
me to tell him, how I durst
adventure to scale the Moon with the
Engine I had told him of: I answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him, that it was because he had
prevented my journey with the
Birds I intended to use: he gravely
smil'd at this Rallery; and the King
about a quarter of an hour after,
commanded the Ape-keepers to lead
<pb facs="tcp:56354:43"/>
us back again, with an express or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to make the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and me lie
together, that we might multiply
our species in his Kingdom. They
exactly executed his Majesties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
of which I was very joyful,
that I might have some body to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
me in the time of my bruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
One day my Male (for
they lookt upon me as the Female)
did relate to me the reason of his
travels about all the Earth, and what
at last obliged him to quit it for the
Moon; which was, that he had not
found one Country, where the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
it self was free: for look you,
sayes he, if you have not a Corner'd
Cap, whatsoever you say, though
never so witty, yet it is against the
Doctors opinion, and you are an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deot,
a Fool, and something worse:
they would have put me (in my
Countrey) in the Inquisition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I maintained to all the Pedants
teeth, that there was a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and
that I knew no matter in the World
<pb facs="tcp:56354:43"/>
heavier then another. I askt him
upon what foundation he built so
little received an opinion: Oh, says
he, to compass it, you must suppose
there is but one Element; for though
we separately see Water, Earth,
Air, and Fire, yet we never find them
so perfectly pure, but that they are
interchangeably ingaged one with
another; as for example, When you
see the Fire, it is not Fire, but Air
mightily extended; Air is but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much dilated; Water is but
Earth dissolved; and Earth it self, is
but condens'd water: and thus seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to penetrate the matter, you
will finde it is but one, vvho (like an
excellent Comoedian) plays all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts, under all diversity of
habits; otherwise we must admit as
many Elements as there be sorts of
Bodies. And if you will ask me,
Why the Fire burns, and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cools, being it is the self-same
matter: I answer you, That this
matter agitates sympathetically, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb facs="tcp:56354:44"/>
to the disposition it is then
in. Fire (that is, nothing but Earth
more dilated then when it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
air) indeavors to convert to it
self by sympathy what it meets with;
so the heat of a coal being the subtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
&amp; fittest to penetrate a body, slides
through the pores of our bulk: and
in the first place, because it is a new
matter that fills us, it causes a breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sweat, vvhich sweat disperst by
the fire, converts it self into fume,
and becoms Air; this Air being
moreover melted by the heat of the
Antiperistass or adjoyning Stars, is
called Fire; and the Earth abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the cold and humidity which
vvere ligaments to the whole,
fall to Earth: Water on the other
side, though it differs not from the
matter of Fire, but in being more
closed, it doth not burn us, because
that we being closed, it sympatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
closes the body it meets with; &amp;
the cold that vve feel, is nothing but
our flesh rallying in a less compass,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:44"/>
drawing with it part of the neighbor
water of Earth; from vvhence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
that those that are sick of a
dropsie, convert all their nourishment
into vvater; &amp; Cholerick men change
the blood their Liver creates, into
Choler: suppose then that there is
but one Element, and it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that all our bodies, each accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to its quality, equally incline
to the Centre of the Earth.</p>
            <p>But you will ask me, Why that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
and other Metals, Earth and
Wood, have a swifter descent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Centre, then a sponge;
but that it is fuller of Air, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
tends upwards: but that is
not at all the reason; and thus I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
you: Though a Rock fall with
more rapidity then a feather, yet the
one and the other have the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
for that voyage: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
a Cannon-bullet (if the
Earth were pierc'd quite through)
would precipitate more furiously
towards its Centre, then a bladder
<pb facs="tcp:56354:45"/>
fill'd with Air; and the reason is,
that that mass of the Metal is a great
deal of Earth crowded into a little
compass; and that Winde a little
Earth in a large compass: for all
the parts of the matter which are
lodged in the Iron, being joyned one
with another, augment their forces
by that Union, because being thus
closed, they are a great many fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against a few, since that parcel
of Air equal to the Bullet in bigness,
is not equal in quantity.</p>
            <p>Without proving this by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of arguments; in good faith,
How do you beleeve, that a Pike, a
Sword, or a Dagger wounds us, if it
be not because the steel is a matter
where the parts are closer together,
and more within one another, then
our flesh, whose poriness and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
demonstrates, that it contains a
very little matter spread into a
large compass, and the point of
the sword being an innumerable
quantity of parts against a little
<pb facs="tcp:56354:45"/>
flesh, forces it to yeeld to the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;
as a well-knit squadron, will
easily break a scattered Batallion?
for, why should a bar of red hot i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
cast a greater heat, then a log of
the same bigness throughly lighted;
but because that more parts are
lighted, or burn in a little space, then
in the wood; which because it is
spongeous, includes a great deal of
emptiness or <hi>Vacuum</hi> within it: and a
<hi>Vacuum</hi> being nothing else but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of being, cannot be suscepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Fire? But may be, you'l ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to me, that I suppose a <hi>Vacuum,</hi>
as if I had proved it, and that it is
that we dispute of: Well then, I
will now prove it to you and though
that difficulty be the labour of
the <hi>Gordion-knot,</hi> yet my arm is
strong enough to become its <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then let that vulgar beast (who
would not beleeve man to be man,
but that it's told so) answer me: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that there is but one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:46"/>
as I think I have sufficiently
proved; How comes it, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to its appetite or disposition, it
restrains or swells? How comes it
that a piece of Earth, by condensity
becomes a stone? Is it that the
parts of that pebble are retired one
into another, in such sort, that where
one grain of sand is lodged, in the
same point or place, another can be
intruded? all this cannot be, nay,
according to their own principle,
since bodies cannot penetrate one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
But this matter is got clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
together, or, if you please, grown
less, in filling some place that was
empty before.</p>
            <p>To say, that it is incomprehensible
there should be a Nothing in the
World, that we in part are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of Nothing, pray, why not? Is
not the whole World incompass'd
with Nothing? since you'l grant that
Article, confess that it is as easie for
the World to have Nothing in it, as
about it. I foresee you'l ask me, why
<pb facs="tcp:56354:46"/>
that water, being restrained by frost
in another vessel, should crack it, if
it be not to hinder a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> But my
answer to it is, that the Air above it,
which tends as well as Earth or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Centre, if it finde in its
journey an empty place, presently
lodgeth it self; if it findes the pores
of this vessel, that is, the ways to this
chamber of <hi>Vacuum</hi> too strait, too
long, and too crooked, it by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, satisfies its impatience to
arrive at its Inn.</p>
            <p>But without troubling my self to
answer all their Objections, I dare
boldly say, that if there were no <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi>
there would be no motion, or
we must admit penetration of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
for it would be ridiculous to
think, that when a fly beats back
with her wings a parcel of Air, and
that parcel another, and that other
another; and so by the stirring of a
flea's little toe, there rises a bumb
behinde the World. But when they
can say no more, they fly to rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
<pb facs="tcp:56354:47"/>
But in good faith, How
comes it, that when a body scarifies
it self, that one particle can be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from another, without leaving
an empty place? Must not these two
bodies that were just now separated,
have been at the same time, in the
same place of this; and that in this
sort, they must be all three penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
I expect you'l ask me, Why
through a hollow trunk, a seringe, or
a pump, they force the water up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
its inclination? To which I
answer you, It is by violence; but it
is not the fear of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
it from its way; but being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Air by an invisible conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
it is elevated with the Air
which holds it imbraced.</p>
            <p>This is not very difficult to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
when one knows the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Circle, and delicate contexture
of the Elements: for if you atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
consider the slime which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the Earth to the Water, you
will finde, that it is no more
<pb facs="tcp:56354:47"/>
Earth, nor Water, but the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
betwixt these two Enemies: the
water and the Air reciprocally form
a Mist, which penetrates the one and
the others humors, to conclude a
Peace; and the Air is reconciled to
the Fire by an Exhalation, their
Mediator. I beleeve he would have
pursued his Discourse, but that our
commons were brought; and my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
being very hungry, closed my ears
to his Discourse, and opened my
mouth and stomack to the welcome
meat.</p>
            <p>I remember another time as we
were Philosophying, (for neither the
one nor the other delighted to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of mean things) I am very
sorry (says he) to finde a wit of
your temper, infected with vulgar er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;
you must know, in spite of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotles</hi>
Pedantism, of whom all your
Schools in <hi>France</hi> ring, that all is in
all, that is, for example, that in Water
there is Fire, and in Fire there is
Water; in Air, Earth; and in Earth,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:48"/>
Air; and though this opinion make
your Scholars open their eyes
as big as sawcers, yet it is easier to
prove, then to perswade them to it.
For, I will first ask them, if Water
will not ingender fish; which if
they deny, digg a pit, and fill it
with water, which if they please
they may strain, to avoid all blinde
Objections; and if in some time
you finde not fish there, I will be
bound to swallow all the water you
have put in't: But if any be found,
as I do not doubt but there will; it is
a convincing reason, that there is
both fire and salt. Now to finde
Water in Fire, as I take it, is no
hard enterprize; for let them pick
out Fire that is most separated from
the matter, if they please; as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
in which there is a great deal,
since that unctious matter of which
they are engendered, converted to
Sulphur by the Antiperistass that
light them, if it should finde no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle
in its violence, in the humid
<pb facs="tcp:56354:48"/>
cold which tempers and opposeth it,
it would briskly consume it self like
Lightning, Now that there is Air
in the Earth, they will not deny; or
else they never heard of the horrible
Earth-quakes, wherewith the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Sicily</hi> are agitated: And
besides that, we see the Earth all
vary, to the very grains of sand that
compose it, and yet none says those
pores contain a <hi>Vacuum:</hi> I hope
then, they will not be angry, that I
say, Air lodgeth there. Now I
must prove, that in Air there is
Earth; but I will scarce take the
pains, since you are convinced as
often as those legions of Atoms fall
upon your head, which are so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
that they choak Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique.</p>
            <p>But let us pass from Simples to
Compositions, which more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
furnish me with subjects,
that all is in all, not that they change
into one another, as your <hi>Peripateticks</hi>
tattle: for I will maintain to their
<pb facs="tcp:56354:49"/>
beards, that the Principles do min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
and separate, and mingle again;
in such sort, that what was made
Water by the Wise Creator of the
World, will ever be so. I will not
(as they doe) suppose a Maxime
without proving it. Wherefore take
a Log, or any other combustible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
&amp; set fire to it; they will say when
it is throughly lighted, that what
was wood, is now become fire. But
I will maintain the contrary, and
that there is no more fire in't, when
it is inflamed, then when it was
first lighted; for what before
the cold and humid part hid (and
hindred to agitate) succoured by the
stranger, that hath rallied his forces
against the flegmatick humor which
choakt it, and now possesses the
field his Enemy before was master
of; which he demonstrates without
obstacle, triumphing over his Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.
Doe you not see how the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
flies out at the two ends of the
logg, yet hot and smoaking from the
<pb facs="tcp:56354:49"/>
Combat? The flame you see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend,
is the subtillest of the Fire, the
most separated from the matter, and
that which is consequently the most
ready to return to its self; yet it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
it self Pyramidically to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
height, the better to pierce the
thick humidity of the Air which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
it; but as in mounting, it begins
more and more to be separated from
the violent company of its Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords,
it then begins to fly at large,
meeting no more Antipathy to its
passage: but this negligence is often
subject to a second imprisonment;
for voyaging separately, it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
rangeth into a Cloud, where
if the juncture be of quantities e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to head a vapour, they joyn,
they grumble; and from thence they
thunder, they lighten; and the death
of innocents is often the impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
effect of the irritated Choler
of dead things. If when it findes it
self intangled in the crudity of the
middle Region, and being not
<pb facs="tcp:56354:50"/>
strong enough to dispute its liberty,
or to defend it self; it straight aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
it self to the discretion of its
enemy, which constrains it by its
weight, to fall again to the Earth;
and this unfortunate ranger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inclosed in a drop of Water,
will be faln at the foot of an Oak,
whose Animal fire will invite this
poor stragler to lodge with him; and
thus he returns to the same Prison he
had so lately broke. But let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Fortune of the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which compose this Logg:
the Air retires to its quarter, yet
mingled with vapours, because the
conquering fire in great Choler did
briskly expel them <hi>pell-mell</hi> together.
Now you see it the Winds Tennis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,
serve Beasts for breathing, fills
up the empty places Nature fram'd;
and may be after all this, being
condens'd into a drop of Dew, it
may be drunk by the thirsty leaves
of the same tree, where our fire was
retired, before the Water which
<pb facs="tcp:56354:50"/>
the furious flames had extirpated
from that Throne, elevated by the
heat to the nursery of Meteors, will
fall in rain upon our Oak, as soon as
on another; and the Earth which
was burnt to ashes, now cured of
its sterility, either by the nourishing
heat of scattered dung, or by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative
salt of some neighbouring
Plants, or by the foecundious water
of some River, this also may be neer
this Oak, which by the heat of its
germ, will attract it, and convert it
to a part of its whole.</p>
            <p>Now here you see these four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which had the same destiny,
which return to the condition they
had some few days before quitted:
so we may say, that in a man there
are all things necessary to compose a
tree, and in a tree to compose a man.
And in this manner, all will be
found to be in all: but we want a
<hi>Prometheus,</hi> who would rob Natures
brest, and render us sensible; which I
am willing to call <hi>Materia Prima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56354:51"/>
These were the entertainments
we past the time withal; for this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Spaniard</hi> had a pretty wit, yet our
discourses were all by night: for the
multitude of people, which from six
a clock in the morning till night,
came to see us at our lodgings, would
have interrupted us; for, some threw
stones at us; other, nuts; others,
grass: there was no talk but of the
Kings Beasts; we were every day du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
served at our hours, and the King
&amp; Queen did often take the pains to
feel my belly, to try if I grew big, for
they burnt with an impatient desire
to have some of the race of these little
creatures. I know not whether it was
by being more attentive then my
Male, to their Apishness and tones,
but I learnt sooner then he to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their language, and to tattle a
little; which made them consider us
after another manner then they did;
and presently the news run, that there
were two Savages found, who for
want of good nourishment, were less.
<pb facs="tcp:56354:51"/>
then others, and by a defect in their
Parents seed, wanted force in their
fore-leggs to rest their bodies upon
them.</p>
            <p>This belief began to take root, by
spreading it self, without the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the Countreys opposition;
saying, that it were a terrible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
to beleeve, not onely Beasts,
but Monsters were of the same spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
as they: there were more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
(added the less passionate)
that our native Beasts participated
the Priviledges of humanity, and
immortality, by the consequence of
being born in our Countrey, then a
Monstrous Animal, who speaks of
being born I know not where, in
the Moon: and then observe the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
which is betwixt us and
them; we walk upon four paws,
because that God would not trust so
precious a thing, upon a less firm si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation;
and he feared that going
otherwise, there might some ill hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to the man; for which reason
<pb facs="tcp:56354:52"/>
he took the pains for to seat him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
four pillars, that he might not
fall; but disdaining to trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the Fabrick of these two
Bruits, he abandoned them to the
Caprice of Nature; who not fearing
the loss of so small a matter, rested
them upon two leggs.</p>
            <p>The very Birds have not had such
hard measure as they; for at least
they have feathers to balance the
weakness of their leggs, with which
they cast themselves into the Air,
when we chase them; when as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
depriving these two Monsters of
two feet, have rendered them inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of scaping our justice.</p>
            <p>After which, see how their head
is raised towards Heaven; it is the
scarcity that God hath inflicted
them with of all things, which are
so placed; for that supplicant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
shews, that they complain to
Heaven of their Creator, and that
they begg permission to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
themselves after our fashion:
<pb facs="tcp:56354:52"/>
but we have our heads downwards,
to contemplate the blessings we are
masters of, as if there were nothing
in Heaven that we need envy.</p>
            <p>I every day heard such discourses
as these at my lodge; and in fine,
they did so bridle the peoples opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
concerning this Article, that it
was decreed, I should at most but
pass for a Parrat without feathers;
for they confirmed those that were
already perswaded, that like a bird,
I had but two leggs; which was the
reason they put me in a Cage, by
the express order of the Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
            <p>Where every day the Queens
Bird-keeper had the care of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me to whistle, as they doe here
your Stares or Black-birds. Indeed
I was happy in not wanting food:
in the mean time, among the Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
with which my Spectators day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
broke my head, I learnt to speak
as they did: in short, when I had
past the difficulty of expressing my
<pb facs="tcp:56354:53"/>
thoughts, I related fine conceits:
the companies already entertained
themselves with nothing, but the
gentleness of my words; and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
they had of my wit, arrived to
that point, that the Council was
forced to publish an Edict, by which
it was forbidden to beleeve, that I
had any Reason; with an express
commandment to all persons, of
what quality or condition soever,
not to imagine, but that it was by
instinct, whatsoever I did, though
never so rational.</p>
            <p>In the interim, the definition of
what I was, divided the Town in two
parts; that which was of my facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
grew greater and greater every
day: and in fine, in spight of the
<hi>Anathema</hi> wherewith they frighted
the multitude, those that held with
me, demanded an Assembly of State
to end this controversie. They were
a great while about the choice of
who should judge the business. But
the Arbiters pacified their animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:53"/>
by equalling the number of both
interests, who ordained, I should be
brought into the Assembly as, I was:
But I was treated as severely as you
can imagine; my Examiners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other things, questioned me
in Philosophy: I sincerely told
them, what heretofore my Regent
had taught me; but they made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of confuting me with more
powerful reasons: so that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to answer them, I alleadged
the Tenents or Principles of <hi>Aristotle;</hi>
which stood me in no more stead,
then my Sophisms had done: for in
two words, they discovered to me
the falseness of them.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Aristotle,</hi> said they, (whose
Science you so largely boast) did
without doubt accommodate his
Principles to his Philosophy, instead
of accommodating his Philosophy
to his Principles; and at least, he
ought to have proved them more
reasonable then those of other Sects,
which you have mentioned to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56354:54"/>
Wherefore I hope, the good Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
will not be angry, if we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
kiss his hands. In fine, when
they saw that I did nothing but
bawl to them, that they were not
wiser then <hi>Aristotle;</hi> and that I was
forbidden to dispute against any
that denyed his Principles; They
all concluded unanimously, that I
was not a man, but a certain kind of
<hi>Estridge,</hi> being that like to them I
bore my head straight, and that I
marched upon two leggs; and in
short, that but for a little down, I
was in every thing else like to them.
So that the Bird-keeper was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to carry me back to my
Cage; where I past my time plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
enough, because of their
Tongue, which I had perfectly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
the whole Court esteemed it
a great recreation, to make me
prate. The Queens Women, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
others, did always thrust
some bribe into my basket; and the
prettiest of them all, having concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb facs="tcp:56354:54"/>
some kinde of friendship for me,
was so transported with joy, when I
entertained her in private, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the manners and divertisements
of the people of our Countrey, and
principally of our Clocks, and other
instruments of Musick, that she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to me with tears in her eyes,
that if I were ever in a condition of
flying back into our World, she
would willingly follow me. One
morning betimes, having started out
of my sleep, I found her ratling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the sticks of my Cage; Cheer
up your self, said she, for yesterday
they resolved a War against the
King;  and I hope, in the
confusion of their prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
whilst our Monarch and his
Subjects are absent, to find a means
for your escape. How? a War, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
I? Do then any quarrels
happen betwixt the Princes of this
World, as amongst those of Ours?
Pray tell me their manner of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<figure/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56354:55"/>
When the Arbiters (answers she)
chosen by consent of both parties,
have designed the Time accorded
for the levying of their forces, that
of the March, the number of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants,
the day and the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for Battle, &amp; all this with so
much equality, that there is not one
single man more in one Army, then
in the other; the maimed Soldiers of
one side, are all in one Company;
and when they come to joyn, the
Marshals of the field have a care to
expose them to the maim'd of the
other side: The Gyants encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Colosses; Fencers, those that are
expert in their weapons; the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
the couragious; those that are
debilitated, the weak; the indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
the sick; and the robustious
meet those that are strong; and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one happens to strike another
then his design'd enemy, without he
can prove it a mistake, is condemn'd
for a Coward: after the Battle is
ended, they number the wounded,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:55"/>
the dead, and the prisoners; for
there are no fliers: if their loss be
found equal, they draw cuts who
shall be proclaimed victorious.</p>
            <p>But though one Kingdom had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
their Enemy in a lawful war,
yet there is hardly any thing advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
for there be other Armies, less
in number, of Learned and Wise
men, of whose disputations, depends
wholly the Triumph or Servitude of
their States.</p>
            <p>One learned man is opposed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
learned man, and one wit to
another wit; one Judicious man, to
another Judicious Enemy: and in
fine, a Triumph gained in this War,
is reckoned as three victories by open
force. After the Proclamation of
the Victory, the Assembly is broke,
and the Victorious Nation chuse for
their King, either their Enemies,
or their former.</p>
            <p>I could not forbear laughing, at
this scrupulous way of combating;
and I alleadged for an example a
<pb facs="tcp:56354:56"/>
stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Policy, the Customes of our <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans,</hi>
where a Monarch will wave
no occasions to overcome his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
to which she thus answered
me.</p>
            <p>Pray tell me, if your Princes doe
not pretend Right, for their levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Arms: Yes, answered I, and
a great deal of Justice in their cause.
Why then, continued she, don't they
chuse Arbiters unsuspected of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality?
and if they be found to have
as much in the one as the other, let
them remain as they were, or play a
game at <hi>Pickquet,</hi> for the Town or
Province which bred the dispute.</p>
            <p>But why have you so many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
in your way of Fighting?
Is it not sufficient, that the Armies
are composed of equal numbers?
You have not much judgment, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
she. Why, do you really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
if you had overcome your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
hand to hand in the open field,
if you were in a coat of Male, and he
naked; if he had but a Dagger, and
<pb facs="tcp:56354:56"/>
you a Tuck; in fine, if he were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of Arms, and you had both
yours; that he were truly vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
in the mean while, with all the
equality you so much recommend in
your Gladiators, yet they never
fight upon equall terms: for the
one will be a tall, the other a little
man; the one a skillful, the other
may be never handled a sword; the
one robustious, and the other weak:
nay, when all these disproportions
should be equalized, that they were
as skillful, or as strong one as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
may be, yet there would be a
disadvantage on the one side; for, the
one may have more courage then
the other; by which reason this rash
man will not consider the danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he may be Cholerick, that
he may have more blood, and that
he may have a more contracted
heart, with all the qualities which
create courage; as if that, as well as
a sword, were not a weapon his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
wanted. He furiously frights
<pb facs="tcp:56354:57"/>
the opponent, with desperately ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
himself upon him, and takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the life of this poor man, who
foresees the danger, and whose heat is
stifled in flegm, and whose Heart is
too copious to unite the Spirits ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to dissipate that Ice, which is
called Cowardise. And now you
praise this man for having killed his
Enemy advantageously; and prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his rashness, you praise a sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Nature, since such boldness
tends to its destruction: and in order
to what we are talking of, some few
years since, there was a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance
made to the Council of war,
to invent some more circumspect
Conscientions rule for Combates;
and the Philosopher who gave this
advice, spoke in this manner:</p>
            <p>You imagine, Sirs, that you have
equalized the advantages of both
parties, having chose them, both
great, both expert, and both full of
courage; but this is not enough, since
that in the end the Victor must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
<pb facs="tcp:56354:57"/>
by address, by force and
fortune: if it be by address, he
without doubt, struck his Adversary
where he did not expect it, or quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then it was likely; or feigning to
hit him on the one side, struck him
on the other; and in the mean time,
all this is cunning treachery, coze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage;
and cozenage and treachery
are not the compounds of a Gallant
man: if he have Triumphed force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
will you esteem his Enemies
overcome, because he was violated?
No sure, no more then you would
judge that man overcome, who by
the overwhelming of a Mountain,
was made incapable of gaining the
victory; so he was overcome, because
at that time he was not disposed to
resist the violence of his Adversary:
if it be by hazard that he overthrow
him, it is fortune we ought to crown,
he contributed nothing; and in fine,
the vanquished is no more to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
then he that with three <hi>Dice,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56354:58"/>
throwing seventeen, yet lost by their
all running sixes.</p>
            <p>They all confest he was in the
right, but that it was impossible, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to humane appearances, to
remedy it, and that it was better to
submit to a little inconvenience, then
abandon themselves to a hundred
greater importances.</p>
            <p>She did not entertain me this time
any longer, because she was fearful
of being found so early alone with
me: It is not, that impudicity is
there a crime; quite contrary, except
convinced Malefactors, all men have
power over all Women, and in the
same manner, a Woman may sue a
man, who had refused: but she
durst not publickly frequent me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some of the Council had said
in the last Assembly, that it was
chiefly the Women, that publisht
that I was a man, cloaking with that
pretext, the desire they had of prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
themselves to beasts, &amp; shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
<pb facs="tcp:56354:58"/>
with me, to commit sins against
nature; which was the reason that I
was a great while without seeing
her, or any of her sex. In the mean
while some had renewed the doubt of
what I was; for when I thought of
nothing but dying in my Cage, they
came to fetch me once more to give
me audience: I was then interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the presence of a great many
Courtiers, upon some point of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Philosophy; and my Answers,
as I beleeve, did something satisfie
them, for he that did proceed, did
largely expound to me his opinions
concerning the Structure of the
World. They seemed very inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
to me; and if he had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to its Origine, which he held
Eternal, I had beleeved his Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
much more reasonable then
ours. But assoon as I heard him su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
an imagination so contrary to
our faith, I quite broke with him, at
which he onely laught; which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me to say, that since they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb facs="tcp:56354:59"/>
so far, I began to beleeve that
their World was but a Moon; but
say they all, You see Earth, Rivers,
and Seas, and what can all this be? No
matter, said I, <hi>Aristotle</hi> assures us, that
it is but a Moon; and if you had said
the contrary in the Schools where I
was brought up, they would have
hist at you: at which they all burst
into a great laughter; you need not
ask, if it were out of ignorance; but
in the mean time I was conducted
to my Cage.</p>
            <p>But other Wits, more transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then these, who were advertised
that I durst say, the Moon from
whence I came was a World, and
that their World was a Moon; did
beleeve, that this would furnish
them with pretext enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
me to the water; which is
their manner of exterminating peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that are so impious. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they in a body went to make
their complaint to the King, who
promised them justice, and ordered
<pb facs="tcp:56354:59"/>
me to be brought again before the
Court.</p>
            <p>I was then uncaged the third time,
and the most Ancient began to plead
against me: I doe not well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
his Speech, because I was too
much frighted, to receive the notes
of his Voice without disorder; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
because he made use of an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to declame with, which deafn'd
me: it was a trumpet which he had
chosen, because the violence of that
Martial sound, should excite them to
my death, and so to hinder by that
emotion of their Spirits, that reason
should not act her part; as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
in our Armies, where the noise
of the Drums and Trumpets hinders
the Soldiers from reflecting upon
the importance of their lives. When
he had done, I rose up to defend my
cause; but I was delivered by an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
which will surprise you: As I
had just opened my mouth to speak,
a man who with much ado had past
through the crowd of the people,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:60"/>
came and cast himself at the Kings
feet, and rowld himself a great while
upon his back in his presence. This
action did not at all surprise me, for
I knew it was the posture they put
themselves in, when they would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in publick; I onely forgot my
own speech, to listen the more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to his.</p>
            <p>O ye Just, said he, hear me: You
cannot condemn this man, this Ape,
or this Parrot, for saying that the
Moon from whence he comes, is a
World; for if he be a man, though
he be not come from the Moon, since
all men are free, is not he free to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
what he pleaseth? What,
can you constrain him, not to have
Visions as well as you? You may
force him to say, the Moon is no
World, but not to beleeve so: for,
to beleeve a thing, there must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
possibilities present themselves
to ones imagination, more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Yea, then to the Nay; and
except you furnish him with those
<pb facs="tcp:56354:60"/>
likelihoods, or that they unforced
offer themselves to his Reason, he
may tell you, that he beleeves it,
though he never doth.</p>
            <p>Now I will demonstrate to you,
that you ought not to condemn him,
if you place him in the Catalogue
of Beasts; for, suppose him a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without Reason, could you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to any your selves, if you should
condemn him for sinning against it?
He said, that the Moon was a world;
now Beasts onely acting by instinct
of Nature, it is Nature says it, and
not he; and to beleeve that wise Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who hath made the World and
the Moon, should not know what it
is her self; and that you who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
all your knowledge from her,
should more certainly know it, were
very ridiculous. But if your passion
should make you deny your Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
&amp; that you should suppose that
Nature did not onely guide Beasts,
at least blush at inquietudes which
are caused in you, by the capricious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb facs="tcp:56354:61"/>
of a Beast: really, Sirs, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
if you saw a man of ripe yeers
busie himself with the Politick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Pismires,</hi> sometimes in
striking one who had overthrown
his companion; another time in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoning
another, for the theft of a
Barly-corn from his neighbour; then
to arraign another, for quitting her
eggs; you would beleeve him mad,
to trouble himself with matters so
much below him, and to pretend to
reduce to Reason, Animals that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had any: How then will you
defend, most Venerable Assembly,
the interest you take in the caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of this little Animal? Yee
Just, I have said.</p>
            <p>Assoon as he had ended, a certain
Musical applause made the hall ring;
and after all their opinions had for a
quarter of an hour had disputed,
the King pronounced,</p>
            <p>That hereafter I should be censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a man, and as such set at liberty,
and that the punishment of drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:61"/>
should be reduced into an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
forfeit; for in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
there are no honourable ones;
by which forfeit I was obliged to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
publickly, that the Moon was a
World, because of the scandal it
might have caused by the newness of
the opinion in weak Spirits.</p>
            <p>This sentence being pronounced,
they lifted me out of the Palace, and
cloathed me most richly, though
scornfully; they carried me upon the
Tribunal of a sumptuous Chariot, in
which I was drawn by four yoakt
Princes, and they made me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
this in all the publick places
of the town:</p>
            <p>People, I declare to you, that this
Moon is not a Moon, but a World,
and that the World below, is no
World, but a Moon: this is what
the Council thinks fit you should
beleeve. After I had cryed this in
the five great places of the City, I
perceived my Advocate, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
me his hand to lift me down:
<pb facs="tcp:56354:62"/>
I wondred very much to finde him;
when I had well weigh'd him, that
it was my courteous Spirit, we were
an hour in imbracing one another:
Come, come to my house, says he;
for to return to Court after a
shameful sentence, were to make
your self be lookt upon with an ill
eye; and I must tell you, that you
had still remained amongst the
Apes and Monkeys, as the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
doth, if I had not in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
publisht the vigor and force
of your understanding, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in despight of your Enemies, the
Protection of the great Ones for
you.</p>
            <p>The period of my thanks was also
that of our journey, for we were
then entring his doors: he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
me till supper-time, with all
the devices he had used to force my
Enemies, in despight of their most
specious pretexts with which they
had gull'd the people, to desist from
so unjust a prosecution: but when we
<pb facs="tcp:56354:62"/>
were told that they had serv'd in
supper, he advertised me, that he had
invited two Professors of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy
to keep me company: I will
make them fall, said he, upon the
Philosophy which is taught in this
World, by which means you shall
see the Son of our Landlord; it is a
young man, as full of wit, as I ever
met any; he would be a second <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
if he could govern his Lights,
and not bury in vice, the Graces
with which God continually visits
him; for he affects a Libertining,
by a Chimerical ostentation, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the reputation of a Wit: I
took my lodging here, to spy out the
occasion of instructing him; he held
his tongue, to leave me in my Cue,
the liberty of talking: then he made
a sign that they should disrobe me of
my shameful Ornaments, with
which I still glistered; which was no
sooner effected, but the two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
entred, and we went to sit
down where the cloath was spred,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:63"/>
where we found the youth he talkt
of, already at his meal: they saluted
him profoundly, and used him with
an high respect, as a slave useth his
Lord and Master: I demanded the
the cause, of my Spirit; who said, it
was because of his age; because that
in that World, the aged bear all
sort of respect to the young; nay
more, Parents obey'd their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
assoon as by the advice of the
Synod of Philosophers, they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to Reason. You wonder,
said he, at a custome so contrary to
that of your Countrey, but it is not
at all repugnant to Reason; for in
your Conscience, is not a young
man, who is hot in the force of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
of judgment, and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
fitter to govern a Family, then
an infirm bundle of threescore yeers,
besotted, whose imagination is fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
by threescore winters, and who
governs himself but by what you
call Experience of happy successes,
which in the mean while, are but
<pb facs="tcp:56354:63"/>
meer effects of hazard, against all
rules and Oeconomy of humane
Prudence? For judgment there is
also as little, though the People of
your World make an Idol of old
Age. But to disabuse them, they
must know, that what is call'd Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in an old man, is nothing but
a pannical apprehension, and a mad
fear of acting nothing but what they
have already seen done: so that
when he doth not hazard a danger,
where a young man had lost himself,
it is not that he fore-judged the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastrophe,
but that he wanted fire to
warm the noble parts, which make
us dare; whereas the boldness of
that young man was as a pledge of
the efficaciousness of his design, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that order which makes the
promptitude and facility of an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
was that which thrust him
upon that enterprise. For execution,
I should wrong your judgment, if I
went about to convince you with
proofs; you know, youth only is fit
<pb facs="tcp:56354:64"/>
for action; which will enough per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
you to it: Pray tell me, why
doe you respect a couragious man,
but because he can avenge your inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and repel your oppressors? and
is it for any consideration, but meer
habit, that you consider him where
a Battalion of seventy <hi>Ianuaries</hi> hath
frozen his blood, and kill'd with
cold all the noble Enthusiasms that
young men are warmed with? when
you yeeld to the stronger, is it not
because that he should be obliged to
you, when you know you can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
dispute the victory with him?
But why should you submit to him,
when idleness hath melted his mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
debilitated his arteries, evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
his Spirits, and dried the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
in his bones? If you adored a
woman, would it not be because of
her Beauty? But to continue your
adorations when old age had made
her a Phantasm, which represents
nothing but the hideous picture of
Death, were very strange. In fine,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:64"/>
when you love a man of Spirit, it is
because by the vivacity of his Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
he penetrates into a turbulent
business, and straight untangles it;
that he can defray by his good
words the Assembly of the richest
Carat, and that he could digest the
Sciences in one thought: and yet
you would continue your esteem,
when his worm-Organs split his
weak noddle, heavy and inopor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to good company, and when he
rather resembles a Fairy Deity, then
a reasonable man. By which (my
son) you may conclude, it is fitter
young men should manage the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Families then old; and
the rather, because that according to
your Maximes, <hi>Hercules, Achilles, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paminondas,
Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> the
most of which died before fifty years
of age, should have merited no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
being by your account too
young; when their youth was the
onely cause of their admirable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which a more advanced age
<pb facs="tcp:56354:65"/>
would have frustrated, because it
would have wanted ardour and
promptitude, the Authors of such
high Successes. You say true, all
the Laws of our World, loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the respect we owe old Age;
for those that introduced those
Laws, were old men; who justly
feared, that the young men should
depose them from their usurpt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>You owe nothing to your mortal
Architecture but your Body; your
Soul coms from Heaven, and it was
in the power of hazard, to have crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
your father your son, as you now
are his: Nay, how do you know,
but that he hath debarr'd you the
inheritance of a Diadem? May be
your Soul departed Heaven with a
design of inhabiting the <hi>King of the
Romans,</hi> in the belly of the Empress,
where may be to shorten her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
she lodged: No, no, God
would not have blotted you out of
the calculation he made of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:65"/>
though your father had died
a little boy: but who knows if you
had not been the work of some great
Captain, who would have associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
you with his Glory, as well as his
goods? so that you are no more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to your father for the life he
gave you, then you would be to a
Pirate, who should chain you to the
Bank, that he might there feed you:
Nay, I will suppose he had ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
you a Prince of King; a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
loses its merit, when it is not
left in the receivers choice of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it or no; Death was given to
<hi>Caesar</hi> and to <hi>Cassius,</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> was
obliged to the slave of whom he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it; so was not <hi>Caesar</hi> to his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
who forced him to accept that
unwelcome gift. Did your father
consult your will, when he embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
your Mother? Did he ask you
if you had a minde to see this age, or
to wait for another? If you would
be contented to be the son of a sot, or
if you had the ambition to derive
<pb facs="tcp:56354:66"/>
your self from a gallant man? But
alas! you who were most concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the business, were he who was
least consulted. May be then, if
you had been lockt up in any place
but in the Matrix of the Idea's of
Nature, and that your birth had
been in your option, you had said to
the <hi>Parca,</hi> My dear pretty Lady, take
the spindle of another in hand, it is
a great while since I am in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of nothings; and I had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
so a hundred yeers longer, then
to be to day, to repent to morrow.
And yet this you must pass through;
your begging to return to the long
black house from whence you were
hal'd, signified nothing; for they
seemed to understand you cry'd for
the teat.</p>
            <p>These are the reasons, my son, why
fathers bear a respect to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
I know that I have inclined to
the childrens side more then Justice
required, and that in their favour I
have a little spoken against my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
<pb facs="tcp:56354:66"/>
but being willing to correct
that pride with which some Parents
brave their childrens weakness, I
have done as they who vvill straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
a crooked tree, draw it on the other
side, that between two contorsions,
it may affect straightness: so I have
made fathers render to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
vvhat they took from them, by
taking away something that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, that they might another
time be contented with what's their
own. I know that by this Apology
I have choak'd all the old fathers:
but let them remember they vvere
children before they vvere fathers;
and that it is impossible but that I
have spoke extreamly to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
since they were not found
under a Cabbage: But in fine, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
happens, and though my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
should range themselves in
battalia against my friends, it can be
but well for me, for I have obliged
all men, and have disobliged but the
half.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56354:67"/>At these vvords he held his tongue,
and our Landlords son began in this
manner: Permit me, said he, since
by your care I am instructed in the
Original History, Customes, and
Philosophy of the World of this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
man, to add something to what
you said, and that I may prove
that children are not obliged to their
fathers for their Generation, because
that they were obliged in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to get them.</p>
            <p>The most strict Philosophy of
their World confesses, that it is
more advantageous to die, since to die
you must have liv'd, then to have had
no being: then not to give a being
to that Nothing, were worse then
giving death. I am more faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in not peoducing it, then in killing
it if it were produced. Yet, my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
man, thou wouldst beleeve it an
unpardonable parricide to strangle
thy son; really, it would be enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous:
but it is much more execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
not to give a being to what can
<pb facs="tcp:56354:67"/>
receive it. For that child thou depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
of light for ever, would have had
the satisfaction of enjoying it some
while: Nay, and we know that
it is deprived but for some ages;
but those poor forty Nothings of
which thou mayest have made forty
good Souldiers for thy King, thou
maliciously deprivest of life, and
suffer'st them to corrupt in thy reins,
with the hazard of an Apoplexy,
which will be thy death.</p>
            <p>But this did not at all satisfie me;
which I witnessed with three or four
shakes of my head: But our Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
held his tongue, for our supper
was ready to fly away.</p>
            <p>We did then stretch our selves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
soft quilts, covered with great
carpets, and a young serving-man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken the oldest of our Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
did conduct him into a little
parlour apart, from whence my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
begg'd him to come assoon as he
had ended his meal.</p>
            <p>This fancy of eating apart, inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:56354:68"/>
me with the curiosity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the cause he will neither
accept the smell of meat nor herbs,
if they doe not die of themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
them sensible of pain: I do
not so much wonder, said I, that he
abstains from flesh, and all things
that have a sensitive life; for in our
World the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> nay, and
some holy <hi>Anchorites</hi> use this rule:
but for example, not to dare to cut a
Cabbage for fear of hurting it,
seems very ridiculous to me. But I
(answered my Spirit) finde a great
deal of Reason in this opinion.</p>
            <p>For that Cabbage which you
spoke of, had it not as well as you,
an existent being in Nature? And
is she not mother to you both? Nay,
and it seems she hath more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
provided for the vegetable, then
the rational; since she hath remitted
the Generation of a man to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priciousness
of his father, and can
according to his pleasure get him or
not get him; a rigor with which she
<pb facs="tcp:56354:68"/>
hath not treated the Cabbage; for
instead of remitting it to the will of
the father to generate the son, as if
she had more feared the loss of the
Cabbages species, then that of man,
she constrains them, whether they
will or no, to give a being to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and not like men, who do fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastically
generate when the freak
takes them, and who in their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
surpass not the number of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
twenty; whereas each Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage
can produce forty thousand.
And yet we tickle our selves with
the imagination, that nature is more
affected to Mankinde then to this
Cabbage: being incapable of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
she can neither love nor hate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing; but if she were susceptible
of love, she would rather affect this
Cabbage, which you know cannot
offend her, then man, who would
destroy her if he could: to which
you may add, that man cannot be
born guiltless, being a member of
the first Criminal; but we know
<pb facs="tcp:56354:69"/>
that the first Cabbage did not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his Maker. Now if you will
say that we were formed <hi>ad Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
Dei,</hi> which the Cabbage is not;
which grant it be true, we have blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out that likeness in our Souls,
wherein we resemble him; since
there is nothing so contrary to God
as sin. Now if our Soul be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
his Image, we are not more like
him in our hands, feet, mouth, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and ears, then the Cabbage is
in its leaves, flowers, stalk, pith, or
head. Doe not you really beleeve,
that if that poor Plant could speak,
it would say, Man (my dear Brother)
what have I done to thee to merit
death? I onely grow in gardens, nor
am I ever found in desert places,
where I may live in security; I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
all other societies but thine,
and I am scarce in thy garden,
when to shew thee my complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
I blow, I stretch out my arms to
thee, and I offer thee my children in
grace; and for the requital of my
<pb facs="tcp:56354:69"/>
courtesie, thou makest my head to be
cut off: These are the discourses a
Cabbage would hold, if it could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
its meaning. What, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he cannot complain, may we
justly doe him all the wrong he
cannot resist? If I find a miserable
man bound, may I kill him, because
he cannot defend himself? Quite
contrary; his weakness would ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
my cruelty: and though
this poor Creature be disrobed of
all our advantages, yet it deserves
not death; and of all the gifts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it hath but that of increase,
which we cruelly deprive it of; the
sin of massacring a man, is not so
great, because one day he must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive,
as that of cutting a Cabbage,
who can never hope another life:
You annihilate the Cabbage in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of it; and in killing a man, you
doe but change his mansion: Nay,
I'le say more, since God doth equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cherish all his works, and that he
hath equally divided his favours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb facs="tcp:56354:70"/>
us and Plants, we ought to
have an equal esteem for them as our
selves. It is true, we were first born;
but in Gods family there is no birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;
and if the Cabbage share not
with us in the blessing of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
it hath certainly something
else to recompense the shortness of
it being: may be, it is an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Intellect, or a perfect knowledge
of all things in their Causes. For
which cause, the Wise Director of
all things hath not given them Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
like ours, who have but a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
reasoning, weak, and often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful;
But others, more ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
framed, stronger, and more
numerous, which serve for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of their speculative entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
May be, you will ask me,
when they ever communicated to us
any of those high thoughts: But
then tell me, who ever taught us cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Essences, which we admit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
us, with which we have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
or proportion, and whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
<pb facs="tcp:56354:70"/>
we as hardly comprehend, as
the Intelligence; and the manner
that a Cabbage is able to express
himself in, to his like, and not to us,
is, because our senses are too weak
to penetrate so far.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> the greatest of all the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
and who drain'd the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Nature, in Natures very
source, signified this truth, when he
spoke of the tree of Knowledge, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which AEnigma he would teach
us, that Plants did possess the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest
Philosophy. Remember
then, O thou the Proudest of all
Creatures, that though a Cabbage
says nothing, when thou cutst it, yet
he pays it with thinking. But the poor
Vegetable wants Organs to howl
as you would do, or fret, or cry; yet
it hath those by which he complains
of the wrong you do him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
draws the vengeance of Heaven
upon you. If you insist asking me,
How I know that Cabbages have
these fine thoughts? I'll ask you,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:71"/>
How you know, that they have them
not; and that in imitation of you,
one of them doth not say, in closing
himself to his neighbour, <hi>I am,</hi> Mr.
Wrinkled Cabbage, <hi>Your most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
servant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he was in this part of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
the young boy that had led
out our Philosopher, led him in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
Why, how now, supt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
cry'd my Spirit to him: yes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
he; and somewhat the sooner,
because the Physiognomist permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me to take of yours. Our
young Landlord staid not till I askt
him the explication of this Mystery.
I see very well that this manner of
living amazeth you; Know then,
though that in your World they are
more neglectful of their health, yet
is not this rule to be despised.</p>
            <p>In every house there is a Physiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomist
entertained by the Publick,
which is somewhat like that you call
Doctors, but that he governs onely
the healthful, and that he judgeth
<pb facs="tcp:56354:71"/>
by what means he ought to treat us,
either by proportion, figure, Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of our members, by the lines of
the face, tincture of the flesh, the
softness of our skin, the agility of the
body, the sound of the voice, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
force, and lastingness of our
hair: Did not you lately take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of a man of little stature? it was
the Physiognomist of the house, who
gaz'd upon you so; assure your self,
that he diversified the exhalations of
your dinner, according to what he
found in your Complexion. Doe
but consider how different your
Couch is from the rest of ours; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, he judgeth your temper
of much another nature, since he so
much feared the fume of these little
Birds should communicate it self to
your nostrils, or that your fumes
should trouble us; and you shall see
that at night he will chuse your
flowers with as great circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
All this while I made signs to
my young Land-lord, to oblige the
<pb facs="tcp:56354:72"/>
Philosophers to fall upon some
Chapter of the Science they profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
who most friendly, straight of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the occasion: wherefore I
will not trouble you with the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
or Prayers, which were the
Prologues of this Treatise; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the medly of seriousness and
Rallery, were too excellent to be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitated.
But in fine, friendly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the last of the Doctors that came
in, continued in this sort.</p>
            <p>I must now prove, that there are
infinite worlds, in an infinite world:
Represent then to your self the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
like a great Animal, and that
the Stars which are Worlds, are in
that great Animal; as they being
great Animals, serve reciprocally to
other Animals, as we our Horses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And that we in our turns are worlds
to certain creatures, which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
comparison less then us; as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
vermine, lice and little worms,
which may be the ground for more
imperceptible ones; and so that we
<pb facs="tcp:56354:72"/>
each in particular appear a great
World to this little People. May
be, our flesh, our blood and spirits,
are nothing but a conjuncture made
of little Creatures, who there enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
themselves, lend us motion by
their own, and blindly suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be ruled by our will, which
is their Coachman, conduct us our
selves, and altogether produce that
we call life: for, pray tell me, is
it hard to beleeve, that a louse takes
your body for a World, and that
when one of them hath travelled
from one of your ears to the other,
for his companions to say, that he
hath travelled to the two ends of the
World, or that he hath made a
course frome one Pole to the other?
Yes, without doubt, this little peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
take your hair for the forest of
that Countrey; Pores fill'd with
sweat or liquor, for fountains;
Bubes or pimples, for lakes or ponds;
and Aposthumes, for Seas; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions,
for Deluges: when you
<pb facs="tcp:56354:73"/>
comb your self forwards and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
they take it for flowing and
ebbing of the Ocean. Doth not the
itching prove what I say? The
worm that causeth it, is it any thing
else but one of those little Creatures,
that hath deprived it self from all
society, to establish it self a Gyant
in its own Countrey? If you ask
me, Why they are bigger then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
imperceptibles? I must ask you,
Why Elephants are bigger then
we? or <hi>Irish</hi>-man then <hi>Spaniards?</hi>
As for the Blisters or Dander, which
you are ignorant of, they must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
arrive by the corruption of
their Enemies, which these little
Gyants have massacred, or that the
plague hath produced them, by the
want of food for which the sedious
have quarrelled, and have left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the field but mountains of
dead Corps; or that this Tyrant, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
chas'd all about him away, who
with their bodies dam'd up his
pore, hath given our liquid passage,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:73"/>
which being stray'd out of the
Sphere of our circulative blood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
corrupted. May be, I may
be askt, Why one louse or worm
produceth so many more? which is
not hard to conceive; for as one revolt
procures another, so these little peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by the ill example of their sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
companions, do each aspire to
Empire, and kindle every where war,
massacre and hunger. But you will
say, that some people are not so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to itching as others, and yet we
equally possess these little things,
since we say, that it is these that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
our life. It is true, for we may
perceive, that flegmatick people are
less subject to scratching, then the
Cholerick, because that the people
sympathizing with the Climate they
inhabit, are less active in cold bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, then others warmed by the
temper of their Region, who frisk
and stir, and cannot quietly remain
in one place; whence it proceeds,
that the Cholerick man is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
<pb facs="tcp:56354:74"/>
then the phlegmatick, being
animated in more places; and the
Soul being the action of those Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
he is capable of feeling in all
those places where this little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
stirs; whereas the flegmatique
wanting heat, cannot by reason of
his coldness, in many places at once,
give action to those little Creatures;
and thereby is less Universally sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
And to prove more plainly
this Universal worminess, doe but
consider when you are hurt, how
the blood straight flows to the
wounded part; your Doctors say, it
is sent by provident Nature to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
the debilitated parts; which
should make us conclude, that there
is besides the Soul and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
a third intellectual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in us, who enjoys its functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Organs apart. Wherefore
I think it more probable to say; that
those little Animals finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
assaulted, presently send to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
succour of their neighbours; &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:56354:74"/>
being arrived from all parts, and the
countrey being incapable of so much
company, they either die with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or are smothered in the press:
this mortality happens, when the
Aposthume is ripe: for to testifie
that these Creatures are then dead,
the rotten flesh becomes insensible;
and if bleeding often ordained for to
divert the fluxion, doth do any good,
'tis because having lost much by the
orifice which these little Creatures
endeavored to stop, they refuse to
assist their Allies, having but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
wherewithal to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at home.</p>
            <p>Thus he ended; and when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Philosopher saw our eyes fixt
upon his, to exhort him to speak in
his time:</p>
            <p>Men, said he, seeing you are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to teach this little Animal (our
like) something of the Science we
profess, I will now dictate a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
which I shall be willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
unto him, because of the light
<pb facs="tcp:56354:75"/>
it gives to the Intelligence of our
Physick; it is the explication of the
Eternal Origine of the World. But
being much prest in the working of
my bellows, you will pardon the
time, since I'll promise you assoon as
ever it is arrived where it ought
to be, I will largely satisfie you.</p>
            <p>At these words, the son of the
house called his father to know what
a clock it was; who having answered,
that it was past eight, he askt him
in passion, why he had not adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them at seven, as he had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him; and that he knew that the
house removed to morrow, and that
the walls of the Town were so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready:
son, answered he, since you
were at table, there is an express
prohibition published of parting till
the next day after to morrow: no
matter, answered the young man,
you ought blindly to obey, and not
to penetrate into my orders, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to remember what I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you: quick, go and fetch
<pb facs="tcp:56354:75"/>
your picture; which when he had
brought, the young man took it by
the arm, and whipt it a whole quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour together. Thou good
for nothing (he continu'd) for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of your disobedience, I will
make you, serve every one this day for
a laughing-stock; for which effect,
you shall go upon two leggs: the
poor man went forth quite disconso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
and his son excused his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
unto us.</p>
            <p>I had much adoe, though I almost
bit my lips thorow, to forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at so pleasant a punishment;
wherefore to break off this mad Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantism,
which would surely have
made me burst out at last, I beseecht
him to tell me, what he meant by
the voyage of the Town, of which he
had lately spoke; and if the houses
and walls travelled? He answered
me, Amongst our Towns, dear Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
there be Motional and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental;
the Motional ones of that
we are now in, are made as I shall
<pb facs="tcp:56354:76"/>
now tell you: the Architecture as you
see of each Palace upholds it upon
light wood; we make it upon four
wheels: in the thickness of one of the
walls, he puts ten great pair of bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
whose snowts pass by an Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal
line thorow the last story
from one pinacle to the other; so that
when they would remove the Town
to another place (for they change the
Air each season) each one unfolds on
one side of his house large sayls, just
before the pipes of the bellows; then
having bent a spring to make them
play, their houses, in less then eight
dayes, by the continual gusts which
those windy Monsters vomit, are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a hundred leagues: as for those
we call stable, they are almost like
your Towers, except that they are of
wood, and that they are pierced in
the Centre, by a great and strong
Vice, which goes from the top to the
bottom, to mount or dismount them
at pleasure.</p>
            <p>Now the earth is hollowed as
<pb facs="tcp:56354:76"/>
deep as the house is high; and it is
all ordered in this manner, because
that assoon as the frosts begin to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the Earth, they may sink their
houses, where they are sheltered
from the malice of the Air; but as
soon as the sweet breathing of the
Spring begins to soften it again, they
mount into the light by the means of
this great Vice I spoke of. I entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, since he had already had so
much goodness for me, and that the
Town was removed not till after the
morrow, to tell me something of that
Eternal Original of the Worlds of
which he had a little before spoke; &amp;
I promise you, said I, in recompence
thereof, assoon as I shall be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the Moon, from whence my
Governour (pointing to my Spirit)
will tell you I am come, I will sow
your glory, in recounting the rare
things you have told me: I see that
you laugh at that promise, because
you doe not beleeve the Moon I
speak of to be a World, and me an
<pb facs="tcp:56354:77"/>
inhabitant thereof; but I can assure
you, that the people of that World,
who take this for a Moon, will laugh
at me when I shall tell them, that it
is a World, and that there are fields
and Inhabitants. He answered me
with a smile, and thus pursued his
Discourse.</p>
            <p>Since we are constrained, when we
have recourse to the Original of that
Great All, to fall into three or four
absurdities; it will be necessary to
take the way where we shall be least
apt to stumble: I then say, that the
first obstacle that stops us is, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
of the Worlds; and the Wit
of man not being strong enough to
conceive it, and being no abler to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
it, then that great Universe,
so fine, so well ordered, being made
by its self, they have recourse to
Creation. But it is like him that
leaps into the River, for fear of being
vver by the Rain; they save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the arms of a Dwarf, to
fall into the mercy of a Gyant; nay,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:77"/>
they doe not save themselves neither;
for that Eternity which they take
from the World, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend it, they bestow upon
God, as if he had need of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
or as if it were easier to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
it in the one then the other: for,
pray tell me, who did ever imagine
any thing could be made of nothing?
Alas, between nothing and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
there are preparations so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
that the quickest Brain cannot
penetrate into it; therefore to scape
this inexplicable Labyrinth, you
must admit an Eternal matter
with Gods. But you will answer
me, when I have admitted this Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
matter, How did this <hi>Choas</hi>
range it self in this manner? Well,
I will now explicate it unto you.</p>
            <p>My little Animal, you must after
having Mentally divided each little
visible Body into an infinite many
invisible Bodies, imagine that the
infinite Universe is composed of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but these infinite Atoms, most
<pb facs="tcp:56354:78"/>
solid, most incorruptible, and most
pure; of which some are Cubiques,
others Parallelegrams; others Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
others round; others sharp or
pointed; others Pyramidical; others
Exagons, and others Ovals; all which
act diversly according to their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure:
To prove which, put an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory
Bowl very round upon a very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
place, at the least impression you
shall bestow upon it, it will be a
quarter of an hour without lying
still; to which I add, that if it were
as perfectly round, as some of those
Atoms are, and the surface upon
which it is put perfectly even, it
would never rest. If art then can
incline a Body to perpetual Motion;
Why shall not we beleeve. Nature
can do it? it is so of the other Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures;
some whereof, as the square,
require a lasting repose; others, a
motion on one side; others, half mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as trepidations; and the
round, whose being is motion, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in conjunction with the Pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:78"/>
may be makes what we call
Fire, because Fire doth not only act
without repose, but also pierces and
penetrates easily: the Fire moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hath different effects, according
to the overture and qualities of the
Angles, when the round Figure is
joyned; as for example, the Fire of
Pepper, is another thing then the
Fire of Sugar; and that of Sugar,
then that of Cinnamon; that of
Cinnamon, then that of a Clove;
and this last, then that of a Faggot.
Now the fire which is the constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of the parts, and the whole of
the Universe, hath pusht and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into an Oak, the quantity of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
necessary to compose an
Oak.</p>
            <p>But you will say, How can hazard
have gathered together in one place
all things necessary to produce this
Oak? I answer you, that it is not
strange, that matter so disposed
should produce an Oak, but that it
would have been a greater wonder,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:79"/>
if things being so disposed, the Oak
had not been produced; some few
less of certain Figures, it would have
been an Elm, a Poplar, a Willow;
and some fewer then these, it had
been the sensitive Plant, an Oyster, a
Worm, a Fly, a Frog, a Sparrow,
an Ape, a Man. If having flung
three dice upon the table, two of
them happen to be rafle, or all, three,
four, and five; or two, six and one;
would you call this a great Miracle?
to each Die, such chance arrived,
when there were so many others: O
the great Miracle! three Dice that
made a sequence: O the great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle!
there is two sixes, and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the third. I know that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a wise man, you would never
make these examinations; for since
there is but a certain quantity of
numbers upon the Dice, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
but some must happen: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all this, you wonder how this
matter mingled <hi>pell-mell</hi> by the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price
of hazard, can produce a man;
<pb facs="tcp:56354:79"/>
since there is so many things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for his construction. Do you not
then know, that this matter tending
to the forming of man, a million of
times hath been staid? sometimes, in
forming a stone; sometimes, lead;
sometimes, coral; sometimes, a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
sometimes, a Comet; and all
this, either because of more of less
Figures, necessary or unnecessary
for the fabrick of a man: so it is no
wonder amongst an infinite of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that change and are incessantly
stirring, they have lighted upon the
construction of some few Animals,
Vegetables, and Minerals, which
we see no more then if in a hundred
throws with the Dice, we should
throw once in and in. It is also im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that in this agitation nothing
should be formed; and yet this must
be always admired at by some fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical
fellow, who knows not how
little he wanted of being something
else. When the great River <gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap>
turns a Mill, conducts the
<pb facs="tcp:56354:80"/>
of a Clock, and the little River
rowls away, and that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>incognito,</hi> amongst the thick
reeds. <figure/>You will say, that this great
River had Wit, because it met with
things disposed for these fine works;
for, if the Mill had not been placed in
this current, it had never pulverized
the corn; or if it had not likewise met
the Clock, it would hardly have
marked the flowers; and if the little
River had met the same obstacles,
it had without doubt, effected the
same Miracles. Just so it happens
with the fire, which moves of its self;
for having found the Organs fit for
the necessary agitation to reason, it
reasoned; when it onely found them
proper to feel; it onley felt, when
proper to Vegetation, it Vegetated:
to prove which, burst the eyes of a
man, the fire of whose Soul makes
him see, and he will leave seeing, as
our great Clock will leave marking
the flowers, if you confound the
wheels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56354:80"/>In fine, these first and indivisible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
compose a Circle, upon which
without difficulty move the most
cumbersome difficulties of Physick;
nay, the very operation of the senses,
which no body yet could conceive,
I will easily explicate by these little
Bodies; let us begin with our fight,
which as the most incomprehensible,
deserves our first debate; I conceive
it is occasioned when the tunique of
the eyes, whose pores are like glass,
transmit that fiery dust, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
visual Rays, and that it is stopt
by some opaque matter, which casts
them back again; then meeting in
their way the image of what reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cust
them, and that image being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an infinite number of little
bodies, which are continually exhaled
in an equal superficies with the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
beheld, they throng it with them
back to our eye. I know you will
object, that a Glass is an Opaque
Body, very much closed; and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of driving back those other
<pb facs="tcp:56354:81"/>
little Bodies, it suffers it self to be
pierced: But my answer is, that
the pores of the glass is of the same
Figure, as the Atoms of Fire, which
pierce it; &amp; as a wheaten sieve is not
proper to sift oats, nor an oaten one
to sift wheat; so a box of fit, though
very thin, that lets sound penetrate
it, yet admits not the sight to do the
same; and a piece of Cristal that
is transparent to the sight, will admit
no penetration with your finger. I
could not hold interrupting of him;
a great Poet and Philosopher of our
World, said I, hath spoke after <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi>
and he after <hi>Democritus,</hi> almost
like you of these little Bodies; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you doe not much amaze me
with this discourse; &amp; I beseech you,
in untwining of it, tell me, how you
will by these principles explicate the
manner of representing your self in a
glass: that is very easie, replied he; for
imagine to your self that those fires
of your eyes having past through the
Glass, and finding behinde it a Body
<pb facs="tcp:56354:81"/>
not transparent, which rejects them,
they return the same way they came;
and finding those little Bodies tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
in an equal superficies upon
the Glass, they recal them to our
eyes; and our imagination, warmer
then any other of the faculties of our
Soul, attracts the most subtle of
them, wherewith the shapes at home
a picture in little.</p>
            <p>The operation of hearing is not
harder to be conceived: and to be
more succinct, let us consider it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Harmony of a Lute toucht
by a Master of that are: You will ask
me, How it is possible I should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a thing so far off me, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see? Is it that a spongeous matter
goes out of my ears, to inclose that
Musick, and so bring it back? or doth
that Player or Musitian engender an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
of the like species, and another
Lute in little, which like an Eccho,
hath order to recant the same Ayrs
unto me? No: But this Miracle
proceeds, that the string being
<pb facs="tcp:56354:82"/>
drawn, strikes those little Bodies of
the which Ayr is composed, into my
Brain, and these little corporal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
do sweetly pierce it; so that
according as the string is stretcht, the
sound is high, because it strikes the
Atoms the more vigorously; and the
Organ thus penetrated, furnisheth
our fancy with wherewithal to
frame a picture: if too little, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
that our memory, not yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
finished its Image, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to repeat to it the same
sound, to the end that of the Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
which furnished it, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the measures of a <hi>Saraband,</hi> it
may take enough to finish the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of that <hi>Saraband.</hi> But this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
is nothing so marvellous as
the others, by which by the help of
the same Organ, we are sometimes
stirred up to joy, or Choler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is done, when in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
those little Bodies meet with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in us, stirred up in the same
manner, or which are susceptible by
<pb facs="tcp:56354:82"/>
their own Figure of the like emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for then the Newcomers excite
their Landlords to move as they do:
and thus when a violent Air meets
with the Fire of our Blood, it inclines
it to a violent motion, and animates
it to an outward course, which we
call ardor of courage, or of the mind.
If the sound be sweeter, and that it
can raise but a less flame, more sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by conducting it through our
Nerves, Members, and Pores of our
flesh, which causeth that tickling we
stile joy: thus it happens in the ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the other Passions, which
will according as those little Bodies
are flung more or less violently upon
us, according to the motion they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by the rencountre of other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and according as they find mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
matter about us: thus much
for hearing.</p>
            <p>The demonstration of the Touch,
I think is not more difficult; when
we conceive that from all palpable
matters there is a perpetual emission
<pb facs="tcp:56354:83"/>
of those little Bodies; and according
as we touch it, there is more evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
because we press them from
the subject, as water from a spunge:
the hard make the Organ sensible
of their solidity; the supple, of their
softness, the rugged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To prove
which, we cannot but cunningly feel
with hands used, or hardened in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
because of the thickness of the
skin, which being no longer porous,
nor animated, hardly transmits these
Atoms from the matter. May be
some would fain know where the
Organ of Touching resides: for
my part, I beleeve that it is spread
through all the superficies of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
since we feel in each part: yet
imagine that we distinguish quicker,
by how much we feel nearer the
head, which we may experience
when with closed eyes we handle any
thing; for we more easily guess at
it, then if we had felt it with our
hinder-feet; which happens that our
skin being all over sieve-like, in little
<pb facs="tcp:56354:83"/>
holes, our Nerves which are a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
no closer, lose in the way a great
many of those little Atoms, by the
little holes of their contexture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their arrival to the Brain, the
period of their Voyage. Now I
must speak of Smelling, and the
Taste.</p>
            <p>Pray tell me, when I taste a fruit,
is it not because the heat of my
mouth melts it? Confess then, that
being there is salt in a Pear, and that
the dissolution having divided it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
little Bodies of another Figure
then that which composeth the taste
or savour of an Apple, they must
pierce our Palat in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
in the same sort as the wound
made by a Pike, is not like that
which a Bullet suddenly makes me
suffer; and as that Pistol-bullet
makes me suffer another pain
then a slug of steel. Of the Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
I have nothing to say, since
your Philosophers themselves confess,
that it is framed by a continual
<pb facs="tcp:56354:84"/>
emission of little Bodies. But I will
proceed upon this principle, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
the Creation, Harmony, and
Influence of the Coelestial Globes,
with the immovable variety of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors.</p>
            <p>He was going to continue, when
our old Landlord entred, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
us, that it was time to goe
to rest; he brought christals full of
Gloworms, to light the Parlour; but
as these little insect fires lose their
light, when they are not newly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
these being ten days old, did
hardly do us any service. My Spirit
waited not till the company was
accommodated, but went up to his
study, and straight descended with
two bowls of fire, so glistering, that
we all wondered he did not burn his
fingers.</p>
            <p>These incombustible torches (said
he) will better light us, then these
bundles of worms; they are Rays of
the Sun which I have purged of their
heat, otherwise the corasive qualities
<pb facs="tcp:56354:84"/>
of the fire, would have offended
your sight, in dazling your eyes; I
have fixt their light, &amp; have inclosed
it in these transparent Bowls which
I hold: this ought not much to asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
you, for it is no harder for me
which am born in the Sun, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dense
his Beams, which are the dust
of that World, then for you to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together the Atoms of the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verized
earth of this World: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
our Landlord sent a servant to
conduct our Philosopher, because it
was night, with a dozen Globes of
Gloworms hung at their four feet;
for us, that is, my Preceptor and my
self, we lay by the order of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomist;
he put me that night in
a Chamber of Violets, and Lilies,
and I was tickled according to the
custome; and in the morning I saw
my Spirit come in, who said, he
came from the Palace  where
one of the Queens  Maids
of Honour had sent for him, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after me, protesting, that she
<pb facs="tcp:56354:85"/>
still continued in the same design of
keeping her word, that is, she should
willingly follow me where I pleas'd
to carry her into the other World;
which much edified me, when I found
that the chiefest motion was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Christian; so that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
her to aid her in all her designs
with all my power, and for that effect
to invent a Machine, able to hold 2
or 3 persons, into which this day you
may mount. I will seriously apply
my self to this enterprise; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to divert you in the mean time,
here is a Book, which I leave you; I
brought it from my native Country,
and it is intitled, <hi>The State and Empire
of the Sun,</hi> with an addition, Of <hi>the
History of the Spark;</hi> I also give you
this, which I esteem much more; it is
the great work of the Philosophers,
which one of the greatest Wits in
the Sun composed: He proves here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
that all things are true, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
the manner of uniting Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
all contradictories; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:85"/>
that white is black, and black
is white; that one may be, and not
be at the same time; that there may
be a mountain without a valley, and
that nothing is something; and that
all things that are, are not. But
note, that he proves also, unheard-of
Paradoxes, without any Captions,
or Sophistical Reason. When you
are weary of reading, you may walk,
or entertain your self with the son
of the house; his wit is very charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all that I dislike in him is,
that he is a little impious; if he
chance to scandalize you, or by some
Argument to shake your faith, doe
not fail presently to come and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it to me, and I will resolve
your difficulties; whereas another
would bid you break company. But
as he is extreamly vain, I am sure he
will take that flight for a defeat; and
he would beleeve your faith unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
if you should refuse to hear
his. He left me (saying so,) but he
was scarce gone out, when I began
<pb facs="tcp:56354:86"/>
to consider my Books and their box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
that is, their coverings, which
seem'd to me admirable, because of
their richness; the one was cut of a
single Diamond, without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
more lustrous then ours; and the
second seem'd a monstrous Pearl cleft
in two: my Spirit had translated
these books into the Language of that
World; but because I have known of
their Print, I will explicate to you the
fashion of these two Volumes.</p>
            <p>At the opening of the Box, I
found in one of them something of
Metal, almost like our Watches,
full of little springs, and almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible
Machines: 'tis true, it is
a Book, but a Miraculous one, which
hath neither leaves nor letters. In
fine, it is a Book, wherein to learn any
thing, the eyes are altogether unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and the ears are only to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
When any one then hath a mind
to read in it, he winds up with a
great many little Springs this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,
then he turns the needle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:56354:86"/>
the Chapter he intends to peruse;
and straight, as from the mouth of
a man, or some Musical instrument,
there issueth forth distinct and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
sounds, which the men of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
make use of in the Moon for the
expression of their thoughts. When
I have since reflected upon this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
invention, I no longer
wondered, that the young men of
that Countrey were more knowing
at sixteen or eighteen yeers old, then
the gray beards of our Climate; for
knowing how to read as soon as
speak, they are never without Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
in their Chambers, their
walks, the town, or travelling; they
may have in their pockets or at their
girdles, thirty of these Books, where
they need but wind up a spring to
hear a whole Chapter, and so more
if they have a mind to hear the Book
quite through; so that you continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
possess the company of all the
great men, living and dead, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
you with living voices. This
<pb facs="tcp:56354:87"/>
present occupied me about an hour;
and in fine, having hung them like a
pair of pendants, I went a walking;
but I was hardly at the end of the
street, when I met a multitude of
people very melancholy.</p>
            <p>Four of them carried upon their
shoulders a thing like a hearse cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with black; I enquired of one
what that Convoy like a Funeral
pomp of my Country meant; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
me, that that naughty
so named of the people, for a
fall he had justly received upon his
right knee, who being convicted of
envy and ingratitude, was deceas'd
the day before, and that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had condemned him above
twenty years ago to die in his bed,
and to be after his death buried in
the ground. <figure/>  I began to laugh at this
answer; and he asking me why?
why, you amaze me, said I, that
what we count a blessing in our
World, as a long life, a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
death, and an honourable Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:87"/>
should serve in this World for
an exemplary punishment. Why
do you, says this man, take burial
for so precious a thing? Good God!
the meer imagination to have, though
dead, a cloath laid upon ones face,
and upon that a Pike thick of earth,
makes me hardly fetch my breath:
this miserable man whom you
here see carried, besides the infamy
of being cast into a pit, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to be assisted with 150 of his
friends, and an express command
imposed upon them, for loving an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and ungrateful man, to appear
with a sad countenance at his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
and if the Judges had not been
merciful, in imputing part of his
crime to his want of Wit, they had
been ordained to have cry'd: here
we burn all but criminals, which is
really a very reasonable and decent
custome; for we beleeve, that the fire
having separated the pure from the
impure, the heat assembles sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically
the Natural heat which
<pb facs="tcp:56354:88"/>
composed the Soul, and gives it
more force to mount, till arriving
into some Star, the World of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
more material then us, and more
intellectual, because that their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ought to answer and participate
to the pureness of the Globe they
inhabit.</p>
            <p>Neither is this our finest way of
burial; for when one of our Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
arrives to an age wherein he
finds his Wit decay, and the Ice of
his years to chill the motions of his
Soul, he assembles his friends at a
sumptuous Banquet; then having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
the motives which make
him resolve to take leave of Nature,
and the small hopes the hath of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any thing to his great Works;
they either are gracious to him, that
is to say, they permit him to die, or
they severely command him to live.
But when by plurality of voices,
they have left his life at his own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing,
he advertiseth his dearest
friends of the time and place. These
<pb facs="tcp:56354:88"/>
purge and abstain from eating four
and twenty hours, then being come
to the house of the Wise-man, and
having sacrificed to the Sun, they
enter the Chamber of the <hi>Generoso,</hi>
who waits their coming, upon a bed
of State; each one embraceth him;
and when it comes to his turn whom
he most affects, after having tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
embraced, leaning upon him, he
joyns his mouth to his, and with his
right hand sheaths the prepared
dagger in his breast: his friend parts
not his lips from his, till he find him
expired; then drawing the steel from
his bosome, and closing with his
mouth the wound, he swallows his
blood till a second succeed him; then
a third, then a fourth, and so all the
company; and four or five hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they bring each of them a wench
of sixteen or seventeen years old; and
during three or four dayes, whilst
they are tasting the pleasured of love,
they feed upon nothing but the flesh
of the deceased, which they eat raw,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:89"/>
to the end, that if of an hundred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements
any thing be born, they
may be assured that their friend is
revived.</p>
            <p>I interrupted this Discourse, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him that made it, that this
manner of doing had some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
with the fashion of our Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate:
so I continued my walk so
long, that when I came back, dinner
had been ready two hours: they
askt me, why I came so late? It is
not my fault, said I to the Cook that
complained, for I enquired ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times in the streets what a
Clock it was, but they made me no
answer, only opened their mouths,
shut their teeth, and held their faces
awry.</p>
            <p>Why, cry'd out all the company,
Do you not know that by that they
shew'd you what a Clock it was?
'Faith, said I, they might have held
their long Noses in the Sun long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
before I understood them. It
is a commodity, answered they,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:89"/>
which serves them in stead of a
Watch; for of their Teeth they
make so true a Dial, that when they
will instruct any one in the hour of
the day, they open their Lips, and
the shadow of their Noses, like a
<hi>Gnomon,</hi> denotes the questioned mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute.
Now that you may know why
in this Countrey they have all great
Noses, assoon as the woman is
brought to bed, the Matrones carry
immediately the Childe to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Seminary;</hi> and just at the
end of the yeer, those of experience
being assembled, if their noses prove
shorter then a certain measure in
the <hi>Syndick,</hi> he is judged <hi>Camas,</hi> and
put into the hands of some who geld
them. You will ask me the cause of
this barbarousness, and how it coms
to pass, that we who esteem Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
a crime, should ordain forced
continence? But know, that we did
it, after having observed for thirty
ages, that a great Nose denotes a
wise man, courteous, affable, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:90"/>
liberal, and that a little one is
a sign of the contrary; wherefore of
flat noses we make Eunuchs, because
the Republick had rather have no
children, then children like them: he
was yet a speaking, when I saw a
man enter stark naked; I presently
sat down and covered my self to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
him; for those are the marks of
the greatest respects you can testifie
in that Countrey: This Kingdom,
says he, desires before you return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your world, to advertise the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
because that a Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
comes now from promising the
Councel, that if when you are retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
home, you will make a certain
Machine that he'll teach you, he will
attract your Globe, and joyn it to
this; which I promised to perform.
I beseech you (said I to my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
when the other was gone) to
tell me, why this Messenger wore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him the Privy-Parts in brass,
which I had often seen when I was
caged, but never asked what they
<pb facs="tcp:56354:90"/>
were for, because I was always invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
by the Queens women, whom
I feared to offend, if I had in their
presence begun so gross a discourse:
so that he answered me in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
The females here, no more then
the males are ingrateful enough to
blush at the sight of that which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them; and Virgins are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to love the onely thing upon
us, which is the greatest memorial
of nature, prickt thereunto by an
itching zeal: know then, that the
Scarf wherewith this man is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
on which hangeth the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
Member of mankinde, is the
Symbole of a Gentleman, and the
mark to distinguish the Noble from
the ignoble: this Paradox seemed
so extragavant, that I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to laugh. This Custome seems
very extraordinary to me; for in our
World the mark of Gentility is to
wear a Sword. Why, my dear lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
man, said my Host, are the great
ones of your Countrey mad, to make
<pb facs="tcp:56354:91"/>
a Parade of an instrument which
denotes a Butcher, and which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
but for our Ruine, and in fine,
the sworn Enemy of all living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and on the other side, to hide
an instrument without which we
should be in the rank of what is not
the <hi>Prometheus</hi> of each Animal, and
the constant repairer of Natures
feebleness? Unhappy Country!
where the marks of Generation are
ignominious, and those of destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
honourable; and in the mean
mean time you call these members
the shameful parts, as if there were
any thing more glorious, then the
bestowing of life, or more infamous
then the depriving thereof. During
all this Discourse, we still continued
our dinner; which having finisht, we
went into the garden to take the Air;
and there taking an occasion to
speak of Generation and Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he said to me,</p>
            <p>You must know, that the Earth
being converted to a tree, that tree
<pb facs="tcp:56354:91"/>
to a hog, and that hog to a man; we
must beleeve all beings in Nature
tend to the most perfect, and that
they aspire to become man, that Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
being the Period, as the best
mixture, and the best imaginable in
this World; since it is that which
joyns life with Reason, all which
none but a Pedantick Coxcomb will
deny, being we see that a Plum-tree,
by the heat of its germ, as by a
mouth, sucks and digests the sod that
invirons it; that a hog devours the
fruit thereof, and converts it to a
part of himself, and a man eating
this hog, warms again this dead
flesh, joyns it to his own, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
revives the Animal under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
species: so that this man you
see, may be was threescore yeers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe,
a turf in my Garden; which is
the more probable, because that the
<hi>Metempsicous</hi> opinion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
sustained by so many great men, is
likely to have come to our ears, only
to oblige us to search out the truth: as
<pb facs="tcp:56354:92"/>
in effect we have found, that all
things that are, feel, or vegetate; and
that in fine, when all matter is arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to that Period which is its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
it descends and returns to its
inanity, to reach the same parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
I descended very well satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the garden, and I began to
tell my Companion what our young
Master had taught me, when the
Physiognomist arrived to lead us to
supper, and afterwards to rest.</p>
            <p>In the morning assoon as I wak'd,
I went to call up my Antagonist: It
is (said I, in accosting him) as great
a miracle to finde a great Wit like
yours buried in sleep, as to see fire
without action. He smil'd at this
ill Complement: But cry'd he,
(with a Cholerick kinde of love)
Will you never leave these fabulous
terms? Know, that these names de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
the name of a Philosopher; and
as the Wise man sees nothing in the
World but what he conceives, and
judgeth may be conceived, he ought
<pb facs="tcp:56354:92"/>
to abhor all those expressions of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies
and events of Nature, which
stupid puppeys have invented to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the weakness of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            <p>I thought then I was bound in
Conscience to take up the disconrse,
that I might rectifie his opinion.
Though you be, reply'd I, very obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in your Tenents, yet I have
plainly seen things supernatural
come to pass. You say so, continued
he, but you know not that the force
of the imagination is able to cure all
Diseases you entitle by the name of
supernatural; by reason of a certain
natural Balm, containing all the
contrary qualities to each Disease
that molests us, which arrives when
our imagination advertized by pain,
presently seeks out the particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for the ill. For which reason
a learned Physician of your World
counsels the Patient rather to take
an ignorant Doctor that he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
otherwise, then a learned one,
<pb facs="tcp:56354:93"/>
whom he shall beleeve ignorant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he thought that our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
labouring our Cure, if it have
Medicines to help it, may effect its
design; But that the best Remedies
were in vain without the help of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination:
Do you wonder, that
the first men of your World lived so
long without skill in Physick? No:
And what do you think was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that their Nature was yet in its
force, and that Universal Balm not
yet dissipated, by the Drugs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
your Physicians now consume
you? needing as then nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
your health, but strong wishes
to that effect, and imaginations that
you were cured. And so their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
fancies plunging their selves
into that Vital Oyl, did attract the
Elixir; and applying the Active to
the Passive, they found themselves as
well as before, almost in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of an eye; which in despight of
Natures depravation, is seen now a
dayes, though I must confess but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
<pb facs="tcp:56354:93"/>
But the vulgar call it a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
whereof for my part, I believe
nothing; and I ground my self upon
something more, then that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
these Doctors are cozened,
that it is so hard to be done: For I
will ask them, he that is recovered
of a desperate Fever, did heartily
wish, it is likely, in the time of his
sickness, to be cur'd, and may be
made vows to that effect, so that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
he must have died, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sick, or be cured; if he had died,
they would have said that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
had put a period to his pains;
nay, and according to the Deceased
his prayers, they would have said,
he had been cured of all Diseases: if
he had remained infirm, they would
have said, he wanted faith: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is cured, they straight cry,
that it is a visible Miracle. Is it not
likelyer, that fancy, being excited by
the violent desires of health, hath
done its operation? for, yeeld that
he scap'd, why must it be a miracle?
<pb facs="tcp:56354:94"/>
since we see many people who had
made as large vows, die miserably
with all their promises.</p>
            <p>But at least, said I, if what you
say of this Balm be true, it is a sign
of the discussive faculty of the Soul,
since without using the instruments
of our Reason, without relying
on the conjunction of our Will, she
acts of her self, by applying the
Active to the Passive, as if she was
separated from us: then if being
separated from us, she is reasonable,
she must necessarily be spiritual;
and if you confess her spiritual, I
conclude her immortal, since death
happens to the Animal, but by the
change of forms, of which onely
matter is capable. The young man
then gracefully placing himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his bed, and making me sit down,
discours'd after this manner: For
the Souls of Beasts which are corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real,
I do not wonder they die, since
they are composed harmonically of
four qualities, a force or vigour of
<pb facs="tcp:56354:94"/>
blood, and a Proportion of Organs
well converted; but I much wonder
that ours, being intellectual, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, and immortal, should be
forced to dislodge by the same cause,
that makes that of a Beast perish:
Hath he contracted with our bodies,
that when they received a thrust
through the heart, or a Bullet-shot
into their Brains, or through their
bulk, she should then quit her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
house?</p>
            <p>And if this Soul be spiritual and
subsistent of its self, so reasonable
that she is as capable of intelligence
being separated from us, as joyned
to our mass; Why cannot blinde
men, born with all those lively ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of an intellectual Soul, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
what seeing is? As if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not deprived thereof,
by the death of all their Senses; why
then I cannot make use of my right
hand, because I have a left.—.
And in fine, to make a just compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and what will destroy all you
<pb facs="tcp:56354:95"/>
can say; I will content my self to
lay before you the example of a
Painter, who cannot work without
his Pencil; the Soul is the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of Corporeal senses,—.
Yes, but answered he,—.</p>
            <p>But yet they will have it, that the
Soul which can but imperfectly act,
having lost one of her tools in the
course of life, can hereafter act with
perfection, when after our decease
she hath lost them all: yet you will
tell me, that she hath no need of
those instruments to perform her
functions. I'll answer you, that the
Hospital of blinde men ought to be
extirpated for counterfeits. He would
have continued in these impertinent
Arguments, when I closed his mouth
by praying him to leave them off, as
he did, for fear of quarrelling, for he
perceived I began to grow warm;
after which he went away, and left
me admiring the people of that
World, in whom amongst the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
sort so much natural wit is
<pb facs="tcp:56354:95"/>
found, whereas those of ours have so
little, and which costs them so dear.
But at last the love of my Countrey
loosened me from the desire and
thoughts I had of staying there; I
thought upon nothing now but my
departure: but I saw so much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
in it, that I became very
melancholy. Which my Spirit
presently perceived; and having askt
me the reason, why I was not as I
used to be, I freely disclosed the
cause of my ill humor; but he made
me such fair promises of my return,
that I wholly relyed upon him: I
sent word thereof to the Council,
who straight sent for me, and made
me swear, that I would rehearse here
the things I had seeen there: after
which, my Pasports were drawn;
and my Spirit having furnished him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with necessaries for so long a
voyage, askt me in what part of my
Countrey I would land: I answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him, that most of the young
<pb facs="tcp:56354:96"/>
Gentlemen of <hi>Paris,</hi> do once in their
life propose to themselves a voyage
to <hi>Rome,</hi> imagining that after that,
there is nothing worth doing or
seeing; and I begg'd of him that I
might imitate them: but added I,
in what Machine shall we perform
this journey? and what directions
do you think that Mathematician
will give me, who talkt t'other day
of joyning these two worlds toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? As for the Mathematician,
said he, do not trouble your self, it
is a man who promises much, and
doth nothing; and for the Machine
which shall carry you back, it shall
be the same, which brought you to
the Court: how? said I, will the Air
become as solid as the sand, to fasten
your steps? I can hardly beleeve
that. And it is much, said he, that
you beleeve, and that you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;
and pray why should the
Witches of your Countrey, who
march in the Air, and conduct whole
<pb facs="tcp:56354:96"/>
Armies of Hail, Snow, Rain, and
other such stuffe from one Province
to another, have more Power then
we? I beseech you, be a little more
credulous in favour of me. It is
true, said I, that I have received
from you so many favours, as well
as <hi>Socrates</hi> and others, for whom you
had so much friendship, that I ought
to confide in you, as I do in aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
my self to your will with all
my heart. I had no sooner spoke
this word, but a kinde of Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind
rose; and holding me in his
arms, he made me pass without any
incommodity, that great space,
(which our Astronomers speak of,
betwixt us and the Moon) in a day
and a half: which made me know,
that they lyed, who said that a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
would be 360. and so many
yeers a falling from Heaven; since
I was so small a time in falling from
the Globe of the Moon to this. In
fine, at the beginning of the second
<pb facs="tcp:56354:97"/>
day, I perceived I was neer the
Earth, since I already distinguisht
<hi>Europe</hi> from <hi>Africa,</hi> and both from
<hi>Asia;</hi> when I smelt the Brimstone
which proceeded from a very high
Mountain, which so incommodated
me, that I swoon'd: I know not
what happened to me afterwards,
but when I came to my self again, <hi>I</hi>
found my self entangled amongst
some Bryars upon the side of a hill,
in the midst of some shepherds that
spake <hi>Italian: I</hi> knew not what was
become of my Spirit, and <hi>I</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of those shepherds, if they had
not seen him: at which words they
made the sign of the Cross, and lookt
upon me as if <hi>I</hi> had not been my self;
but telling them that <hi>I</hi> was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and desiring of them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
me to some resting place, they
brought me to a Village about a
mile off; where <hi>I</hi> was scarce arrived,
when all the Doggs of the Place,
from the meanest Curs, to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb facs="tcp:56354:97"/>
Mastiffs, flew all upon me; and
had certainly devoured me, if <hi>I</hi>
had not found a house wherein <hi>I</hi>
sheltered my self: but that did not
hinder them to continue their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,
so that the Master of the
house began to look upon me with
an ill eye; and <hi>I</hi> beleeve the scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
those augurious people in such
kind of Accidents have, would have
made this man have abandoned me
to the fury of those cursed Animals,
if <hi>I</hi> had not bethought my self, that
the thing that made them so fierce
after me, was the World from
whence <hi>I</hi> came: for being accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bark at the Moon, they smelt
<hi>I</hi> came from thence, having the
smell about me, as those that come
from Sea, smell of that briny Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
To purge me from that evil
Air, <hi>I</hi> exposed my self upon a Tarras
three or four hours together in the
Sun; after which coming down, and
the Doggs smelling no longer the
<pb facs="tcp:56354:98"/>
dangerous influence which had cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
me their enemy, did no longer
bark at me, but sneakt home quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
The next morning, <hi>I</hi> travelled
for <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>I</hi> saw the Reliques
of the Triumphs of some great men,
past and present; <hi>I</hi> admired the
beautiful ruines, and the rich repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made by the Moderns. <hi>In</hi> fine,
after having staid there fifteen days
in the Company of <hi>Monsieur de Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>
my Cozen, who lent me money for
my return; <hi>I</hi> went to <hi>Civita-Vecchia</hi>
aboard a Gally, which brought me
to <hi>Marseilles.</hi> During all this voyage,
<hi>I</hi> thought upon nothing, but of that
<hi>I</hi> had so lately made. <hi>I</hi> began the
memorials of it then, and have since
my return, put them as much in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as sickness (which made me keep
my bed) would permit me: but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
that they would be the end of
my studies and troubles, to keep my
word with the Council of that
World, <hi>I</hi> did beg of <hi>Monsieur le Bret,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56354:98"/>
my dearest and most inviolable
friend, to put them forth in Print;
with the History of the <hi>Suns Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
and that of the <hi>Spark,</hi> if those
that have stolen them from us, do
render them unto him, as <hi>I</hi> do most
earnestly conjure them to do.</p>
