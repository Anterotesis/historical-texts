            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>This double Apologie I take to be thus rightly meant in theſe two parables, and thereby the deuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and ſlanderous conſequent, of the diffamation of our Sauiours offenſiue, or diſſolute breach of the affirmatiue part of the ſixt and ſeuenth commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, to bee moſt notably and clearely ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.

And theſe againe are of two ſorts: For either they are both warranted and commended, as are the Voluntarie vowes of perpetuall Virginity and widowhead, of Pouertie, of paying all, or part of our goods to poore Chriſt, whether they be proper voluntarie vowes, or ſolemne &amp; publicke volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vowes; or they are permitted onely,<note place="margin">Indifferent actions war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted and commended, but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</note> and tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the booke of God, as lawfull, but no where commended alſo as laudable, as is that beſt kind of Vſurie, where a man doth no otherwiſe deale with his brother, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he himſelf in the like caſe,<note place="margin">Things war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted, and onely permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are in the Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors power</note> would be very willing to be dealt withal. It is in the conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie power of the publicke gouernours of Chriſts Church, either altogether to diſannull and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, or at their diſcretion to reſtraine and correct
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7139:15"/>
the abuſe of this latter, either by ciuill puniſhment in their ciuill gouernement, or by Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſuſpenſion in their Cleargie gouernement. But as touching the former, which are both war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted and commended in the Scripture, it is not in the conſultatorie power of Chriſts Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, either publikely to commande them, or publikely to diſannull and altogether forbid them, whether they be <hi>priuate and proper</hi> voluntarie vowes or ſolemne and publicke voluntarie vowes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall continencie, pouertie, or ſuch like. When thou abſteineſt from ſuch proper or ſolemne vowes (ſaith the only lawgiuer, able to ſaue and deſtroy <hi>Deuter.</hi> 23.22.) it ſhall be no ſinne vnto thee: who then can binde me (<hi>in foro conſcientiae</hi>) either to vow ſingle life, though a thing warranted and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or forbid me to vow it publickly, I ſay, either to commaunde theſe commended holy Voluntarie vowes, or to diſannull, and altogether forbid them, is not in the power of any publicke gouernours whatſoeuer. Onely it is in their power to reſtraine and correct the abuſes of them, if either the Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie doe vow that raſhly, which is not likely to be in his power and abilitie to performe, or doe vowe that wickedly, or to a wicked, vngodly, ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous end, which he ought not to performe.

Theſe againe are of two ſorts. For either they are by ſuch Conſultatorie commaundement, commaunded onely vnto pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men; or they are alſo commaunded both to priuate men and to publicke officers. Of the former ſort is Continencie, commaunded vnto them who haue the gift thereof, in that conſultatorie priuate precept <hi>Math.</hi> 19.12. <hi>He that can receiue it, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it.</hi> Of the ſame ſort is the renouncing of all wordly buſines to follow the ſtudie of Chriſts hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Doctrine, commaunded vnto them, vnto whom it is expedient, by that Conſultatorie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>Math.</hi> 19.21. <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, Goe ſell thy goods, and giue them to the poore, and come follow mee.</hi> But of the latter ſort is Decencie of apparell, and a diſcreete conſtitution of Church-orders, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in generall by that Conſultatorie precept, <gap reason="foreign">

For although thoſe indifferent duties, which are commaunded to priuate men, onely by Conſultatorie priuate commaund, be to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by priuate men, ſo onely as the ſpirit of God in them ſhall exact, (as it did of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>) their Conſultatorie obedience in the exact performance of them: yet thoſe indifferent duties, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded alſo to publicke Officers, by the ſpeciall Conſultatorie publicke commaunde of Chriſt, the moſt louing Bridegroome of his Church: theſe in different duties, I ſay, of this ſo ſpeciall Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7139:17"/>
publicke commaunde, cannot without neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of dutie vnto Chriſt their Lord and maiſter, the only lawgiuer, able to ſaue and deſtroy, be either intermitted vpon an humour, or omitted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulled altogether by the publicke gouernours of Chriſts Church. The neglect of theſe Church faſts then, in any Church whatſoeuer is a token of ſome want of that feeling, which the Church as a true lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wife ſhould haue of the bodily abſence of her louing husband: according to the ſpeach of our Sauiour in this my Text: But the daies will come when the Bridegroome ſhall be taken from them, and then ſhall they Faſt. Surely as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 7.6. The heart of Fooles, (who laugh in the face as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12.) is in the houſe of mirth, but the heart of wiſemen, who laugh in the heart, &amp; are ſoberly and truely wiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſaluation, is alwaies in the houſe of mourning, that is (as our Sauiour heere in my Text doth <gap reason="foreign">

And thus I haue aſſoiled the former doubt, which might worthely ariſe, touching the gouernours of the Church, their abſolute omiſsion and repealing of all Church faſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To the other doubt thus much I ſpeake briefely, that though the Faſt be Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke,<note place="margin">No faſting, no mourning.</note> as is the Faſt before the Communion, and all

If it be found ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through the ſuperſtition of this doting old world, or through any other enormitie, wherewith Sathan and mans corruption doth often ſtaine and defile the beſt exerciſes of godlines, to be any whit preiudiciall to thoſe holy duties of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, which are commanded by abſolute precept; then the practiſe of the beſt particular Churches, and euen of ſome Dioceſan Biſhops, haue taught vs, that our righter way to obey the <hi>Oecumenicall counſell</hi> is to obey rather the meaning then the bare and dead letter of their decree. I confeſſe that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith wiſely and well, ſpeaking of theſe Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall cuſtomes of faſting, decreed by the Plenary counſel of the whole church; <hi>Si quid horu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tota peror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem frequentat Eccleſia, hoc quin ita faciendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſit deſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, inſolentiſsimae inſaniae eſt. If any of theſe things be vſed by the cuſtome of the whole Church, for a man to hold that ſuch a thing ought not, or may indifferently not be done, it is a part and a tricke of moſt ſiely fondneſſe and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> But he giueth this reaſon intimated both in his words following, and in his words before going,

where he had ſet downe his formall difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene particular Church cuſtomes, and betwixt Vniuerſall Church cuſtomes to be the cauſe of this his ſpeeach, for that the Vniuerſall Church neuer decreeth any thing, that is <hi>Contra fidem &amp; bonos mores,</hi> againſt the Faith and good maners, but the particular Churches may be ſuppoſed to decree ſome new cuſtomes both <hi>Contra fidem &amp; bonos mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi> Out of which reaſon we may plainely ſee, how Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> did vnderſtand the decrees of Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall counſels, and the minde of all Churches, when they chanced to haue the ſame cuſtome in the vſe of an indifferent duty amongſt them all, Namely, that the intention, and minde, and meaning of the Vniuerſall Church is this to keepe or to decree no cuſtome, that is, <hi>Contra fidem &amp; bonos mores:</hi> yet that his meaning is not; neither was it the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke meaning of the whole Church, that the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomarie vſe of any indifferent thing, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by abſolute precept, ſhould therefore neuer be altered, becauſe it was once decreed by ſo Vniuerſall a decree and conſent of all Churches.<note place="margin">The Catholick Conſtitutions are to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, ſo long as they are commanded.

                  </p>
                  <p>Though indeed, whileſt ſuch indifferent matters are in vigour and force, and are commanded by the Church, he is worthily to be eſteemed <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus ſchiſmate charitatis</hi> in the higheſt degree, who doth not obediently yeeld vnto them; &amp; alſo <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticus ſchiſmate fidei,</hi> if he diſpute againſt the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church, in giuing out ſuch conſtitutions: yet no ſuch indifferent matters of Catholick conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
