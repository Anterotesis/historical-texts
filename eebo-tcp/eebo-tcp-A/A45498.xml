            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96584:4"/>This Meeting alſo taking tender Notice of the Requeſt of our Friends and Brethren of the 6 weeks Meeting in <hi>London,</hi> for this Meeting to be concerned, in order to hear and end the ſaid dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, which they had in part heard before, but had not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunity to hear fully: It was thereupon, in Brotherly Love, aſſented unto by this Meeting, that as many Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the ſix Weeks Meeting as were formerly deputed by the ſix Weeks Meeting; and all other Members of the ſame Meeting that ſhould deſire it, might be preſent and Aſſiſtant with this Meeting, for the good ends aforeſaid. And this Meeting agreed, that after all the other publick affairs ſhould be over, as many Members of the yearly Meeting as could attend the ſervice, together with all publick faithful Friends that are free, ſhould Remain and continue the yearly Meeting, to hear, judge and determine, and endeavour to Quiet all the differences between <hi>Geo. Keith</hi> and others concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein.</p>
            <p>Proceedings thus far agreed to by this Meeting, in order to a full hearing of <hi>Geo. Keith</hi> and others concerned in the ſaid differences, much of ſix days were ſpent, impatiently hearing the ſaid differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo far as they were related, or made out unto us, both by the publick Reading of ſeveral Printed Books and Papers from <hi>G. K.</hi> and his Friends, relating to the differences, particularly one book, intituled, <hi>A True Copy of Three Judgments,</hi> &amp;c. another, intituled, <hi>The Plea of the Innocent,</hi> &amp;c. another, intituled, <hi>Some Reaſons and Cauſes of the late Separation,</hi> And alſo by <hi>Epistles, Papers</hi> and <hi>Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates</hi> (from many concerned on both ſides) out of <hi>America,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the great Patience of this Meeting towards him, in frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hearing him in his <hi>Defence</hi> and <hi>Complaints, Allegations</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi>; as alſo in divers paſſages both by <hi>G.

K.</hi> divers times acknowledged <hi>the Moderation of the Meeting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The foregoing Cauſes and Reaſons, <hi>How this Meeting came to be concerned in this Weighty Affair, together with the manner of Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, thus far being ſincerely related, we proceed likewiſe to give the true Sence, and Chriſtian Advice of this Meeting thereupon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96584:5"/>Concerning the Printed Books from <hi>G. K.</hi> and others of his Friends, relating to thoſe Differences and Diviſions in ſome parts of <hi>America,</hi> it being propoſed to this Meeting, <hi>That Friends concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might ſingly declare their Sence</hi>; which they had liberty freely to do in the Fear of the Lord, whoſe Power was over the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thereupon many Weighty Teſtimonies were given in great Fear and Tenderneſs of Spirit, <hi>That the expoſing the Differences in Print to the World, to the View of our Enemies, both in</hi> America <hi>and</hi> Europe, <hi>hath been of great diſ-ſervice to the Truth, and given great occaſion of Offence and ſtumbling to many, and of great Sorrow and Grief to us, and many Faithful Friends, opening the Mouths of our Adverſaries, Profeſſors and others, to reproach the Truth and Friends thereof.</hi> And it's the clear and general Senſe of this Meeting, That <hi>G. Keith,</hi> and the reſt therein concerned with him, were not acted in God's Wiſdom and Counſel therein, and that they ought to have had more regard to God's Glory, and the <hi>Reputation of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Society and Profeſſion.</hi> And altho it appears that ſome few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have given <hi>Offence,</hi> either through <hi>Erroneous Doctrines, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Expreſſions,</hi> or <hi>Weakneſs, Forwardneſs, Want of Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Right <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding</hi>; yet the ſpreading thereof in Print, and in that aggravating <hi>manner</hi> as they are, and ſending them over into <hi>England,</hi> and other parts of the World (unconcerned in the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi>) appears not to be in God's Peaceable Wiſdom, nor conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the good Order of Truth among us, ſince we were <hi>a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And therefore it is the <hi>tender Advice</hi> and <hi>Counſel,</hi> That <hi>G. Keith</hi> ſhould either call in theſe Books, or at leaſt publiſh ſomething In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently, and <hi>effectually to clear the Body of the People</hi> called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and <hi>their Miniſters,</hi> from thoſe Groſs Errors charged on ſome few in <hi>America</hi>; and retract the bitter Language in them, ſo far as he is concerned, which ſeems to have too much appeared in ſome few particular perſons on <hi>both ſides,</hi> thereby giving occaſion to Truth's Adverſaries to aſperſe us, and to look upon <hi>the Quakers rendering Reviling for Reviling</hi> one againſt another; which is of an ill ſavour, and to be remov'd by God's Power and Truth, and the Root and Spirit thereof, in whomſoever it is.</p>
            <p>And as to the Separation among Friends in <hi>America,</hi> ariſing from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96584:5"/>
the unhappy <hi>differences,</hi> and the dividing ſome Meetings there; It hath been, and is to the great reproach of Truth and Friends, and diſhonour of our holy Profeſſions, and hinderance of Truth's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and the great Grief and Trouble of Faithful Friends, both in <hi>England</hi> and other parts of the World. And how far ſoever <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath been concerned therein (which the general Senſe of Friends here is, doth lye at his door;) He ought now ſincerely to uſe his utmoſt Endeavours, and Intereſt with his Friends concern'd, to <hi>remove it,</hi> and to help forward a Re-uniting and Amicable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure for the holy Truth's ſake, and the Clory of God, and Peace of his People.</p>
            <p>And wherein <hi>G. Keith</hi> apprehends himſelf injured, or aggreived by any particular perſons, he ought to exerciſe a Spirit of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as he would for Chriſt's ſake be forgiven of God and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, accordingly as he himſelf has ſometimes openly declar'd. And we deſired the ſame in all others concerned towards him, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>perſonal Injuries or Offences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as concerning thoſe few late Magiſtrates (profeſſing the Truth) concerned againſt <hi>G. Keith,</hi> in their <hi>Seſſions-Proceedings,</hi> and <hi>Order of Seſſions</hi> publiſhed againſt him, and in their fining him, and ſome few others (profeſſing the Truth) about words of <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> or ſuch like; It is the Senſe of Friends, That <hi>G. Keith,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with him, had been, and were under an <hi>hour of Temptation and Provocation</hi>; And thoſe Magiſtrates concerned, did too much let in the <hi>Provocation over them,</hi> and did too highly reſent <hi>Reflection</hi>; and it had been better they had not medled with it, but quietly have born it, and paſſed it by; and had they kept in the Wiſdom of God, theſe things might have been prevented. There appears to us to have been too much height of Spirit on <hi>both ſides,</hi> and <hi>both</hi> had need to be deeply humbled, both <hi>Provokers and Provoked.</hi> Tho the Legality, or Illegality of the Proceedings, according to Men, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not proper for this Meeting to meddle with, howbeit the Book of the Printed Trial of the Proceeding, where <hi>Quakers</hi> are repreſented to perſecute <hi>Quakers,</hi> has done great hurt in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and other parts, and occaſioned great Reproach upon the ſaid People in this Nation, whereby many of our Enemies inſult over
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96584:6"/>
us, as if we were a People ſwayed by a perſecuting Spirit, ſaying, <hi>We knew what the Quakers would do if they had power in their hands.</hi> And therefore Friends ought to be cleared from that Reproach; howbeit the ſaid Book appearing ſcandalous in divers parts of it, Inquiry was made in this Meeting, who was the Author and Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it; and <hi>G. Keith</hi> diſowned it to be his; but he owned that part of it which concerned his Trial, and <hi>T. Budd</hi> ſaid, <hi>he was not willing to diſcover the Author's Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore our Senſe is, <hi>That the Publiſhers of that Book (if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Truth) ſhould call it in, and condemn its publication, and ſending it over hither, to our great Reproach, and Injury of the Truth and people of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We underſtand from divers Epiſtles and Teſtimonies from many of our Friends in <hi>America,</hi> correſponding with us in Brotherly Love, That they appear to be in a Spirit of Love, and of a ſound Mind and Judgment in the things of God, in the Faith of Chriſt, and principle Doctrines of Chriſtianity; and particularly, beſides other Epiſtles, we obſerve one bearing date the 17<hi>th</hi> of Month 4. 1692. ſigned with near 30 Names, from a Meeting of Miniſtring Friends, wherein they do appear ſincerely to believe and confeſs their Faith in Chriſt, according to the Scriptures, both as to his Conception, Birth, Life, Sufferings, Miracles, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and Interceſſion, and that all he did and ſuffered, was to compleat our Redemption; and that they expected Salvation by no other Name than by the Name of Jeſus, to which every knee ſhall bow, and Tongue confeſs; and that of the Reſurrection and General Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they believe them according as they are declared in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus far they. Nevertheleſs, if there be any ſuch Groſs Errors, Falſe Doctrines, or Miſtakes, held by any profeſſing Truth in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> as are either againſt the Validity of Chriſts Sufferings, Blood, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, or Glory in the Heavens, according as they are ſet forth in the Scriptures, or any ways tending to the denial of the Heavenly Man Chriſt; ſuch perſons ought to be diligently inſtructed and admoniſhed by Faithful Friends in thoſe parts, and not be expoſed by any to publick Reproach; and where the Error proceeds from Ignorance, and darkneſs of their Underſtanding, they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96584:6"/>
ought the more meekly and gently to be informed But if any ſhall wilfully perſiſt in Error, in point of Faith, after duly informed, then ſuch to be further dealt with according to Goſpel Order, that the Truth, Church and Body of Chriſt may not ſuffer by any particular pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Member, that is ſo corrupt.</p>
            <p>It was very obſervable in this our ſolemn Meeting, that <hi>G. Keith,</hi> in order to remove ſome ſcruples, that might be in the Minds of ſome concerning his belief, or Doctrine about the Sufficiency of the Light within, did voluntarily Declare in theſe words, <hi>viz. I know no man upon the face of the Earth, that profeſſes a Belief of the Sufficiency of the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to Salvation, more than I profeſs or hold, and have always profeſſed ſince I came among Friends,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Light within, being God, the Word and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in every Man, is ſufficient to Reveal to every Man all that is needful to his Eternal Salvation</hi>: Which Confeſſion did appear to have a tendency to the Satisfaction of the Meeting in that reſpect; and it is earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and tenderly adviſed by this Meeting, that <hi>G. Keith</hi> have a tender regard to our Antient Teſtimony, for the Sufficiency of the Light, the Word of Faith, the Immortal Seed and Spirit of Truth within, and to the plainneſs and ſimplicity of the Preaching of it from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whereby many have been turned to God; which Teſtimony and Miniſtration the Lord hath ſignally bleſſed and proſpered by his power and preſence, for the Gathering, confirming and Building up of many thouſands of his People, in the moſt holy faith; Whereof there are many Living Witneſſes yet Remaining.</p>
            <p>Alſo this Meeting, in true and tender Love, for Chriſt's ſake, deſire and admoniſh the ſaid <hi>Geo. Keith</hi> (and even for the peace of his own ſoul) to watch againſt his Human Infirmity, and Weakneſs appearing therein, and againſt ſuch paſſionate Behaviour, as thence appeared di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times in this Meeting, to the trouble and Grief of many Antient and faithful Friends; and humbly to Wait upon God, to feel his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to ſubdue his own Paſſions, and to be very Watchful againſt the ſame, and againſt the Enemy that takes Advantage thereupon to hurt him, or at any time to hurry him into diſorder of Spirit at unawares; which we pray God make him truly ſenſible of, and watchful againſt, for his own Inward peace, and for Good Example and behaviour in the Church of Chriſt. Howbeit, we do declare, that the ſaid <hi>Geo. Keith</hi> did divers times openly acknowledge his Paſſions, Weakneſſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; ſo that this Meeting did the more Exerciſe Compaſſion, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Patience towards him.</p>
            <p>And this Meetings tender Advice to <hi>G. Keith</hi> alſo is, to live in Peace and Charity among Friends and Brethren here in this City, Nation,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96584:7"/>
and elſe where, and to avoid all publick and apparent Reflections upon Miniſtring Friends, or their Miniſtry; and likewiſe all Miniſtring Friends to forbear the like towards him, that no occaſion of ſtumbling or Reproach may be given thereby, nor any Brother Hurt in his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. And as <hi>G. Keith</hi> ſhall apptove himſelf in Charity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with Friends and Brethren here in <hi>London</hi> and elſewhere, they are deſired accordingly to be tender and kind to him, as he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely approves himſelf to be a Man of Peace and Charity towards all, and Anſwers our Chriſtian Advice herein.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, This our Solemn Meeting, in the Name and Power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, doth Exhort and Charge all them that have ſeparated, to meet together with other Friends, in the Love of God, and humbly to wait for his Power to Repair the Breach, Reconcile and Reunite them in his tender Love, and earneſtly Supplicates the God of all our Mercies, to remove all Prejudice and Offences out of their Minds, and to Effect this good End, which our Souls have deeply, and in great Humility and Brokenneſs of Heart, Travelled for in this Meeting, and are ſtill in a Travel for, that the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach may be removed, Gods Truth Exalted, and his Churches Peace Reſtored and preſerved.</p>
            <p>And if any man think himſelf a Prophet, or Spiritual, let him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, we have the Mind of Chriſt in theſe Matters, to whom we Recommend you, and in whoſe Love we Salute you all.</p>
            <p>The God of Peace be with you, and bruiſe <hi>Satan</hi> under your Feet.</p>

grieved and troubled, under a ſence of the Reproaches the Truth has met withal, by reaſon of the ſaid unhappy Difference, yet having not concerned our ſelves actually in the ſaid Difference on either ſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met at the ſaid Meeting-Houſe, with true Deſires to the Lord, that he would make us inſtrumental to put an end to the ſaid Difference, and truly make up the ſaid Breach, before it grow wider, according to the Requeſt of the ſaid <hi>George Keith,</hi> and the reſt of the Friends joyned with him in their ſaid Appeal: And the ſaid <hi>Thomas Lloyd,</hi> and the reſt concerned, (though again deſired, by two Meſſengers from the Meeting, to appear, and they) refuſing the Meeting, adjourned till an hour after the Publick Meeting the next day; and then being aſſembled, and the ſaid <hi>Thomas Lloyd,</hi> and the reſt concerned ſtill refuſing to come (although the ſaid <hi>Thomas Lloyd,</hi> had lately before adviſed the ſaid <hi>George Keith,</hi> to make Application to the Yearly Meeting in this Caſe, (as Divers of us can witneſs) and the ſaid <hi>George Keith,</hi> and the reſt concerned, laying their Complaint before us, and the ſaid <hi>Thomas Lloyd,</hi> and the reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, not appearing, (though again deſired ſeveral times) our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations and Deſires, (with reſpect to that effectual and abſolute heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid Breach) is in ſome meaſure fruſtrated. Notwithſtanding whereof, having heard the Papers on both ſides read, and having weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and deliberately conſidered them, do give it as our Sence and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That the ſaid <hi>George Keith,</hi> and his Friends concerned in the ſaid Paper of Condemnation, are not guilty of the Charges and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures therein contained; and that therefore, for the Honour, Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Welfare of Truth, and Peace and Quietneſs of the Churches of Chriſt in theſe Parts, and elſewhere, the ſaid <hi>Thomas Lloyd,</hi> and the reſt of the ſaid Twenty eight Perſons, forthwith Re-call their ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Condemnation, and that they condemn the ſame by a Writing under their Hands, directed to all the Monthly and Quarterly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whereunto the ſaid Paper was directed; And that they forbear offering to ſpeak, by way of publick Teſtimony in Meetings, till they have ſo done. And we do alſo give it as our Judgment, That thoſe Publick Friends who are charged with Miſdemeanours, and Ill Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in their Lives and Converſations, do forbear ſpeaking in Publick Meetings by way of Teſtimony, till they clear themſelves, and make Satisfaction to their Brethren: And that all Publick Friends on both ſides, forbear all Railing and Reviling one another, either publickly or privately, which hath only this tendency, to diſhonour Truth, and lay Stumbling-blocks in the Way of the Weak; but that in ſuch Caſe they obſerve the Primitive Churches Order, eſtabliſhed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and practiſed among Friends.</p>
