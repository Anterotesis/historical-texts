         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

pronounced confidently
before the mightie king <hi>Darius;
viz. Magna est veritas, &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualet;</hi>)
is this day verified (God
be blessed for it,) euen in the publike writings of
the Iesuites, against the secular priests, their owne
deare Popish brethren. And reciprocally of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
priestes against the Iesuites, their religious
fathers and holy fryers. The deepe and serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
whereof, hath possessed mine heart with
such vnspeakable solace, as I can not easily with
penne and ynke expresse the same. Such is the force
of truth, (my good Lord,) that it hath enforced
the professed enemies of truth, (a thing verie rare
and to be admired,) to testifie the truth against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and to publish the same in printed books, to
the view of the whole world. God (say the popish
priests) hath most straungely,<note place="margin">Quodl 8. art. 9. Page. 267.</note> and in verie deed (as it
may be termed,) miraculously, reuealed the truth,
<pb facs="tcp:1553:3"/>
which long hath beene hidden. Thus them selues write
of themselues. Hence proceedeth that rare conceiued
ioy,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. vers. 15.</note> which hath enuironed me on euerie side. And
which (I am well assured,) cannot but bring great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
to your Lordship, and to all true hearted En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
subiects. For as the Apostle saith: <hi>Some preach
Christ through enuie and strife; and some of good will.</hi>
The one sort preacheth Christ of contention, and
not purely: but the others preach him of loue. What
then? yet Christ is preached all manner waies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be vnder pretence, or syncerely; and I therein
ioy, yea, and will ioy. Thus wrteth the chosen vessell,
of our Lord Iesus. The Iesuites puffed vp with enuie
and malice against the secular priests, doe vnwittingly
and vnwillingly bolt out many important truthes; not
onely against themselues, and to their owne great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice;
but also to the euerlasting scandall, and vtter
ruine, of theit patched hotch-potch late Romish reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
The Secular priests turmoyled with the vniust
vexations of the cruell Iesuites, seeke by all aswell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
as direct meanes, to redeeeme their iniust mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations,
and to defend themselues from their villanous
and diabolicall dealing. The while they are thus bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied;
they cannot inuent or deuise, how to find out any
end of their miseries; but by laying open to the world,
the badde and irreligious conuersation of the Iesuites;
and by imputing to them those disloyall treacheries,
and most bloodie complots, wherewith their owne
hearts and hands had sometime beene imbrewed. And
consequently, while they are encombred to disgrace
and gall the malepeart and trayterous Iesuites; they
doe vnawares grieuously wound themselues, euen with
their owne chosen weapons. They freely grant, and
<pb facs="tcp:1553:3"/>
can it not denie; that all papists were kindly dealt
withall, vntill such time as themselues gaue iust cause,
by their disloyall plots and bloudie practises against
her Maiestie,<note place="margin">See quodl. 7. art. 8. page. 199.</note> of greater restraint and sharper procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
against them. For first, they grant, that the Earles
of Northu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>berland &amp; Westmerla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d with their adhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts,
were rebels, &amp; their insurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> flat treaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>; that the pope
ioyned with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>; that he exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municated her Maiestie;
that he assoyled her subiects from their allegeance to
her; that he sent two popish priests, <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>VVebbe,</hi>
(my selfe knew them both right well,) to bring the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
into England,<note place="margin">The Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke.</note> which they effected
accordingly; that the Pope assigned the Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,
to be the head of the rebellion; that he gaue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to <hi>Ridolphi</hi> the Florentine, to take 150000<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> crownes
to set forwarde the saide rebellion. That the
King of Spaine at the Popes instance,<note place="margin">The duke of Alua.</note> determined to
send the Duke of Alua into England, that with all his
forces he might assist the Duke of Norfolke. Secondly,
they grant that the pope plotted with <hi>Stuckeley, Fitzmo.
rize,</hi> and others both English, Irish, and Italian, (my
selfe was euen then in Rome,) for enterprise by force in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Ireland,<note place="margin">ann. 1578.</note> vnder pretence of religion; to further which
cruell attempt,<note place="margin">ann. 1579.</note> 
               <hi>Sanders</hi> did afterward thrust himselfe
personally into the like action. Thirdly, they confesse,
that <hi>Parsons, Campian, Sherwin,</hi> and others, were sent
disloyally into this land from pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. (my
selfe was then in Rome,) and that <hi>Parsons</hi> presently vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their arriuall,<note place="margin">ann. 1580.</note> fell to his trayterous Iesuiticall cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and bestirred himselfe with tooth and naile,<note place="margin">1581.</note> how he
might set her maiesties crowne vpon an others heade.
Fourthly, they confesse, that the Iesuite <hi>Heywood</hi> was
sent into Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d from the Pope, &amp; that he tooke vpon
<pb facs="tcp:1553:4"/>
him to call a synode, and to abrogate auncient cust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes,
to the great scandall of many. Fiftly, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that the Pope plotted with the King of Spaine, for
the assistance of the Duke of Guise,<note place="margin">1583.</note> to enter vpon the
sodaine, and to aduance the Queene of Scotland to the
crowne of England. For the better effecting whereof,
<hi>Mendoza</hi> a Iesuite (as they write,) then ledger in this
land for the king of Spaine,<note place="margin">The Iesuits sludie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but treason.</note> set on worke Frances <hi>Thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cmorton,</hi>
and many others. They adde there vnto, that
about the same time <hi>Arden, and Somervile</hi> had conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
how they might lay violent hands vpon her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
sacred person. Sixtly, they write, that about the
same time <hi>Parrie</hi> was also plotting with the Iesuites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the sea, how he might haue effected the like villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
Seuenthly,<note place="margin">1586.</note> they confesse freely, that the earle of
<hi>Northumberland</hi> was drawne into the plot of the Duke
of Guise; and that <hi>Parsons</hi> the bloudie Iesuite, was him
selfe an actor therein. Eightly, they write plainely,
that <hi>Babington</hi> and his complices committed such no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
treason against her maiestie,<note place="margin">1587.</note> as it was shameles
boldnesse to deny or qualifie the same. Ninthly, they
confesse roundly, that Sir William <hi>Stanley</hi> committed
notable treacherie, &amp; falsified his faith to her maiesty.
Tenthly,<note place="margin">1588.</note> they write plainly, that in the yeare 1588. the
King of Spaine made a most cruell &amp; bloudie attempt,
not only against her Maiesty, (to vse the priests-words,)
and their commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> enemies; but also against themselues,
all catholikes,<note place="margin">1592.</note> and their owne natiue countrey. The
memorie of which attempt (as the priests write,) will
be an euerlasting monument of Iesuiticall treason, and
brutish crueltie. Eleuenthly, they grant, that Richard
<hi>Hesket</hi> was set on by the Iesuites, in the yeere 1592. or
their abouts, to haue stirred vp the Earle of <hi>Darbye,</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:1553:4"/>
rebell against her maiestie. Where I may not omit,
to deliuer mine owne knowledge in this behalfe. This
<hi>Hesket</hi> I knew very well; in his life, conuersation, and
professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, I euer deemed him to be of all religions; that
it to say, of none at all, and so the euent did declare. He
could temporize egregiously and frame his religion in
all places,<note place="margin">Loe, all traytors are welco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>e to our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites.</note> after the humours of the companie. In the
end his creditors came so roundly vpon him, for his
manifold and huge debts; that he was in forced secretly
to depart, and to take England on his backe. Not long
after, he became so deeply Iesuited, that he must needs
be a glorious popish martyr; <hi>viz.</hi> an arrant and most
bloudie traytour. he thought &amp; sought by murdering
his naturall soueraigne, to haue gotten gold, money,<note place="margin">1592.</note> &amp;
large possessions; and so perhaps to haue paid his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
or at the least to haue cut them short at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
But in steade of a popish imaginarie charter, hee
found an english reall halter; according to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>digne
deserts. Twelftly, they grant,<note place="margin">1592.</note> that shortly after this stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageme,
the Iesuite <hi>Holt</hi> and others with him, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
one <hi>Patricke Collen</hi> an Irish-man, to attempt the
laying of his violent and villanous hands, vpon her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
person. Thirteenthly, they freely confesse, that
doctor <hi>Lopez</hi> the Queenes phisition, was stirred vp to
haue poysoned her Maiestie. and the like they affirme,
of <hi>Yorke, VVilliams,</hi> and <hi>Edward Squire,</hi> animated and
drawne thereunto, by <hi>VValpole</hi> that pernitious Iesuite.
All these notorious treasons (right reuerend father,)
damnable in nature, intollerable in state, and almost
incredible in relation, are plainly confessed of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular-priests;
and the same together with many other,
bad, licentious, barbarous, sauage, and plaine brutish
practises of Iesuited papists, are compendiously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
<pb facs="tcp:1553:5"/>
in this small volume. Which I haue therefore
endeuoured to reduce to certaine heads, distinct
bookes, and chapters, with some profitable annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
annexed to the same; because I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that whosoeuer shall seriously pervse them
with indifferencie, cannot but loath and detest cursed
Iesuitisme and all popish Iesuited faction. For, though
it be necessarie to all true hearted English subiects,
to know throughly the matters discouered by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Priests; yet because many for lacke of money, are
not able to buy the bookes; and others because they
are tedious and confusely written, will either abstaine
wholy from the reading thereof; or lightly and slender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
runne them ouer, and so neuer attaine to the full
knowledge thereof; I haue imployed my industrie &amp;
my wits, to couch in a small volume and portable
manuall, the summe &amp; effect of all their bookes, pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phelets,
libells, edicts, and letters; so as euery one may
easily compasse the price, and no one bee wearied in
pervsing the discourse. My desire was to profit all; to
confirme the strong; to strenghthen the weake; to stay
the staggerer; to rowze vp the drowsie; to instruct
the ignorant; to gratifie the thankefull; to perswade the
doubtfull; and to confound the proud, malepeart and
disloyall hearts,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

these my labours, let such as shall reape that good, be
thankfull to God for the same. The disloyall papists &amp;
bloud thirstie Iesuites, haue alreadie kicked against my
former labours, and whet their malicious tongues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me. Their holy father the bishoppe of Rome,
(whome they tearme the Pope,) hath thundred out
his curse against me. But neither secular priests, nor
<pb facs="tcp:1553:5"/>
religious Iesuites, will or can make any sound answere
to any of my bookes. They haue often beene buzzing
about the matter; yet neuer durst they publish so much,
as but one colourable answere, either to all, or to any
one of my bookes. so as I must needs thinke, that male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
cursing, &amp; rayling, will be their morning and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening
song against me; by reason of this my friendly
posie, which I present as a most redolent odour to their
noses-grauitie; so often as they shall kisse the shoe of
their Pope, and with him commit idolatrie. the vsuall
manner (most reuerend and worthy prelate,) in all such
kind of exercises, both is and alwaies hath beene, to
make choise of some worthy and mightie personage,
to protect, defend, and patronize the cause. and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
neuer did any booke or pamphlet stande in more
neede of a stout and resolute patron, then this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
volume. For the traytorous Iesuites and Iesuited
papists, that cannot endure their owne brethren the
secular priests, to publish in their honest defence, their
knowne practises and imperfections; will no doubt
become starke madde, &amp; fetch al their Romish friscols
against me poore soule; who haue as it were anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and painted them out in their best beseeming co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
After mature deliberation had herein, (most
christian patron of learning and learned men,) I haue
resolued to dedicate this worke to your most reuerend

perfumes of the heart and liuer of a fish; that is to say,
with the redolent harmonie of christian diuinitie,
(which continually floweth most pleasantly form his
mouth,) to vanquish all the Asmodean-Iesuites vpon
earth, &amp; to strike such terrours into their harts; as they
shall not once dare to grunt or barke, against my true

dealing and sincere proceeding in this behalfe. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
other motiues do occurre, which might most iustly
incite me to this dedication of these my late studies, if
they were better then in deed they are; amongst which,
many large bounties from time to time receiued at

So praying the almightie to increase your godly zeale,
against all traytorous Iesuites, &amp; disloyall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

(gentle Reader,) was compiled and made
readie for the presse before the tenth of
October, in the yeare of our lord God
1602. but by reason of casuall accidents,
and other circumstances concurring, it
was not printed vntill this present yeare
1603. before which time, it pleased the
Almightie to call hence to his mercie,
our most gratious Soueraigne the mightie Princesse <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
late Queene of England, France, and Ireland. Against whose
sacred person, the Pope, the Spaniards, and Englist Spanioli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
Iesuites with all Iesuited popelings, deuised, contriued, and
practised, many most cruell stratagems and bloodie complottes.
All which were effected, for this sole and onely purpose, because
forsooth her most excellent Maiesty of holy memorie, did euer with
singular Christian zeale and rare magnanimitie, protect, patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize,
and stoutly maintaine, Christs holy gospell and his diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
throughout her Realmes and Dominions. These treacheries
and most villanous conspiracies against her royall person, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
indignities against her Realmes &amp; most louing subiects,
contriued and put into actuall execution, by the cursed crew of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Iesuites, and Iesuited papists, are compendiously, distinctly,
and pithily, comprised in this present volume. By reason whereof
it commeth, that though this present worke be published, after that
the imperiall Diademe of the Realmes afore named, came and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
wholy and lawfully to the high and renowmed prince now our
vndoubted Soueraigne lord, <hi>Iames</hi> the first, King of England,
Scotland, Fraunce, and Ireland, yet must all the chiefest parts
thereof, be referred principally to our late Soueraigne ladie Queene
<hi>Elizabeth.</hi> I say (principally) for that the same doe in some sort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
his royall person &amp; regall prerogatiues, who this day most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
raigneth ouer vs. For, the cursed and trayterous Iesuites, who
for their manifold treasons against their Soueraigne lords, the late
king of France &amp; the king now regnant, are iustly banished out of the
<pb facs="tcp:1553:8"/>
whole kingdome of Fraunce, euen by publike decree of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(as the French papists tell vs,) and who also (as the Secular
priests their owne brethren write of them,) haue endeuoured with
tooth and nayle to stirre vp sedition in the kingdome of Scotland,
so to set the imperiall Crowne thereof vpon a Spaniards head, will
not now doubtlesse surcease, from their inueterate and wonted bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
treacheries, (seeing their profession is linked inseperably with
treason, as the priests affirme against them,) if our liege lord king
<hi>Iames</hi> the first, shall graunt them any footing and resting place,
within any of his kingdomes, territories, or dominions. God for his
mercie sake, (which hath no end,) eyther conuert them soundly, or
confound them vtterly, for the peace of his Church, the
safetie of our gracious King, and the comfort of
all his true hearted subiects, English,
Scottish, and Irish. Amen.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue imployed my whole industrie and
best indeuour (gentle Reader) to doe thee
good, and to confirme thee in the truth of
Christs gospell, who, if I shall vnderstand,
that my paineful labours for thy sake, shall

very expedient and necessarie, to instruct thee in some generall
points, without the knowledge whereof, neither canst thou
fruitfully read this discourse, nor fully and perfectly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the same.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>PrimÃ² prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipaliter.</hi> Peruse the second booke, the fift chapter in the first section, &amp; note it wel: see also the second se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and forget it not.</note>First therefore, the gentle Reader must obserue seriously,
(though some, otherwise learned, be of an other opinion,)
that the discontented secular Priests, are in truth and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all doubt, at vtter defiance with the Arch-Priest and the
Iesuites; that they condemne the proceeding and dealing of
the Arch-Priest; that they vtterly abhorre and derest, the
licentious liuing, the vnchristian coozening, and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
practises, with infinite other badde dealing of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites;
as also that they write nothing of or against the Arch-Priest
or the Iesuites, but that onely, which they thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
bound in conscience to write, and to make the same
knowne vnto the world. I my selfe am thus perswaded of
them doubtlesse, and I prooue the same many waies.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because the Secular Priests haue a long time suffered
intollerable iniuries, at the hands of the Iesuites; because they
haue often insinuated so much one to another; because they
haue often complained, of the hard vsage of the Iesuits against
them, because they haue often repined at their partiall dealing
<pb facs="tcp:1553:10"/>
with their fauorites, and rough dealing against such, as would
not bow and bend to their designes at a becke: this my selfe
know to be so, as also that it hath euer beene their vsuall prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
euerie where.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because the Secular priests were most vnwilling
to reueale the turpitude, and the villanous dealing of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
fathers the Iesuits, (as who professe one and the same
religion with the Iesuits, &amp; saw rightwel, that it could not but
tend to the great scandall, &amp; vtter disparagement of their Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
religion) vntill necessitie it selfe enforced them therunto.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, because their Seculars write nothing of our English
Iesuits in deed,<note place="margin">See the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond book, fourth chapter, &amp; sixt Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</note> but the French papists haue in effect and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
made the same knowne vnto the world; affirming ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
that for their seditious and treacherous dealing, they
are wholy banished out of the kingdome of France; and that
by a publike decree of Parliament. Hereof none be ignorant,
that shall throughly and duely peruse the Iesuits Catechisme,
and the Franke discourse, lately set foorth by the Catholike
Frenchmen in the french tongue, and since translated into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
by some of the Secular priests.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, because neither the Iesuits nor the Seculars do spare
one another, in catching and snatching the least aduantage,
that they can finde or picke out of their reciprocall writings,
so to reproach and giue the foyle one to another.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, because other English Secular priests, &amp; lay-papists
of best account beyond the seas, seeing such endlesse conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betweene the Iesuits and the other priests, and knowing
the badde dealing of the Iesuits against them, haue thought
themselues bound in conscience to take part with the Seculars
in England, and thereupon haue written verie sharpely against
the Iesuits, on their behalfe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, the same is proued by many inuincible reasons, which
the Reader shal find set down at large, in the last section of the
fift chapter of the fourth booke, all which in regard of breuitie
I heere omitt.</p>
            <p>Againe, the gentle reader must obserue seriously, that though
I do charge the seculars with treasonable practises, and dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in state-affairs, &amp; haue proued the same out of their own
<pb facs="tcp:1553:10"/>
bookes and writings in rigor of wordes; yet will I not denie,
but they may haue a better meaning toward the state, then
their bare words externally seeme to insinuate &amp; purport. For
albeit they professe themselues wholy deuoted to the Pope, &amp;
do submit their bookes, their writings, their opinions, and their
own selues also to his censure; yet do they seeme vtterly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of many of his proceedings; yet do they flatly condemne
all English popish treasons; yet do they renounce the doctrine
of <hi>Sanders, Allen,</hi> &amp; Iesuits, in state-matters of wars, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes:
yet do they write plainly and resolutely, that the Pope
hath no power to depriue kings of their royal scepters &amp; rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
nor to giue away their kingdomes to another. In which
opinion likewise, the French papists do concurre &amp; iump with
them. For though Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> affirmed roundly, that all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
were bound in conscience to ioyne with the Pope, and his
power, in all maner of wars for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>; &amp; though also the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
priests do highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mend him for many respects; yet doth
it not follow of necessity, but the seculars may take part with
our soueraigne against the Pope, &amp; fight on her side in defence
of their natiue country, as they professe; to do in their bookes.
The reason hereof is this; because the Seculars, though they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Popes power supereminent <hi>in spiritualibus,</hi> yet
do they disclaime from it <hi>in temporalibus,</hi> when he taketh vpon
him to dispose kings of their Empires, and to translate their
kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the gentle reader must obserue seriously, that howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
the seculars may be doubted and suspected, to dissemble
or equiuocate in state-affaires, which are not articles of popish
faith; yet may we safely beleeue them, and securely giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to their words and writings, whensoeuer, and how often
soeuer, they speake, write, or deliuer their opinions, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of popish faith and doctrine. For to make equiuocation
lawfull, euen in popish manner of proceeding; these three
things must all concurre, or else it may not stand. First, the
matter must not be an article of popish faith. Secondly, it
must bee before an incompetent iudge. Thirdly, it must
be in a matter of moment, as to redeeme ones vniust vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the like.</p>
            <p>

secular priests acknowledge themselues bounde in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to detect the Iesuits to the vttermost. For these are their
owne words; all priests and others, that are not of that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious

as now the case stands, to detect them to the vttermost. First,

art. 4. pag.</hi> 9. the Reader must likewise obserue,<note place="margin">Quodl. 9. art. 4. p. 304</note> that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
confesse treason to be now by Iesuiticall proceeding,
linked inseperably with Priesthood. For these are their owne
words; The execution of Priesthood and treason are now so
linked together by the Iesuites in England; as they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
any to the Catholike faith, but <hi>Dogmatizando,</hi> in so doing
they draw him in effect to rebellion; thus it is written, <hi>quodl. 9.
art. 4. p.</hi> 304. The Reader must further obserue, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
priests know where the Iesuits vsually reside, where their
walkes are, and with whom they doe conuerse. For these are
their owne words; which of the Iesuits hath hitherto beene in
danger of apprehension by our means, and yet we know all, or
most of their residences in England, &amp; their walkes? I am sure
he will say, that if we were so lewdly disposed, we would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
with them first. Thus is it written <hi>verbatim,</hi> in the
replie to <hi>Parsons</hi> libell. <hi>fol. 57. a. in fine.</hi> The reader must yet
further obserue, that the English penall lawes are iustly made
against the Iesuites. For these are their owne words; vntill at
last they were intangled by penall lawes, which were iustly
made against them equally, as against the Iesuites: thus it is
written, <hi>verbatim,</hi> in the Preface to the Quodlibets, towards
the end of the sixt page. And when the gentle reader hath
well obserued all these foure points; first, that the Secular
priests are bound in conscience, to detect the Iesuites to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost;
secondly, that treason is inseparable to Iesuitical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
&amp; can no way be seuered from them; thirdly, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
know the walkes of the Iesuits, the persons with whom
<pb facs="tcp:1553:11"/>
they conuerse, and the houses where they reside; Fourthly,
that the seculars acknowledge and willingly confesse, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
lawes of this Realme to be iustly made against the Iesuites;
then may he rightly informe himselfe therewith, and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold this opinion, as built vpon a sure and sounde foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>viz.</hi> that if the secular priestes be indeede as they write,
sincerely and loyally affected to her maiestie, and fully resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to spend their liues and best bloud in their bodies, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of her sacred person, and of their natiue countrey, against
the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Pope, and the Iesuites; then doubtles
they will make knowne those disloyall persons, who haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
with the Iesuites in their bloudie treacheries; the persons
who haue and still doe, harbour, aide, and releiue them; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that haue deuoted and consecrated themselues, to the
king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Pope, and the Iesuites, against their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
soueraigne and deare countrie. Then doubtlesse they
will disclose to her maiestie, the howses where the traytorous
Iesuites reside, and the walkes which they frequent. That so
her maiesties person may be secured, and their natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
preserued, form the treasonable practises of those tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
villaines. For if they say, they may not this doe, least
so they become the cause of their imprisonment, exile, or
death; that cannot serue there turne, nor be a sufficient excuse
for them in this behalfe. I proue it.</p>
            <p>First, for that they shal no otherwise become such a cause, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
they haue beene the same alreadie, by reuealing their tresona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
plots and bloudie treacheries. Secondly, because thereby
they shall doe nothing els then that; which (as themselues
write,) they are bound in conscience to performe. Thirdly,
because in so doing they shall onely effect that, which the law
of iustice requireth at their handes, as themselues doe graunt.
Fourthly, because how often soeuer two euils doe so concurre,
that both can not be auoyded, but that of necessitie the one
must happen; then it is not onely charitie, but euerie man is
also bound to preuent the greater euill, with the permission
of the lesse, For the clearing hereof, I will here recount the
priestes their owne expresse words; which though they be
longe, yet doe I with the reader to marke them attentiuely,
<pb facs="tcp:1553:12"/>
because they are verie important, &amp; plainly conuince so much
as I intend.</p>
            <p>First, you know, (say the Priestes,) it is a generall receiued
ground by all, that when the actions of any particular man
or men, (be they of what degree they will be, secular or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
ecclesiasticall or lay,) doe tende to anie generall or
common huit of a communitie; (as for example, the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of some particular seruant in a familie, to the ruine or
ouerthrow of the familie; the actions of some particuler scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in a colledge, to the subuersion of the colledge; or the
actions of some particuler men in a common weale, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of a common weale;) It is then not onely lawfull to
disclose these particuler men, and their particuler actions,
though otherwise priuate &amp; diffamatorie to the said particuler
parties, (as all such actions of their owne nature must needes
be) but also euerie honest seruant, euerie faithfull seruant, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
true scholler, and loyall subiect, is bound in conscience
vpon his dutie to his master, faith to his colledge, loyaltie to
his Prince, and loue to his countrie; to disclose such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and their facts or intentions, without regarde or respect
vnto the hurt or damage, that may redound to the said par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler
parties so offending. The reason hereof is this, because a
generall good is alwaies to be preferred before a particuler, and
a greater hurt to be eschewed before the lesse. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when two euils concurre so, that both cannot be auoyded,
but that necessarily the one must happen; it is not onely cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
but euerie man is also bound to preuent the greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
with permission of the lesse rather then the contrarie.
These words are set downe at large in this manner, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
to <hi>Parsons</hi> libell. <hi>Fol. 28. a.</hi> This is a goodly foundation
which the Priests haue laid, as which indeede is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the verie law of nature. And out of this grounde may so
much fitly be deduced, as is sufficient to conclude my scope
and purpose. If therefore the secular priestes doe<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in deede
meane truly to their Prince and countrie, as they pretend in
outward shew of words; then no doubt they will doe as
is alreadie said. But if they refuse thus to deale against the
traytorous crew of Iesuites, for the common good of their
<pb facs="tcp:1553:12"/>
natiue countrie; then doe they but dissemble and equiuocate,
when they tell vs they will take part with our Queene and
countrie, against the Pope and king of Spaine. Thus much
I thought good to set downe for a caueat to the reader. For
these obseruations being well remembred, the reader shall be
more able to iudge of the discourse following. This caueat
must be well pervsed, throughly vnderstood, and faithfully
remembred; or els the reader cannot possibly be able, to
yeelde a sounde censure vpon the whole worke. First therfore
reade it; then vnderstande it; that donne, giue thy
iudgement, as indifferencie and right reason shall pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe.</p>

most vnlawfull, as all the world knoweth. Secondly, that the

and distinguished by there verie habits; but the Iesuites
being newly hatched and punies to all, must needes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
all,<note place="margin">The Iesuits are poore monkes by profession, but lordly fellowes in all their con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersation.</note> and be like to none at all. I haue spoken more
at large of them, both in my booke of motiues, and in my
booke of suruey. Which mine assertions in those bookes,
the secular Priests haue now iustified and made good, in
their late printed bookes; so as my sincere dealing therein,
is by indirect meanes made apparant to the world. The
Iesuites haue vowed these three thinges, pouertie, chastity,
and obedience, as all other religious papistes haue done.
Of these Iesuites some bee Priestes, and some lay-brothers;
which lay-brothers make also the said triple
vow, &amp; therevpon they are called religious fathers, though
they be but porters or doore keepers; and they will take
vpon them I warrant you, and so forth. Of these good
fellowes you shall heere <hi>mirabilia,</hi> before the ende of this

are those men and women, aswell priestes as lay-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
which are foolishly so denoted to the Iesuites, that
they will doe at a becke, whatsoeuer the Iesuites shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point

                  <hi>A</hi> Famous Iesuite now in England made offer to a
Gentleman, that if he would become Catholike, hÃ©e
should haue licence to eate flesh in Lent, and on all fasting
daies, among Lollards and Protestants; that by so doing
he might liue without suspition, and escape daunger of the
lawes. Thus it is written in their Dialogue. <hi>Page.</hi> 99.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note heere gentle Reader, these important points with me.
First, that the Iesuites are right Machiuels, and make Religion
a nose of waxe, which they vse as a seruile instrument, to bring
to passe all their bloudie, tragicall, and traiterous attempts.
Secondly, that those trayterous persons in high authoritie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her Maiestie (whereof I haue spoken in the third booke
in the second reason of the 12. aduise) who haue entered
closely into league with the Spaniard, do (as it may seeme) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
these kinds of popish dispensation. Thirdly, that Iesuits and
Seminaries are both most dangerous to the state, and vnfit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to liue in this land: vnlesse they will ioyne in Sacraments
and common prayer, with the rest of her Maiesties faithfull
subiects. For to no other symbole or signe, can credit bee
safely giuen.</hi>

               <p>THe Iesuites haue an axiome of winning of redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of time; which is in effect to runne with the time,
in altering their positions so, as they may best serue to win
their desires. The practise of which ground, is in no one of

                  <hi>Note here gentle reader, these important points with me.
First, that the Iesuites labour with tooth and nayle, with gold
and money, with threats and faire promises, to cause others
both domesticall &amp; forraine to ioyne with them, in setting the
royall diadem of England, vpon the Spanish Infantaes head.
Secondly, that they affirme in a most traytorous, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
booke published for that end, that the kinges of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
haue beene vsurpers, and not lawfull princes, for manie
yeares together. Where I must needes put them in minde of
this one thinge, that their <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> telleth them
with their Popes good liking; that if the Popes had somtimes
beene vsurpers, yet prescription would iustifie the Popes title
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1553:19"/>
in these dayes. So then by their owne doctrine, if their suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
were graunted, (Which they disloyally auouch, like arrant
traytors as their fellow priests rightlie terme them,) yet were
prescription sufficient in that behalfe. Thirdly, that they haue
offered huge masses of gold and money, so to allure men do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestical
or forraine, to the cruel murder and bloudie massacre
of our gracious soueraigne, most noble Queene Elizabeth. If
papists themselues had not thus written, my selfe could hardly
haue beleeued it.</hi>

                  <hi>Note heere gentle Reader, these important points with me.
First, that all Kings, Queenes, and Monarches of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world, are by this popish Maxime and Iesuiticall ground,
brought into the bondage and slauery of the Bishop of Rome,<note place="margin">See the compleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t of the third booke, and note it well.</note>
and must be his slaues and vnderlings to doe what pleaseth
him. Secondly, that the Secular priests (who vnwittingly
haue deliuered this doctrine against themselues,) are guiltie of
the same treacherie with the Iesuites, though not perhaps in
the same degree. For seeing the seculars doe professe their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Pope in euerie thing, and do withall submit both
themselues and all their writings to his holy censure, (as is to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1553:20"/>
be seene at large in this discourse;) they must needes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
and like well of this most traiterous doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Pope liketh and approoueth the same. Thirdly,
that all the Papist, in England which ioyne with the Iesuites,
who are verie many,) doe obstin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Note heere gentle Reader, these important points with
me. First, that these good fellowes, who pretend to bee
sent of God from Heauen, to reforme the English Church
and State, are men of no religion, but men that make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
a matter of meere policie. Secondly, that they
are so wicked, so irreligious, and so trayterous, as the
like were neuer heard of. Thirdly, that it is a great shame
for the whole Church of God, that such badde fellowes
doe liue vnpunished. These things well considered, hee
that will thinke them or the Seculars to be Gods ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours,
may iustly be deemed as wise, as hee that hath
no witt at all. For God is so highly offended, with their
trayterous dealings and damnable practises; that hee hath
enforced themselues, to discouer their owne bad proceedings
against themselues; that so all the worlde may knowe their
abhominations, and detest them with all their traiterous and
cursed machinations.</hi>

is, that they are called religious. But how truly they enioy

                     <hi>Note heere gentle Reader, that this sweete harmonie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Pope, the Iesuites, and the Secular priests, were
able to make an horse to breake his halter. And doubtlesse,
the Pope, yea, many Popes successiuely, haue thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
them, as shall appeare in the due place of this
discourse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Iesuites holde this position for a constant doctrine,
that the people may depose their princes, and choose others
at their pleasures; haue they any or no right to the Crown,
that is not materiall, so it be done <hi>ad Deum;</hi> that is (by
our interpretation,) as the Iesuites shall appoint it. HÃ©ere

great stirre in Spayne, to perswade the king to inuade
England, yeelding to him many reasons, why he was bound
to vndertake that enterprise, and assuring him of great assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
if once his forces were landed. Hereunto may be
added, how many they haue intituled to the Crowne of
England, as the Duke of Parma the Earle of Darbie, and
others, exciting some of them by force of armes to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile
her Maiestie, and buzzing into their eares, how easily
the scepter might be wrung out of her hands, and they
obtaine it. But most pertinent to the purpose, is that their
plotting and compassing, how to set the Diademe of this
Realme, vpon the head of the princesse <hi>Isabella</hi> the <hi>Infanta</hi>
of Spayne. To this purpose they haue written a booke,
wherein they gaue her such an interest, as they make the

that liued in England in father <hi>Haywoods</hi> time of
libertie, and knew him &amp; his manners, and fashions well,
and if they doe not assure you, that his port and carriage
was more Baronlike, then priestlike, all the world will
condemne them for most partiall, and impudent deniers of
the truth. Was he not wont to ride vp and downe the
countrey in his coach? had he not both seruants and priests
attendants in great numbers? was not his pompe such as
the places where he came sÃ©emed petie-courts, by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
traine, and followers? againe, for present I referre
you to father <hi>Garnets</hi> pompe and expences, of which I haue
heard some honest priests (who haue bÃ©ene much with him,)
report, that he cannot spend lesse then 500. pound by the
yeare. The mightie and extraordinarie excesse of master
<hi>Iohn Gerard,</hi> hath bÃ©ene such and so notorious, that I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
few priests (besides our cath.) to be ignorant thereof.
His apparrell at one time hath bÃ©ene valued at an higher
rate, then I will for shame speake of. His horses were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and of no small price. My selfe haue knowne him to
haue two geldings in a gentlemans stable, at 30. pound a
gelding, besides others else-where, and horses of good vse.
During his imprisonment in the Clinke, he kept a priuate
table continually, with great store of dainties, and much
resort daily. Besides, he paid his ordinarie commons at
the common table, and chamber rent. Let them which haue
liued in the Clinke, but iudge what this would come vnto
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1553:26"/>
in the yeare. But that you may not thinke this to haue been
the vttermost of his excesse, you shall vnderstand, that he
ordinarily kept his geldings in the towne,<note place="margin">O faithfull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

which I suppose to be some round charge vnto him. He also
so wrought the matter, that he rode into the countrey at his
pleasure, and returned. Which I thinke you will suppose
cost his purse well, in bribes to such as were his keepers, if
to no other. He also maintained two houses in the towne,
with seruants in them, and not this without great expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
I weene. Sure I am, that such as liued with him in
the Clinke, were of opinion, that he could not maintayne
all this I haue spoken of, vnder 400. or 500. pounds by
the yeare. I may not omit master <hi>Oldcorm,</hi> though but a
pettie Iesuite in this kinde. I know, that his apparrell is
seldome lesse worth, then 30. or 40. pound. He is alwaies
extraordinarily well prouided for horses, and those of the
best. An honest gentleman, and one whom I thinke you
will iudge to be no lyer, (besides that he is not euill affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
towards the Iesuites,) told me, that he had eight good
geldings at one time. Such as haue heretofore bÃ©ene secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
priests, and were wont to goe on foote sometimes, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
poore people willingly, becomming afterwards Iesuites,
haue bÃ©ene so a cockhorse, that it must be thought no small
fauour to be worthy of their presence, and that not without
their attendants, and other ceremonies. Witnes this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

               <p>Nothing is more familiar to the Iesuites, by their buls &amp;
constitutions: &amp; then beggery, yet neuer had any men better
skil to scrape vp coyne, that they might liue at their ease. In
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1553:26"/>
this occupation they played more trickes of legerdemaine,
then master <hi>Peter Patelin,</hi> or <hi>Frances de Villon,</hi> or <hi>Panurge
de Rabelais.</hi> For all that these thrÃ©e worshipfull Doctors
did, was but in matters of trifles. But to doe as our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend
fathers, the Iesuites do: is to fish for Whales, not
for Goodgins: for which purpose they haue first the instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of youth, which is their first hooke: <hi>Viz.</hi> The allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they vse to them, their auriculer confessions, which
they know how to imploy to the benefit of their house: the
visiting of the sicke, the waiting vpon them to the very last
gaspe, that they may neuer be out of sight; the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
absolutions, which they say they can giue them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they fÃ©ede their humour, that they may draw some
rich legacie from them: the deuises of their simple vow,
and a thousand other hypocriticall shiftes, which they call
charitie, but with this condition, that their charitie begin
at themselues: because the predicament <hi>ad aliquid,</hi> is not
an accident to them, but wholy the substance of their sect.
So that one may iustly call them, not the order of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,
but the ordure of the Iesuites. For although they
make shew, not to meddle with retayling, yet they sell by
whole sale, the administration of the holy Sacrament, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
then <hi>Giezie Elizaeus</hi> man, would haue sold the spirituall
gifts of <hi>Naaman.</hi> At once, so it is, that within these thrÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
yeares, they haue raked togither more treasure by this
their sophisticall beggerie, then all the Monasteries of
Fraunce, haue done two or three hundred yeares. These
words are set downe in the <hi>Iesuites Catchisme,</hi> in the second
booke, and fourtÃ©ene chapter. But you perhaps will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
how such summes should come to their hands? I
answere, that it is well knowne, that the Iesuites haue had
disposition of the common purse for many yeares, and the
receits of almost all legacies in <hi>pios vsus,</hi> yearely almes,
extraordinarie gifts, besides restitutions <hi>de bonis meritis,</hi>
much for dispensations in diuers cases, and for Alienations,
Aduowsons, and such like. All which receits rise to no
small summe. There hath falne by way of legacies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
these few yeares of my knowledge, (besides what other
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1553:27"/>
men can say,) 2000. pound,<note place="margin">The Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites cannot be but rich, though they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> some affirme 3000. pound,
from one of worth, 500. pounds, from another priuate gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman:
800. pound from another, and some 100. pound,
yearely in lands and rents. Master <hi>Iohn Gerard</hi> for his
part, got by one gentleman 200. pound at one time, and
700. pound at another time, besides the disposition of 100.
pound by the yeare. The said Iesuite had in another place
by a priests procurement who told me of it, 160. pound, of
another he receiued 500. pound in a matter of restitution,
<hi>certa pro incertis,</hi> the partie hauing compounded before the
aduise of another priest, for 300. pound, which he should
haue giuen to the prisoners of Wisbish. But this young
father Iesuite comming to the partie, hoysed the summe
vnto 500. pound, and tooke it vnto himselfe. These words
are set downe, in the reply to <hi>Parsons</hi> libell. <hi>Fol.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note heere gentle Reader for Christs sake, what impostors,
and coozners these Iesuites be, whom for all that, so many sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and simple soules, doe repute for saints and men of God.
First, you see, that they will sell their holy so supposed sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for money, and that at a dearer rate, then <hi>Giezie Elizaus</hi>
man would haue solde the spirituall gifts to <hi>Naaman.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that by their sophisticall and deceitfull beggerie, they daily
scrape golde and money into their hands. Thirdly, that too
proudly, and too too sumptuously, (which is abhominable in
Gods sight, and all good mens,) they bestow 30. pound vpon
one gelding, (of which sort they haue many at once,) and 30.
pound vpon one girdle and hangers. Fourthly, that so soone
as they become Iesuites, (that is to say, poore begging fryers,)
they are vpon their cockhorse, and thinke their betters to be
enworthie of their presence. Fiftly, that they feede the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the sicke, with faire promises of extraordinarie abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
so to draw some rich legacies from them. Sixtly, that
they apply their simple vow and auriculer confession, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
themselues, and to fill their cofers. Seuenthly, that they
receiue great summes of mony for dispensations. Eightly, that
they cause men to make restitution for goods vniustly gotten,
and conuert the money to their owne proper vses. Wherfore
I must needs conclude, that they are as blinde as beetles, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1553:27"/>
doe not see there irrelegious dealing, but wil yeeld their soules
to their vnchristian guiding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among many other meanes, which the holy Iesuites
haue to enrich themselues, this is not the least, to wit,<note place="margin">The Iesuits are good hunters, in seeking gold and money. See book third, aduiso. 9.</note> the
drawing of men into their holy exercise. A yonge gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
not long since, entering into this exercise vnder a yong
Iesuite here in England, was found by his meditations
to haue landes yet vnsold, worth one hundreth markes a
yeare, which hindred his iourney to heauen. Whereupon
he offering the same to the said yonge Iesuite, the good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
allowing the offer, said, <hi>that if he should receiue the land
her maiestie would take it from him, but</hi> (quoth he) <hi>sell it,
and then I am capable of the monie.</hi> By which Ghostly
counsell, the Gentleman set his land to sale, and was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
900. pound for it; but the holy father insisting vpon
a 1000. pound, the Gentleman died before a chap-man
could be gotten, and so the good father lost all. I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
how many poore yong men, falling into these good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hands to be exercised, haue fallen into sundry incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences,
and growen to be broken-brayned euer after.

make no more conscience to deceiue their holy father the pope

                  <p>The Iesuites so rule in all gentlemens houses where
they reside, that no lease must be let, but by their aduise;
the tenants must either please them, or repent at leasure.
Such fines must be taken,<note place="margin">Loe, the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites haue vowed to forsake the world, and yet are wholy oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, in worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,</note> as they thinke connenient, and

scarsely can the master or mistres of the house, giue a piece

                  <p>The Iesuites desire, that England should be conuerted

                  <p>A famous Father of the Iesuits, said in plaine words to
a gentlewoman of good calling,<note place="margin">Behold here tyran ny &amp; ambition, in Iesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge.</note> which was charitablie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

time of tryall, they that are not with vs, are against vs.
If you forsake them not now, you will ouerthrow your selfe
and all your posteritie for euer. This he said to affright the
charitable gentlewoman, as though the state of her poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
should be vtterly ouerthrowne, vnlesse shee adhered to
the Iesuite. What more? was it not an other Iesuite with
his assistant,<note place="margin">O cruell tyrannie, o tyranous crueltie.</note> which caused a gentle-man either to promise
or to sweare, that he should stand fast vnto them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
whatsoeuer he sawe or heard by priests and others,
done against them and the arch-priest his procÃ©edings? they
made the lay gentle man their spie, (as they haue euery

                     <hi>Note heare gentle reader, what traytorous and dangerous
people our Romish Iesuites bee. They doe not only confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

they vse all cogging and lying, to allure and stirre vp her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties

iudge, vpon how iust and necessarie cause, capitall penall sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes

attempts, of these traytorous Iesuites, these most damnable
villaines. If their power were correspondent to their willes,
they would most cruelly murder her sacred and louing person

caused many of their owne coate (the secular priests I meane,)
to contest and publish to the world in there printed bookes;
their bad demeanor, their hypocriticall dealing; their conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
garboyles; their seditious conspiracies; their disloyall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies;
their tumultuous courses; their vnnaturall practises,

the Rector called in certaine of his lay brethren strong fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,

to him, catched him by the legs, and pulling them from vnder
him vpon a sodaine, threw him backward flat vpon the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with such violence (being then sicke and weake with a
feauer,) that he was much brused therewith. The rest of the
lay brethren, apprehended some a legge, some an arme, haling

haue murdered him in his bed, if a casuall good hap had not

                  <p>The first breaking out of our troubles, was in the yeare
1585. at which time all that resorted to the Iesuites to be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1553:33"/>
confessed, if they affirmed themselues to be good subiects, and
loyal seruitors to the king, (for they were questioned vpon
that article,) they were sent backe by the Iesuites, without
receiuing absolution. <hi>Sequitur;</hi> Our kings represent the
true image of God, against whom this yeare there hapned
three straunge and vnusuall accidents; first, the rebellion
against the late king, which they coloured with the pretext
and title of tyranny; secondly, the parricidie committed
vpon his person by a Monke: and lastly, the continuance
of that rebellion against the king that now is, for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<hi>Sequitur;</hi> their confessions were instructions, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
destructions, to teach rebellion; refusing to absolue
them, which eyther were not in their consciences fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
in their reuolt from the two kings, or had any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to acknowledge them for their soueraignes. And
(which is full of horrour and detestation,) their ordinarie
conrse was, before they would absolue them, to make them
sweare by the holy gospell conteyned in their breuiaries,
neuer to take these two kings for their lawful soueraignes.
That which I speake, I haue by good information from
many, that were faine to passe through that strait; and I
know one amongst the rest, more nÃ©ere me then the rest,
who rather then he would giue credit to their doctrine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from his confessour, without receiuing absolution.
These words are set downe by a Catholike papist a French

                  <p>
                     <hi>Note heere gentle Reader, these important points with me.
First, that not onely our English papists, but euen the French
also, do write the same argument in substance; against the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,
and their damnable doctrine. Secondly, that they vse
confession, as an instrument of patricidie, euen of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted
princes. Thirdly, that they would absolue none, which
acknowledged true loyaltie to their soueraignes. Fourthly,
that they caused all those whom they did absolue, to sweare
by the holy gospell, neuer to take the king now regnant nor
king <hi>Henry</hi> his predecessor, for their lawfull soueraignes. It
therefore is high time for all kings, to abandon and expell all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1553:34"/>
this cursed crue out of their kingdomes, territories, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</hi>

of this Iesuiticall warre within France, there was
some conformitie of names betweene this, and that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists

they had one <hi>Iohn Mathew</hi> their chiefe prophet, vnder <hi>Iohn

<hi>Claudius Mathew,</hi> and <hi>Bernard Rouellet.</hi> I will not
hÃ©ere recite the other particulars of our troubles, being
contented plainely to haue shewed vnto you, that our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
were the first seminaries thereof. These words are

                  <p>
                     <hi>Note heere gentle Reader, that the French papists write as
sharpely against the Iesuites, as doe our secular popish priests.
And consequently, the priests assertions and reports of them,
are of more credit in that behalfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Iesuites hauing set foote in Portugall, sollicited the
king <hi>Sebastian</hi> by all manner of illusions, to make an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
law, that none might be called to the Crowne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
he were of their societie; and moreouer, elected by the
consent and suffrages of the same. Whereunto they could
not attaine, albeit they met with the most deuout &amp; supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
prince that could be. They were the men, that kindled
the first coales of that accursed league, which hath bÃ©ene
the vtter ruine and subuersion of France. In fauour of the
Spaniard, they set on worke (to kill the king,) one <hi>Peter
Barriere,</hi> whom they caused to be confessed in their Colledge
at Paris, afterwards to receiue the Sacrament, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
confirmed him by an assured promise of Paradise, as
a true martyr, if he died in that quarrell, they set forward
this valiant champion, who was thrise at the verie point
to execute his accursed enterprise; and God as often mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1553:34"/>
stayed his hand, vntil at length being apprehended
at Melun, he receuied y<hi rend="sup">â€¢</hi> iust hyre of his traiterous intention
in the yeare 1593. I speake nothing, but what mine eies
can witnesse, and what I had from his owne mouth, when
he was prisoner. View and peruse all the iniquities, that
you will, you shall finde none so barbarous as this. To
perswade an impietie (to kill a king,) and then to couer it
with such a seeming maske of pietie. In a word, to destroy
a soule, a king, paradise, and our Church all at a blow; to
make way for their Spanish, and halfe-pagan design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Thus is it written in the Iesuites Catechisme.
<hi>Lib.3. cap. 18. fol.</hi> 185.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note heere gentle Reader, these materiall points with me.
First, that the Iesuites labour with might and maine, (as our
Secular priests truly write of them,) to ouerrule the whole
world. For they would haue had a generall law made, that
none should be made king of Portugall, vnlesse he were a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite,
and also elected by their consent and suffrages. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they suborned <hi>Peter Barriere,</hi> to kill his and their liege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
the king of France. Thirdly, that they abused the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to that end and purpose. Fourthly, that they promised
him Paradise and to be canonized for a martyr, if he should
kill his soueraigne and die in that quartell. Fiftly, that all this
was done, in the honour and behalfe of the Spanish king. Put
all these together, and see if the same be not the Iesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
practise heere in England, as the Secular priestes haue
told vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It happened vpon Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> Enangelists day in the
yeare 1594. after the reducing of Paris vnder obedience to
their soueraigne, that the king going to his chamber, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with many princes and lords, found himselfe
vnlookt for sodainly stroke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in the mouth with a knife, so that
neither he, nor those that were with him, could perceiue it.
For assoone as <hi>Iohn Chastell</hi> who was the traytor, and but
nineteene yeares of age, had giuen the stroke, he dropped
downe the knife, and set himselfe in the midst of the prease.
Euerie one was in a maze, and busie to thinke who had
done that trayterous dÃ©ed, and it wanted not much, but that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1553:35"/>

God would not permit that this detestable act should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

                        </gap>as brought vp in the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites schoole.</note> that some ore ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
his eyes vpon him, he became as one sore affrighted
and appald with feare. But as he promised himselfe to haue
the paradise of Iesuites, if he died one of their martyrs, so
also he confessed this fact more readily and promptly, then
was looked for at his hands. Whereby by decree of the
Court of Parliament in Paris, he was condemned to die.
I haue no greater argument then this, to shew that the
trade of murthering was lodged within their Colledges.
For where there was any exercise of good education and
studie, no scholler would haue vndertaken such a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
determination, but such a one as was brought vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them. In other Colledges, they know not what it
meant to instruct schollers how to murther kings, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in ours. But in the Iesuits Colledges, it is contrarie
and preached in their owne assemblies nothing so much as
that alone. Of the which indÃ©ed, they were but too prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
in their sermons. These words are set downe, in the
Iesuites Catechisme. <hi>Lib. 3. cap. 8. fol.</hi> 155.</p>
                  <p>When our Iesuites saw themselues remoued from their
princes fauour, they began to lay a snare to intrappe him.
And as their societie is composed of all sorts of people, some
for the penne, others for practise; so had they amongst them,
one father <hi>Henry Sammier</hi> of Luxenburge, a man disposed
for all affaires, and resolued to any hazard. This fellow was
sent by them in the yeare 1581. towards diners Catholike
princes to sound the fourd. And to say truly, they could not
haue chosen one more fit. For he disguised himselfe, into as
manie formes as obiects; one while attired like a souldier, an
other while like a priest, by and by a countrey swaine.
Dice, cards, and women, were as ordinarie with him, as
his presired houres of prayer, saying, he did not thinke he
sinned in this, because it was done to Gods glory. and that
he mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>t not be discouered, changing his name together
with his habite, according to the countries where he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to negotiate. These words are to be read in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme.

                     <hi>William Crichton</hi> the Iesuite, went into Spaine by the

against him. Whereunto the king of Spayne gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no eare, <hi>Crichton</hi> determined with himselfe, by
letters to sollicite the Catholike Nobilitie of Scotland
to the same purpose; and to that ende wrote letters in
the yeare 1592. to <hi>Gourdon,</hi> and other Iesuites remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                  <p>It is well knowne (O Iesuites,) that your Colledge was
the fountaine and seminarie, of all those calamities, which

                     <hi>Note here gentle reader with me, these important ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations.
First, that Iohn Chastell but 19. yeares of age, went
about trayterously with a knife prepared for that purpose,
to murther his naturall Soueraigne. Secondly, that hee the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1553:36"/>
said youth was fully perswaded by Iesuiticall education and
doctrine, that to murther his liege Lord the King was the readie
way to heauen. Thirdly, that nothing was more freely taught in
the schooles of the Iesuites, then the doctrine of the killing of
lawefull kinges. Fourthly, that their sermons abounded, with
this kind of maladie. Fiftly, that the Iesuites imployed in this
kind of marchandise, one Henrie Sammier a most licentious &amp;
dissolute villaine, giuen to all vices vnder heauen. Sixtly,
that he reputed all his vices for vertues, in respect of his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intents and purpose; <hi>viz.</hi> Of killing Kinges. Seuenthly,
that the Iesuite <hi>Crichton</hi> sollicited the Spanish King, to inuade
both England and Scotland; affirming that the crownes of
both the kingdomes, did by right pertaine vnto him. Eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Iesuite <hi>Commolet</hi> and his adherents, sounded
the trumpet of warre against their king, euen out of the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s if it had beene an high point of diuinitie, and most fit
for edification. Ninthly, that the Iesuite <hi>Walpoole</hi> endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by poyson, to take away the life of his Soueraigne. Tenthly,
that the Iesuites at Doway, sent the Cooper of Iper, to kill
Graue Maurice of Nassaw. Eleuently, that the colledge of
the Iesuites, was the fountaine and seminarie of the calamities
in France. That in their colledge was all rebellion plotted, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued,
nourished, &amp; maintained. Twelftly, that the prouincials,
rectors, and other superiours of the Iesuites, gloried and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
in their rebellious dealing. Thirteenthly, that a <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all posterities may know, what a kind of seditious and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
people they are. I might here adde manie other most
cruell and trayterous murders, plotted and contriued by the
Iesuites. But in regard of breuitie, I referre the reader, that
shall desire more of this kind of their hellish diuinitie, to that

                  <p>Touching the vowes of the Iesuites. it is not amisse
to put downe this corrolarie, as a fit preamble to the
discourse following. To conclude, as long as we mingle the
bringing vp of our youth, with this munkerie (of Iesuits,)
we shall neuer be able to saue our selues from this vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
confusion, whereof the citie of <hi>Paris</hi> (thankes be to God.)
is at this day discharged. But I speake to them, who being
coozened, protecte as yet, this new monster with their autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie.
These words are put downe, in the Iesuites cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme.
<hi>libr. 2. cap. 8. fol.</hi> 97.</p>
                  <p>I will begin with the simple vow of Iesuiticall order,
which I may say is new and monstrous, and which can
not be tollerated in our Church, without the ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof, at the least in regard of religious orders and
monasteries. The first vow of their order, is that which
they call the simple vow, by which he that will vow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to their societie, makes at the first the three ordinarie
vowes of all other religious orders; namely, of chastitie, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie,
and obedience. And although in respect of himselfe,
he may not after this vow giue ouer his profession, yet it is
in the power of the generall, to dismisse him when he will,
though he haue beene a Iesuite .25. yeares. And which is
more, as longe as he goes no farder then this simple vowe,
he is capable of all inheritances direct and collaterall, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the vowe of pouertie which he hath made.
These words are set downe, in the Iesuites catechisme.
<hi>lib. 5. cap. 9. fol.</hi> 97.</p>
                  <p>It is a new law, as also the simple vow of chastitie is,
which this societie makes; which hinders mariage to bee
contracted, and disannuls it after it is contracted. <hi>Ibid.
fol.</hi> 98.</p>
                  <p>What new monster then is that, which our Iesuites
bring from the Church, that he which becomes one of their
order, may breake of his marriage, without sinning
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1553:37"/>
thereby against his wife? So that vpon a bare discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
of the husband, the poore desolate wife shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
vnmaried, according to the lawes of Iesuitisme; and
yet may not marry an other husband, because the lawes
of christianity forbids it. These words are put down in the
Iesuites catechisme. <hi>lib. 2. cap. 15. fol.</hi> 113.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note here gentle reader, that the religion of Iesuites, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els in deede, but an hotch-potch of <hi>omnium githerum,</hi> as
the seculars rightly terme it. For first, they vow pouertie, and
so they abandon all wordly possessions; and yet are they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of all inheritances direct, and collaterall, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of their simple vow. Secondly, though gods Lawe forbid
the seperation of husband and wife, sauing the case of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
yet they roundly dissolue wedlocke, vpon the sole
and only making of their simple vow. So as wee may truely
say of these Iesuites, as doe the french papistes els where in
these words; the Iesuites would say, that their simple vow is
a vow of a pettie dissimulation, and that they thinke to deceiue
God by the same sophistrie, which the old pagan vsed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he
said, <hi>iuraui lingua, mentem iniuratam habeo;</hi> which protestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
was condemned by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the time, though they were not chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
So saith the Iesuite, I vowed pouertie with my tongue,
but in my mind I had a bird that sung an other songe. And
thinking by this shift to make vs like to their new doctrine,
he plaies three partes at once, the Iesuite, the heretique, and
the Machiuelist. These words are put downe, in the Iesuites
catechisme, libr. 2. cap. 10. fol. 100.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This reseruing of the goods (say the Iesuites,) is not for
them, who haue renounced this right, but to helpe them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
if happily they should be dismissed. Therefore if
they be not dismist, these goods appertaine to their order.
Was there euer more notorious coozenage, then this? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
I wonder not indeede, that they very seldome dismisse
their disorderly Iesuite; for in so doing, this fat morsell
would fall out of their mouth. But why is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iesuite during
this simple vow, kept away from his kin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ed? Why is he
sent out of one country into another? But to the end that
if any new inheritance should fall vnto him, no man might
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1553:38"/>
certainly know what his condition is, nor know howe to
call in question, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right he pretends. Well, in the end he is
freed from his vow, that he may be out of daunger of all
impeachments, and hinderances. Which done, hee shall
proue himselfe to be the right heire, and yet by a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word
betwixt him and them, he shall returne afterward to
the Iesuites, to bestow his goods in almes vpon them.
Adde herevnto, that this is a point that toucheth the estate;
that by this meanes, it is easie for the Iesuite to make him
selfe in time, maister and head of many cities, townes, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,
and castles, according to the qualitie of them, whom
he hath drawen vnto him. Let vs put the case, that their
are a doozen gentlemen of good houses, (for such they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to bring into their societie,) that haue made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selues
Iesuites, and that some ciuill or forraine warres, hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away all their brethren; who now, but the Iesuites
of the simple vow shall succeede in their inheritance, and
so being admitted to thier first solemne vow, shall enrich
their order there with all? And in time they will become
monarches. These words are set downe in the catichisme
<hi>libr. 5. cap. 15. fol.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>The Iesuites after their simple vow make a solemne
vow, by which they adde nothing to the former; but only
that by making this second, they cannot any more inherit,
nor be dismist by their generall. There remaines now the
third, which is the vow of three steps, by which besides
pouertie, chastitie, and obedience, vowed by them; they
make a particular vow of mission to our holy father the
Pope, which is to goe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Indies &amp; Turkie, for y<hi rend="sup">â€¢</hi> winning
of the soules, if they be commanded by his holi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sse. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all, I make great account of that precise pouertie,
which is inioyned them by their constitutions. runne
through all the orders of religion, there is not one of them
in which pouertie is so recommended, as among the Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>nes
which liue from hand to mouth, and put ouer the
care for to morrow, to the onely goodnes of God The
foundation of the profest, which are the Iesuites of the
great vow, is to vow pouertie, aswell in generall, as in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1553:38"/>
particular, as it is in all the orders of begging Fryers.
But because their pouertie had neede to be expounded, let
vs see the commentaries they bring vs by their constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
They haue three sorts of houses; one for their noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
an other for their religious bounde by their solemne
vowes, which they call the house where there Church is;
and an other, which they call a colledge, for the religious,
that are bound only by the simple vow; whereof some are
schollers probationers, others coadiutors, some spirituall,
some temporall. <hi>In domibus vel ecclesiis, quae Ã¡ societate &amp;c.</hi>
That is to say, in those houses and Churches, which the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
shall except of, for the saluation of soules, there shall
be no reuenewes proper, either to be applied to the vestrie,
or to the frame and buildinges, or for any other purpose
whatsoeuer. That the societie may haue nothing to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of, but onely to depend vpon God, whome by his
grace they serue, trusting that without reuenewes he will
prouide thinges necessarie for vs, to his praise and honor.
They that are professed, (that is, men of the last, great, and
solemne vowe,) shall liue by almes in their houses, when
they are not sent forth to any countrie, nor to take the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
charge of Rectors of Colledges, or Vniuersities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be vpon necessitie, or vrgent vtilitiy require it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall they vse the Colledges reuenewes in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
they shall be readie to begge from doore to doore, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
obedience or necessitie requires it. And to this purpose let
there be one or two, or more appointed, to craue almes for
the sustenance of the societie, which shall begge the almes
simply, for the loue of our Sauiour Iesus. The houses and
churches of the societie, shall not onely haue no rents, or
reuenewes, but no possessions or inheritance, in generall or
particular.</p>
                  <p>Gather all these particulars together, was there euer
pouertie more obstinately vowed, then this? And therfore it
was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> first <hi>Pius.</hi> 5. &amp; after that <hi>Gregorie.</hi> the 13. ordained that
this societie should be placed among the orders of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants.
If they would obserue that, which here is enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them; I would excuse them with all my heart of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1553:39"/>
herefie of their first vow. And that, because that after they
had a long time enioyed goods, during the time of their sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
vow, at the last to make satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to God for it, they are
come to the periode of their great vow, by reason whereof,
they haue the name of fathers aboue the other religious, yet
not onely they vow from thence forwards, a beggerie, but
also themselues to become treasurers thereof. I would ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as the true followers of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> repentance,
after he had denied his master, and would esteeme them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all the other orders of mendicants. But when sawe
you them goe with a wallet vp and downe the towne? For
al this they liue richly and plentifully, not with the manna
of God (for they are not children of Israell,) but by a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
point of Sophistrie, and see how. The houses where
these holy fathers dwell,<note place="margin">O w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

goodes, but onely their colledges are. Now so it is, that
vnder their generals authoritie, they haue all there care
and gouernment of their colledges. These are the old <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnati</hi>
of Rome, that boasted they had no gold, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them that had. In like sort these masters, though
they may haue noe proper reuenewes but their wallet
(which they scorne,) yet doe they gouerne them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue
good store.</p>
                  <p>This foundation presupposed, you may easily iudge what
will follow. For it is reason, that being fathers, they
should be sed and maintained by their children; and it is
more honesty for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, to aske almes of their colledges where
they command, then to stragle vp and downe the townes
to craue it. See how carefully they make sheaues off carne
for God, as <hi>Caine</hi> did, and yet heerein they are the true
and lawfull children of their good father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who in
all his actions, reserued for himselfe the principall care of
his kitchen. Nothing is more familiar to them by their
buls and constitutions, then beggerie; and yet neuer had
any men better skill to scrape vp coyne, that they may liue
at their ease. These words are put downe in the Iesuites
catechisme. <hi>libr. 2. cap. 14. fol. 10. fol.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note here gentle reader, the pouertie of the Iesuites, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1553:39"/>
is wonderful. For first, they professe and vow beggerie, and yet
they neuer begge. Secondly, they can haue no possessions, no
inheritance, no lands, no goods; and yet they abound in welth,
lands, and goods, and haue the worlde at will. Oh, who
would not be a begging Iesuite F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ier? Thirdly, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all possessions, (except their bare wallet, which they
sreone and will not vse,) and yet they command both the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssessions
and the possessours, to come and goe at a becke.
Fourthly, the professed Iesuites abandon and forsake all; but
the other Iesuites, (who stand at their command,) shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
nothing that may be had. The fathers can teach them
to fish for whales, and not for Gudgins. This then is a goodly
religious pouertie.</hi>

was rolde vp in quicke lime, that being spÃ©edily consumed,
it might not putrifie. Neuerthelesse, being sixe moneths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
carried to the towne of Goa, where he lyeth, he was
found to looke as fresh and sound, as when he liued. After
he was brought to this towne, there was a wax candle of a
cubit long, placed at the foote of his tombe, which burnt two
and twentie daies, and as many nights, &amp; was not wasted.
A man that neuer saw further then the length of his owne
nose, hauing got so much fauour of the priests, as to open
him <hi>Zauiers</hi> tombe, tooke the dead mans hand and rubbed
his eyes with it, and presently recouered his sight. Many
other miracles were done by his dead corps, but I find
none so famous as these two; one of his disciples hauing
stollen away the whippe wherewith he beat himselfe, and
a woman called <hi>Marie Sarra</hi> hauing cut of a pÃ©ece of his
girdle, which she wrought into siluer, and wore it about
her necke, cured an infinite number of all sorts of diseases,
by the bare touch of these two reliques. All these miracles
were done in the Indies, and many other moe, if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

as by common prouerbe we call old wiues fables, that is to

                     <hi>Note here gentle reader, that the Iesuites would very gladly
haue their first founder <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Spaniard, to be reputed
and canonized for a Saint. And for this end and purpose, they
haue deuised to publish many counterfeit and feined miracles,
which they affirme in printed bookes, to haue beene done by
men of their societie. But the bare rehearsall with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
may suffice for the confutation thereof. They are you
see, but their owne meere inuentions, and old wiues fables.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">Of the perfidiousnes, lying, cooznage, mutabilitie, and
temporizing, which the Iesuites vse in all their
proceedings and constitutions.</head>
                  <p>IN Rome the Iesuites acknowledge the Pope to be Lord
spirituall and temporall ouer all Christian princes, else
must they directly contradict all the extrauagant decretals,
which impose the same vpon all Monarchies. It is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
very familiar in the court of Rome. And in the
Buls appointed for the publication of the Iubily, in the
yeare 1600. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Sant <hi>Paul</hi> are called prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the earth. In France the Iesuites are of another
opinion. For in their pleading in the yeare 1594. they
giue out, that the Pope hath no temporalities, but such as
he hath by long succession of time gotten in Italy. The Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
are statesmen and temporisers, who hold all things
honest and lawfull, which serue their turne. As in former
times, when they spoke of a perfidious people, they named
the Carthagenians, whereof the common prouerbe grew,
<hi>Fides punica;</hi> the like we may now say of the Iesuites, <hi>Fides
Iesuitica,</hi> They priuately among their friends, make a
iest of perfidiousnes, and treacherie. For if you aske them,
what is a Iesuite? their answere is, euerie man. Imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they are creatures which varie their colours like
the Camelion, according to the obiect. A very fit comparison
for them; for no more then the Camelion, can they borrow
the colour of white, which in holy scripture figureth vertue
and innocencie. A little before the king entred Paris, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Alexander Hays</hi> a Scot, seeing the affaires of that league
verie much decline, it was his chance to disgorge out of the
abundance of his heart, these words in a great audience,
in the Colledge Clairmont, where he read the principall
lecture. Hitherto (saith he,) we haue beene Spayniards,
but now we are constrayned to be french. It is all one, we
must formalize vntill a fitter season. <hi>Cedendum erit tempori.</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1553:41"/>
These were the words he vsed. And that you may not think
that this maxime procÃ©edeth from the pliantnes of their
consciences, which they restraine or extend, as best fitteth
their profit; their good father <hi>Ignace</hi> first taught them this
dispensation, whereof they haue since made a particular
constitution. The other holy fathers founders of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
established diuers ordinances, which they fastened,
if I may so speake, with nailes of diamond in tombes of
brasse, which should perpetually be obserued by munks
and other religions. In the sect of Iesuites, there is nothing
so certaine as their vncertaintie, as I said of late. In the
Bull of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third, it is written as followeth.
That they may make (saith the Pope,) particular ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
which they shall indge fit for the societie, to the
glorie of our Lord Iesus Christ, and the profit of their
neighbour. And that such as are alreadie made, or shall be
made hereafter, they may chaunge, alter, or abolish, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the varietie of place, time, and occasions, and in
stÃ©ede of them, make new; the which so changed, reuoked,
or made new, we will that they be confirmed by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
authoritie of the Apostolike sea, and by the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
of our specall grace and fauour we confirme
them.</p>
                  <p>Out of this generall constitution, they haue drawne one
particular, which is worthy to be knowne, in the 16. part
of their constitutions, chap. 5. The title beginning thus.
That the constitutions may not binde any man in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
sith the societie desires, that all their constitutions,
declarations, and order of life, should be without euasion,
conformable to our direction; and also neuerthelesse wisheth
to be secured, or at least succoured, that they be not snared
in any sinne, which may growe by their constitutions or
ordinances; we haue thought good in the Lord, (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
taken to the expresse bow, wherewith the societie is
bound to the Pope for the time being, and the thrÃ©e other
essentiall vowes, of pouertie, chastitie, and obedience,)
that no constitutions, declarations, or any order of life,
shall impose any yoake of mortall or veniall sinne vpon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1553:42"/>
them; vnlesse their superiour command those things, in
the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, or in the vertue of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
And againe; in stead of feare of offending, let loue
and desire of all perfection come in place, and let the glorie
and praise of Christ our Lord &amp; maker, be the more exalted.
By the first article, it is lawfull for them to change and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
their constitutions at their owne pleasure, for their
owne good. By the second, their constitutions are held (in
regard of the soule,) indifferent; so that the Iesuite may
breake them, without committing mortall or veniall
sinne. A law which their great law-giuer gaue them, to the
end, that to Gods honour and glory there might he fewer
sinners in their societie.</p>
                  <p>Oh holy soules? oh pure consciences? who restrayning
their inferiours from sinne, take themselues the reines.
committing all manner of sinne vncontrolled, Let vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
these points without passion, and let let vs consider
the scope of these two propositions. By the first, no prince
shall be assured of his estate; and by the second, no prince
shall be secure of his person in his owne kingdome. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the first point, call to minde how matters haue
bÃ©ene carried for these 25. or 30. yeares. There hath bÃ©ene
no nation, where they be fostered, but they would be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
with their affaires of state. I thinke they are such
honest men, as what herein they haue done, they haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to doe it, by vertue of their silent constitutions;
for if they did it by their owne priuate authoritie, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
were vnworthie of his place, should he suffer it. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this was forbiden them in the yeare, 1593. when they
saw all their plots were frustrate. Admitte new troubles
should arise, these gallants will cassiere and disanull this
last ordinance, suffering their companions to intermeddle
as before. But what are their rules in such affaires? Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that is it lawfull to kill a tyrant; that a king breaking
the common lawes of the land, may be depriued of his
Crowne by the people. That there are other causes, for
the which princes and great personages may be slaine. In
what a miserable condition shall princes liue, if the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1553:42"/>
of their estate, shall depend vpon these fellowes?
Let us sÃ©e their new constitutions of 1593. I will that they
medle not at all in affaires of state in generall termes. And
that particularly, they practise not vpon the person of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Are they bound to obey this? Nothing lesse. For
their law-giuer chargeth not their consciences, but in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
termes; he would otherwise haue charged them,
by vertue of their blind obedience. And this is the
cause, that <hi>Commolet</hi> preaching since this new statute, that
there wanted a new <hi>Ehud</hi> to kill our king. and <hi>Walpoole</hi>
furnishing <hi>Squire</hi> with poyson and instructions, to kill the
QuÃ©ene of England his mistresse, thought they sinned not
therein. These words are set downe in the Iesuites Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme.

                  <p>It is not christian charitie (O Iesuites,) that leads you
to that course, but Iesuitish charitie. Your whole profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

                  <p>The Iesuites make ostentation of a solemne decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
among them, that they shall no more intermeddle
in matters of estate. But let vs see, what date this decrÃ©e
beares? They say of <hi>an.</hi> 1593. hath your Maiestie then
alreadie forgotten, that since that time they haue practised
twise against your life? Behold the performance of this
glorious decree. Doe not we know the generall exception
of all their statutes? vnlesse it be for the good of the Church;
an exception that extends as farre, as they list to straine it.

first, that the Iesuites are notorious lyers, and that their owne
fellowes can not tell when to trust them. Secondly, that they
are notorious coozners, and full of iugling tricks. Thirdly,
that the Iesuites acknowledge the Pope to be Lord spirituall
and temporall, ouer all christian princes. Fourthly, that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits

that will serue their turne. Fiftly, that the Iesuites are so perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

no estate is free, from the villanie of the Iesuites. Eightly, that
the Iesuites make hauocke of the Popes Buls and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Ninthly, that the Iesuites change and rechange their
rules and lawes, at their owne good will and pleasure. The
Iesuites therefore are good fellowes, fit for all times, all places,
and all companies.</hi>

                  <p>This is not to stand long hammering about the matter;

christianisme, which <hi>Ismael</hi> first trode in Mahumetisme.
Their Prophet <hi>Ismael</hi> is the great <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who with his
fabulous visions, would beare the world in hand, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he spoke with God, somtimes with Christ, somtimes
with our Ladie, or S. <hi>Peter.</hi> And as <hi>Ismael</hi> fetched out of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1553:44"/>
                     <hi>Hali,</hi> the pretended brother of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> a new branch of
religion taken from the old stocke; so <hi>Ignatius</hi> christening
himselfe with the new name of a Iesuit, in steed of the name
of a Christian authorized from the Apostles, builded vp a
religion neuer anciently obserued by our Church. <hi>Ismael</hi>
vnder a new vow, changed the ancient Turban; <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
inducing a new monachisme amongst vs, yet retaineth
not the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t habit of munks. <hi>Ismael</hi> first assembled a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of people after raised millions; <hi>Ignatius</hi> doth the like <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi>
to make himselfe great, mingled pollicie and religion
together; <hi>Ignatius</hi> followed him. <hi>Ismael</hi> and his successors,
were adorned and magnified by their followers; <hi>Ignatius</hi>
hath beene so idolatrized, and the rest of the successours in
the generalship. <hi>Ismael</hi> made himselfe be called the Prophet
of God; the generall of the Iesuits termeth himselfe Gods
Vicar. In these proceedings and practises, <hi>Ismael</hi> troubled
and turmoyled the Mahometicall state; and shall not
we mistrust in Rome, this same new Iesuited <hi>Sophi?</hi>

                     <hi>Note heee Gentle Reader, these points of great mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t with

their whole time &amp; study, in hunting after newes. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that their profession is nothing else indeed, but a particular
coozning of your families, and a plaine villany of all countries.
Fourthly, that Iesuiticall religion, is a semimonarchicall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
and a flat diminution of all royall regiment. Fiftly,
that Iesu itisme is a new late vpstart Mahumetisme. And thus

                     <hi>FIrst,</hi> the Iesuites hold and defend this proposition;
<hi>hominem non christian<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> posse esse Romanum pontificem.</hi> Thus
in English; one that is not a christian, may be the Bishop
of Rome. Thus it is written in the discouery. <hi>pag. 37. quodl

                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us admit this proposition gentle reader, with our
Iesuites; perswading our selues, that the holy Ghost
who made <hi>Balaams</hi> asse to speake, hath enforced them to
speake the truth vnawares against themselues. For. as I
haue proued at large, in my <hi>Suruey</hi> of poperie; Their
owne renowmed popish writers freely graunt, that dame
<hi>Iohan,</hi> a woman not a man, was once Pope of Rome.
And certes, if a woman may be Pope, who by Saint
<hi>Paules</hi> doctrine may not be permitted to speake in the
Church: a <hi>Fortiori,</hi> an Ethnicke, Pagan, Turke, or Iew,
who is no christian, may well bee the Bishoppe of
Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Archer</hi> the Iesuite defended this proposition;
the Stewes are as lawfull at Rome, as the Pope himselfe,
or any order of religious men. the Iesuite <hi>Weston</hi> also did
defend the same, against <hi>D. Bagshaw.</hi> These words are set

                  <p>
                     <hi>Note here gentle reader, that the force of truth, and true
christian religion is such, that the verie enemies thereof, doe
often vnwittingly and vnwillingly acknowledge the same. for
by this Iesuiticall doctrine, it followeth of necessitie, that the
Popes authoritie and his being at Rome, is altogether vnalw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
as also that all the religious there, that is, munkes, Friers,
Iesuites, and Nunnes, are vnlawfull, wicked, and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable,
which conclusion (by Gods assistance) shall be made
more euident, when I come to speake of the Pope and his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
in particular.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Iesuites hold, teach, and practise this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine

that a malefactor being condemned so die, after hÃ©e
hath once made confession of his sinnes to his ghostly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is not tied to reueale it to his iudge; nay, it is law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full
for him to stand in stiff deniall thereof, at the time of
his execution, as being cleare before God, after hee hath
discharged the depth of his conscience to his confessour.
Thus is it writen in the Iesuites catechisme, <hi>libr. 3. cap. 12.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Note here gentle reader, with what strange docrine our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
vse to feed, the humours of their deuoted vassals. And for
the better clearing of the falshood thereof, thou must duly
obserue with me, that if it were true, (as the Iesuites suppose,
&amp; take <hi>pro confesso,</hi>) that the malefactor were washed &amp; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
purged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> his offence, by his confession and absolution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
at the priests hands; yet would it not follow by good
consequution, that he might lawfully denie, his former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
offences to the iudge; and that for these two insoluble
reasons. First, because he doth formallietell a lie, which hee
ought not to doe, as Saint <hi>Austine</hi> affirmeth, if he might ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
saue the whole world. For to lie is euer a sinne, as all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
diuines doe teach. But that he lyeth, in saying he did
not commit such a fact, all the world knoweth. The reason
hereof is euident, because a murder committed not to haue
beene committed, is a thing so impossible, that God himselfe
cannot performe it. Neither doth this argue anie imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in God, but contradiction in the thing that should be done.
God is truly called omnipotent, because he can doe indeed,
whatsouer is dowable or can be done. Yet, whatsoeuer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth
imperfection or contradiction, that can he not doe; not
for anie defect or impotencie in himselfe, God forbid; But
for the contradiction or imperfection of that, which man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
to be done. For this cause, God cannot bring to passe,
that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was not once dead; albeit he could and <hi>de fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
did,<note place="margin">ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ke well my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note> raise him vp from death to life againe. For this cause,
God cannot make another God equall to himselfe. For this
cause, God cannot sinne. Yet, whatsoever neither implyeth
contradiction, nor imperfection, that God can doe without all
peraduenture, because hee is omnipotent. Now then, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1553:45"/>
that hath killed a man, and is by a popish priest abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
from the guilt of that fact; must perforce tell a leasing
to the iudge, when he saith he killed not the man; though we
suppose it true, that at that time hee be freed from the
sinne. For it is one thing, to haue killed the man; an other
thing, to be freede from the crime; euen as it was one thinge,
for <hi>Lazarus</hi> to be restored to life; an other thing, to haue
beene dead. And as it can neuer be true, to say <hi>Lazarus</hi> was
not once dead; so can it neuer be true, to say the malefactor
did not once kill the man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, the papists teach generally and vniformely, that
none without a speciall reuelation from heauen, can know
that he is in the state of saluation, and frÃ©ede from his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
sinnes. The malefactor therefore cannot assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that he is purged from the murder by vertue of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.

be the Pope of Rome. Secondly, that neither Pope, Munke,
Iesuite, or Nunne, are or can be lawfull at Rome; vnlesse the
Stewes be also lawfull there. Thirdly, that one may denie the
fact which he hath done, and that before a competent iudge;
and yet neither sinne, nor lye at all. Fourthlie, that both the
Iesuites and the Pope himselfe tell vs, that the Pope is both
Lord spirituall and temporall ouer all christian princes; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that he can depriue christian princes of their royall scepters
and regalities. But withall forget not, that not onely the eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

and derided his curses and comminations; that Kinge
<hi>Philip</hi> the faire resisted <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, burnt his buls, and
imprisoned his legates; and that all this was done, by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell

the sixt despised pope <hi>Benedicts</hi> interdict; burnt his Buls; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the bringers thereof to be set on the pillorie; and that to

expelled; not for religion as he hath vanted, but for his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdie,
factious conuersation, libelling, and other misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors.
But thereof ye need no further information, then
the said declaration; where you shall finde, that there was
such lamentation at his departure from the Colledge, as
for ioy he was rung thence with bels. Doctor <hi>Bagshaw</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>Concerning father <hi>Parsons</hi> illegitimation, I haue oft
wished it had not beene vrged, being not much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
But sith it haue bÃ©ene vrged, &amp; that he denieth it, I will
but aske him, why he was expelled Balioll Colledge in
Oxford, and whether the chiefest matter obiected was not
periurie, in taking the oath of the house to the statutes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the which this was one; <hi>Volumus, vt omnes huius

him, and offered to be proued openly. For the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of which publike infamie, he made his owne resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
writing it with his owne hand, as is yet to be sÃ©ene.
This is more, then I ment to haue said in this matter, being
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1553:49"/>
a personall touch; had no father <hi>Parsons</hi> ouer much vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the obiection, not onely as an vntruth, but also inuented

was not coyned by any of vs, nor so void of verity, as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth.

away (as fearing the sheet, &amp;c.) And so became a Iesuite;
secondly, or rather formerly and continually, by being a

                     <hi>Not, heere gentle Reader, two things of great moment.
First, that when the Pope abandoned lawfull and honest wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke
to priests. (which was euer deemed lawfull, vntill <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
was aduanced to the Popedome in the yeare 385. as I
haue prooued in my booke of Surucy,) then the priests
had good store of bastards; one of which as the priests
heere confesse, was expelled from Balioll Colledge for his
bastardie, &amp; seditious dealing, &amp; is this day (euen by the free
confession of the secular priests,) an arrant traitor to his prince
and natiue countrey. Secondly, that this holy father, who must
forsooth reforme the Church of England and manage euerie
thing in that high and heauenly function, was to be sent from
heauen with heauenly and extraordinarie gifts. <hi>viz.</hi> he must
first be a priests, sacrilegious bastard. Then, hee must be
a common drunkard. Thirdly, he must be polluted with the
execrable sinne of incest, and beget male and female vpon the
bodie of his owne sister. Fourthly, he must be giuen to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and libelling. Fiftly, he must be a ranke traytor to his
naturall soueraigne. At the length, being thus qualified with

                  <p>THe next point brought in by father <hi>Parsons,</hi> is the last
Irish attempt; but before we say any thing to that,
we must put his fatherhood in minde of his practises, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
two other preparations, wherein he cannot denie
himselfe to haue beene not onely a dealer, but also the verie
chiefe and principall actor. The first was that, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>in Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<hi>Stillington</hi> and some others got their death, which mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1553:50"/>
by reason of the ignorance of their pilotes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the prouision of God, thirtie foure ships being shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
vpon their owne bayes. If he denie this, wee haue
master <hi>Thomas Leake</hi> a reuerend priest, and others witnes
thereto, with whom he dealt to goe in that armie. And
because master <hi>Leake</hi> refused, he intreated him accordingly.
This preparation was intended, (as then was thought,)
for Ireland. The second preparation was some thrÃ©e or
foure yeares after (if I be not deceiued,) of which father
<hi>Parsons</hi> maketh mention, in a letter written to master <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
fitzharbert</hi> from Rome into Spayne, desiring to heare
of the successe thereof, saying withall, that they had little
hope of that attempt at Rome. This preparation (as I
remember,) was in the same yeare, that the Earle of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex
went into the Ilands, and it miscaried also by tempests.
These two preparations are so euident, to haue procÃ©eded
with his concurre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce, &amp; cooperation, as he no way can denie
it, without the note of impudencie; so many witnesse and
his owne letters, being in testimonie against him. What
wise man will not laugh at father <hi>Parsons,</hi> to heare him in
such sober protestation affirme, that he neuer intended, that
the king of Spaine should haue any temporall interest to
the Crowne of England, and yet by all his might and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
seeke to make him master thereof, by inuasion and force
of armes? Was the booke of titles (wherein the kings
daughter, the Ladie <hi>Infanta</hi> was intituled to all her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
dominions,) writ to no purpose,<note place="margin">Parsons the author of the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous booke of titles.</note> but to exercise father
<hi>Parsons</hi> wit,? was it a vaine speculation in the ayre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
relation to effect or end? there is a most trayterous let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his extant, which in time may come to light. But
should I labour to light a candle at noone tide? whose po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
good father are these? the Catholikes in England,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
may fauour <hi>Tyrone</hi> in his warres, and that with great me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and hope of eternall reward, as though they warred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the Turkes. All Catholikes do sinne mortally, that
take part with the English against Tyrone, &amp; can neyther
be saued, nor absolued from their sinnes by any priest, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they repent and leaue the English. They are in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

same case, that shall helpe the English with any victuals, or
any such like thing. The most worthie prince <hi>Hugh Ã´ Neale</hi>
and other Catholikes of Ireland, that fight against the
Queene, are by no construction rebels. How say you fryer
<hi>Robert,</hi> out of what forge came these warlike engins? they
were hammered in Salamanca the seuenth day of March,
1602. and are as you see, read hote. But what <hi>Vulcan</hi> was
the workeman of them? you shall heare euerie one of them,
speake for themselues. So I <hi>Iohn de Sequenza,</hi> professour
of Diuinitie in the Colledge of the societie of Iesus, in the
famous Vniuersitie of Salamanca, do thinke. I <hi>Emanuel
de Royas,</hi> professor of Diuinitie in the same Colledge of the
societie of Iesus, am of the same opinion. I <hi>Iasper de Mena,</hi>
professor of diuinitie, and of the sacred scripture in the same
Colledge, doe assent to these fathers sentence, as to an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
truth. I <hi>Peter Osorio,</hi> preacher in the Colledge of the
societie of Iesus at Tire, ain altogether in iudgement with
these fathers. Now father <hi>Parsons,</hi> speake out man, haue
any of your company beene practicioners in the treasons of
Ireland? the Catholike author of the Iesuites Catechisme
telleth vs, that all the late rebellious treacheries and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hÃ©e there mentioneth, were plotted and contriued in
the colledges of the Iesuites in France: and doe not these
Iesuiticall professors, tell vs as much, of their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cÃ©edings
in their colledges in Spaynt, for our treasons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
and murthers in Ireland? I can be but sorie, that
the auncient Christian faith and rebellion of Christ, should
thus be scandalized by Machiuilians, vnder pretence of the
blessed name of Iesus. We can alledge his letter written
to the Earle of Angus, the 24. of Ianuarie, 1600. wherein
he confesseth, that he had laboured eight or tenne yeares
for his Maiesty of Scotland, and the preferment of his title,
with the summe of twentie hundred crownes a yeare for
two yeares together from Spayne, which were as hee
saith, disbursed in the yeare 1583. and 84. as also 4000.
crowns procured to y<hi rend="sup">â€¢</hi> same effect, from Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13.
by bil of exchange; which he confesseth he brought to Paris,
and there deliuered it. And he saith the same had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1553:51"/>
it any correspondencie of gratitude, or hope had
continued from Scotland; with no small assurance of
farre greater matters, and aduauncement to the kings
person, if the enemies since of both our Realmes (as hÃ©e
saith,) had not ouer throwne, and altered that course. This
he hath in that letter, and much more. Whereby you
may perceiue, what his practises haue bÃ©ene from time
to time, against her Maiestie and State; sÃ©eking first as you
see, by large pensions from Spayne, to worke with
the Scots and others, for the vntimely aduancement of
his title, which must haue beene with the ouerthrow
of her Maiestie, or otherwise you know, it could not
haue beene. And heere I request the reader, to note
these labours of father <hi>Parsons</hi> for the affayres, of Scotland,
to haue beene in the yeares, 1583. and 1584. in which
selfe same yeare, happened the trayterous plots of <hi>Patry,
Frances Throgmorton,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
and the practises with the Duke of Guise, Spayniard,
and other English abroade, about the deliuerie of the
Queene of Scots, and ouerthrow of her Maiestie; and
shortly after, the treasons of <hi>Babington</hi> and his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Which I note, that you may see, how father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
courses concurred at the same instant with their
attempts; and by this you may gesse, whether it be
not more then probable, that he was inward with all
those deuises; and perhaps some of that money was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
to the setting forward of those attempts, though
he would seeme cleare in all things. But it is Gods will,
that his owne letters and writings, should discouer his
dealings. There want not other letters of his and his
complices, which shew his good will towards our so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
and countrey, but these shall be sufficient at this

                  <p>As for <hi>Don Bernardino Mendoza,</hi> it is knowne, that he
was wholy affectionate to the Iesuites. and it is but
an ordinarie course with the Iesuites, to bind both noble
men &amp; noble women, &amp; others also, vnto them by vow; and
yet leauing them in the world to be their instruments; of
which kind in both sexes, I could name some in our owne
country; and therefore it is no strange thing to charge the
Iesuites, to haue men in the world abroad that are theirs,
and bound to them in vow, and therefore may be termed
Iesuites. for what doth incorporate into a religious bodie,
but the vowes thereof, amongst which obedience is the
chiefest. These words are set downe, in the reply to <hi>Parsons

                     <hi>Note here gentle reader, what a cursed crewe of disloyall
caterpillers these Iesuites be. they are not onely ranke tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,

hypocriticall dealing in their pestilent sect; that no man can

are both Friars and Nunnes, both men, and women, and liue in
the world to set forward Iesuiticall plots and treasonable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
as if they were lay-people. The like was neuer heard
of in the world; it is a new no religion; it is a folly of all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
Friers are become Nunnes, &amp; Nunnes are Friers, &amp; all are
iumbled vp together. They may dilate and inlarge their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall

For Friers may begette Friers, and Iesuiticall Nunnes

these Friers and these Nunnes, are knowne to the secular

said priests confesse. Thirdly, the said priests, as themselues
haue voluntarily graunted, are bound in conscience to discouer
them. Let wise magistrates remember these points, and thinke

Friers and base Nunnes, but nobles of the best families, noble
men, and noble women. if this geare, and this treacherous
dealing, be permitted a while; welladay, and welladay, may
be Englands song night and day. for the Priests themselues

                     <hi>Note heere gentle reader, these important points with me.
First, that the Iesuites doe perswade themselues confidently,
and would perswade all others in like manner; that they can
procure a conquest of England, at their pleasure. Secondly,
that themselues are the onely wise men in all Europe, at least
in their owne conceits; and consequently, that all people
or all estates and condition whatsoeuer, must in reason yeelde
to their counsell of reformation. Thirdly, that all bishops, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and vicars, must depend vpon the Iesuiticall munks, those
irreligious and trayterous fryers; a thing neuer heard of, since
the world began. Fourthly, that not onely the ancient lawes
of the Church, but also of the Realme, must be altered by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suiticall
profested fryers. Fiftly, that munks (the hautie and
arrogant Iesuites I meane,) must be the high treasurers of the
land. Sixtly, that all the nobilitie of the land, must be censured
and limited by the said Friers, what retinew they shall keepe,
what summes of money they shall spend, and what diet they
shall vse, Seuenthly, and lastly, that these Iesuits, these Lordly
Friers, these noble treasurers of England, are lawles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent;
aboue all and vnder none; no man may call them
to accoumpt; no man may once aske them, what is become
of the common treasure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two Priests (Maister <hi>Bishoppe</hi> &amp; Maister <hi>Charnocke,</hi>)
being messengers to Rome, sent in the name of all the
rest, were imprisoned at Rome before their message was
deliuered. The French Ambassadour came to the Pope
and told him, that in imprisoning those two men, he had
done that, whereof no example could begiuen in any age.
And therefore beseeched the Pope, to giue them audience.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1553:55"/>
After the Ambassadours departure, forthwith commeth
the Spanish Ambassadour suborned by, <hi>Parsons,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth
the Pope from that which he had promised. The
French Ambassadour commeth againe the second time,
and vrgeth as before; and againe audience was granted
to the Priestes. This being knowne to the Iesuites, they
procured the said Spanish Ambassadour to come againe to
disswade the Pope, at whole motion audience againe was
denied, and the Priests cast into prison. These words are
set downe, in the preface to the important considerations.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Note here gentle reader, these points with me. First, that
the Iesuites are men, which respect neither religion nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
nor honest morall dealing. Againe, that the Pope
is an vnfit man, to gouerne any one nation; and much lesse
fit, to gouerne all the christian world. But all is well, his
traytorous Iesuites can doe it for him. Yea, they can rule the
Pope himselfe, For so themselues affirme. These are their
words, in the notes vpon the Apologie. <hi>page. 267. Parsons</hi> for
his credit (you say,) in the Romaine court, doth greatly let &amp;
hinder their designements. And this their saying was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
monethes since confirmed, by one of his owne coate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssing

               <div n="1" type="conclusion">
                  <head>The first conclusion.</head>
                  <p>THe bishop of Rome hath no authoritie deriued from
Christ,<note place="margin">Read the 4. chapter, in the 10. &amp; 11. Paragraph.</note> or S. <hi>Peter,</hi> by which he may lawfully depriue
and dispossesse her Maiestie, (that now most happily raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
ouer vs,) from her royall Diademe and regalitie; and
giue the same to the king of Spayne, to <hi>Isabella</hi> his sister,
or to any other forraine potentate whosoeuer. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
is effectually proued, by all the sections of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
chapter. For in the first section, this authoritie is said
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to tend to the destruction of nature, which power is denied
to the Pope. In the second section, it is flatly affirmed, that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Christ neuer gaue any such power to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> whom
all papists will grant to haue had as great power, as their
Pope hath, I am sure. In the third section, it is said plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that Saint <hi>Peters</hi> commission was onely to denounce by
excommunication, Gods displeasure against trangressors
of his lawes. In the fourth section, it is auouched, that this
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> kinde of proceeding, doth neither stand with Christs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
nor with his vicars. In the fift section, it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in plaine termes, that subiects can not be charged to
obey such a commaundement; and the reason is yeelded to
be this, because it is against the law of nature, of nations,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and of man. In the sixt section, the priests grant the fact, and
know not how to excuse the same. Yet, they seeme to haue
a great desire to excuse the Pope, if possibly they could tell
how. And therefore they say, he was misinformed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly
drawen to these courses. For which respect, I will
put downe the next conclusion.</p>

Ladie Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was heire to the crowne of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
by succession in blood royall; that she was opposite to
his disholy holines in religion; and that the crowne was
set vpon her head, by <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> the bishop of Carlett, a
papist to his owne liking. 2. Because he knew his owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
plottings in that matter; <hi>viz.</hi> that he did excommunicate
her Maiestie, that he did depriue her from her kingdome
by his Bull, that he did pronounce her an vsurper; and
that he discharged, absolued, and freed all her subiects, from
their allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce to her. 3. Because he knew <hi>Ridolphi</hi> the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine,
the king of Spayne, the Duke of Guise, and <hi>Stuke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to say nothing of the rest. 4. Because, he denounced his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Bull as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selues grant, purposely to further the intended
rebellion. 5. Because he designed <hi>Ridolphi,</hi> as the priests
also grant, to take 150000. crownes to set forward the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
said attempt. So then, it is verie ridiculous, to say
the Pope was misinformed. For euerie thing was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
related to him, and he was ignorant of no important
point. No, no, he will not say,<note place="margin">This doth confound the secular priests.</note> as the priests doe, that hee
hath no such authoritie. For the Iesuite <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth
the saide authoritie to the Pope, and defendeth
it in that verie booke, which hee dedicated to the Pope
himselfe; which booke is this day in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

parts of Europe. If the priests doe not recant this point,
and submit themselues to his holinesse; I am well assured,
they must smart for the same. I would therefore aduise
them, that as they haue wisely renounced the Iesuites and
the Archpriest; so they will also (as I haue conceiued some

pondered, the verity of my third conclusion, is inferred of
necessitie. For first, seeing it is a matter of conscience, faith,
and religion, to follow the Popes direction in all warres
concerning religion, as is proued in the sixt obseruation;
Secondly, seeing the Pope hath intended, willed, directed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, seeing the Pope hath no such power and

as appeareth by the first, Second third, and fourth,
obseruations; it is so euident, as none hauing but common
sence can denie the same, that the Pope hath erred <hi>de facto,</hi>
euen iudicially, and in a matter of faith: when he affirmed
it to be lawfull, and a matter of conscience, to obey his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

hold if for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>stant maxime, that the pope is the onely iudg
in controuersies; yet doe the priests now when the case
toucheth themselues, take vpon them to censure the
Pope, and to say bouldly, that they will not, because they
are not bound, in such and such cases to obey him. Marke
well for Christs sake, it is not my doctrine, but the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie

I weene, enen in the opinion of euery papist, that God is

I suppose, none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> will oppose himselfe, against this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted

These are their owne wordes. Out of which I note first,
that both the Pope and Spaniards wherefully bent, to
depose our gratious Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> from Ireland and
England by degrees. Secondly, that the priestes greatly
approued this rebellio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

highly extolled the rebels. Fourthly. that their hearts were

doe professe, their obedience to the Pope. Sixtly, that in

with so prudent a counsell as her Maiesties is, if not for
a toleration of our rites, at least for a mitigation of our ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griefes
in the meane time. Thus write the priestes out of
these words.</p>
                  <p>I note first,<note place="margin">Loe, the papists ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a day, as Esau did when be meant to kil his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Gen. 27. 41.</note> that the papists expect a day, <hi>viz.</hi> the

designements, of the Pope, Spaniard, Iesuite, and other
disloyall papists, now and euer.</p>
                  <p>I note secondly, that the priests expect trouble, rather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
then peace; in their long wished change, and conquest.</p>
                  <p>I note thirdly, that the priests boldly anouch, that her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Maiesties graue counsellers cannot preuent the mischiefe,
that the disloyall papists are able to worke in this land.</p>
                  <p>I note fourthly, that they proudly and malepeartly, like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
saucie malcontents, auaunt their partie to be so great after
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1553:65"/>

stand in feare thereof.</p>
                  <p>I note fiftly that they seeme to haue conceiued an hope,
that they shall as it were with bigge words and threats,

they should rather feare, to procure sharper measure to them
selues in time to come, then to liue in hope of any toleration.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> My reasons are these. First, because where they would
haue rendred humble thanks for her Maiesties great cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie,
they contrariwise bragge of their great partie,
which her Maiestie might haue cut short before this day.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because if their partie be great and strong, as
they auaunt it is, there is greater cause to keepe them vnder

                  <head type="sub">Of the popish Catholike religion of Secular priests, and

Catholike religion. Is there any sinne (deare Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes.)

a Catholike may, &amp; often hath fallen into the saire, and yet
remained constant in his religion to death? questionlesse,
there is not. As innumerable examples of treasons, of

in their preface to their important considerations, a little
from the beginning thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note heere gentle reader, many most excellent epithites,
which the secular Romish priests, ascribe to themselues, and
to their Romish or popish Catholikes. <hi>Viz.</hi> That they may be
traytors, murtherers, adulterers, incestuous persons, drunkerds,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1553:65"/>
co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>seners, and all manner malefactors; and yet be popish ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks
good enough, constant in the popish religion vnto
death. If the papists the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selues had not written thus, who would
haue beleeued me? none at all. But Gods spirit hath enforced
their owne pennes, to testifie the truth against themselues.
Out of this their plaine doctrine, and open confession; these
golden corollaries, are deduced euidently. First, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
religion may fitly be termed Catholike; that is to say, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
or vniuerall; and the professors of the same religion,
Catholikes, that is, generalls. For in good sooth, if they speake
truly of themselues, all vices generally are in themselues, and
they are generally vitious, as their letters patents tels vs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that where they imagine, there is a purgatorie after
this life; it may seeme, that such their opinatiue doctrine, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of their most beastly liuing. For treasons, murthers,
adulteries, incests, drunkennes, cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>enage, and al vices that can
be, must needs haue a purgation doubtlesse. And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
these notorious vices remayning in popish Catholikes vnto
death, no maruell, if they dreamed of a popish new no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie
after this life. Thirdly, that the popish religion cannot
be good. For as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, cap. 1. pure and sound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is this, to keepe our selues vnspotted of this world. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
therefore, seeing popish religion may stand with such vices, it
cannot be good.</hi>

relation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note heere gentle reader, these important points with me.
First, that the popish priests in this Realme are so multiplied,
and become so strong and mightie, and haue conceiued so
firme and constant hope, of their abilitie shortly to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
their long wished conquest; that they haue desired their
Pope, to appoint presently some bishoppe or bishoppes ouer
them. What would these boysterous Nimrods doe, if a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
were granted them? if they be so sawcie, malepeart,
and peremptorie, when they are in some sort by law kept vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and supprest; what troubles, what garboyles, what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and treacherie would they stirre vp, thinke you; If
the magistrates should fauour them, in such sort as they
desire? I doubt not, but her Maiesties wise and graue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers,
doe sufficiently see, what marke these good fellowes
ayme at. Secondly, that the Iesuites labour with tooth and
nayle, that they may haue all, and ouerrule all. And when
they could not preuaile therein, as they wished directly,
their solemne vowe withstanding it; they brought to passe
by indirect meanes, that an Arch-priest to their liking, is
appointed ouer all. This Lordly Arch-priest is <hi>George Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
forsooth, I know the man right well. He is made a pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
to daunce as the Iesuites pipe vnto him. For he is the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suiticall
idoll, as the priests write; and dareth to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but as they commaund him; neyther may hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to execute, whatsoeuer they will haue done. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it is true, which I probably foretolde long since in
my booke of motiues. <hi>viz.</hi> That as the Romish English se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1553:66"/>
beganne with an vngodly oath and dissention; so
it would continue vnto the end. And I pray you, is it not
this day apparant to the world? You see it, it can not bee
denyed. The priestes confesse, (as you heare,) that their
contention was the ground of the Archpriestes authoritie;
that their garboyles did beget his greatnesse; and therefore,
that they are his good masters. Fourthly, that the secular
priests the Romish seminarists, repute it no shame to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
in printed bookes; that the superioritie among
them, proceedeth of sedition and factious dealing.
Happie are they forsooth, that are gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

fathers as they professe to be but disordered, dissolute,
and blood-thirstie companions. Secondly, that they are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with wilfull murder,<note place="margin">Loe, the Iesuites are most skilfull Phisitions.</note> and that of no meane personages;
but euen of Byshops; euen of Kings; euen of Cardinals; yea,
euen of Popes themselues. Thirdly, that murder is a thing so
common, or rather so connaturall to Iesuiticall faction; that
if their purposes and plots bee but a little crossed, not onely
by Barons, Earles, or Dukes, but euen by Kings, Emperours,
and monarkes; nay, euen by the Pope himselfe, whom they
would be thought to honour aboue the rest; then doubtlesse,
that Barton, Earle, duke, King, Emperour, or Pope, shall haue
such a fig giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> him by these skilful Phisitions, for his restoratiue

               <head type="sub">Of Cardinal Allens intendment, against his prince

               <p>IT can not be denied, but that in the yere 1588. Cardinall
Allen compiled a booke, to be published when the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
should haue arriued; to haue stirred vp all English
papists to take armes against their Soueraigne, for the
speedy conquest of their natiue Countrey. The first part
of which booke, was intituled a declaration of the sentence:
The second part. An admonition to the Nobilitie, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of England: but presently vpon the ouerthrow of the
great invincible <hi>Armado,</hi> vnder their heroical <hi>Adlantado,</hi> for
shame of the world they procured the whole Impression to
be burnt; sauing some fewe that had beene sent abroad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
to frindes, &amp; such as had otherwise bÃ©ene conueyed
away by the Printer, and others in secret wise. Thus it is
written, <hi>quodl. 8. art. 6. p</hi> 240.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note here gentle Reader, that Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> the chiefe
gouernour vnder the Pope, in all popish English affaires; did
further the Spaniards intended conquest of England, with all
his might, strength, power, and force; and that hee published
a most trayterous booke in his own name, for the speedy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of that most cruell and bloody attempt: to which
adde with mee, that the sayd <hi>Allen</hi> was sent by the Pope, to
manage that great affaire: and was also made Cardinall for
that onely ende and purpose, as I haue proued in the second
Booke, ninth chapter, and third conclusion. now then, seeing
the Pope, the Cardinall and the Iesuits, did all wholy intend
the inuasion and conquest, &amp; did at all times bend their Buls,
bils, libels, and all their forces, to depose her Maiestie from her
Crowne and royall Scepter; and seeing also, that the Secular
priests confesse freely, as is already proued in the second book,
tenth chapiter, and second Paragraph; that many of their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
were knit to the Spaniards, and that none were more
forward then they, in those bloodie treacheries; and seeing
thirdly, that the said priests do still professe their obedience to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1553:68"/>
the Pope in euerie thing. and humblie submit themselues and
all that they haue written, to be decided, iudged, and censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as shall seeme good to his holinesse; (for so they write,
in their important considerations, pag. 43. quodlibet. 10. p. 342
et. p. 361.) let them (the secular priests I meane,) say and write
what they list and like, of their true and loyall hearts towarde

               <p>THe instituton of the Arch-priest was procured from

               <p>The secular priests impute notorious treason to the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,
(as appeareth by their owne words vttered in the

arch-priests authoritie from the Pope; but this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they affirme peremptorily, that they themselues
are cleare and free from all offence. For these are their
words; the seculars are so cleare and farre from all danger
of any offence, committed by appealing from the arch-priest
to the sea of Rome; as most daungerous, vniust, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall,
indiscret, irreligious, and preiudiciall to all, both
Pope, Prince, Church, common-wealth, and all estates,
if they had not appealed. These wordes are set downe,

               <p>
                  <hi>Note here gentle reader, that these seculars are great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in their owne conceits, and so they may rightly be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
if they can make good indeed, that which they take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

may submit themselues to his resolution in all thinges, and
concurre with his bloudie designments; against the honour,
state, crowne, regalitie, and life, of their naturall soueraigne.
and all this notwithstanding, still be cleare and free from all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.

is this text verified; all that take the sword, shal perish with
the sword.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that the greatest iniury of all, was done to our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
gratious Soueraigne, most noble Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> For
first, the Iesuits that procured the authority, and the Arch-priest
excepting it, were all her maiesties naturally borne
subiects<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and so thereby committed execrable villany, and
intollerable iniurie, against her most sacred person. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the seculars being also her maiesties subiects, did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in like manner offend most disloyally, against their most
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1553:70"/>
gratious and mercifull soueraigne; in submitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to the Romish tyrannizing Bishop, the professed
enemy of her honour, her state, her crowne, her life, &amp; her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie.
Thirdly, the seculars promised their homage and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> obedience to the Pope, so that he would make his good plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure
knowne vnto them; and to signifie their alacrity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

made it a matter of state in preiudice of regall

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I say first, that the seculars make it a matter of state,
as well as did the Iesuites. For they professed solemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Pope, that they would dutifully obey the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of the arch-prieste, if his holinesse would so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that albeit the seculars did indeuoure indÃ©ede,
to stay and hinder the arch-prists authoritie; yet was not
that done for any loyall part in them, or seruiceable dutie to
her maiestie; but for their owne frÃ©edome, and to defends
themselues from Iesuiticall bondage. The disloyall act it
selfe, was really and intrinsecally the selfe same in them
both; and not but accidentally and meere respectiuely,
different in the one and in the other. The popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1553:70"/>
and power, was acknowledged on both sides; the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
vrged his authoritie the seculars yelded to his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie;
this only was the difference. The Iesuites affirmed,
that the Pope had authorized the arch-priest; the seculars
stood only vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> this point, that so much was not yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to them. So then, they differed not in the thing, but in
the modification of the thing.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that the seculars made in deede a matter of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
conscience; because it troubled their dissoyall conscience, to
disobey the Pope. Conscience they had, I graunt; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of their bloud thirstie Pope, not in regard of our most

builde all their treasonable plots and practises, vpon the

to all right and reason; that the seculars, (if they

that there is none other to appeale vnto, but the Pope alone;
they desperately appeach them selues of high treason. The

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that this appeale was taken in hand, for her

the reason.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, that the said appeale was for the quiet of the

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, that it was also for auoidance of inuasions, and
cutting of conspiracies. These obseruations well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
the argument will be aunswered with all facilitie, but
to the cold comfort of the seculars. For first, they appealed
to the Pope, as is in the first obseruation; and so they are
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> traytors to Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by the lawes of Englande.

reason, where they flatly denie her Maiesties royall prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1553:72"/>
ouer them, while they affirme disloyally, perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
saucily, and tootoo arrogantly, that there is no other to
appeale vnto, but onely the bishoppe of Rome, whom they
know (as is alreadie proued,) to be her Maiesties mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

plots, conspiracies, treasons, &amp; bloodie intendments
whatsoeuer, against Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> her sacred person,
her Realmes, her royall honour, her princely Diademe and

seculars should haue beene vniust and vnnaturall, as is in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the second obseruation, but to the Pope, not to Queene <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth.</hi>
To her, they are thereby in deed vniust, for that
they withhold thereby, their homage due vnto her. to her,
they are indeed vnnnaturall, because they deny that loyalty,
which by nature they owne vnto her, and they are in a sort
naturalized to his disholie holines, by the said appeale:
For they say flatly, in the next article of the same quodlibet,
that they may not yeeld to the Iesuites, vntill his holines
haue decided the cause in the court of Rome. And yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witingly,
they condemne themselues in an other place,<note place="margin">quodlib. 8. art. 1. page. 223.</note>
graunting that they may not by worde or writing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne

                     <p>Thirdly, by not appealing, they should haue beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall
to prince, Church, and all estates, as is in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
obseruation; but not to the prince, Church, or State
of England: <hi>ergo,</hi> to the prince, Church, and State of
Rome, for of force they must so meane, the force of trueth
hath inforced their penne. Fourthly, they appealed for her
Maiesties securitie, as is in the third obseruation; where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
I cannot enough admire,<note place="margin">The secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</note> the impudent insolencie of these
disloyall Seculars, who make a treacherous flowrish, as if
the securitie of their dread Soueraigne, did depend vpon
their Popes good pleasure, and their treacherous appeale
vnto him. Herein they make hauocke other Maiesties sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-lawes,
which els where by popish statization and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinocation,
they say they may not offend. A note worthy
to be remembred. Fifthly, they appealed for the quiet of
the state, which is as disloyally spoken, as the former, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:1553:73"/>
God auert, that the peace of her Maiesties state, and her

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> appealed for the auoydance of inuasions and conspiracies,
as is in the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>th obseruation; out of which confession, I
inferre these two important corollaries. First, that conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
and inuasions are still intended,<note place="margin">Corall. 1.</note> against her sacred
person,<note place="margin">Corall. 2.</note> her royall throne, her crowne, her state, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
Secondly, that the Pope is the principall actor, in
all plots, conspiracies, treacheries, inuasions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests;
intended against the Queen, her realms, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
subiects. I therefore conclude, that the Seculars are
this day as dangerous, in al treasonable plots, bloody prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizes,
and disloyall conspiracies, as they haue beene here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.
For albeit they belabour themselues seriously, to
hide and bolster out all their cursed intendements, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their dread soueraigne and natiue Countrey; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
when they are occasioned to speake of matters of state,

they but equiuocate and temporize in so doing,<note place="margin">See the 10. chapter in the 3. Paragraph in the second booke.</note> and that as
scornefully and treacherously, as euer did the Iesuites. Of

nor can stand with popish religion; to thinke and beleeue
that Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (whom God long preserue ouer vs,)
can ordeine any competent iudge ouer them. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
vntill the Seculars renounce the Pope and his

                  <p>Among many examples, of the deare loue and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

<hi>Fitzempresse,</hi> and of his sonne king <hi>Iohn</hi> the third Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narke
of England of a <hi>Plantagenets</hi> royall race. Against
whom hauing vsed his fatherly correction, (as pastor vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vniuersall
ouer the whole flocke of Christ,) for their great
crueltie and tyrannie vsed towards their naturall subiects;
yet vpon their repentance, mercifully receiuing them into
grace and fauour of Gods Church againe; his holines on
the behalfe of the second, did not onely accurse and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of France with all his adherents,
forcing him to yeeld vp all the interest, right, and title, that
he or his posteritie had or euer should haue to the English
crowne, but also surrendred vp the said crowne of England
franke and free, to king <hi>Iohn</hi> and his heires and successours
from of the head of Cardinall <hi>Pandulphus,</hi> hauing sit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronized
three daies therewith in the Popes right. And
thousands there are in England, that desire as much. Thus
is it written, <hi>quodl. 8. art 9. page.</hi> 327.</p>
                  <p>Out of these words it is euidently deduced, that the
Pope taketh vpon him, (though most iniuriously and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically,)
to translate kingdomes, to depose kings, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
and Monarkes, and to bestow their princely Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demes

(who in outward shew of words by often and earnest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations,
affirme themselues to be most loyall subiects,)
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> approue the Pope in so doing. For first, where the Pope
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> had excommunicated and deposed king <hi>Henry,</hi> they terme
it his fatherly correction. Secondly, they say he did it, by his
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vniuersall authority ouer the whole Church. Thirdly, they
terme the deposing of prince <hi>Lewis,</hi> and the restoring of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1553:74"/>
king <hi>Iohn</hi> to the crowne, the chiefest fatherly compassion

crowne of England vpon his head, in the right of the Pope:
which forraine tyrannicall fact, they commend &amp; approue.
Fiftly, they tell vs, that the Pope enforced king <hi>Lewis,</hi> to
yeeld vp his whole title and right, that eyther he or his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie

This they likewise approue and commend. Sixtly, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
crie and exclayme with open mouthes, that thousands in
England desire as much to be done. Which is all one, (as

Cardinall from Rome,<note place="margin">Loe, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands are bent and wish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie.</note> to be enthronized three daies with

                  <p>I know, that <hi>Iure ecclesiastico,</hi> and by the authoritie and

then heere I will speake of. But yet I thinke it will proue
in the end the best course, for men not to doe so much as
they may. Many things be lawfull, which are not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
Thus is it written, <hi>quodl. 9. art. 3. pag.</hi> 293.</p>
                  <p>This reason <hi>ab authoritate,</hi> (for better reasons then their
owne grants and confessions, cannot be had,) is as strong
as the former, if it be well noted with the circumstances
thereof. For first, after <hi>Watson,</hi> (who speaketh in the name
of the seculars,) had told vs by the doctrine of a learned
man, that if we goe no further then to the law of nature, or
to the law of God, no king is depriued from his soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
ouer his subiects, though it be for the sinne of apostasie
from faith; forthwith he addeth the words of this present
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1553:75"/>
reason, affirming peremptorily, that the Pope can do more; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
then he will heere set downe. Secondly, he telleth vs here,
that kings can neyther by Gods law, nor by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
be deposed from their crownes and regalities; and
consequently, when he saith, the Pope can doe more, hee
must perforce affirme both impudently and senselesly, that
the Popes power is aboue the power of God.<note place="margin">The Pope hath grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then God.</note> The latter
he dare not say; and yet hath Satan so bewitched and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted
him, that it followeth necessarily of the former<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that
is of the doctrine, which he deliuereth from the penne of
a learned writer, and putteth it downe for good. Now
what is it, that the Pope can doe more, then may be done
by the law of nature and of God? forsooth, he can excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
kings, depose kings from their royall thrones,
and put their Diademes vpon the heades of others.
This is it, that <hi>Watson</hi> will not say heere, because it
is not expedient. Yet vnwittingly (the truth enforcing
him,) he telleth vs no lesse in another place. For, a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
priest (saith he,) and ancient gentleman, ould master
<hi>Middleton,</hi> was content at <hi>Parsons</hi> his motion,<note place="margin">Quod. 9. art. 5. pag. 306.</note> to subscribe

in another place it is thus written; say then for the present,
(which yet is more then I would willingly put to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,

of the third reason generall; I gather first that
all the difference betweene the Iesuites and the Seculars,
concerning the inuasion and conquest of this land, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
in this onely point, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Iesuites would haue
the Ladie <hi>Infanta</hi> of Spayne to be the Queene of England,
but the seculars will haue an English man, to be king of

the land. They differ not in the thing to be done,<note place="margin">Marke this well, that ye may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it aright.</note> but in the
manner of contriuing the thing that should be done; not
in the partie to be deposed from the crowne, but in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that should haue the Crowne; not about taking the
crowne from Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but about giuing the
crown to the Spanish Ladie. The reason hereof is euident,
because our Quodlibetist telleth vs roundly, that old <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton</hi>

forsooth, he telleth vs, that he would not willingly maintain
that doctrine, the time &amp; circumstances considered. Where
he vnwittingly auoucheth; that the Pope and king of
Spayne might lawfully take armes, to depose her Maiestie
from her royall Diademe. Yea, he granteth, that he would
defend the same doctrine, but that the time is not correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

erre as a priuate man, but not as a publique person. Of
which absurde doctrine I haue written at large, in my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
intituled the hunting of the Romish foxe. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at this present only speake thereof, as these words giue
me fit occasion. First then; we see heere, that if we meane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
to wringe any truth out of the Popes nose, we must haue
recourse to his holinesse, at such time as hee is sober; not
when he is furious, least he become starke madde, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
for euer the knowledge of the truth. Secondly, we must
haue his aduise, when he is a publique person, not a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

this or that pope; but as he is Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that blessed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Apostle of our Lord Iesus. Thus much is gathered out of
this popish doctrine, by euident and necessarie consequutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1553:77"/>
These points, if they be well marked, will vtterly confound
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all popish doctrine, and turne it vpside downe. For first, it
is a constant axiome in all popish doctrine that the pope and
none but the pope, must iudge in all controuersies of faith
and doctrine. This notwithstanding, we see by this popish
doctrine; that if the pope iudge of any matter, as he is furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and not sober; as he is a priuate man, and not a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
person; as he is <hi>Clemens, Sixtus, Adrianus,</hi> or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

it followeth of necessitie, that euery one must examine
well the popes doctrine and iudgement, before he beleeue
it; otherwise doubtlesse, he may receiue poyson for medicine,
falsehood for truth, &amp; erroneous for orthodoxe christian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
Nay, otherwise he cannot possibly tell when he shall
appeale from the Pope, as a falfe teacher and reducer of the
people. Secondly, the time cannot be named, in which the
bishope of Rome shalbe the bishope there, and not a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> person at the selfe same time. for euen then, when he is

for once a bishope euer a bishope, by popish indelible
character. Yet I grant willingly, that a publique parson
may doe some act, which may be censured the act of a priuat
man; but that cannot serue their turne. Thirdly, if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> will neuer appeale to the Pope, nor haue any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with him, vntill he be Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> they shall neuer
doe it, till the worlds end. Fourthly, if they will appeale
from the now Pope, as <hi>Clemens,</hi> they must perforce appeale
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> from him in ech respect; or els he must be christened againe,
and haue a new name. But pardon me, he was called <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>
when he became their Pope. Be it so. <hi>Ergo</hi> when they
appeale from him as <hi>Clemens,</hi> they appeale from him as
Pope. For doubtles if he be not <hi>Clemens</hi> the Pope, he is not
Pope at all. Fiftly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> if he be <hi>Peter</hi> by office or calling, then
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is he alwaies <hi>Peter;</hi> vnlesse perhapes he be sometime <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi>
which were a rare metamorphosis. Sixtly, this popish
distinction may fitly be termed, a tricke of fast and looose.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> For, if the Pope define a truth, they may say, he defined as

that he can nener erre; but some man in his coate, or

               <p>In causes of faith there is no infallible iudge vpon earth,
or which cannot swarue from the faith by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon course
of Gods procÃ©eding, sauing the vniuersall Church or a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
councell.</p>
               <p>Thus you see at large, the constant doctrine of this great
Doctor, and famous papist; who was present at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Constance,</hi> and one of the best account in the same
councell. Out of whose words I gather many verie excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
documents, well worthie to be written in golden let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that no Christian is bound to belÃ©eue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crÃ©e,
definition, determination, or resolution of the Pope,
as he is barely and precisely Pope, or Bishoppe of Rome,
without the assistance of a generall councell. Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the Pope may erre both priuately and publikely in
resolutions of faith, aswell as other bishops and ministers
of the Church. Thirdly, that the Pope is subiect to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> councell, and may be controlled by the same. Fourthly,
that the contrarie opinion is a flat heresie, condemned in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the councell of Constance. Fiftly, that an inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to the bishoppe of Rome, withdraweth many men from
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the truth of Christs Gospell. Sixtly, that a generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
is so aboue the Pope, that it hath power and lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
to depose the Pope, for any notorious crime what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.
Which authoritie (saith this great papist,) was
practised and <hi>de facto</hi> put in execution, both in Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the
12. and in Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23. of that name. Seuenthly, that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> a generall councell hath full power to compell a Pope law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
elected to the place, to renounce and forsake the pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and to giue place to him whom the councell shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.
Eightly, that if the pope shall withstand the councell,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> and refuse to obey the decrÃ©es and constitutions thereof; he
must be excommunicated, and reputed as an Ethnicke and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> publican. Ninthly, that a generall councell may be summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and kept, without consent of the pope, that is both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1553:83"/>
elected and then liuing. Tenthly, that the Church or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
a generall councell is a rule set downe by the holy Ghost,
and giuen vs by Christ, to which all people, aswell the
pope as others, must yeeld obedience, or else be as the eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks
and publicans. Eleuenthly, that neither the pope, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
any one man vpon earth is or can be an infallible iudge in
matters of faith. Twelftly, that the iudgement which we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
must rest vpon, in all controuersies of faith and religion; is
eyther the vniuersall Church, or a lawful generall councell.
This is sound and most Catholike doctrine, though procÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from the penne of a great papist. Which doctrine as
the councell of Constance did approue, so do I embrace the
same with all my heart; humbly thanking God, that by the
mightie power of his truth, our aduersaries are enforced
to deliuer vs the truth against themselues. This doctrine
is proued more at large in my my booke of Motiues, and in
my Suruey; in many places also of this present volume, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by the confession of the priests vnawares; and shall be
confirmed God willing, in my Golden ballance of triall,
now readie to the presse.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of the secular priests. My reasons mouing me therunto, are

Because <hi>Ballard</hi> the secular priest, did at his comming ouer,
about the yeare 1586. deliuer a like message to al reconciled
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> persons, buzzing into their eares, to acknowledge the quÃ©en
of Scotland for their soueraigne. Fourthly, because all the

deuoted to him, euen as they were before. Fiftly, because the
seculars iumpe with the Iesuites, in all things concerning

are banished out of the kingdome of France, for their sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

to dwell in that Realme; where popery is openly professed,
and therefore are banished from thence; it sÃ©emeth not to

added and forged by themselues, and no one such word

thereof.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Out of these words of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> we must obserue
first, that the Iesuite <hi>Bellarmine</hi> now Cardinal, wrote from

were not yet come thither.</p>
               <p>

the priests came eyther to Rome or to Ferrara; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was thought they would come, because the Pope

               <p>Thirdly, that it was decrÃ©ed, that they should be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
so soone as they came. These three obseruations are
expresly conteyned, in the former part of the Cardinals
letter; to speake nothing yet of the last clause thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that part is denied. But the former part is freely
granted, which may not be forgotten.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that the Pope was aduertised in Ferrara, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
his Nuntioes in Fraunce and Flaunders, that the priestes
would come to him.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that the Pope willed the Cardinall to write to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                  <hi>Parsons,</hi> to be enformed of them and their pretences.</p>

to be their fiction; for so saith the Apologie.</p>
               <p>These obseruations duely pondered, it will appeare to
the indifferent reader, as cleare as the Sunne when it shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
at the noone tide; that the Iesuite <hi>Parsons</hi> is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

falshood, and impudent lying. First therefore, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
chargeth the Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> with false testimonie.
This is euident by the first obseruation, where after hee
told vs the words of the Cardinals letter, he addeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
to the same words, the exclamation of the priests.
That done, he forthwith with an impudent mouth auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,
that the Cardinall can testifie all this to be their fiction.
Peruse the words in the beginning of this third chapter,
and marke them well. The diuell is termed a lyer,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. vers. 44.</note> and <hi>pater eius;</hi>
but henceforth let him giue place to <hi>Parsons,</hi> in that
behalf. For hauing told vs of the Cardinals letter written
to him, and of the contents thereof; he forthwith affrmeth
to vs, that all is false, and the mÃ©ere fiction of the priests. And
yet is the greater part, or rather the totall summe of their
narration, conteyned in the said Cardinals letter. But let
vs in the way of dispute, and in fauour of our good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
<hi>Parsons,</hi> and in regard of his trauels for the king of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1553:90"/>
Spayne against our natiue countrey; suppose with him,
that the priests had vttered many vntruthes, (the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
whereof God willing, shall shortly be made manifest;)
yet must the lye perforce be retorted vpon <hi>Parsons,</hi> as vpon
him that best hath deserued it; for his impudent, shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
and most notorious lying. The reason is euident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he granting a great part to be true, affirmeth in the
same periode, the whole to be false. But it shall be proued
before the ende of this replie, that there is no falshoode
therein at all; saue that onely, which procÃ©edeth from his
owne lips.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Parsons</hi> to purge himselfe of bad dealing, if
possibly it would bee, telleth vs in the fift obseruation, that
the Pope willed the Cardinall to write to him, to be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the priests and their pretences. Heere <hi>Parsons</hi> either
condemneth himselfe, or else giueth the Pope a mortall
wound. If the Pope gaue no such charge to his Cardinall,
then hath <hi>Parsons</hi> committed a damnable sinne, in ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so egregiously vpon the Pope and his Cardinall. And
it sÃ©emeth verie probable, that the Pope was not then
acquainted with the matter, but that the Generall of the
Iesuites by <hi>Parsons</hi> his information, had required the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
to moue the Pope for their imprisonment, if perhaps
they should come to Ferrara, while the Pope made his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
there. And for this cause did the Cardinall answere,
that the priests were not yet come,<note place="margin">O blessed Iesuitical, Cardinall. seruant of the diuell. Page. 199.</note> but should be impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
when they came, as we haue in the third obseruation.
As if he had said, haue yee no care, I will be minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to gratifie you in your desire. The priests are not yet
come, but I shall not faile to procure their imprisonment
at their comming. For it can not be imagined, that intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of this matter could come to the pope, but by the
consent of <hi>Parsons,</hi> and as <hi>Parsons</hi> did designe to be done.
The reason is euident, because <hi>Parsons</hi> boasteth, that he is
appointed the Rector of the English Colledge, the Prefect of
the English mission, and the like. All which is true indÃ©ed,
and by reason hereof, all English papists depend vpon <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
and will doe nothing without his aduise; the seculars
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1553:90"/>
euer excepted,<note place="margin">Note this dilemna.</note> that now oppose themselues against him,
who doubtlesse would not bewray their owne cause. If the
Pope gaue such a charge indÃ©ed, then did he shew himselfe
to be the diuels vassall. and not Christes vicar, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to be. For who, but the diuell of hel, would first decrÃ©e
that the priests should be imprisoned and afterward labour
to know, what offence they had committed? For if <hi>Parsons</hi>
say truly, the Pope knew not what offence was done. Wel,
be this as it be may, it is confessed on all sides, that the
priests with the Popes knowledge, were first imprisoned,
then inioyned to liue in exile, and neuer to returne into
their natiue countrey without licence, and could not to this
day, be permitted to speake to the Pope. Iustly therefore
may the priests exclayme, O miserable times? O wicked
manners of men? O cursed <hi>Parsons?</hi> O cruell bishoppe of
Rome? Doest thou send thy priests with the daunger of
their liues, to execute thine imployments, and when they
haue taken a long, painefull, and chargeable iourney, to
know thy further pleasure, in their doubts and distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in that behalfe, doest thou cause them to be imprisoned?
Doest thou punish them,<note place="margin">The Pope is a most cruell ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</note> before thou know any cause?
Doest thou condemne them, nay banish them, before thou
doest heare them speake? they truly haue deserued no lesse,
because they haue taken part with thee against their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
soueraigne. Yet is it a shame of all shames for thee,
to haue dealt so cruelly with them. They may see if they
haue but one eye left, that thou art neither Saint <hi>Peter</hi> nor
Christs lawfull vicar.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they were more strictly imprisoned at Rome,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
then the Iesuites are this day in England, though knowen
professed enemies to the crowne. For first, <hi>Parsons</hi> was the
chiefe Iaylour. Secondly, the priests were put in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eucrall
places of the prison so as the one could not speake with the
other. Thirdly, they could not be permitted to talke with
schollers,<note place="margin">Apologie. Page. 193.</note> nor the schollers to talke with them.<note place="margin">Page. 191.</note> This is a
good president. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:1553:91"/>
Fourthly, the notarie that penned the examination, was a
Iesuite, so as <hi>Parsons</hi> had his desire, in euerie respect.
These things put together with the former, the last clause
of the Cardinals letter, of <hi>Parsons</hi> his hasting to Ferrara,
will be euident.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Parsons</hi> fearing, that the Pope would make
some subordination in England, laboured by all meanes
possible,<note place="margin">Apologie. Page. 99.</note> that <hi>Blackwell</hi> might be the Arch-priest. I proue
this euidently. For first, the Pope willed that informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should be procured out of England, who were the
fittest men for gouernment. And yet <hi>Parsons</hi> confesseth,
that the opposite seculars were not acquainted therewith;
Albeit they were the fittest men, as I shall proue demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratiuely,
if any Iesuite will prouoke me thereunto. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the Protector demaunded the opinions, of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
English in Rome. And I pray you, who were these?
<hi>Parsons</hi> himselfe forsooth, and his brother Iesuite <hi>Baldwin,</hi>
lately come (for that intent) out of England, <hi>Haddocke</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
<hi>Martin Array,</hi> and <hi>Allen,</hi> all Iesuited vassals, and at his
commaund. Thirdly, diuers other principall men wrote
out of Spayne, to signifie the sufficiencie of <hi>Blackwel</hi> for his
Arch-presbiteran office, and that he should be the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
This doth <hi>Parsons</hi> or his flattering vassals at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signement,<note place="margin">Apologie. page. 99.</note> set downe in expresse termes in their Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.
Now I beseech the gentle reader, who is so blind,
as cannot see this malitious treacherie? <hi>Parsons</hi> seeketh
by hooke and by crooke to hide his false dealing, and yet
doth he vnwittingly bewray his owne villanie. Men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth

and they must write to the Protector at Rome, that <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
(whose sufficiencie they know not,) is a most suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
man. Hee and none but he, must gouerne all the
priests in England. Will ye know the reason? this <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
is Iesuited, (if not a close and secret Iesuite;) and
consequently, he being the gouernour, <hi>Parsons</hi> may rule
at his pleasure, and banish all that will not subscribe to
his treasons. For not onely the prests, but the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1553:91"/>
also; yea, the Pope himselfe must conclude and agrÃ©e,
to the Iesuites their designements. Who so will read
the instructions, which the Arch-priest is inioyned to
follow, can not possibly; but be of my opinion.</p>

                  <p>ANd as for that, which our discontented brethren do
cite in diuers places of their bookes, of Cardinall
<hi>Boromaeo</hi> of holy memorie, that he tooke the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of one of his seminaries in Millan from the fathers;
we haue informed our selues of the trueth, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of their owne will, and vpon their owne ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
suite; left the said gouernment of the great labour
and trouble thereof; as also some little difference in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
about the schollers education; which the good Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
would haue had somewhat more bare in their diet
and apparrel, then the fathers order in their seminaries did
permit. For which the holy Cardinall alledged no euill
reason: saying, that seeing they were to be sent after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
abroad to poore benefices among countrey people,
where they must faire hardly; they would refuse to goe,
beeing brought vppe after the diet of other seminaries.
But the fathers thought it easier for them to leaue this
gouerment, then to admit this difference, and so they
left it. And the good Cardinall did vse all the meanes
possibly he could, both there &amp; in Rome, to stay it in their
hands. These are the expresse words of <hi>Parsons</hi> his Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suited
vassals,<note place="margin">Apologie. page. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> or rather of <hi>Parsons</hi> himselfe in the said
Aplogie.</p>
                  <p>By these words, two things are cleare. The one, that
the Iesuites had once the gouernment, of one of the semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1553:92"/>
in Millan, vnder the iurisdiction of the Cardinall
<hi>Boromaeo;</hi> the other, that the said Cardinall was a good
man, and of holy memorie. Now the controuersie is this,
whether the good Cardinall disliked of their gouernment,
and therefore displaced them, or that the Iesuites were
wearie of the place, and therefore did voluntarily leaue it.
The seculars say, that the Cardinall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Iesuites denie it. But why would the Iesuites giue ouer
that gouernment, which they had once taken vpon them?
because forsooth, the good Cardinall would haue had
the schollers, to bee brought vp more barely in their diet
and apparrell. Thus they say, but the contrarie is the
truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For first, eyther the Cardinals allowance was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
or not sufficient. If it were not sufficient, then was he
not so good a man,<note place="margin">Note this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> nor of so holy memorie, as the priests
do affirme. If it were sufficient, then was that excessiue,
and consequently vitious, which the Iesuites did require,
then was their gouernment iustly disliked, then did they
shew themselues to be a prude and arrogant kinde of
people, that would not condescend to the Cardinall, in his
most lawfull demaund.</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, my selfe admiring, that the Iesuites kept not
that place which sometime they had in <hi>Millar,</hi> enquired di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
what should be the cause, for that I thought well
of the Iesuites, at that time indeed. And one of their owne
order, being then a Prefect in the English Colledge, (to say
nothing of the common report of others,) confessed frÃ©ely,
that the Cardinall could not brooke well their fathers, but
he would not in any case, shew the cause thereof. This to be
true, I protest before God, and his holy Angels.</p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:1553:92"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, they alledge a reason which they would haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
to be the Cardinals but both it is from themselues, and
doth consute themselues. The reason is this; <hi>viz.</hi> because
they were to be sent afterward abroad to poore benefices,
where they must fare hardly. But this reason is their owne,
and neuer framed by the Cardinall; and it is confuted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
waies. For first, they grant, (marke their words alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
cited) that the cardinals reason was good; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that the Iesuites were bad, and without all
reason, when they refused to yeeld vnto reason. Secondly,
where shall those benefices be found,<note place="margin">See Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, page. 224.</note> and in what country;
which are not sufficient to fill the priests belly? No where
doubtles; for the mainteynance of Popish priests, is too
great euery where. Yea, by the setled law of poperie,
(would God it were so in our english ministery,) euery
priest at the houre of his consecration, hath some title for
his sufficient maintenance; to say nothing of the huge
commodities, that doe dayly insue vpon his priestly functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And for this cause, the papists that now come into
England, where they haue no titles; are created <hi>ad titulum
sanctissimi,</hi> and so may iustly chalenge necessary mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Pope; howsoeuer he hath imprisoned the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,
but bestowed no <hi>viaticum</hi> on them at all, neither
great nor small.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, it followeth of the Iesuites their owne procÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
that they are vnfit men for gouernance. For it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all reason, to allow larger commons and more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
diet, to those that must be sent where no certaine main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
is so be had; and more bare and sparing diet, to
such as must haue well setled liuings. And yet doth the case
thus stand, by Iesuiticall precÃ©edings in the seminaries.
For they grant as you see, that the Cardinals reason was
good, (but it is their owne indeed,) in regard of the poore
benefices, which are farre larger and better, a wiseman
would thinke; then the vncertaine and accidentiall mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
of the Seminaries in this lande. But this
happely may bee gainesaide, in respect of the euerie
daye expected conquest; for other reason none can
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1553:93"/>
be yeelded, and yet this perforce must be reiected.</p>

                     <hi>Parsons</hi> that arrogant Iesuite, for his owne credite
if it would be; telleth vs in the apologie, in the 184.

were all dismissed thence, and yet brought againe and
placed in the colledge by his good meanes. Thus doth
this good fellow boast of his rare fauours towards the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
students, and his deserts in this behalfe are excÃ©eding
great, if we will beleeue him. But I assure thee gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
(whosouer thou art,) and I speake vpon mine owne
knowledge as who was at the same time one of the same
number; that this is to be enrolled, among his other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> vntruthes. For first, there was no disagreement
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1553:93"/>
at all, betwÃ©ene the late Bishop of <hi>Cassana</hi> and the students.
Againe, the contention was indeed, betweene the Cardinal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <hi>Morone</hi> then the protector of the English, and the students,
or rather the Iesuites; who like wilie foxes did all in all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly,
and yet would sÃ©eme openly, to be most vnwilling
to haue the gouerment of the colledge. Thirdly, <hi>Parsons</hi>
was at that time, a man of no reckening among the Iesuits; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
neither did he,<note place="margin">Apologie. p. 184. 1579. 1574.</note> or could hee doe anie thing in that behalfe.
The reason hereof is euident, because he confesseth in the
said apologie, that the colledge was erected in the yeare
1579. And that himselfe entered into the societie, in the
yeere 1574. so that he had then bÃ©ene Iesuite scantly foure
yeeres, whereof one must be allotted for his probation. now
if any wise man wil belÃ©eue him,<note place="margin">Parsons would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gladly haue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, but it will not be.</note> that he could be of such cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite

Maister <hi>Meredith,</hi> Maister <hi>Griffeth,</hi> Maister <hi>Morgan,</hi> M.
<hi>Elize,</hi> and sundrie others; but none better then Maister
<hi>Mush,</hi> if he list to speake the truth therein. Fourthly, there
were at that time Iesuited English men, of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
in that societie; who should rather haue done that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit
then this good father, if it had bÃ©ene but for comely
order sake; but as I said afore, the Iesuites would not be
knowen to deale in the matter. Fiftly, this good fellowe
(this good father I would say,) will needes bee the only <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
man, that procured the schollers to stay; and (a thing to bee
laughed at,) the graue and learned father <hi>Toledo,</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Cardinall,) was but an instrument to helpe the said
<hi>Parsons</hi> in his imployment. A shame it is for this fellow, to
tell of himselfe such a shamelesse lye. The truth is this; the
generall of the Iesuites was desirous indeed, to haue the
gouernment of the colledge, committed to his societie; as
who knew right well, that it would tend both to his credit,
and to his commoditie. But for feare of the displeasure of
Cardinall <hi>Morone,</hi> who tooke part with Maister <hi>Morice</hi>
the welch-man, whome he had designed to be the Rector of
the colledge; he neither would deale openly for the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
neither suffer any of the societie, to concurre with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:1553:94"/>
in that behalfe. yet he did that secretly, which was the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot,
and end of all; <hi>viz.</hi> he commanded by a secret mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
the reuerend father <hi>Toledo,</hi> a great learned man and
one of great reckening with the Pope at that time; that he
would instantly beseeth the Pope prostrate on his knees
before his holinesse, and to make a most pitifull lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the ouethrow of England. that is forsooth, that now
were reiected the finest wits; the most toward youthes; the
seede of poperie; and the only hope of the English nation,
who now exiled for zeale in religion, and come to be his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
vassals; must either be trained vp in papistry after the
Iesuiticall manner, or els should England neuer be recla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
world without end. this swÃ©et narration noe sooner
sounded in the Popes eares, but the commanded the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
to be receiued into the colledge againe. Where note
by the way what politicians the Iesuites bee. This <hi>Toledo</hi>
was a Iesuite, then remaining in the Popes house with
the Pope, and was the Popes chiefest aduiser, in all ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
causes. He then being a Iesuite, must needs doe the
designement of his generall, the maister Iesuite of all the
rest. For his profession was, to obey at a beck. And for that
he was present with the Pope, in his pallace <hi>Bel-v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>dÃ©re,</hi>
he was free to deale without suspition, in this great and
weightie matter. Lastly, being in high esteeme with the
Pope, and speaking in a cause so plausible and profitable
for his holinesse, he was most likely to preuaile in his suite.
which (I protest to the reader,) the Iesuits did more then
once promise to the schollers, before it came to passe. Thus
it is most apparant to euerie indifferent reader, that the
goodly story which <hi>Parsons</hi> telleth for his owne vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
is a lye with a witnesse. For the first credite that euer
he got, was wrought by his treacheries &amp; treasons against
his natiue country, most noble England. By reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he crept into such credite with the King of Spaine, that
now he is able to doe all in all, both with that Kinge and the
Pope himselfe. Wherefore my opinion is this, that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
are ouer matched, and that howsouer they bragge,
that they will haue audience, or els dye for it one after an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1553:94"/>
yet are they more like many of them, if they goe to
Rome to be cast into their holy most holy inquisition. for
<hi>Parsons</hi> hath now by the reason of their writings, matter
enough to worke vpon; and therefore their best course is,
to submitte themselues to Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and to
bid the Pope faire well with all his traytorous Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites.</p>

which hath diuerse euident falshoods, reproueable by
the witnesse, of all that liued at that time in England, both

<hi>Parsons</hi> containeth a lye so palpable and so notorious, as
I wonder how he could vtter it, without blushing. For
first, diuers of the seculars in England at that time, refuse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

which is most absurd to say or hold. Fourthly, his owne
disputation will confute it selfe. For after hee hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
told vs of his great paines in preaching, teaching, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
and namely in setting forth the reasons of refusall, of
going to the protestants Churches; hee forthwith addeth
these words; vpon which preaching and writing, when
many chiefe men refused to goe to hereticall seruice: there
was called a parliament in the end of the same yeere, and
the law of twentie pound a moneth for recusancie was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained;
but no capitall law made against priests or their

father Wiseman maketh for his honest purgation; if it may
stand good either in law, or with right reason. let vs examin
it, to know the truth therof. First, he granteth frÃ©ely, that by

of 20. pound the month,<note place="margin">Apologie page. 183.</note> was imposed for recusancie.
Secondly he granteth frÃ©ely, y<hi rend="sup">â€¢</hi> by his traytorous preaching
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and writing many chiefe men refused to goe to hereticall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> seruice. Thirdly, he granteth frÃ©ely, that he wrote against

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> likewise, that he termed the godly prayers vsed in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of England, hereticall seruice; and consequenly, hee
termed her maiestie an heretike, like an arrant traytour

and must perforce take parte with the Pope against the
Queene, as is already proued. And to this recusancie must
be ascribed, as to the principall cause; the enacting of all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall
lawes, and other penall mulcts whatsoeuer. I say, to
this recusancie, that is, to that recusancie to which treason
is annexed as an inseperable accident therof. For vntill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusancie
was so linked with popish treason,<note place="margin">Note this point well.</note> that disloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was thereby set a broach in euery corner, recusants did
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ioy all curtesie, libertie, &amp; freedome, Wherof this is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
argument, because all the capitall and other sharpe
penall statutes, did nothing at all touch the old popish recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants.
Albeit we sÃ©e this day, (which is to be imputed to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1553:95"/>
the traytorous Iesuites,) that other priests together with
the lay-people, are as deepely drowned in treasonable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
as the seminarie-priests. But what? Can <hi>Parsons</hi> say
nothing for him selfe? Yes forsooth; he telleth vs first, that
he was gon forth of England, before capitall lawes were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
made against priests, or their receiuers. Alas, alas,<note place="margin">Apologie. page. 183.</note> what
a poore shift is this? Nay, what a foolish man is this?
<hi>Parsons</hi> committed treason vpon treason, and then ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
for feare of the halter. <hi>Ergo</hi> the capitall lawes ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
were not made to preuent his and the like future trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
Euery child I weene, will sÃ©e the absurdity of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequution.
He telleth vs secondly, that in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pions</hi> arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(which was after <hi>Parsons</hi> his departure,) there was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
no one action of <hi>Parsons</hi> objected in particular against the
state, though he were known to haue bÃ©ene the superiour in
that mission. To this I reply, that the silence of <hi>Parsons</hi> in
<hi>Campions</hi> arraignment, cannot discharge <hi>Parsons</hi> of the
same or like treasons. Besides, it may be, that the state was
aduertised, how dastardly <hi>Parsons</hi> ran away; and that they
thought that their conniuence and silence in the matter,
would be an occasion of his returne, and then they would
talke with the good fellow. He telleth vs thirdly, that
<hi>Parsons</hi> was the chiefe in the Iesuiticall mission. which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
doubtlesse, doth vtterly confound the man. For sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the capitall lawes, were enacted onely and solely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Iesuites and their fauorites; it must needes bÃ©e
granted, it cannot be denied; that they were principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
against the principall Iesuite that is to say, against
<hi>Parsons</hi> who will needes be the chiefe. I therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the Iesuite, <hi>Parsons</hi> is a notorious lyar, and
that the lye which he would bestowe vpon others, is iustly
and fitly retorted against himselfe. See the fift chapter, in

manner of <hi>Parsons,</hi> to put his name to his bookes. The
secular priests haue truly vnfolded that secresie, in their
publike writings. And <hi>Parsons</hi> himselfe vnawares, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
no lesse in effect in this Apologie. Well,<note place="margin">Apologie. page. 172.</note> what doth <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
call euill edification? <hi>Richard Hadocke</hi> I am well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
spent his whole time or the greater part thereof, (sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting

hunting, carding, dicing, and licentious liuing, to say
nothing of other more homely, but lesse comely qualities.
Of which manner of liuing, he was sufficiently admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
I know when, where, and by whom, and can so
decipher all the particulars thereof, as himselfe shall
neuer be able to denie the same. I therefore conclude,
that when <hi>Parsons</hi> saith, it is false,<note place="margin">See Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, page. 126.</note> &amp;c. The falshood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from his owne stinking mouth. He indeed is the
libeller,<note place="margin">See also the fift and sixt chapters following. See Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. page. 294.</note> though it please him to bestow that name on the
seculars. But such good fellowes as <hi>Haddocke,</hi> must be
maintained, to bolster out master <hi>Parsons,</hi> and his detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
treacheries. For by his plotting to set the English
Crowne on the Spanish <hi>Infantaes</hi> head, he is become so
familiar with the Spanish king, and the Arch-dutchesse
<hi>Isabella</hi> his sister, that he is able with his word to set vp or
pull downe, all disloyall kil-princes in the world. Who
then dare write against him? the seculars haue entered the
combat, and if they faile in the conflict, a halter will be the
end. He sÃ©eketh by flatterie to make them yeeld, and to
bring them to submssion,<note place="margin">Apologie Page. 221. &amp; 222.</note> but if that be once done, <hi>actum est
de illis,</hi> they must enter into glorie, that is to say, into the
holy inquisition, where there they must eyther remaine <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuo,</hi>
or be bondslaues to <hi>Parsons</hi> and his Iesuited familie.
I might enlarge my selfe, in discoursing vpon many other

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, a notable contradiction in wordes of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
<hi>Parsons,</hi> who seemeth to repute himselfe the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiseman in the world. For in the former place he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs, that howsoeuer the treason be embraced, yet the
traytor is hated and contemned. But in the second place,
he singeth another song, for he commendeth the notorious
treason of sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> and defendeth him therein.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that all traytors which take part with the

right honest men. It is euident in <hi>Sir William Stanley,</hi>
a man in great esteeme with them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> was a notorious traytor,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
euen by the testimonie of the Iesuits; though they will not
grant so much in plaine termes. For of the said Cardinall,
this Apologie affirmeth foure things, as you haue heard.
First, that he wrote against English iustice, (done vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the seminaries.) Secondly, that hee wrote in defence of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the seminaries that were executed, and affirmed them to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
be martyrs. Thirdly, that he iustified sir <hi>William Stanleys</hi>

treasons,<note place="margin">Note here, that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular priests dostil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Allen in al things. See Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. p. 282.</note> and highly extolled him for the same. Fourthly,
that he published a most traytorous booke, against her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
and the State, in the yeare 1588. when the kings
Armado was on the seas. Adde hereunto for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
that the seminaries, who euer to this houre speake
most reuerently of that Cardinall, and did obey him du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

which master <hi>Bishop</hi> and master <hi>Charnocke</hi> had spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
the world, of the hard and iniurious dealing vsed
to them in Rome; which were contrarie to all truth, if the
good Iesuites words were of any credit. In one place of
the said letter, he hath these words: Master <hi>Bishop,</hi> it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now diuers moneths since you departed from hence,
and no one letter appearing yet from you, nor from your
friend master <hi>Charnocke;</hi> it made vs maruell, considering
your promise at your departure. In another place of the
same letter, he hath these words; by a state letter which I
receiued this weeke from you, I perceiue &amp;c. These are the
words of the Apologie. In which words, any man may
easily behold a flat contradiction. For, in the former place,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1553:98"/>
he denieth the receit of any one letter; but in the latter he
granteth, that he had receiued one stale letter. The secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
haue charged him with this contradiction, and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
that from May to Nouember is more then halfe a
yeare, in which time no letter was come from them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to their promises, vntill this present weeke. This
is the answere. To which answere, I reply in this manner.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I say first, that when <hi>Parsons</hi> saith, it is more then halfe a
yeare from May to Nouember, he is a lyar. For, from May
to Nouember, are onely fiue moneths; and yet do 12. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
concurre, to the complement of one yeare. Againe,
if he begin his supputation the first day of May, (which
is to reckon from Aprill rather then from May,) yet is it
but iust halfe a yeare; and consequently, <hi>Parsons</hi> affirming
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it to be more, is still a lyar.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Apologie. page. 176.</note> that his reckoning must end vpon the ninth
day of October, at which time <hi>Parsons</hi> wrote his letter; and
so perforce he is farre short of his halfe yeare, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
a lyar.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that when <hi>Parsons</hi> saith, from May to Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is more then halfe a yeare, in which time no letter was
come from them, he both contradicteth himselfe, and is an
impudent lyar. I proue it, because euerie child knoweth,
that betweene may and Nouember, intercÃ©edeth the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
of October; and yet as <hi>Parsons</hi> confesseth liberally, he
wrote his letter to master <hi>Bishop</hi> the ninth of that moneth,
and the same weeke receiued a stale letter firm the same
<hi>Bishop.</hi> So then, it is true, that <hi>Parsons</hi> receiued a letter
from master <hi>Bishop,</hi> in the moneth of October; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
it is false, that he receiued no letter from May
to nouember.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that the word (now) in <hi>Parsons</hi> his letter, doth
connotate the time present: that is, the time of the date
of his letter, to wit, the ninth of October; at which time
as he saith in one place, he had receiued no letter, but as
he saith in another place, he had that weeke receiued a
stale letter: <hi>Ergo, <hi>Parsons</hi>
                     </hi> is a stale lyar. This lye is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
<hi>in perpetuam res memoriam,</hi> by the word (yet,)
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:1553:98"/>
for when he saith, no one letter appearing from you yet; he
doth flatly contradict himselfe, when he saith, by a stale let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which I receiued this weeke from you.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that when <hi>Parsons</hi> saith,<note place="margin">See the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> the reports of the hard and

                     </hi> the Iesuite, and marchandizer of

is a bastard, and a man of bad demeanour, the fift chapter

in his Apologie,<note place="margin">Quodl. 4. art. 2. page. 109.</note> laboureth to purge himselfe thereof; I
haue thought it good, to speake a little to that effect in this
place. <hi>Watson</hi> the secular priest hath these words; we may
not imagine, that father <hi>Parsons</hi> was ignorant of his owne
base estate, as being a sacrilegious bastard in the worst
sense, <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where he was borne, vpon the bodie of a verie base queane.
This then being so, and he not so senselesse as to thinke, but
that he will find the Canon law more strict in dispensation
with him for his irregularitie, then the ciuill or common
law, will be for dispensation to inherit; there is no question
to be made of it, but that some close statute and prouiso was
closely made, and couertly foysted into the high councel of
reformation, for enabling some bastards in the spitefullest
sense, to be capable of any honour or dignitie, eyther in
the Church or commonwealth. And true it is, that this
good father <hi>Parsons <hi>(alias Cowbucke,) filius populi &amp; filius
peccati,</hi>
                     </hi> or the very fiend himselfe, might be chosen to a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
by his doctrine, if any people would be so madde, as
to chuse him for their king. Thus doth our Quodlibetst
write. The same <hi>Watson</hi> in an other place, writeth of the

thus doth priest <hi>Watson</hi> write, you haue his owne words.

boy in his youth, that during his aboade at Oxford, his
conuersation was seditious, wanton, and factious, and that
for his libelling and other misdemeanour, he was thrust
out of Balyoll colledge. Againe in an other place, he hath
these words, I meane the great Emperour illegitimate,

his turbulent head and lewd life, would be a discredite to

all, that haue throughly conuersed with him, is this; that
he is of a furious, passionate, hote, cholericke, exorbitant
working humour, busie headed, and full of ambition, enuy,
pride, rancour, malice, and reueng. Cursed bee the houre,
wherein he had the name of a Priest, nay of an irreligious
parson, nay of a temporall lay-man Iesuite, nay of a catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
nay of a christian, nay of a humane creature; but of a
beast, or a deuill; a violater of all lawes; a contemner of all

a corrupter of all honestie and a monopole of all
mischiefe. These are the words of <hi>William Watson,</hi> the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
secular priest. <hi>quodl. 8. art. 5. page.</hi> 236. See the fift
chapter of the second booke, in the first, second, and third

                  <p>By these sections, especiallie the fourth and fift, euery
man may easily see,<note place="margin">Of the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by Parsons, see Colleto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> page. 126.</note> that the Iesuite <hi>Parsons</hi> is not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
impudent lyar, but also a most bloodie and scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
traytor, the monopole of all mischiefe, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedst
man vpon the face of the earth. The reports recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of this Iesuite, cannot but seeme strange, if not incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to all that shall pervse the same. I know it is sinne to
lie on the deuill; and therefore I will not affirme any lye
of this Iesuite, nor of any other man. That which I haue
written of him, is most true and sincere, in such sort as I
haue put in downe. I name my authors, and their words,
the tale, and the tale-teller; the assertions, and the places
where they are to bee reade. I graunt willingly, and
will it not denie, that I haue set downe in this discourse,
many sharpe obseruations, annotations, correlaries, &amp; illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but all are deduced by necessary and euident conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s,
out of those premises and antecedent propositions;
which the secular priests and Iesuites haue published in
printed bookes, to y<hi rend="sup">â€¢</hi> view of the whole worlde. In regard
whereof; neither my selfe, nor any others guided by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1553:101"/>
of right reason, can but giue credit to the same. For
first, the authors thereof are many, and the same of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and learning. and yet doe they charg the Iesuits with
murdering of Kings. Secondly, they professe euen to death,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the selfe same religion with the Iesuites. Thirdly, they all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
yeeld themselues in all thinges, to the censure of the pope;
at whole tribunall the Iesuite must needes preuaile, if his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
case and cause bÃ©e good. Fourthly, they are subiect to such
satisfaction, if their accusations should be false; as publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
pennance must nÃ©edes be inioyned them, and that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily;
so as they shall neuer be permitted to exequute priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
function, while there liues shall endure. Fiftly, they
know, that if such haynous accusations, powred out against
their fellow-priests, especially against their religious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
were false and vttred of malice; they should thereby
heape Gods heauy wrath, and vengeance vpon themselues.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
Sixtly, they cannot be ignorant, that all the world would
hate and detest them to their liues end, if such their reports
of killing of princes and the like, should be proued false and
slaunderous. So then, the reports made of the Iesuite <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
supposed to be true, and constantly admitted for such; it

Apologie,<note place="margin">Parsons is a great ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, well worthey of the wet-stone.</note> cunningly fassioneth a narration lasting for foure
of the first leaues, but with addition of moe vntruths, then
he vsed full points in the tale. Hence suddenly arose
an vrgent, or as it were, a fatall necessitie in father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
conceit; of making a superiour in England, ouer the

and father <hi>Parsons</hi> themselues, hauing their owne words

letter of thankesgiuing to his holinesse, for institution

that hearing how we went about in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
to make a superiour among our selues,<note place="margin">Colleion, page. 126. page. 127.</note> he thought it
wisedome to preuent the effecting of such our indeuours, by

then, he said he had receiued a resolution from the mother

date the 22. of Feburarie, 1600. writeth thus; I determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that hereafter whosoeuer had faculties of me, he should
first be content to recall his peeuish opinion; terming the
opinion pÃ©euish, that doth not hold vs for schismatikes.
Furthermore, your reuerence affirmed the assertion of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Iones</hi> a priest of the societie to bee true, auowing all
those to incurre presently the censure of holy Church, who
should stiffely defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d, that we were no schismatikes. Which
position you againe ratified, in your letters the 14. of March

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Blackewell</hi> sent forth a most arrogant, absurd,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
and diabolicall decrÃ©e, against both the clergie and the laity,
in these words; I <hi>George Blackewell</hi> arch-piest in England,

they were sometime, (howsoeuer they be now,) as dÃ©epely

these men haue bÃ©ene busie, as farre as their power or credit
wil reach, or as any prince would hearken to them, or deale

in matters of succession,<note place="margin">They sent Watson with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> and haue tempered also with the
king of France, by others of their consorts to like effect, as
the Lords themselues of her maiesties councell cannot but

that they and theirs are innocent in these affaires, &amp; onely
Iesuites and their friends doe deale therein, and so master

               <p>Out of these words I note first, that the secular priestes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
are heere charged with disloyall dealing, against their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
soueraigne, by plotting not onely with the king of
Scotland, but also with the king of France.</p>
               <p>I note secondly, that the seculars are as guiltie of trayto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
practises and treasonable complots, as the hautie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

               <p>I note thirdly, that the Iesuite <hi>Parsons</hi> doth hÃ©ere vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

               <p>I therefore conclude this discourse, that seeing on the

and seeing on the other side, that the secular priests
are bad fellowes, no better then southsayers and idolaters,
and that by the verdict of the Iesuites, and sÃ©eing withall,
that both the secular priests and the Iesuites, professe one

all men and women, noble and ignoble, learned and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

account, and high estÃ©eme euen in the Church of Rome,
cannot but behold as in a glasse of Christall, that the late

the ancient Roman religion was in dÃ©ed sincere, and
agrÃ©eable to the holy scripture, but the late Romish religion,
is quite contrary to the same. This I proue by two means:

the late order of the Capuchenes, who affirme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selues to
be nothing else, but only reformed Franciscans, as the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

did by little and little, neglect and abolish the ancient
rules of their order,<note place="margin">Let this be well mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note> and brought into their societie, nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and new deuises in stead therof, and therefore were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the Capuchenes, and called home again to their

old setled rules, euen so the late bishops of Rome, haue neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and swarued from the ancient doctrine of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 18.</note> and brought into the Church nouelties &amp; new

of best approued popish writers. The great learned

to these inordinate dispensations, &amp; to this so miserable
state where we are neither able to endure our owne griefs,
nor remedie assigned for the same. And therefore must we
perforce inuent some other way, for conseruation of the
lawes. Giue me <hi>Clements, Lines, Siluesters,</hi> and I will
commit all things to their charge. But to speake nothing
grieuously against these latter Popes, they are doubtles
inferiour to Popes of old time, by many degrÃ©es.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loe heere gentle reader, the Popes owne renowned doctor

degenerate, from the ancient doctrine and discipline of the

the truth, was not done all at once, but was brought by little
and little into the Church. Thus you see or may see, that the
doctrine I teach, is the selfesame, which I receiued from the
best learned papists. The Popes famous Canonist <hi>Covaruvias,</hi>
writeth to the same effect in these words. <hi>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

am I ignorant, that S. <hi>Thomas</hi> affirmeth after great delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that the bishop of Rome cannot with his dispensation,
take away from monks their solemne vow of chastitie. This
notwithstanding,<note place="margin">Couarr. 10. 1. cap. 20. par. 11. in med.</note>
we must defend the first opinion, least those
things which are practised euery where, be turned vp side
downe. Thus writeth <hi>Coueruvias,</hi> out of whose doctrine, many
godly &amp; profitable lessons may be learned. First, that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
cannot agree about the Popes authority. Secondly, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
great learned papists, among whom <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> is one,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1553:106"/>
(whose doctrine sundry Popes haue confirmed to be sound,) do
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> denie the Popes authoritie in the premisses. Thirdly, that the
contrarie opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> must be defended, for the honesty &amp; safegard
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the Popes pretensed soueraigntie. Fourthly, that most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
is the Popes religion, which stand in need of such poore
and beggerly shifts, for the vpholding &amp; maintenance therof.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, that the papists haue no cause to exclaime against the
mariage of priests, seeing the Pope dispenseth with his owne
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> munks to marry at their pleasure. Sixtly, that the doctrine of
Aquinas which the Pope himselfe hath approued, doth vtterly
ruinate and batter to the ground, the lately inuested religion
of the Church of Rome. Now, for the better satisfaction of the
ignorant, I will heere briefely recount the originall, of the
chiefest points and articles in the late Romish religion.</hi>
