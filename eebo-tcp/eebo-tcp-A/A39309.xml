            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat we may not build too <hi>large</hi> a <hi>Porch</hi> to so <hi>small</hi> an <hi>House,</hi> we shall only premise, That the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion hath <hi>often Suffered,</hi> but <hi>never taught</hi> or countenanced <hi>Persecution;</hi> That it was the <hi>Persecuting Jews,</hi> not the <hi>Persecuted Apostle,</hi> who cry'd <hi>Men of Israel, help,</hi> Acts 21. 28. That these <hi>Petitioners</hi> against us, have nothing to Charge us with of <hi>Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> nothing against the <hi>Publick Peace,</hi> nothing but what concerns our <hi>Religion:</hi> Which is an implicit Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment (at least) that they are in the same Streight to find out Matter of Accusation against us, that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Adversaries were in, to find Matter against him; who thereupon ingeniously confest, <hi>We shall not find any Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion against this</hi> Daniel, <hi>except we find it against him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Law of his God,</hi> Dan. 6. 5.</p>
            <p>We begin with the <hi>Norfolk Petition,</hi> as that which (we understand) was contrived first, and probably led on the other.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> 'Tis probable, the <hi>little Zeal</hi> (unless for Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance) the <hi>Petitioners</hi> have observed in their own <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested</hi> Teachers, makes the Zeal of those they Petition against so observable to them. But they may do well also to observe (which if they will not, it may be hoped, They to whom they have Petitioned, will) how much this Charge, of <hi>Restless Zeal,</hi> renders us like unto the <hi>Apostles</hi> and Primitive Christian <hi>Teachers,</hi> whose <hi>Restless Zeal</hi> would not suffer them to <hi>sit</hi> down, and <hi>rest</hi> in a Fat Benefice (with a <hi>Curat</hi> to perform the Service for them:) But made them <hi>Travel</hi> into most of the then Civilized Parts of the World, as the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Histories</hi> shew.

                  <hi>Obs.</hi> The Petitioners should have done well to have given the Ground of this <hi>Suspicion</hi> of theirs, if they had any to give, that it might have been examined. But to <hi>Suggest</hi> (for it is probable this came, è <hi>Suggesto,</hi> out of the <hi>Pulpit:</hi> For <hi>Justices,</hi> we hope, would deal more <hi>justly</hi>) so <hi>Scandalous</hi> a Matter, upon a <hi>bare Suspicion,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out assigning any Ground for it, is (to speak modestly of it) an <hi>Evil-Surmising,</hi> and <hi>against Charity:</hi> For <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> (we are assured, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5.) <hi>thinks no Evil.</hi> And since <hi>Charity</hi> is so excellent a Christian Vertue, as to be preferr'd to both <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> verse 13.

to find <hi>so little Charity</hi> among the Justices and Grand Jurors of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> This Suspicion of <hi>Romish Emissaries</hi> going under the Disguise of <hi>Quakers,</hi> is indeed an <hi>old Scandal</hi> rais'd by <hi>our profest Enemies,</hi> the Priests, above Forty Years ago, and by them industriously spread, and kept up ever since, on purpose to Traduce us to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort of People. But is it not strange, that if this had been true, not one <hi>single Instance</hi> could be given, not <hi>one Proof</hi> made in all this time, of one Romish Emissary found among the <hi>Quakers!</hi> This alone is enough to baffle the Slander: which it hath done already with considerate Persons. Therefore, without taking further notice of it here, we will conclude with Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Motto (used while she was Princess, Persecuted and a Prisoner) <hi>viz. <hi>Much suspected by me.

Demonstrable!</hi> Not yet <hi>Demonstrated</hi> then, it seems, tho' for these Forty Years, and more, it has been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured. <hi>Hard</hi> Words and <hi>Ill</hi> Names may easily be put upon the <hi>best Books</hi> and <hi>Principles.</hi> And there is no Book or Principle, which may not, by <hi>Perversion</hi> and <hi>Misconstruction,</hi> be made to look and sound <hi>Ill.</hi> But sure we are (and always ready to make appear) that neither are our <hi>Books</hi> Blasphemous, nor our <hi>Principles</hi> Pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The <hi>Eundamentals</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> we heartily Own, and Assert as <hi>Boldly</hi> and Vigorously as any. And how far we have been from <hi>undermining the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> our Practice, well known throughout these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, is the best Demonstration.</p>

               <p>Pet. The Publishing whereof, by pretended Permission of the Government, is of most dangerous Consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> Pray give the <hi>Government</hi> leave to judge of that. So long as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> could stop the Publishing of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51666:5"/>
any <hi>Books</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> but her own, the Christian World lay very Snug, in a deep <hi>Sleep</hi> of <hi>Darkness</hi> and Profound <hi>Ignorance,</hi> which she had lul'd it into, which was what she desired. And if the first <hi>Reformers</hi> had been debarr'd the Liberty of <hi>Publishing</hi> their <hi>Books,</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> the <hi>Reformation</hi> must either not have been be gun, or greatly retarded in the carrying of it on, and <hi>Popery</hi> might have prevailed still. It is a sure <hi>Maxim,</hi> that <hi>Truth is Strongest.</hi> And therefore, they who have <hi>Truth on their side,</hi> and who know their own Principles to be <hi>Sound,</hi> need not fear the Publishing of Principles by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for if those Principles publish'd by others be <hi>true,</hi> they co-operate with theirs; and therein they have Cause to rejoyce: If <hi>false,</hi> they have thereby a fair Occasion given them, by exposing and confuting the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> thereof, to illustrate more clearly, and establish more firmly, the true Principles asserted by themselves; and for that they have no cause to be Sorry.</p>
               <p>Thus for the Petition out of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the <hi>Prayer</hi> of which shall be considered together with that from <hi>Bury,</hi> which will help to explain one another.</p>
               <p>The Petition from <hi>Bury</hi> speaks in the Name of <hi>The Alderman, Assistant Justice, chief Burges and Burgesses of the Common Council, in behalf of themselves and other the Inhabitants of that Burrough;</hi> And in it they say,</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>Pet. That we, considering all Ancient Hoeresies, which have vexed both Church and State, were never so formidable in their Rise and Progress, as are the Quakers.</p>

                  <hi>Obs.</hi> Are then the <hi>Alderman</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> of <hi>Bury</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and versed in, <hi>All Ancient Haeresies?</hi> Or do they rely upon the <hi>assistance</hi> of their <hi>assistant Justice?</hi> Or do both They and He take this upon trust from some not very trusty <hi>Parson.</hi> Have they read, examined, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the vexation, the Spoil, the Havock, of both E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states and Lives, and almost Desolation, made in both

            <div type="part">
               <p>Pet. We have too just a Cause of dreading the Subversion of our Government by them, if not carefully prevented and suppressed.</p>

                  <hi>Obs.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> So did the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> object to the <hi>Protestants</hi> in general upon the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as Bp. <hi>Jewel,</hi> in his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> for the Church of England, observes, <hi>Clamant hodie passim</hi> (says he, p. 7.) <hi>Nos omnes esse Haereticos, discessis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se</hi> à <hi>side,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They cry out now a-days, That we are all Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, That we are departed from the Faith,</hi> &amp;c. But if that was a <hi>false Charge</hi> against them; we are sure, this is <hi>not a true Charge</hi> against us.

               <p>Pet. Having their Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly and Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meetings, which we cannot but reasonably believe tend, not only to the Subversion of our Laws, but of our Religion also, to us of greater concerns than our Lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> To <hi>Believe</hi> is one thing; to believe <hi>reasonably</hi> (or to have <hi>Reason</hi> to believe, is another thing: Which if these Petitioners pretend to have, they should (if they expected to be believed) have assigned the Reasons of their so <hi>believing.</hi> Well known it is to the Nation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and to the Government in particular, that we have had Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly and Yearly Meetngs (and those <hi>the same</hi> that now we have, and for thesame Services) many Years before the Government was pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to grant the present Indulgence; yea, and that in the times of the greatest Troubles, and hotest Persecutions:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51666:7"/>
Which was an Evidence, <hi>beyond bare saying so,</hi> That our Religion was of greater Concern to us than our Lives. But what one single Act or thing have any, or all of those Meetings of ours produced, in all this time, that has tended to the <hi>Subversion</hi> of the Laws, or Estáblished Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Do not both the one, and the other, <hi>stand</hi> now, at this very day, as <hi>Safe</hi> and <hi>Firm</hi> as ever they did, at least for us? Can it reasonably be supposed, that if those Meetings of ours had so <hi>dangerous</hi> a Tendency, as to <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi> the Laws and Religion of the Nation, the <hi>Piercing</hi> Eye of the <hi>Government</hi> should not see it as well, and as soon, as the <hi>Aldermen</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> of <hi>Bury?</hi> How come they, now all of a sudden, to be so <hi>Eagle-Ey'd,</hi> to pretend to see that, which <hi>their Betters</hi> (and who have much <hi>better</hi> Advantages for seeing) could never yet see! For can it be imagined, that if our <hi>Governours</hi> had seen, or suspected, our Meetings to have so <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Dangerous</hi> a Tendency, as is here Suggested, they would so Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously have <hi>Indulged those Meetings,</hi> and granted us a <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi> thus to hold them: We wish these Petitioners would think well of this; and consider whether it was <hi>decent</hi> for the <hi>Aldermen</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> of <hi>Bury</hi> thus to <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach</hi> the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of the <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto they have spoken in the <hi>Accusative</hi> Case: They now turn to the <hi>Vocative,</hi> Invoking the Parliament against us. As therefore we have made brief Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Charges: Let us now, as briefly, take notice of the <hi>Prayer</hi> in each Petition; which we chose to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider together, because one seems to explain the other.</p>
               <p>That out of <hi>Norfolk</hi> must be acknowledged to speak the more modestly of the two. For it Prays the House of Commons, <hi>To take these things</hi> (the Charges in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Petition mentioned) <hi>into Consideration, that the said Principles and Practices may be strictly Examined, and Censured, or Supprest, as they shall appear to deserve, and as</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:51666:7"/>
                  <hi>in their great Wisdom shall seem expedient.</hi> Nor is it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destistute of some <hi>Shew</hi> of Tenderness towards us: For it prays This may be done, <hi>With whatsoever Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the Persons and Estates of these People.</hi> But as it can hardly be conceived, how <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> flowing therefrom (especially where <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> as these Petioners say, is <hi>vouched for Warrant thereof</hi>) can be <hi>Supprest,</hi> without exercising great <hi>Cruelty</hi> (the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pósite</hi> to <hi>Tenderness</hi>) on the <hi>Persons</hi> or <hi>Estates</hi> of the People, whose Principles and Practices they are: So, if the <hi>Prayer</hi> of the other <hi>Petition</hi> from <hi>Bury</hi> (which was Formed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, and comes from their near Neighbours) may pass for a <hi>Comment</hi> upon the <hi>Norfolk-Text,</hi> it will not be very difficult to find, what, in the softer <hi>Norfolk</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect, is meant by <hi>Suppressing our Principles and Practices.</hi> For the <hi>Alderman</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> of <hi>Bury</hi> say, <hi>We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, oblig'd in Duty to God and our Country, do humbly pray your timely Consideration of our Jealousies, and remove our Fears; if not by totally Suppressing, yet at least by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting their after Growth and Increase amongst us.</hi> Here, after an acknowledgment, that ali those High Charges, exhibited against us in the <hi>Petition,</hi> are grounded but upon their own (groundless) <hi>Jealousies,</hi> they (how man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly, let others judge) offer the Parliament <hi>Hobson's Choice,</hi> either <hi>totally to Suppress us,</hi> or at least to <hi>prevent our after Growth and Increase;</hi> which perhaps cannot be done, without <hi>totally</hi> suppressing us; or if it could, must needs tend to a <hi>total Suppressing</hi> of us. Now if they, who have declared <hi>their Religion to be of greater Concern to them than their Lives,</hi> could find in their Hearts to have so much Charity for their Neighbours, as to admit <hi>our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religion to be of greater Concern to us than our Lives</hi> (which we think we have given a <hi>full proof</hi> of, to say no more, as ever they have done) they might thence reasonnably conclude, that we will part with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51666:8"/>
our <hi>Lives,</hi> rather than with our <hi>Religion;</hi> and that there is no way <hi>totally to Suppress us,</hi> but by <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Throats,</hi> or <hi>Knocking out our Brains:</hi> Which must therefore be supposed to be their Meaning. And would they have the <hi>Honourable</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> Assembled, undertake this Inhumane Piece of <hi>Butchery,</hi> to <hi>desile</hi> their hands in the <hi>innocent Blood</hi> of so many <hi>Thousands</hi> of harmless, peaceable and industrious People, who are their <hi>Fellow Citizens,</hi> and <hi>Fellow-Commoners,</hi> and by the <hi>Suffrages</hi> of some of whom, many of themselves were <hi>Elected</hi> into that Honourable Society; and to Act, or Enact, so Barbarous a Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, only to <hi>remove</hi> the groundless <hi>Fears</hi> of a few <hi>Jealous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Headed Alderman</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> of <hi>Bury;</hi> who seem to have forgotten what is written of some (whom they in this too nearly resemble) who were said to have been <hi>in great Fear, where no</hi> (cause of) <hi>Fear was,</hi> Psal. 53. 5.</p>
               <p>They close their Petitions; That out of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> thus.</p>

And for <hi>Enthusiastical Innovations;</hi> as we do not own the word in that sense, in which they <hi>abusively</hi> apply it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51666:8"/>
to us (tho' <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> or God's speaking by his Spirit in the Heart of man, we do own) so we always offer our <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> to be <hi>Examined</hi> by the Holy Scriptures; which were written by <hi>Divine Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and are best understood by the Inspiration of the <hi>same Spirit</hi> by which they were written.</p>
               <p>To the Second we say, We desire, as well as they, that their Posterity may live untroubled: But we think they might have done well to have considered, that <hi>we have Posterity,</hi> as well as they; and the like Inducements from natural Affection, to wish that our Posterity may live untroubled as they for theirs. Sure we are, and it is but too obvious, that we have more cause to apprehend Trouble and Danger too, to our Posterity from them and theirs, than they or theirs from us or ours; For tho' we have done nothing, since we were a People, that might either give Trouble to them, or threaten it to their Posterity; they stick not here openly to propose, and seek the <hi>Ruin</hi> and <hi>Extirpation</hi> of both <hi>us</hi> and <hi>our Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> They desire they may enjoy the wisht for Happiness of a Peaceful Life. We envy it them not: But God forbid they should <hi>Swim</hi> into it through a <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Innocent Blood.</hi> Can they find no way to the wisht-for Happiness of a Peaceful Life, but by the <hi>Destruction</hi> of their <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Subjects</hi> and <hi>Peaceable</hi> Neighbours? Had not <hi>Self-love</hi> (to say no worse) been more prevalent with them (or with their <hi>Envious</hi> Guides, who probably have anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to these Malicious Counsels) than <hi>Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> (which seeks the Good and Happiness of all, and teaches to love our Neighbours as our selves) they would have been Content, that <hi>we also should enjoy the wisht-for Happiness of a Peaceful Life.</hi> But since they are so <hi>uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable</hi> to <hi>grutch</hi> us that, and so <hi>unchristian</hi> to seek to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave us of it;</hi> We humbly address our selves, in the first place, to Almighty God (<hi>the sure Refuge of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>)
