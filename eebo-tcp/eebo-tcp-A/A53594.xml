            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Pamphlets,
Sirs, now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
thrust
so fast out of
the Press, that they will
not give the Readers time
to breath; this was the
misery of <hi>Iuvenals</hi> time,
<pb facs="tcp:57469:3"/>
and I may cry as he did,
<hi>Semper ego auditor tantum?</hi>
But yet there is one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
<hi>periturae non parcere
chartae.</hi> Yet what shall
be the Subject? Novelty.
No. Hang it, then must
it be laught at and jeared
in every Coffee-house, and
be subject to the Old mens
Tobacco-pipes to bring
them fire. But Coffee-houses
are going down,
you l say: Faith that's one
comfort; for I heard such
damming of a Pamphlet
<pb facs="tcp:57469:3"/>
there once, that I thought
they had sate on the Life
and Death of the Author:
Besides, I know some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
hate new Fashions, as
much as an old <hi>Don</hi> in the
University, hates <hi>Burgerdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
Logick; because he
was taught in <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shall the Matter be old
then as the <hi>Prae-adamites?</hi>
No, that's foolish too—
O Gramercy mine old
grete Granfader, now me
<pb facs="tcp:57469:4"/>
seemeth to think on his
wholesome Saw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <q>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So then I must write
what's neither new nor
old; in a Dialect that is
both dawbed over with
Novelty, and hath An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
for its ground.
Have at 'um then, and let
any Novice say what he
will; since there is a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
built to Antiquity,
<pb facs="tcp:57469:4"/>
what ever the World may
say of my Superstition, I
am resolved to fix this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet

Prince CORNIGER,

CRUCIFRAG.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O it befell upon a
time after the Death of King
<hi>Mort,</hi> who was
wounded in battaile by his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that he died; when all
his good Knights and Barons,
passing stout men of bodies
were gedred togyder in their
their Castle, to make a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile-general
and a great Justs,
after they were come thider,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57469:26"/>
and lodged as them seemed
best, there came a Damesel
which was sent on a message
from the great Lady of the Isle
of <hi>Witch;</hi> and when she came
before them, she let her mantel
fall that was very richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and then was she girded
with a noble Swerd, whereof
the Knights had great marvail,
and said, Damesel, for what
cause are you girded with this
Swerd? it beseemeth you not.
This Swerd, said the Damesel,
that I am girded withall, doth
me great sorrow and encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:
for I may not be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of this Swerd, but by a
good Knight, and he must be
a passing brave man of his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57469:26"/>
hands, and of his deeds, and
without villany and treachery:
For I have been with King <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liobarb,</hi>
'cause it was told me
that there were passing good
Knights with him, but none of
them can speed. Then they all
pulled at it eagerly, but the
Swerd would not out. Sirs,
said the Damesel, ye need not
pull half so hard, for he that
shall pull it out, shall do it with
little might, and he must be a
clean Knight, of gentle stream
both of fader and mothers
side.</p>
            <p>Now it hapned so at that
time, that there was a poor
Knight, which had been priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with King <hi>Mort</hi> half a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57469:27"/>
year, for sleying of a Knight
that was his Cousin; this
Knight was named <hi>Corniger,</hi>
('cause his Crest was a pair of
Horns) and by the good means
of the Barons he was delivered
out of Prison after the Kings
Death; for he was a passing
good Knight. So he went pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
to the Castle, and saw this
adventure, whereof his heart
rose, and would assail it as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Knights did; but for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was poorly arrayed,
they put him not far in price.
Netheless he called the Damesel,
and said, I pray you of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
to suffer me as well to assay
as these Lords; though I be
poor clothed, in my heart me
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57469:27"/>
seemeth I am fully assured to
speed right well. The Damesel
beheld the Knight, but for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his poor array she
thought he should be of no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
without villany or treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery.
Ah fair Damesel, said Sir
<hi>Corniger,</hi> worthiness and good
deeds are not all onely in ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but manhood, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and hardiness is not in
cloathing. In sooth, said the
Damesel, you say true, therefore
you shall assay to do what you
will; then he took the Swerd
by the Girdle and Scabberd, and
drew it out easily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when
he looked upon the Swerd, it
pleased him moche. Then the
Barons had great mervail that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57469:28"/>
Sir <hi>Corniger</hi> had done the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.
Truly, said the Dame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
this is a passing good Knight,
and the best man that ever I
found, and most of worship
without treachery and villany;
and many mervails shall he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve.
Wherefore all the
Knights and Barons cry'd all at
once, We will have Sir <hi>Corniger</hi>
unto our King: for we all see
that it is Goodness will that he
should be our King, and who
so holdeth against it, we will
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lee him. And thereupon they
kneeled down all at once both
rich and poor, and cry'd Prince
<hi>Corniger</hi> mercy, because he had
been imprisoned; and Prince
<hi>Corniger</hi> forgave it them: And
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57469:28"/>
so anon there was Coronation
made, and there was he sworn
to the Lords and Commons for
to be a true King, to stand with
true Justice from henceforth
all the days of his life. So he
became their King, and let cry
a great Feast.</p>
            <p>But many Complaints were
made unto Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> of
great wrongs that were done
by their Enemies, sithen the
Death of King <hi>Mort,</hi> of many
Londs that were bereaved of
their Lords, Knights, Ladies,
and Gentlemen; wherefore
the King came out of his Towre
to the Ambassadours, and there
went with him Sir <hi>Cruel,</hi> Sir
<hi>Rasour,</hi> and Sir <hi>Kilman;</hi> these
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57469:29"/>
were the men of most worship
that were with him. And
whan they met togider, there
was but little meekness; for
there was stout and hard words
on both sides, but always Prince
<hi>Corniger</hi> answered them, He
would make them blow if he
lived: wherefore they depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with wrath; and Prince
<hi>Corniger</hi> bid them keep them
well, and they bid Prince <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niger</hi>
keep him well. So the
Prince returned to his Castle,
and armed him and all his
Knights; in the mean while
there were three hundred good
men of the best that went strait
to Prince <hi>Corniger,</hi> and that
comforted him greatly. And
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57469:29"/>
Sir <hi>Cruel,</hi> Sir <hi>Rasour,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Kilman</hi> slew on the right hand
and on the left, and did mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailous
deeds of Arms, that the
King had great joy of their
deeds and hardiness, But the
Enemies came on afresh behind
them, and perplexed Prince
<hi>Cornigers</hi> Knights; wherefore
Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> drew his Swerd
which was so bright in his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
eyes, that it gave light like
thirty Torches, and therewith
he put them back, and slew moch
people.</p>
            <p>So in little space the Enemy
fled, and Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to his Castle; where he
found a passing fair fellowship,
and well beseen, whereof he
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57469:30"/>
had great joy, and victuals they
wanted none.</p>
            <p>Next day Prince <hi>Corniger</hi>
with his good and trusty
Knights set upon his Enemies
so fiercely, that they overthrew
their Pavilions on their heads,
but by manly Prowess of Arms
they were forced to take a fair
field; and when it grew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
day, Sir <hi>Fierce</hi> smote
down Horse and Man, and Sir
<hi>Rasour</hi> cut an infinite company
of heads off, and Sir <hi>Kilman</hi>
slew many a valiant Knight, so
the meddle waxed passing
great and hard on both parties.
But when Sir <hi>Fierce</hi> saw Sir
<hi>Cruel</hi> on foot, he ran like a
Lyon upon Sir <hi>Meddlemuch</hi> his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57469:30"/>
Enemy, and smote him through
the left side, that horse and
man fell down to the ground:
Then he took the horse by the
Rayns, and led him to Sir <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
and said, Have thou this
Horse, mine old Friend, for
grete need hast thou of an
Horse. Gramercy, said Sir
<hi>Cruel,</hi> and lightly mounted. So
then he saw Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> do
mervailously, that all men had
wonder thereof; for he smote
King <hi>Boldenough</hi> on the Helm,
that a quarter of the Helm and
half the Shield fell down, and
so the Swerd carved down unto
the Horse neck; and so both
Horse and Man fell to the
ground. But there came four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57469:31"/>
Knights upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
then he smote one of them on
the Helm, and it went down to
the Teeth; and he rode to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and smote him that his
Arm flew into the Field; then
he went to the third, and smote
him on the Shoulder, that both
Shoulder and Arm flew into
the Field; and he smote ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Knight on the Neck, that
Head and Helm went to the
earth: So Sir <hi>Cruel,</hi> Sir <hi>Fierce,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Rasour,</hi> and Sir <hi>Kilman</hi>
by Prince <hi>Cornigers</hi> example,
smote off Heads, Legs, and
Arms wonderfully. So the
Battle was passing hardy, that
many Knights shook and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for eagerness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:57469:31"/>
Then Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> seeing
the Battle wou'd not be ended
by no manner, he faced like a
Wood Lyon, and stirred his
Horse here and there, on the
right hand and on the left, that
he stinted not till he had slain
twenty Knights; so there was
a terrible meddle of breaking
Spears and smiting of Swerds,
with sleying of men and horses,
and the enemies were at a loss;
for there was newly arrived Sir
<hi>Bloudy</hi> as a fierce Tyger, that his
strokes redounded again from
the Wood and the Water; so
that the Enemies were forced
to hurtle togyder for great
drede, and a grete multitude
fled, but his blow fell upon Sir
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57469:32"/>
               <hi>Coward,</hi> and carved a cantel of
his Shield; and the Swerd slid
down by the Hawberk behind
his back, and cut in twain the
Trapper of Steel, and the
Horse also in two pieces. So
he became so bloudy, that no
man might know him; for all
was Bloud and Brains about
him.</p>
            <p>Then returned Prince <hi>Corni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
with his Knights to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
where all his Barons at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
on him, and there came
a fair Damesel also which was
an Earls Daughter, and she
came thyder to do homage as
other Lords did after the great
Battaile; and Prince <hi>Corniger</hi>
set his Love gretely upon her,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57469:32"/>
so she did upon him; and the
King had a do with her, and
that night dremed a mervail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Dreme whereof he was
right sore adradde: for him
thought that there was coming
in his Lond many Gryssons and
Serpents, and him thought he
they slew moch of his people;
and then him thought he fought
with them, and that they did
him passing great demage, and
wounded him full sore. So the
King awoke, and was passing
heavy and right pensife of his
Dreme; and then to put away
all thoughts of Battail, next
morning he made him ready
with his Knights to ride on
Hunting; and assoon as he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57469:33"/>
came in the Forrest, he saw a
grete Hart before him; this
Hart will I chace, said he; and
so he spurred his Horse, and
rode along after, and so by fine
force oft he was like to have
smitten the Hart; whereas his
Horse fell down dead, and he
sat him down by a Fountain,
and there he fell into grete
thoughts: And as he sat there
alone, him thought he heard a
noise of Hounds to the number
of thirty Couple, and with
that he saw coming towards
him the strangest Beast that ever
he saw or heard tell of; for the
Beast went to the Fountain and
drank, and the noise was in the
Beasts Belly like unto the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57469:33"/>
Questing of thirty Couple of
Hounds; but all the while the
beast drank, there was no noise
in the beasts belly; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the beast departed with a
great noise, whereof Prince
<hi>Corniger</hi> had gread mervail.</p>
            <p>Then the King arose and
went forwards a good pace to
seek for his Knights, and so as
he went he came to a rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion;
then was he ware
where a Knight sat all armed in
his Chair. Sir Knight, said the
King, for what cause abidest
thou here, that no Knight may
ride this way, said he, before he
Just with me? I'le make thee
leave that Custom, said the
King. This Custom, reply'd
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57469:34"/>
the Knight, have I used, and
will use, maugre who saith nay,
and who is grieved with my
Custom, let him amend it that
vvill. I vvill amend it, said
the King, and I vvill defend it,
said the Knight. So anon he
lent the King a Horse, and dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his Shield, and took a Spear,
and they met so hard either in
others Shield, that they all to
shevered their Spears; but the
Knight hit him so hard in the
middle of the Shield, that
Horse and Man fell to the
ground. Then Prince <hi>Corniger</hi>
vvas vvroth, and dressed his
Shield tovvards him vvith his
Svvord dravvn: When the
Knight savv that, he alighted,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57469:34"/>
for him thought it was no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to have a Knight at such
advantage, he to be on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
and that other on foot;
and so alight and drest him to
Prince <hi>Corniger;</hi> and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
a strong Battaile with many
grete strokes: and so they hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their Swerds, that the
Cantels flew in the fields, and
much bloud they bled both. So
at the last they smote togyder,
that both their Swerds met e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
togyder; but the Swerd
of the Knight smote the Kings
Swerd in two pieces. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was full sorry, and leapt
upon the Knight, and took
him by the middle, and threvv
him dovvn, and raced his
Helm. Whan the Knight saw
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57469:35"/>
that, he was adradde; for he
was a passing big man of might,
and anon he brought Prince
<hi>Corniger</hi> under him, and raced
off his Helm, and would have
smitten off his head.</p>
            <p>Therewithall came the Lady
of the Isle of <hi>Witch,</hi>(for she
was an Enchantress) and said,
Knight hold thy hand; for and
thou <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lee that Knight, thou
puttest this Realm in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
damage that ever Realm was
in, for this Knight is a man of
more vvorship then thou vvot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of. Why, vvho is he said
the Knight; It is Prince <hi>Corni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
said she. Then vvould he
have slain him for drede of his
vvrath, and heved up his Svverd;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57469:35"/>
and therevvith the Lady cast an
Enchantment on the Knight,
that he fell to the earth in a
grete sleep. Then the Lady
took up the King; and as they
rode togyder upon the Knights
Horse, Alas, said Prince <hi>Corni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
hast thou slain this good
Knight by thy crafts? there li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not so vvorshipful a Knight
as he vvas. I had lever the
stint of my Land a year that he
vvere on live: Care ye not,
said she, for he is vvholler then
ye; for he is but on sleep, and
vvill avvake vvithin these three
hours.</p>
            <p>Right so the King departed,
and vvent unto an Hermitage,
vvhereas vvas a good man, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57469:36"/>
a great Leche. So the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite
searched all his wounds,
and gave him good Salves; and
the King was there three days,
and then were his wounds well
amended, that he might ride
and go; and so he departed
with the Lady. And as they
rode, Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> said, I
have no Swerd, nor wot I where
to gain one so good as that I
lost. Here by is a Swerd, said
she, that shall be yours, and I
may.</p>
            <p>So they rode till they came
to a Lake, which was a fair
Water, and a broad; and in the
midst of the Lake Prince <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niger</hi>
was ware of an Arm clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in white Sattin, that held
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57469:36"/>
a fair Swerd in the hand. Lo'
said the Lady to the King, yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is the Swerd in that Arm
which I spake of. With that
he saw the Damsel that brought
him the other Swerd, going up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lake. What Damsel is
that, said the King? It is my
servant, said the Lady, and she
will come to you anon, and
then speak fair to her, that she
will give you that Swerd:
Therewith came the Damesel
to the King, and saluted him,
and he her again. Damesel,
said the King, what Swerd is
that which the Arm holdeth
yonder above water? I would
it were mine, for I have no
Swerd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:57469:37"/>
Sir, said the Damesel of
the Lake, if you will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for it, you may have it;
but be advised, that many
Knights have perished in the
attempt That shall not make
me adradde, said the King; for
I wot he is not worthy of a
Swerd that deserveth it not.
Than, said she, you may go to
yonder Barge, and rowe your
self to the Swerd; and if no
tempest arise, it is yours, and
take it, and the Scabberd with
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So than anon he came to
the Swerd, and took it up by
the handle, and brought it with
him; and the Arm and Hand
went under the water, and so
he came to land: But the Lady
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57469:37"/>
and her Maid were gone he wist
not whither, which made him
passing heavy.</p>
            <p>So he rode forth, and came
to his Castle, whereof his
Knights were passing glad; and
when they heard of his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they marvailed that he
would jeopard his person alone.
But all men of Worship said it
was fine to be under such a
Chieftain, that would put his
person in adventure, as other
poor Knights did.</p>
            <p>The mean while came a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
hastly from King <hi>Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obarb,</hi>
and he was King of many
Isles; and this was his message,
greeting well Prince <hi>Corniger</hi>
in this manner wise, saying,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57469:38"/>
that King <hi>Palliobarb</hi> had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited
and overcome eleven
Kings, and each of them did him
homage, and that was, they
gave him their Beards clean
flain off as much as there was:
Wherefore the messenger came
for <hi>Cornigers</hi> Beard; for King
<hi>Palliobarb</hi> had pu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>feled a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
with Kings Beards, and
there lacked for one place of
the Mantel, wherefore he sent
for his Beard; or else he would
enter into his Lands, and burn
and slee, and never leave till
he have thy Head and thy
Beard. Well, said the King,
thou hast said thy message,
which is the most villanous and
lewdest message that ever man
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57469:38"/>
heard sent to a King. Also
thou may'st see my Beard is full
young yet for to make a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel
of. But tell thou the King
this, I owe him no homage, ne
none of mine Elders; but e're
it be long he shall do me ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
on both his knees, or
else he shall lose his Head by
the faith of my body; for this
is the most shameful message
that ever I heard speak of. I
see well King <hi>Palliobarb</hi> never
met with worshipful man; but
tell him I vvill have his Head
vvithout he do homage unto
me: Then the Messenger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>And forth vvithall there
came a poor man into the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57469:39"/>
Court, and brought vvith him
a fair young man of eighteen
years of age riding upon a lean
Mare, for he had nevvly sprain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Leg; and the poor man
asked all men that he met,
Where shall I find the King?
Yonder he is, said the Knights,
vvilt thou any thing vvith him?
Yea, said the poor man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I came hither. Anon as
he came before the King, he
saluted him, and said, O Prince
<hi>Corniger,</hi> the Flovver of all
Knights and Kings, I beseech
Jesu save thee. Sir, it vvas told
me, that at this time novv you
are made King, that vvithin
the first year and a day you
vvould grant any man the gift
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57469:39"/>
that he vvould ask, except it
vvere unreasonable. That is
trouth, said the King, such
cryes I let make, and those
vvill I hold, so they appair not
my Realm nor mine estate.
Ye say vvell and graciously,
quoth the poor man; Sir, I
ask nothing elles, but that ye
vvill make my Son a Knight.
It is a grete thing thou ask est of
me, said the King, vvhat is thy
name? My name is <hi>Bubulcus</hi>
the Covvherd, said the poor
man. Whither cometh this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of thee or of thy Son, said
the King. Nay Sir, said <hi>Bubul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
this desire cometh of my
Son, and not of me; for I shall
tell you, I have seven Sons,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57469:40"/>
and all they will fall to what
labour I put them, and will be
right glad to do labour; but
this Child will do no labour for
me for any thing that my Wife
or I may do, but always he will
be shooting or casting Darts,
and glad to see Battails, and to
behold Knights; and alwayes
both day and night he desireth
of me to be made a Knight.
What is thy name amongst thy
Companions, said the King to
the young man? They call me,
said he, <hi>Crucifrage</hi> ever since I
ran so fast to take a Lamb from
a Wolf, that I broke my Leg.
Than the King beheld him fast,
and saw he was passingly well
visaged, and passingly well made
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57469:40"/>
of his years; and he said to <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulcus</hi>
the Cowherd, Where is
the Swerd that he shall be made
Knight withall? It is here, said
the youth; then take it out of
the sheath, said the King, and
require me to make thee a
Knight: Then he pulled out
his Swerd, and required the
King he would make him a
Knight. I will make you, said
the King, and therewith smote
him in the neck with the Swerd,
saying, Be ye a good Knight,
and so I pray to God ye may
be of Prowess and Worthiness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Now, said he to one of his
Knights named Sir <hi>Astrolog,</hi> that
had Skill in Physiognomy, say
whether Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> shall be a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57469:41"/>
good Knight or no? Yea Sir,
said Sir <hi>Astrolog,</hi> he ought to be
a good Knight, for he is come
of as good a man as any is o'n
live, and of Kings bloud. How
so, said the King? I shall tell
you, said Sir <hi>Astrolog,</hi> this poor
man the Cowherd is not his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
But I suppose nay, said
the Cowherd. Well fetch thy
Wife, said Sir <hi>Astrolog,</hi> afore
me, and she shall say nay. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none
the Wife was sent for,
which was a fair Housewife;
and there she answered Sir <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log</hi>
full womanly. And there she
told the King, that when she
was a Maid, and went to milk
Kine, there met her a stearn
Knight, and half by force he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57469:41"/>
got her Maidenhead, and at
that time he begat this Youth;
and he took away from me my
Greyhound that I had at that
time with me, and said that he
would keep it for my Love.
Ah, said the Cowherd, I wend
not this, but I may believe it
well, for he had never no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of me. Sir <hi>Astrolog,</hi> said
Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> dishonour not my
Mother. Sir, said Sir <hi>Astrolog,</hi>
it is more for your worship then
hurt; for your Fader is a good
Knight and a King, and you
were begotten before your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was married. That is
trouth, said the Wife. It is
the less grief to me, said the
Cowherd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:57469:42"/>
Right so the Cowherd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
and Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> rode
forth to seek Adventures; when
as he was aware of a Knight on
the other side the Lond all
armed save the Head; and on
the other side the Lond came a
Dwarf on Horseback also all
armed, but the Head with a
grete Mouth and a short Nose:
And the Dwarf when he came
nigh the Knight, said, Where is
the Lady that should meet us
here? And therewithall she
came forth out of the Wood,
and they began to strive for the
Lady; for the Knight said that
he would have her, and the
Dwarf said that he would have
her. Well, ye do well, said
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57469:42"/>
the Dwarf, yonder is a Knight
at the Cross, let us put it to his
judgment; and as he deemeth,
even so be it. I will: Well,
said the Knight. And then
they went all three unto Sir
<hi>Crucifrag,</hi> and told him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they two strove. Well
Sir, said he, will ye put the
matter into my hands? Yea Sir,
said they both. Now Damesel,
said Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> ye shall stand
between them both, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ye list better to go to, he
shall have you. And so when
the Damesel was set between
them two, she left the Knight,
and went to the Dwarf: and
the Dwarf took her, and went
his way singing, and the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57469:43"/>
Knight went his way mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Then came Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> to
an Husbandman of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
who told him how there
was in that place a great Giant,
who had slain, murdered, and
devoured much people of the
Countrey, and had been sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
seven years with the
Children of the Commons of
that Land, and now of late he
had taken a Dutchess, the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Woman in the world, and
killed her Husband, and had
led her to his Lodging which
was in a Mountain, for to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
her, and lie by her to her
lives end; and many people fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
her more then five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57469:43"/>
but all they might not
rescue her, but they left her
shryking and crying most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably;
wherefore I suppose
he hath slain her in fulfilling his
foul lust of Lechery. Alas,
said Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> this is a grete
mischief, I had lever then the
best Realm, that I had been a
furlong way before him, to have
rescued her. Now fellow, said
Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> canst thou bring
me there where as this Giant
haunteth? Yea Sir, said the
poor man, lo yonder whereas
you see two great fires, there
shall ye not fail to find him,
and more Treasure as I suppose
then is in a great Realm. When
Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> had well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57469:44"/>
this piteous case, he made
ready his Horse and Harness,
and after Evensong he rode
forth as fast as he might, till he
came to the Mountain; and so
he ascended up the Mount till
he came to a great fire, and
there found he a careful Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
wringing her hands, and
making great sorrow, sitting by
a Grave new made: And then
Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> saluted her, and
demanded her whereof she made
so great lamentation: Unto
whom she answered, Sir Knight,
speak soft, for yonder is a
Monster; if he hear thee speak
he will come and destroy thee: I
hold thee unhappy for coming
here in this Mountain, for if ye
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57469:44"/>
were such fifty as ye be, ye
were not able to make resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
against this Devil. See
where lieth a VVoman dead,
which was the Sister to a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mans VVife, that he hath
murthered in forceing her.
Dame, said Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> I
come from the great Prince
<hi>Corniger</hi> to treat with this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
for his Leige People. Fie
upon such Treaties, said the
VVidow, he setteth nought by
Prince <hi>Corniger,</hi> ne by no man
else. Beware, approach him
not nigh, sor he hath over come
and vanquished fifteen Kings,
and four hundred Knights, and
hath made a Coat embroidered
vvith their Beards, vvhich they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57469:45"/>
sent him to have his love for
sparing of their people; but on
if thou wilt speak with him, at
yonder fire he is at supper.
Well, said Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> I will
accomplish my message for all
your fearful words, and he went
forth by the crest of that Hill,
and saw where he sate at souper
knawing on the limb of a man,
beking his broad limbs by the
fire, and breechless, and three
Damesels turning three bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
whereon were broched
twelve young Children late
born like young birds. When
Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> beheld this piteous
sight, he had great compassion
on them, so that his heart bled
for sorrow, and hailed him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57469:45"/>
in this wise, He that all the
world weldeth give thee short
life, and a shameful death, and
the Devil have thy soul; why
hast thou murdered these young
innocent Children, and this
Woman? Therefore arise and
dress thee thou Clutton, for
this day shalt thou die of my
hands. Then anon the Giant
started up, and took a great
club in his hand, and smote at
Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> that his Club fell
far into the earth, and Sir <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifrag,</hi>
hit him again, that he
carved his belly (for he was
breechless for haste) that his
Guts and Entrails fell down to
the ground; then the three
Damesels kneeled down, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57469:46"/>
called to our Lord Jesu Christ
for help and comfort of the
noble Knight Sir <hi>Crucifrag.</hi> So
Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> smote off the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
Head, and the Damesels
came and thanked him, and
brought him to the fair Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess,
and many prisoners. These
he released, and bid them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the Goods amongst them;
onely he took the Giants head
and Club, and the fair Dutchess
to himself, and with her he
made good cheer, and either
drank to other freely of the
Giants good wine; and they
thought never drink that ever
they drank to other was so
sweet nor so good. But by
that their drink was in their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57469:46"/>
bodies, they loved each other
so well, that Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> and
the Dutchess Love was not to
be parted for wele nor for
woe.</p>
            <p>And so anon they departed,
and rode so long, till by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
they came nigh a Castle,
and there they arrived for to
rest them, wening to have had
good harbour. But anon as Sir
<hi>Crucifrag</hi> was within the Castle,
they were taken prisoners;
for the Custom of that Castle
was, that such that brought
any Lady, must needs fight
with the Lord of the Castle,
which was high Sir <hi>Bullirock,</hi>
and he that was weakest should
lose his head; and than if his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57469:47"/>
Lady be fowler then the Lords
Wife, she must lese her head;
and if she be fairer proved, then
the Lady of the Castle must
loose her head. Now so God
help me, said Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> this
is a shameful custom; nethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
I have one avantage, for I
have a Lady, fairer saw I never
in all my life days, and I doubt
not but she shall save her head.
Then he said to the Knight
that took them Prisoners, I
have great mervail, Sir, what is
the cause that your Lord hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us Prisoners; for it was
never the custom of any place
of worship that ever I came in,
that when a Knight and a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
asked harbour, and were
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57469:47"/>
received, and then after they
should be destroyed, it is a foul
evil custom by the faith of my
body; wherefore tell your
Lord, I will be ready as to
morrow with my Lady and my
self to Battaile, if it be so that I
may have my Horse and my
Armour. Sir, said the Knight,
undertake that your desire
shall speed right well, and
therewith he departed. And
on the morrow betimes that
same Knight came unto Sir
<hi>Crucifrag,</hi> and put him and his
Lady out of Prison, and
brought him Horse and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
which was his own, and
bade him make him ready to
the Field: For all the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57469:48"/>
and Commons of that
Lordship were there ready to
behold the Battaile, and give
judgement. Then came Sir
<hi>Bullirock</hi> the Lord of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
holding his Lady by the
hand all muffled, and asked Sir
<hi>Crucifrag</hi> where his Lady was,
for and thy Lady be fairer then
mine, vvith thy Svverd smite
off my Ladies head, and if my
Lady be fairer then thine, then
must I strike off her head; and
if my Lady lose her head, yet
shall I slee thee, and have thy
Lady. Sir Knight, said Sir
<hi>Crucifrag,</hi> this is a foul and an
horrible custom, and rather
then my Lady should lose her
head, yet had I lever lose my
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57469:48"/>
head. Nay, said Sir <hi>Bullirock,</hi>
the Ladies shall be first shewed
togyder; then I doubt not,
said Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> but my Lady
is fairer then thine, and that
will I prove and make good
with mine own hands; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he be that will say nay,
I will prove it upon his Head:
And therewithall Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi>
shewed his Lady, and turned
her thrice about, with his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Swerd drawn in his hand.
And when Sir <hi>Bullirock</hi> saw
that, he turned his Lady about
in the same wise. But when
he beheld Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi>'s Lady,
him thought he never saw a
fairer Lady, and then he did
drede that his Ladies Head
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57469:49"/>
should be smitten off: And all
the people that were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
gave judgment that Sir
<hi>Crucifrag</hi>'s Lady was fairer then
the Lady of the Castle, and
the better made body. So
God me help, said Sir <hi>Bullirock,</hi>
thy Lady is fairer then mine,
and that me sore repenteth,
and therefore slee my Lady,
for I doubt not but thy Lady
shall be mine. Thou must win
her, said Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> as dear as
ever Knight won Lady; and
because of thine own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as thou wouldest have
done unto my Lady, if she had
been fouler then thine; and
because of thine evil custom,
give me thy Lady, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57469:49"/>
he strode unto Sir <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirock,</hi>
and took his Lady from
him, and with an awke stroke
he smote off her Head. Now
Knight, said Sir <hi>Bullirock,</hi> now
hast thou done me a despite;
wherefore take thy Horse, sith
I have lost my Lady; for I will
win thy Lady, and I may.
Then they took their Horses,
and came togyder as fast as
their Horses might run, and
both fell to the ground horse
and man. Then Sir <hi>Bullirock</hi>
gave Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> three or four
sad blows before he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
and would have slain
him, but Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> was
young and nimble, and avoided
his Horse, and then they rushed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57469:50"/>
together like two wild Boare
full mightily; for this Sir <hi>Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rock</hi>
was a proved Knight, and
had been e're then the death of
many good Knights, that it was
pity that he had so long endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and thus they fought hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
here and there two hours:
So Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> was wroth, and
took a mighty blow, for he
vvas a big and strong Knight,
and clove Sir <hi>Bullirock</hi> from the
Crest of his Pate to his Breast;
and then all they that belonged
to the Castle came and did
him homage, praying that he
vvould foredo that foul Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom.
Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> granted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
then he returned to Prince
<hi>Corniger</hi> with his Lady.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:57469:50"/>But as he Rode, there met
him I trow, the Richest Lady
and the Fairest of all the World,
who saluted him, and he her;
then she besought him to be her
Love, for she had loved him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all earthly men, and she
would make him richer then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was man of his age. When
Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> heard her words,
he was right evil at ease, for he
could not consent before his
dear Lady, so wyst he not how
to answer. Alas said she I
Will you not stay with me one
night? Madam said Sir <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frag,</hi>
there is no Lady in the
World whose will I will fulfil
as touching this thing, but this.
Then she made much sorrow,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57469:51"/>
as if she would have died. Now
you have brought me to my end
said she, and therewith she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
and went up to a high
Battlement, and led with her
twelve Gentlewomen and when
they were above, one of them
cry'd, Sir, Gentile Knight,
have mercy on us all, and suffer
my Lady to have her will, or
we must perish with her from
this high Tower. Than Sir
<hi>Crucifrag</hi> looked up, and they
seemed all Ladies of great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
and Riches, and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen;
then had he great pity of
them: but he was counselled
within himself, that lever then
he forsake his own good Lady,
they all died. So they fell
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57469:51"/>
down all at once to the earth,
and when he saw that sudden
chance, he was right sore abash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and had thereof full great
mervail; and with that he bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his Body and his Visage,
and anon he heard a full grete
noise and a great cry, as though
all the Fiends in Hell had been
about him; and therewith he
saw neither Towre nor Ladies,
ne Gentlewomen, ne Chappel.
Than held he up both his hands
to Heaven, and said, Good
Father, I am right well esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped:
And then he took his
way strait to Prince <hi>Corniger's</hi>
Castle with his Lady, and
found there a passing fair Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
and well beseen,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57469:52"/>
whereof each other had great
joy. And when he told
how he had sped, they had
great mervail, that man on
earth might speed so soon, and
go and come.</p>
            <p>So it drew fast to <hi>Michaelmas,</hi>
and thyder came many a noble
and Peerless Lady and good
Knights to see the Wedding
between Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> and the
Dutchess; and so when this
Solemnity was done, there
came in fourscore Knights and
thirty Ladies, and all these told
the King how Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi>
had delivered them from the
dolorous Giaunt, and slew him
without pity; and therefore
we and our Heirs will do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57469:52"/>
unto Sir <hi>Crucifrag.</hi> So
then Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> made him
his Champion that same day;
and after that the Earles and
Barons, and many stout Knights
went unto meat, and well ye
may wite that there was all
manner of meat plenteously,
and all manner of Revels, and
Games, and Dauncing; and
the Kings chief Musician sang on
this wise.</p>
            <l>O Would to God that now
were one,</l>
            <l>another such as <hi>Arion,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>who had a harp of such tempture,</l>
            <l>and thereto of so good measure</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:57469:53"/>
he sung, that he the beasts wild</l>
            <l>made of his note tame and mild.</l>
            <l>The Hind in peace with the Lion,</l>
            <l>the Wolf in peace with the Mutton,</l>
            <l>the Hart in peace stood with the
Hound;</l>
            <l>and every man on the same ground</l>
            <l>which at that time this Harper
heard,</l>
            <l>as well the Lord as the Shepherd.</l>
            <l>He brought them all in good accord,</l>
            <l>so that the Common with the Lord,</l>
            <l>and Lords with the Common also,</l>
            <l>he set in amity both two,</l>
            <l>and put away melancholly;</l>
            <l>that was a lusty melody,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57469:53"/>
when ev'ry man did th' other love.</l>
            <l>And if there were the ground above</l>
            <l>one which could harp as he did,</l>
            <l>he might avail in many a stede,</l>
            <l>to make peace where now is hate,</l>
            <l>for many men think on debate.</l>
            <l>And now God wot upon this tide,</l>
            <l>we see the world on every side</l>
            <l>in sundry wise so diversed,</l>
            <l>that it well nigh stands all rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</l>
            <l>So were it good at this tide,</l>
            <l>that every man on his side</l>
            <l>besought, and pray'd for the peace,</l>
            <l>which is the cause of all increase,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:57469:54"/>of worship, and of worlds wealth,</l>
            <l>of hearts rest, and souls health.</l>
            <l>Then pray for Peace ye mortal
men.</l>
            <l>Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen.</l>
            <p>Then after these fine doings,
the next day Justed Sir <hi>Cruel,</hi>
and he o'rethrew thirty
Knights, and did passing mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
deeds of Arms, that
all men had great wonder of
his noble deeds. Also the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
day Justed Sir <hi>Rasour,</hi> and
he o'rethrew twenty Knights,
and did like a mighty Knight.
The third day Justed Sir <hi>Fierce,</hi>
and he o'rethrew nine and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Knights, some Horse and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57469:54"/>
man, and some the man and not
the horse, and there was none
but he was hit surely so, that
he bare none Arms that day.
But at the last came a strange
Knight, and ran so hard against
Sir <hi>Fierce,</hi> that he bare him
dovvn horse and man, that he
lay in a Svvound. Novv this
stranger, as you shall knovv
hereafter, vvas King <hi>Palliobarb,</hi>
vvhich had been esteemed the
biggest Knight in the vvorld;
for having heard of Sir <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frag,</hi>
and because Prince <hi>Corni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
had denied to send his
Beard, he had great despite, and
set out from his Castle vvith
tvvo Knights to come and kill
Prince <hi>Corniger,</hi> or Sir <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frag;</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:57469:55"/>
but in the way he said
to his Knights, Now will I
tell you my counsel, for ye be
the men that I trust most on
live; and I will that ye wot
my going is to this intent, for
to destroy Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> or Sir
<hi>Crucifrag,</hi> by wiles or by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and it shall be hard if they
escape us. Alas, said one of
them, what thing mean you to
be set in such a way, ye are
shamefully disposed; for Sir
<hi>Crucifrag</hi> and Prince <hi>Corniger</hi>
are Knights of the most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
that we know now living;
and therefore I warn you
plainly, that I will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to do him to death; and
therefore I will yield my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57469:55"/>
and forsake you. Whan
King <hi>Palliobarb</hi> heard him say
so, suddenly he drew his
Swerd, and said, O false Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
and smote him on the
head, so that the Swerd went
to his teeth: Whan the other
Knight saw him do that villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
deed, and also the Squires,
they said all it was foully done
and mischievously; wherefore
we will appeach thee of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
before Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> and
Sir <hi>Crucifrag.</hi> Then was the
King wonderous wrath, and
would have slain him; but he
and the two Squires held them
togyder, and set nought by his
malice; so he departed from
them, and they buried the
Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:57469:56"/>
Thus came King <hi>Palliobarb</hi>
to Prince <hi>Corniger</hi>'s Castle, and
smote Sir <hi>Fierce,</hi> thinking by
his mervaillous deeds that he
was Sir <hi>Crucifrag.</hi> Beside, he
defied all Prince <hi>Corniger</hi>'s
Knights that day, and let cry
how he would fight with any
of them body for body, but
there could be found no Knight
amongst them that would
fight with him that day. The
next day (for he might not
fight the three days of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
Feast) Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himself to fight with that
bold Knight. I shall fight with
him, said he, or else I will be
slain in the plain Field.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:57469:56"/>So on the morrow they met
to do battail as long as Horse
may endure; and after that to
do battail on Foot to their
lives end. So whan appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was made, they departed
each from the other, and they
came togyder with all the
might that their Horses might
run, and either smote other so
hard, that both Horse and
Knights went unto the earth.
Then they both lightly arose,
and dressed their Shields on
their Shoulders with naked
Swerds in their hands, and they
dashed togyder like as they had
been a flaming fire; thus they
traced, and raced, and hewed
on Helms, and cut away many
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57469:57"/>
pieces and cantels of their
Shields, and either wounded
other passing sore, so that the
hot bloud fell upon the earth;
and by that they had foughten
togyder the maintenance of an
hour, King <hi>Palliobarb</hi> waxed
faint, and gave sore aback,
that saw Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
fiercely upon him, for
he gave him twenty strokes for
one, and ever he cry'd, yield
thee. So King <hi>Palliobarb</hi> threw
away his Swerd, and pulled off
his Helm to breath; but when
Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> and his Barons
saw it was King <hi>Palliobarb,</hi> they
were mervailously astonied:
But he fell dead to the earth for
grief and for his wounds. Then
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57469:57"/>
did Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> make great
joy for the Victory, and gave
Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> a brave Castel for
his reward, for delivering him
from his great Enemy King <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liobarb,</hi>
who had been counted
the most villanous as well as
the stoutest Knight on earthly
habitation; and eke also all the
Barons and Knights praised the
stern might of Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> so
that he was counted the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfullest
Knight of the world:
but some were envious. For
at the season of the merry
moneth of <hi>May,</hi> when every
lusty heart flourisheth; for as
the season is lusty to behold,
and comfortable; so man and
woman rejoyce: for Winter
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57469:58"/>
with his rough windes and
blastes, causeth a lusty man to
coure and sit by the fire. So
in this moneth of <hi>May</hi> it fell
out, that there happened a
great Love of the Queen to
Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> the which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
stinted till the Flower of
Chivaldry of all the world was
destroyed and slain; and this
befell long of two unhappy
Knights, who had ever a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
hate unto Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi>'s
Prowess, and then they said
openly, and not in counsaile,
that many Knights might hear
it, I mervail that we all be not
ashamed both to see and know
how Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> lieth daily
and nightly by the Queen, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57469:58"/>
all we know it so, and it is
shamefully suffered of us all,
that we should suffer so noble a
King as is Prince <hi>Corniger,</hi> to
be shamed; therefore fall of it
what fall may, I will declare it
to the King. Ye shall not do
so, said the rest; for if there
rise any war and wrath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> and us,
wyte you well, there will be
many Kings and Knights that
will hold with Sir <hi>Crucifrag;</hi>
also Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> hath done the
King great service, and rescued
him from his Enemies; and
the best of us all had been full
cold at the heart root, had not
Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> been a better
Knight than we. Do you then
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57469:59"/>
as you list, said Sir <hi>Blaball,</hi> (for
it was his name) I will hide
so no longer.</p>
            <p>With these words came to
them the King. Now stint
your noise. said they to Sir
<hi>Blaball.</hi> But I will not, quoth
he. Than good speed, said
they, for we will not hear your
tales, ne ony of your counsel;
and therewith they departed,
making great doole.</p>
            <p>And then Prince <hi>Corniger</hi>
asked Sir <hi>Blaball</hi> what noise
they made. My Liege, said
Sir <hi>Blaball,</hi> I shall tell you what
I may hold no longer. Here is
I and my Brother <hi>Sneeks</hi> know
all, that Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> holdeth
your Queen, and hath done
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57469:59"/>
long, and we your good
Friends and Servants may not
suffer it any longer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we will prove that he is a
Traytour to your person. If
it be so, said the King, wyte
you well he is an hardy Knight,
and all know he is the man of
most might among us; and if
he be taken with the deed, he
will fight with him that brought
up the noise, and I know no
Knight is able to match him.
But if it be soth that ye say, I
would he were taken in the
deed. My Lord, said Sir
<hi>Blaball,</hi> to morrow shall ye ride
on Hunting, and when it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
toward night, ye may send
the Queen word that ye vvill
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57469:60"/>
lie out all that night, and so
may ye send for your Cooks;
and then upon pain of death
vve shall bring him dead or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.
I vvill, vvell, said the
King; but bevvare, for ye shall
find him mighty vvyghty. So
on the morrovv the King rode
on Hunting: Then Sir <hi>Blaball</hi>
and Sir <hi>Sneeks</hi> did themselves in
a Chamber in the Castle. So
vvhen night came, Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi>
told his trusty Friend Sir <hi>Fierce,</hi>
he vvould go speak vvith the
Queen. Sir, said Sir <hi>Fierce,</hi> I
alvvays dread me moch of Sir
<hi>Sneeks</hi> and his Brother Sir <hi>Blab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi>
vvho vvait you daily to do
you shame, and never gave my
heart against any going that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57469:60"/>
ever ye vvent to the Queen so
much as novv. Have ye no
doubt, said Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> I shall
go and come, and make no tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying;
and I will not be so
moch a Covvard, but that she
shall understand I vvill see her
good grace. Speed you vvell,
said Sir <hi>Fierce,</hi> and send you
safe and sound.</p>
            <p>So Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> departed,
and took his svverd underneath
his arm; and so that noble
Knight vvent forth in his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and put himself in great
jeopardy, and so he passed till
he came to the Queen. And
than the Queen and Sir <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frag</hi>
vvere togyder, and vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they vvere a bed, or at O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57469:61"/>
manner of sports, me list
not thereof to make mention,
(for Love at that time vvas not
as it is novv adays) but thus
as they vvere togyder, there
came Sir <hi>Blaball</hi> vvith Sir
<hi>Sneeks,</hi> and ten more Knights,
crying vvith a loud noise, that
all the Court might hear it,
Traiterous Knight, Sir <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frag,</hi>
novv art thou taken. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
said the Queen, novv are
vve mischieved both. Madam,
said he, have you any Armour
here vvithin your Chamber,
that I might cover my body
vvithall; and if there be any,
I pray you heartily let me have,
and I shall soon stint their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.
Truly, said the Queen, I
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57469:61"/>
have no Armour, ne Shield, ne
Svverd, ne Spear; vvherefore I
drede me sore our long Love is
come to a mischievous end, and
therefore ye are like to be slain,
and I shall be brent. Alas, said
Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> in all my life vvas
I never thus bestead, that I
should be thus shamefully slain
for lack of mine Armour; but
alvvays Sir <hi>Blaball</hi> cry'd, Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
come out of the Queens
Chamber. O Jesu, mercy, said
Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> this shameful cry
and noise I may not suffer; for
better vvere death at once,
then thus to endure pain; and
therevvithall Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> vvrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
his Mantel round about
his Arm vvell and surely, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57469:62"/>
by then they had gotten a grete
Form out of the Hall, and
therewithall they dashed at
the Chamber door. Faire
Lords, said Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> leave
your noise and your dashing,
and I shall set open the door,
and then may ye do with me
what it liketh you to do.
Then Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> unbarred
the Door, and with his left
hand he held it open a little,
so that but one man might
come in at once; and so anon
there came striding a good
Knight, a big man and a
large, and with a Swerd he
struck at Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the stroak, and gave him
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57469:62"/>
such a buffet upon the Helm,
that he fell down dead, grove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
within the door: and
then Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> with his stern
might drew in the dead Knight
within the Chamber, and with
the help of the Queen and her
Ladies was lightly armed in
his Armour; and ever stood
Sir <hi>Blaball</hi> crying, Traytour,
come out of the Queens Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
we will have thy Head
maugre all thy might, if we
please to slay thee; for we will
let thee to wyte, that we have
the choice of Prince <hi>Corniger,</hi>
to save thee or to slee thee. So
then Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> was wroth,
and set open the Chamber
door, and mightily and Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57469:63"/>
he strode amongst them; and
anon at the first beset he slew
Sir <hi>Blaball,</hi> and within a little
while after five more; for there
was none of all them that
might stand Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> a
buffet. Also he wounded Sir
<hi>Sneeks,</hi> and he fled with all his
might, and the rest with him:
and then Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> returned
again to the Queen, and he
kist her, and promised to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue
her, and either gave other
a Ring; and so he went to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his
Lodging, and told Sir <hi>Fierce</hi>
all that had happened; so they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
fled to Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi>'s Castle,
and many good Knights cleave
to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:57469:63"/>
Now whan Prince <hi>Corniger</hi>
was advised of what was pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
he commanded his Knights
to be ready in their best Array
with their brethren, to bring
the Queen to the Fire; for she
shall soon have her Judgment:
And then the Queen was led
forth without the Castle, and
there she was despoiled to her
Smock; and so then her Ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father was brought to her
to be shriven of her misdeeds.
Then was there weeping, and
wailing, and wringing of hands
of many Lords and Ladies; but
there were but few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
that would bare any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
for to strengthen the
death of the Queen. Then
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57469:64"/>
was there one that Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi>
had sent for to spie what time
the Queen should go to her
Judgment; and anon when
as he saw that the Queen was
despoiled to her Smock, and
and also that she was shriven,
then he gave warning to Sir
<hi>Crucifrag;</hi> then was there hot
spurning and plucking up of
Horses, and right so they came
to the Fire, and who stood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them were slain, there
might none withstand Sir <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifrag</hi>
and Sir <hi>Fierce.</hi> So all
that bare Arms and withstood
them were slain, even many a
noble Knight. Then when Sir
<hi>Crucifrag</hi> had done this, and
put to flight all that would
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57469:64"/>
withstand him, he rode straight
to the Queen, and made a
Gown to be cast upon her;
and then he made her to be set
behind him, and pray'd her to
be of good cheer: Wyte you
well, that the Queen was right
glad she was escaped from
death; and then she thanked
God and Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> and so
he rode away with the Queen,
and many cleave to him. Now
when this was known openly
that Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> and Sir
<hi>Crucifrag</hi> were at debate, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Knights were glad of their
debate, and many Knights were
sorry of their debate.</p>
            <p>So then Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> sent
Writes, and let cryes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57469:65"/>
his Realm in length and
breadth, for to assemble all his
Knights, so that he had a great
Host; and when they were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,
the King told them
how Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> had bereft
him of his Queen: Then all
made them ready to lay Siege
to Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> whereas he lay
in his Castle. Thereof heard
Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> and purveyed
him of many a good Knight,
some for his own sake, and
some for the Queens. Then
Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> made many
Knights to blow upon Sir <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifrag,</hi>
and all at once they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him, Traiterous and recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Knight. At this Sir <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifrag</hi>
was wroth, and all his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57469:65"/>
Knights; and on the morrow
either party made them ready
to do Battaile, and great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
was made on both
sides. Then came forth Sir
<hi>Hasty</hi> on the Kings party, and
proffered to Just. So Sir <hi>Fierce</hi>
ran against him, and smote him
through the body. Then there
began a great stir of breaking
Spears, and smiting of Swerds;
and ever Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> was
nigh to Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> for to
have slain him, and Sir <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frag</hi>
suffered him, and would
not strike again. Wherefore
Sir <hi>Traiterous</hi> encountred with
the King unawares, and there
with a Spear he smote him
down to the ground; and so
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57469:66"/>
he alighted and drew his Swerd,
and said to Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> Shall I
make an end of this War? and
therewith he meant to have
slain the King. Not so hardy,
said Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> upon pain of
thy Head, if thou touch him
any more: for I will see that
the most noble King that made
me Knight, be neither slain ne
ashamed, and therewithall Sir
<hi>Crucifrag</hi> alighted from his
Horse, and took up the King,
and horsed him again, and said
unto him thus, My Liege Lord,
for Gods Love stint the strife,
for ye may get no worship, and
I do my uttermost to forbear
you, and ye, ne none of yours
forbeareth me: My Liege, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57469:66"/>
what I have done for
you, and now am I evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.
So when Prince <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niger</hi>
was again on Horseback,
he looked upon Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi>
and the tears brast out of his
eyes, thinking on the great
courtesie that was in Sir <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frag</hi>
more than in any other
man; and therewith the King
rode his way, and might no
longer behold him, and said to
himself, Alas that ever this
War began; and then either
party withdrew them for to
rest, and bury the dead bodies,
and to the wounded they laid
soft Salves; and thus they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
that night till on the
morrow; and then they made
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57469:67"/>
them ready to Battail. Then
came Sir <hi>Crucifrag</hi> as grim as
any Bear, in a black Armour,
that he might not be known,
with a great Spear in his hand,
and he smote on the right hand
and on the left, which astonied
Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> and all his
Knights; so they resolved to
set upon that sturdy Knight,
but he ran Sir <hi>Killman</hi> through
the body horse and all, and
also with a buffet kill'd Sir <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour;</hi>
but as he stroke at Sir
<hi>Ironside,</hi> his Swerd brake, and
Prince <hi>Corniger</hi> slew him. Then
he drew away the body, to see
who that famous and stern
Knight might be; and when
he savv it was Sir <hi>Crucifrag,</hi> he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57469:67"/>
ran his own Swerd through his
body, and died by him. Thus
the dismal War ceased; and
when the Queen heard of all
the dolorous case, she poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her self. Then was vveep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and vvailing, and great
dool, such as vvas never made,
for the Flovvers of Chivalry
vvere vvithered and dead. <hi>O
hone, O hone.</hi>
