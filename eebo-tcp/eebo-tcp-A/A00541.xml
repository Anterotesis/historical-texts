            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the firſt verſe, <hi>Solomon</hi> tels vs that the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart are in man, but the anſwere of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1646:8"/>
the tongue is from the Lord, that is, Howſoeuer man hath powers of minde to premeditate, and conſult, yet hee cannot expreſſe what hee hath thought without Gods direction and aſſiſtance. Whence the wiſeman concludeth; If we cannot ſo much as vtter with our tongues what we haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated, without Gods aide, then wee ought to commit our more weighty workes vnto the Lord: But we cannot doe the former; <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi> The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is thus drawne from the leſſe to the greater: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it may be thus framed, taking in our ſpeeches into the number of our workes (as they may well be:) If all our actions, euen the leaſt, as our ſpeeches, be from God, then are they to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God; but they are from God: <hi>Ergo.</hi> So we ſee how this third verſe hangs vpon the firſt. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe his meaning (I take it) is this, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we are naturally ſo ready to flatter and ſooth vp our ſelues in our owne doings, that wee imagine all to be right, and as it ſhould bee, which we goe about, eſpecially if it haue but a ſpice or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of good in it: Yet God is not alwayes pleaſed with that wherein we ſo <hi>pleaſe</hi> our ſelues; he many times either allowes not of the matter, or manner of thoſe performances which wee ſo <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud,</hi> and magnifie: why?

Heereupon he inferrs in my Text, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God doth ſo, therefore we ſhould commit our workes vnto him, that is, lay them to the rule of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1646:8"/>
his word, for the approbation and warrant of them, and then ſo do them as we may confidently put our ſelues, and our manner of performing them to Gods ſcanning, and judgement: Thus working vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſure ground wee ſhall haue them eſtabliſhed. And ſo I come to the words read.</p>
            <p>The parts whereof appeare at the firſt view to bee two, and but two; hauing only one terme of connexion [<hi>And</hi>] The firſt we may either call <hi>A counſell and aduice</hi> (as I ſaid in the beginning:) and the ſecond anſwerably, <hi>A promiſe</hi> or ſucceſſe in following it: Or elſe we may conceiue the <hi>latter</hi> to be an <hi>end propoſed</hi> by euery man to himſelfe; and the <hi>former</hi> as the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>meanes</hi> by which it may be <hi>attained</hi> vnto. Of theſe as they lye in order. For our better proceeding, the words are to bee <hi>explained</hi> before any point be <hi>obſerued</hi>; and the only word which needeth opening is [<hi>Commit</hi>] We are therfore to know that in the originall it is <gap reason="foreign">

that he ſhould ſuſtaine either <hi>it</hi> for <hi>vs,</hi> or <hi>vs</hi> vnder <hi>it.</hi> In a word, we are aduiſed heere to doe no other thing, than what men doe in thoſe caſes, wherein they alone are inſufficient. What doe they? They goe to ſome body, of whoſe ſufficiency and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe they are aſſured, and tell them that they know not what to doe themſelues, they cannot goe through with the buſineſſe, and therefore they relie and depend wholly vpon him, committing it to his ordering and diſpoſing. Mee thinks <hi>Pharaohs</hi> cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> ſhadoweth out our duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God in this point: He hauing weighed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of his dreames, and the neceſſity of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome courſe for preſeruation of himſelfe &amp; his people, caſts himſelfe vpon <hi>Ioſeph</hi> (whoſe ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie he had well proued) and left the whole buſineſſe to his wiſdome and prouidence. Thus ought wee confidently to entruſt God with all our workes, and much rather than any man. This is enough for the diſcouery of the <hi>Metaphor</hi>: the fuller meaning we ſhall haue afterwards. In the other words there is no obſcurity.

For more full explication of which duty ſo manifeſtly and ſtraitly enjoyned vs, deſcend we to the particulars therin contained. There are three things which ſeeme to take vp the whole nature of this <hi>Committing</hi>: 1. <hi>A ſenſe, and acknowledgement of ſelfe-inſufficiencie for the worke.</hi> 2. <hi>A faithfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1646:10"/>
on God for the appointing and effecting of it.</hi> 3. <hi>An actuall recommending of it vnto God in prayer.</hi> Theſe three, were this an aſſembly of Schollers, I would liken vnto thoſe three principles of naturall things which Philoſophers tell vs of, <hi>Priuation, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and <hi>Forme.</hi> The <hi>deniall</hi> of our owne <hi>abilities,</hi> I may call in ſome ſort a <hi>Priuation.</hi> for vnleſſe wee confeſſe our want of them, and ſtrip our ſelues na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked (as it were) out of all conceits of our owne ſufficiency, we ſhall neuer be diſpoſed to looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in our actions. Yet is not this (indeed) eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall to this duty, though neceſſarily preceding, and making way for it. Secondly, our <hi>faithfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency</hi> vpon God, and impoſing the weight vpon him, may be termed the <hi>matter,</hi> of which this duty conſiſteth. Thirdly, our <hi>actuall recommending</hi> of our workes vnto God in <hi>prayer,</hi> is as it were, the <hi>forme</hi> of this duty, by which it is compleat in the <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> or being of it: Now for the explanation of theſe ſeuerals.</p>
            <p>Firſt we muſt finde our ſelues vnable to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the burden, and acknowledge our weakneſſe; And this in a threefold reſpect, 1. of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> 2. of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> 3 of <hi>Power.</hi> We muſt deny our owne <hi>Iudgement</hi> to direct in matter of reſolution what to doe. For how great cauſe haue we to confeſſe our folly, and our blindneſſe in chooſing? True it is which the wiſe man ſpeaks, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>All the waies of a man are cleane in his owne eyes,</hi> and (cap. 21.2.) <hi>right in his owne eyes.</hi> Yet ſee what good judges our eyes are, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>There is a way that ſeemeth right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man, but the end thereof are the waies of death.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1646:10"/>
And, indeed, not <hi>one</hi> only, but <hi>euery</hi> way, <hi>euery</hi> worke that is of our owne finding out, of our owne deuiſing, is ſinfull, and tendeth to death, vnleſſe we haue warrant for it elſewhere, from God. Fearefull is that Irony of the Preacher, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Walke o young man in the wayes of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes, but know, &amp;c.</hi> I need not tell you how ſharply God reproued the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by his Prophets, for walking in the peruerſe and crooked wayes of their owne hearts. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe no greater judgement could befall euen the beſt of vs, than to eat the fruit of our owne wayes, and be filled with our owne deuices, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 1.31. But to lay aſide theſe more weighty conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, let vs examine our actions, by the meere grounds of morality; and (alas!) how ſottiſh, how blinde are we when we are our owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors! What groſſe miſtakings, what ſilly choiſes make we? How great failing in judgement do we bewray in ciuill actions? Was it not a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh project to thinke to perpetuate ones name by a building, as they did at <hi>Babel? Gen.</hi> 11.4. No better projects many times do we lay, but ſuch as will end in <hi>confuſion</hi>: At the beſt, we ſtudy, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our ſelues, for the moſt part, but about toyes, and trifles, and things that profit not. We rather chooſe <hi>Marthaes</hi> encombrance, than <hi>Maries</hi> better part. So that we haue great cauſe to renounce our owne judgement in chooſing.</p>
            <p>Againe, in the ſecond place, for <hi>wiſdome</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging and diſpoſing of a matter reſolued on, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the reſolution bee good, wee lacke that too.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1646:11"/>
There are but two wayes (we vſe to ſay) a right and a wrong, and do not wee generally take the wrong? In ſpirituall matters, we would worſhip God: but how? Our owne wiſdome would faine intermeddle too farre in the manner, &amp; intermingle the inuentions of our braines, which are very louely &amp; decent in our owne eyes, how contrary ſoeuer to Gods word: when in the meane time we marre all, corrupting our ſeruices, &amp; making them odious to God. It was certainly a godly mind in <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that moued them to bring the <hi>Arke</hi> out of the houſe of <hi>Abinadab,</hi> and their ſolemnity in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a new Cart for it, made a faire ſhew for the time, of diſcretion, and wiſdome; but afterwards they found their folly to their <hi>griefe,</hi> and that they had not ſought the Lord <hi>in due order,</hi> 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13. why? Becauſe they thought themſelues wiſe enough to manage that action, without following and obſeruing <hi>Gods order.</hi> In worldly matters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we ſaile either in not vſing right meanes or not in a right manner: Wee either leane on a Reede which will breake, and pierce our hands (as Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt is called, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 36.6.) or elſe wee take the wrong end of a good ſtaffe. Either we take thoſe courſes which will hinder, and prejudice our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or we worke ſo prepoſterouſly, ſo vnſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that we are not a whit the neerer, to that which we would effect. Surely, vnleſſe an higher proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence leade, and guide vs, we may all vſe the words of Eliphaz, <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.13, 14. <hi>Our counſels are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried headlong; wee meete with darkneſſe in the day time, and groape at noone day as in the night.</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1646:11"/>
in a caſe of extremitie, and in diſtreſſe wee are ſo diſtracted that we are at our wits end, and know not which way to turne our ſelues. So that in this reſpect we haue good reaſon to take <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> counſell, <hi>Leane not vnto thine owne vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Prou.</hi> 5.5. And let vs ingeniouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge vnto God with <hi>Ieremie</hi> (cap. 10 23.) <hi>O Lord I know that the way of man is not in himſelfe; it is not in man that walketh to direct his owne ſteps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third place wee are to deny our owne <hi>Power</hi> to accompliſh any worke though neuer ſo well conceiued, though meanes are neuer ſo well ordered, and the buſineſſe in very great forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Who is he</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ieremie, Lamen.</hi> 3.37.) <hi>that ſaith, and it commeth to paſſe when the Lord commandeth it not?</hi> I may adde; <hi>when he aſsiſteth not, proſpereth not</hi>; For, poore impotent creatures that we are, if we looke vnto <hi>ſpirituall</hi> actions, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as will to doe good of our ſelues, much leſſe can we carry our ſelues through any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duty with comfort, and ſucceſſe: <hi>Without mee</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ye can doe nothing, Ioh.</hi> 15.5. which is true alſo if we looke to <hi>temporall</hi> affaires, and emploiments. For what can we ſay we will doe? God can interpoſe when he will, and ſtay our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings a thouſand wayes. He can either ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly cruſh vs, and turne vs into duſt: or blow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our labours, or ſuffer others to croſſe and cleane ouerthrow our enterpriſes. So that, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>profit</hi> no man can ſay, my power, my labour, the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth,

Nor in point of <hi>honour, By my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie I haue builded my neſt on high: by the ſtrength of mine arme I haue gotten the victorie, Pſalm.</hi> 44.3. Therefore (to ſhut vp this firſt preparatiue act to into duty) we are in euery action to take notice of our weakneſſe, and to groane vnder euery imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as vnder a burden inſupportable, ſhould we haue no helpe: We may bee in continuall motion, <hi>rouling</hi> and <hi>tumbling</hi> our actions vp and downe, but ſhall neuer finde <hi>reſt,</hi> and <hi>firme ſetling</hi> of them, before we lay them vpon God: ſeeing before wee come to him, it is with vs as <hi>Mathematicians</hi> tell vs it is with a <hi>Globe</hi> vpon a <hi>plaine,</hi> impoſſible to ſtand ſtill, and as impoſſible to ſtirre to any purpoſe. If then we ſet vpon ſpirituall duties, ſay with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul, We are not ſufficient of our ſelues to thinke</hi> (much leſſe to doe) <hi>any thing as of our ſelues but our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>And nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he that planteth, any thing; nor he that watereth, but God that giueth the increaſe,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 7. If we goe about any worke of our worldly callings, humbly acknowledge with <hi>Dauid, Except the Lord build the houſe they labour in vaine that build it, Pſal.</hi> 127. 1. So, except he proſper other our handy-workes, in vaine do we think in our owne ſtrength to bring them to a wiſhed end: eſpecially when any more important affaire is in hand; as when preparations are made for <hi>warre,</hi> and publique ſeruice is to be done for the <hi>Church</hi> of God; then let vs be moſt ſenſible of our owne weakneſſe, and confeſſe with <hi>Iehoſhaphat, That we haue no might againſt our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor know we what to doe,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12.

But had not <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> a great Armie, and valiant men? Yes, yet in them was no might. Did not he know that he had no way but to lead out his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? yes, and yet he knew not what to doe. Only this, <hi>Our eyes</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>are towards thee,</hi> that is, ſeeing we cannot worke effectually for our ſelues, we <hi>roule</hi> (not our eyes only, but) our <hi>worke</hi> vpon thee ó Lord, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And thus we paſſe on from the firſt <hi>preparatiue,</hi> vnto the ſecond, an <hi>eſſentiall act</hi> of this duty: from the act of <hi>acknowledgement</hi> in humilitie of our <hi>ſelfe-inſufficiencie,</hi> to the act of <hi>Faith in dependencie</hi> on God, and his efficiencie. Now in this reſting and relying vpon God conſiſteth principally this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoluing or committing our worke vnto God, and this is manifeſted in ſo many acts as there were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars wherein we diſcouered our owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Firſt then, he that commits his worke to God, muſt depend as well on his <hi>wil</hi> and <hi>allowance</hi> before he begins it, as on his <hi>helpe</hi> and <hi>aſsiſtance</hi> afterward; he muſt out of that ſuſpicion he is to haue of his owne iudgement in choice, referre his determinations to God, conſult with him, and as he willeth, and preſcribeth, ſo doe, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. This was the courſe which Gods people tooke of old; they would neuer attempt any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, eſpecially of moment, without a warrant, Thus the Iſraelites, when <hi>Ioſhua</hi> their Generall was dead, before they ſtirred to elect another, asked of the Lord, <hi>who ſhould goe vp firſt for them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 11.

Iudg.</hi> 11.18, 23, 28. Thus did <hi>Dauid</hi> ſundry times, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.12. &amp; 30 8. Thus did many others of Gods ſeruants in ſuch like caſes, and all in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods ordinance, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.21. that the Prieſts ſhould aske counſell for them after the judgement of <hi>Vrim</hi> before the Lord, and at his word they ſhould goe out, and come in, &amp;c. But what tell I you of this extraordinarie courſe of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reſolution? We in theſe times can haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto a vocall <hi>Oracle,</hi> yet notwithſtanding we muſt looke that all our actions be lawfull, and warranted by that written <hi>Oracle</hi> which is among vs; Why elſe hath God left vs his word? Why are we called <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimonie, Eſa.</hi> 8.20. Whatſoeuer we commit to the determination of that word, we commit to God himſelfe. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But the Scripture (ſome will ſay) doth not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thouſands of particular actions, about which men are imploied. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> True, yet it giues ſuch rules and directions, as may be applied to euery action that we can poſſibly fall vpon, and are able to ſatisfie him that rightly applieth them. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we intend any holy worke or ſeruice, let vs commit it to God, and examine we our ſelues whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath licenced vs to meddle thus, or thus in his holy things, whether he hath called vs, and <hi>ſent vs,</hi> and <hi>ſet vs</hi> about them. If we go about any other ciuill actions, put each of them likewiſe to the queſtion, Is it lawfull? haue I any ground for it? and be reſolued from God before we aduenture on it. Wherefore we are to take <hi>Dauids</hi> courſe in ſubmmitting our ſelues to God, and waiting on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1646:13"/>
him continually to know the way wherein we ſhould walke, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.8. So that this is the ſumme; we are not to be our owne caruers, but leaue it to God to chalke out our way, and appoint our worke; otherwiſe we cannot worke in faith; <hi>and whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne, Rom.</hi> 14.23.</p>

and endeuour. For the better cleering of the point I lay downe two propoſitions; 1. That we are ſo to commit our workes to God, as that yet they may remaine <hi>our</hi> workes. 2. We are ſo to doe <hi>our</hi> workes, as not to buſie our ſelues with <hi>Gods</hi> worke. Firſt, I ſay, we are ſo to roule our workes vpon God, as yet to vndergoe ſomewhat our ſelues. Otherwiſe, how could the Text ſay [<hi>thy worke</hi>] if we had no finger in it? How other where could it be called [<hi>our way</hi>] if we neuer ſtirred a foot in it? Againe, for the laſt alleadged places; Can any dreame that Chriſt forbids all premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conuenient preparation before hand, when a man is (perhaps) to ſpeake in publique, and there where are both curious, and captious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers?

Would not ſuch <hi>idleneſſe</hi> be Sathans <hi>illuſion?</hi> Yes ſurely; for no precept rightly vnderſtood, contradicts ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

We muſt be like Pilots at Sea, who though their eyes are lifted vpward, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the <hi>ſtarres,</hi> yet hold their hand on the Helme to direct the <hi>Sterne</hi>: And we muſt imitate <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> and his people, who as they made their <hi>prayer</hi> to their God, ſo they ſet a <hi>watch</hi> day and night to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues, and their worke, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 4 9.</p>
            <p>The ſecond propoſition will make the point plainer, <hi>viz.</hi> That God would haue vs ſo to doe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1646:15"/>
               <hi>our owne</hi> worke, as not to buſie our ſelues with <hi>his worke</hi>: What now is <hi>our</hi> worke? To be induſtrious and diligent in vſing the meanes which God offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs, and employ thoſe talents which he hath giuen vs, after the beſt ſort we can. What is <hi>Gods</hi> worke then? To diſpoſe of all things according to his owne counſell, and to giue the ſucceſſe of the action according to his will: So that, if we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vex, &amp; diſquiet our ſelues with needleſſe <hi>feares,</hi> or torment our ſelues with ſolicitude and exceſſiue <hi>cares</hi> about the accompliſhment of our buſineſſe, we incroach vpon Gods worke, and that only is there forbidden.</p>
            <p>This now being cleered, it is apparent that our diligence, &amp; our repoſe on Gods prouidence may ſtand together; of which repoſe we now ſpeake, and it is to be practiſed in two reſpects: 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our ſelues; 2. of other meanes. Firſt, for our ſelues, we muſt yeeld as inſtruments to bee fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and prepared for the worke, and to be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and guided in it, by him.

When he prayed thus, going vp the hill, he knew no meanes how God would effect it, only he referred it to him who could either infatuate <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> or confound his counſell, as pleaſed him; but we finde how that God preſently as ſoone as he was gotten to the top of the hill, preſented vnto him a <hi>meane</hi> whereby it was poſſible <hi>Ahithophels</hi> counſell might be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſending of <hi>Huſhai</hi> vnto <hi>Abſalom</hi> to mate <hi>Ahithophel</hi> with his wiſdome, &amp; that proued effectuall. <hi>Gideon,</hi> when God had called him to fight againſt the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and had cauſed him to ſend home the greater part of his Army, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the remnant, choſe only 300. men, knew not (queſtionleſſe) how God would worke with thoſe men, or after what manner they ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the enemie, yet beleeued he that God would <hi>ſome way</hi> employ them: and we finde that God taught him, at length, <hi>how</hi> they ſhould be armed, <hi>how</hi> appointed, not with weapons, but with Trumpets, and fire-brands, and pitchers, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 7.16. Very pertinent to this point, is that worthy example of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeruant going to get a wife for his young maſter <hi>Iſaak, Gen.</hi> 24.13, 14. He not only truſted God with the <hi>ſucceſſe</hi> of his journey, but commited to his diſpoſing the <hi>meanes</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">¶ </seg>3</label> There remaineth only the laſt thing required to this Commiting &amp;c. <hi>viz. Prayer.</hi> For, as we muſt deny our ſelues, and depend on God for a warrant when we are in <hi>conſultation,</hi> for aſſiſtance, and meanes when we come to <hi>reſolution,</hi> and for ſucceſſe when the buſineſſe is to bee ripened, and brought to <hi>perfection</hi>: So we muſt make a ſolemne <hi>recommendation</hi> of our worke to God, in Prayer, which I called the <hi>formall act</hi> (that is, the ſet man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) of <hi>Commiſsion,</hi> becauſe whereas by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance</hi> we doe, indeed, really, and truly roule our burden vpon God, by this <hi>prayer</hi> that faith (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

other graces beſides) is acted forth, and cleerely manifeſted.</p>
            <p>I explaine my meaning by an ordinary courſe in Law (as I take it) <hi>viz.</hi> When a man puts ouer his eſtate to another, or eſtates another in any thing, there muſt be, beſides the writings drawne, a formall deliuery of them to the party: To theſe writings, wherein is contained the ſubſtance of the conueiance, I liken <hi>Faith</hi>: to the deliuery of theſe writings, in the manner of conueiance, I liken <hi>Prayer.</hi> Now for prayer, that it is included in this duty, is without queſtion. Some would haue it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or at leaſt principally, meant in the text, and therefore tranſlate it (in ſtead of <hi>Roule</hi> thy workes) <hi>Reueale</hi> thy workes vnto the Lord. But that they are miſtaken, both the proper ſignification of the Hebrew word ſheweth, and the nature of the thing.</p>
            <p>For, will my bare telling another that I am bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, eaſe me any whit, or keepe my burden from falling? No, vnleſſe I lay it vpon him, and he helpe to ſupport it: Will my faire words to another, how I will entruſt him with ſuch an eſtate of mine, either better mine eſtate, or keep it from decaying? No, vnleſſe by a due legall proceeding I reſigne it ouer vnto him, and ſo giue proofe that I truſt him. No more will a bare acquainting God with mine intentions, or actions, or griefes, further my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, or ratifie my deſires, vnleſſe I repoſe my confidence in him.</p>
            <p>Yet muſt we take in <hi>Prayer</hi> within the compaſſe of this <hi>Rouling,</hi> though not ſhut out the other for

If we looke backe to the examples of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, we ſhall finde diuers of them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering their faith in the prayer of <hi>Faith.</hi> It was in <hi>prayer</hi> that <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> confeſſed his weakneſſe and committed his worke of warfare vnto God: It was in <hi>prayer</hi> that <hi>Dauid</hi> asked God what hee ſhould doe, and in what way he ſhould walke: It was in <hi>prayer</hi> alſo that hee be truſted God with the meanes to be foole <hi>Ahithophel</hi>; as did <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to find out a wife for his yong maſter.

               <p>THeſe words appeare plainely to be a <hi>Promiſe</hi> ſubioyned to that counſell which the Wiſe man gaue in the former part of the Verſe; and containe that end which is aimed at by all agents, and eaſily obtained by taking that courſe, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that way which was premiſed.

               <p>Two words are to bee opened [<hi>Thoughts</hi>] and [<hi>Eſtabliſhed.</hi>] Thoughts in the ſoule of man are properly the inward agitations, or workings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, beating as it were, vpon an obiect fomerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; and we ſhall finde the greateſt vſe of them in matters either of <hi>weight</hi> or <hi>difficultie,</hi> and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1646:22"/>
the more wee are poſſeſſed, or preſſed with any thing, the more they are multiplied.

And indeed, this ſwarming of thoughts is a maruellous grieuance vnto a man, for they hinder and interrupt the cleare diſcourſe of reaſon, and raiſe as it were, ſuch a miſt in a mans minde, that hee is not able to diſcerne one truth from another. This noted by the way, I paſſe on to other acceptions of thoughts: For in Scripture they are often put for the <hi>effect</hi> of thoughts, that is, for counſels, and reſolutions taken after the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the thoughts; and ſo <hi>Ierem.</hi> 11.19. <hi>They haue thought a thought, or deuiſed a deuice againſt me. &amp;c.</hi> The word is the ſame which is vſed heere.

For inſtance; we finde God promiſing the Iſraelites that whilſt they went vp thrice in the yeare to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before him, no man ſhould ſo much as deſire their land, <hi>Exod</hi> 34.24. What? was it not in the power of the heathen borderers to haue inuaded that diſpeopled country at ſuch a time? Yes in ſome ſenſe it was, and had not God hindered, it is likely they would ſoone haue beene tampering with Gods inheritance: But we ſee that though they ſuppoſed they had ſtated themſelues, (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps out of ſome politique reſpects) yet it was God indeed that ſtayed them. Againe, we finde <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.18. that God would hiſſe for a flie from Aegypt, and a Bee from Aſſyria: and <hi>Iudges</hi> 4.7. that he would draw out Siſera to fight, &amp;c.

So that we ſee when man thinkes hee reſolues of himſelfe, then God hath his ſtroke in that reſolution. Now to anſwer
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1646:23"/>
this queſtion; why it is ſaid (notwithſtanding all this) that man deuiſeth his way? I anſwer;</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ſo ſaid to ſhew that though God in his counſell hath determined, and moderated our counſels, yet our naturall liberty in conſulting is not taken away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The firſt thoughts, and purpoſes of the heart may be attributed to man, rather than other acts <hi>comparatiuely</hi>; for thoughts and meditations, being the firſt productions, and the moſt ſimple acts of the faculties in man, his worke is moſt ſenſible therein, and leſſe of Gods worke is diſcerned. Whereas the more our operations are <hi>compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> the more are the acts and <hi>ioynt workings</hi> of diuine prouidence manifold, and <hi>doubled.</hi> I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe my ſelfe more clearely thus: In the motions of the will or minde, there God workes only vpon the will or minde, and that inwardly, and very <hi>cloſely</hi>: but when we come to execute our deſignes, there God muſt not only concurre with the <hi>ſoule,</hi> but with the <hi>parts of the body</hi> likewiſe, as with the <hi>tongue</hi> in ſpeaking, with the <hi>hand</hi> in working, with the <hi>feet</hi> in walking, and that more <hi>palpably</hi>: And hence it is that in ſpeciall manner the anſwer of the tongue is from the Lord, and our ſteps directed by him.

&amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.

Who ſeeth not there an euident fulfilling of this gracious promiſe? Nay (to appeale to our ſelues) who is there of vs that walkes with God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth him in his wayes, who hath not found it fulfilled vpon himſelfe? Many wayes doth God manifeſt his aſſiſtance in our working, as, 1. By giuing vs wiſdome to goe the right way to worke. 2. By bleſſing the inſtruments which we imploy. 3. By making times and ſeaſons and all occurrences to ſuit with our deſires. Wee are certainly either blinde, or very forgetfull, if we cannot ſay thus much out of experience. Yea, many times is not that true of vs, which is but fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of <hi>Timotheus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Captaine? Are not wee little better than <hi>aſleepe</hi> (as is ſaid hee was) when all things are brought into our <hi>net</hi> which we <hi>fiſh</hi> for?

How many ſuch probates of this truth might we finde in this booke! I will inſiſt no more vpon any of them, but will only propound the experience of <hi>Peter</hi> as a cleare confirmation of this promiſe, laid downe <hi>Luke</hi> 5.5, 6. <hi>Peter</hi> and others of his fellowes had beene toyling all night at their fiſhing worke, and had caught nothing: Chriſt bid him caſt out his net for a draught; at Chriſt his word (though otherwiſe he had little hope) he did it; thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his worke to Chriſt for the ſucceſſe of it, (yea another time euen for the ordering of the meanes, as caſting on the right ſide of the ſhip,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1646:26"/>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 21.6.) and what wonderfull ſucceſſe he had both times we may there reade. As it was with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in the worke of his fiſhing, ſo ſhall it be with Miniſters in their ſpirituall fiſhing, and with all of vs, in our ſeuerall emploiments, if we doe as he did, let God haue the managing of our worke, and beleeue him. Faith well grounded may wax bold, for it cannot but be welcome to God. O then <hi>let vs delight our ſelues in the Lord ſo ſhall we be ſure to haue our hearts deſire, Pſal.</hi> 37.4.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The certainty of this promiſe, as it is made to <hi>faith,</hi> is apparant: It is a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </label> I <hi>anſwer:</hi> The promiſe may be ſure, and yet the time of fulfilling it vncertaine. God doth not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe when to bring to paſſe our deſires, nor muſt we limit him. And many times indeed, hee ſuffereth our lawfull actions, and thoſe wherein we depend on him, to bee interrupted, and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for a long time. But what then? Shall wee ſuſpect his faithfulneſſe? By no meanes. If wee doe ſo, it is a ſigne we doe not truſt him with our

buſineſſe as we ſhould: for will not he that thinks any one able, and wiſe enough to doe the thing <hi>it ſelfe,</hi> leaue the time of doing it to him alſo? Doubtleſſe if wee cannot effect what we would preſently, it is either becauſe in the ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Gods prouidence, it cannot be done ſo ſoone, or if it could, it would not be ſo good for vs.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> we ſee that at length their worke proſpered, and why it did not ſooner wee may well gueſſe. For (ſay our Diuines) it is probable, that they had not throughly denied themſelues, but ſomething was defectiue, in their humiliation; and therefore we finde that whereas the firſt time they but <hi>inquired,</hi> the ſecond time, <hi>inquired</hi> and <hi>lamented,</hi> the third time they more <hi>ſolemnly faſted,</hi> and thereupon got the <hi>victory.</hi> Againe, it is not vnlikely that their enemies being ſo few, they were too confident in their ſtrength: God therefore, to let them know that all prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without him are but vaine, let them a while ſee their weakneſſe. So that we may rather gather a <hi>leſſon</hi> of continuall dependance vpon God from them, than a <hi>cauill</hi> to infringe a promiſe. And as for the other inſtance, we ſee that for all Gods <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe</hi> a long time, yet they forgot him not, but ſtucke cloſe to him, in their confident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.</p>

duty. But here is vſe of a diſtinction. Promiſes are either <hi>generall,</hi> or <hi>particular.</hi> Generall promiſes, made to all perſons; of which number this is one: but now ſome of theſe doe not hold in all caſes, for in ſome they are <hi>abſolute,</hi> in others <hi>conditionall.</hi> This <hi>in ſome caſes</hi> is but a conditionall promiſe, as namely when our workes, or affaires are ſuch as touch not our ſpirituall eſtate in the maine hold of it, but only this or that ciuill employment; and all conditionall promiſes haue their fulfilling reſerued to the pleaſure of God.</p>
               <p>To the point then, whether it be vncertaine I ſhall proſper in this worke or no, I ſay this, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I doe not proſper in it, yet the text remaineth good in theſe reſpects: 1. If wee commit our workes to God, wee muſt looke to the nature of them. If they be not ſuch as are <hi>abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,</hi> we ought not <hi>abſolutely to beleeue</hi> the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of them. Now to apply this by turning of it: Then only ſhall our thoughts bee <hi>eſtabliſhed abſolutely,</hi> when wee can <hi>abſolutely commit</hi> our workes to God without doubting. 2. If we fully roule our workes vpon God, our thoughts ſhall be eſtabliſhed, if not in the <hi>forenamed,</hi> yet, at leaſt, in <hi>another</hi> ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>after thoughts</hi> and counſels; for if Gods working for vs be not according to our <hi>firſt</hi> thoughts, yet our <hi>ſecond</hi> thoughts ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and fitted to his working, that is, hee will ſo ſatisfie vs in that particular that our <hi>thoughts ſhall be ſetled</hi> and we contented.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond doubt, whether none but <hi>theſe reſigners</hi> ſhall haue their thoughts eſtabliſhed, I

anſwer, yes, and that ordinarily. We finde it a ſcandall to the godly that the wicked do ſo proſper in their way, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 12.1. And they who are ſo farre from truſting God with their workes, that they aske what God can doe for them, yet haue <hi>their houſes filled with good things, Iob</hi> 22.17, 18. But what of all this? The promiſe only belongeth to the faithfull, and none but they can preſume, or with any reaſon looke to haue their thoughts eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. 2. The eſtabliſhment of thoughts, is vouchſafed in mercy only to them: to others, in judgement. The wicked are thereby more puffed vp in conceit of their owne power, and prudence, and policie: but the godly haue their eyes opened to ſee God the better, and the rather to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his prouidence. 3. They that worke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, haue not their counſels and thoughts fully eſtabliſhed: for firſt they cannot be ſo <hi>eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed</hi> when they are <hi>troubled,</hi> and <hi>diſtracted</hi> with cares, and feares; but ſo troubled they muſt needs be, when they want <hi>faith,</hi> which is it that <hi>ſetleth</hi> and <hi>compoſeth</hi> them. Secondly, how can their thoughts bee properly ſaid to be <hi>confirmed,</hi> when the Scripture tels vs, their expectation is ſuddenly <hi>cut off,</hi> and themſelues ſoone <hi>cut downe,</hi> yea gone in a moment? We find their eſtates called ſlippery,<note place="margin">

               <p>Firſt, how can they looke for eſtabliſhment who deny not themſelues, but are confident in their owne ſtrength, and ability to carry their owne burden? God hath pronounced, that he <hi>reſiſteth the proud,</hi>

                  </note> and certainly their actions can neuer proſper whom God reſiſteth.</p>
               <p>As it is one point of his omnipotency to be able to doe what he will without let or hinderance: ſo it is another, to bee able to hinder whatſoeuer he is not pleaſed with. Now if <hi>they</hi> be not proud (and ſo of the number of thoſe whom hee will hinder) who hold themſelues able to moue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, in whom they both liue, and moue, and who acknowledge no <hi>powerfull concurrence,</hi> or prouidence of <hi>him</hi> in their worke, <hi>who</hi> indeed, ſuſtaines both them, and it, if, I ſay, theſe be not proud, I know not who are.</p>
               <p>Yet more particularly, how can they looke for eſtabliſhment who enterpriſe any worke without Gods warrant, and approbation? Gods promiſes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1646:30"/>
are made to obedience, not to heady preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He that asketh not Gods leaue, nor hath his conſent, hath none of his company. So hee told them that would needs goe vpon a peece of ſeruice without his command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.42. <hi>I am not among you, &amp;c.</hi> And he who is without God, and left alone to himſelfe, is likely to haue ſuch ſucceſſe as they had in that action.</p>
               <p>Againe, what a folly is it for a man to preſume that his affaires can be well managed or diſpoſed of when he runs vpon his owne head, and neuer hath any reſpect vnto God nor his guidance? It is not a ſufficient ground that ſuch an enterpriſe ſhall bee effected, to be aſſured that it is warranted or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued: He that giues vs leaue, vnleſſe he ſet vs in a right courſe and direct vs, we cannot but faile and falter in the manner of doing it. And will not he (thinke we) let vs alone when we thinke our ſelues able enough to contriue the only courſe, and deuiſe the beſt way to compaſſe it? Surely, we may looke that he will either infatuate our counſels, and beſot our minds, or elſe croſſe thoſe meanes which might otherwiſe, with his bleſſing, haue beene effectuall: Either wee ſhall goe the wrong way to worke, as <hi>Abſalom,</hi> in reiecting <hi>Ahithophels,</hi> and embracing <hi>Huſhai's</hi> counſell <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.14.</note>: or leane vpon poore tottering props, as the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> committing their worke to <hi>Goliah</hi> who deceiued them, and could not make good his vndertakings <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note>: Or if we vſe good meanes (without dependance on Gods bleſſing) and at length obtaine our deſires, yet wee are commonly like the children of Iſrael, going that iourney forty

yeeres, which perhaps might haue beene diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in forty daies.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, who can expect eſtabliſhment, that thinke themſelues ſufficient to make an end of their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and depend not vpon God for the ſucceſſe of it? Will God ſuffer himſelfe to bee robbed of the praiſe of his wiſdome and power? He will not, but will lay open the weakneſſe of theſe men by ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their deuices, and confounding their purpoſes, that they may learne, that with him onely are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and ſtrength, and wiſdome, to eſtabliſh mans thoughts, and that though they take counſell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it ſhall not ſtand but come to nought, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.10.</p>
               <p>Now if they cannot proſper who wait not on God, what ſhall we thinke of them that are angry both with God and others, when their actions are but a little croſſed? We read of <hi>Xerxes</hi> King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> who hearing that his bridge ouer <hi>Helleſpont</hi> was broken downe with the waues of the Sea, cauſed three hundred ſtripes to be giuen to the Ocean in way of reuenge.
