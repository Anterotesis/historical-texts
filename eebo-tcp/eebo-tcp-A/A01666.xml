            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the saying of <hi>Cambyses,</hi> (reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, and in Christ most honorable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) that Cities would floorish wel in prosperitie, if the inhabiters of them were watchful, and still imagined their enemis to be at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. That which he said for the prosperous estate of a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale,<note place="margin">Matth. 14.25. Mark. 13.

And both tende to shewe, that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee respect the safetie of our bodyes here on this earth, or the saluation of our soules in the kingdome of Christ, wee may not be in our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings either idle, carelesse, or secure. But yet, such is our nature, wee rather obey the woordes of <hi>Cambyses,</hi> for temporall prosperitie, than the warnyng of Christe, for eternall happynesse.

<pb facs="tcp:15674:2"/>
fayre bodyes, but deformed soules: much goodes, but litle goodnes: and glorious wee seeme in the sight of men outwardly, but odious inwardly in the eyes of God. For it is harde to finde a man (saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aristot lib. 2. Rhetor. ad Theodecten. cap. 10.</note>) which in prosperitie is not proude, disdainful, and arrogant, of which sort are they, whom strength, whom riches, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> clientes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authoritie, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fauour of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath exalted. And so inioying their harts desire, they are of this mynd, that no aduersitie ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hurt them. And what is that, but as <hi>Dauid</hi> said, The vngodly hath saide in his hart, tushe,<note place="margin">Psalm. 10.</note> I shall neuer be caste downe, there shall no harme happen vnto me. But the fayrest Oke is soonest cut down: the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Oxe is readyest for slaughter:<note place="margin">Prouerb. 1.</note> and the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of fooles, is their owne destruction. For how sodainely doo they consume, vanishe,<note place="margin">Psalm. 73.</note> and come to fearefull ende: yea, euen as a dreame are they, when one awaketh.</p>
            <p>As our Sauiour thought the doctrine against securitie, most profitable for his Disciples, and all mankynde: So hath his faythfull seruant the Author of this booke, supposed the same moste necessarye to bee spoken of, in these miserable dayes. And this was the cause and ende where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Treatise was first written, namely, that by reciting the signes and tokens of dangers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, and of the worlds destruction, he might draw the wicked from securitie, and driue them to a care of godlynesse and vertue. A godly,
<pb facs="tcp:15674:3"/>
zealous, and learned woorke, and gratefull, no doubt, to all good men. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> forewarned the <hi>Grecians</hi> of a greeuous plague, which was nigh at hande, and for his good admonition he was honoured as <hi>Hercules,</hi> and obeyed as a god. The <hi>Athenians</hi> for telling them the perils which they were like to fall into,<note place="margin">Cardanus de rerum varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e.</note> erected to <hi>Berosus</hi> a goodly Image with a golden tongue. The <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and the <hi>Athenians</hi> to <hi>Berosus</hi> were neuer so bounde, as all Christians to <hi>Schelton,</hi> for this learned booke. For herein the tokens of the ruine, not of one Citie, as of <hi>Athens:</hi> nor of one Countrie, as of <hi>Greece</hi>: but of all the worlde, are set downe. And here may be seene the wayes to preuent the destruction, not of body alone, as were those of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Berosus,</hi> but of body and soule from euerlastyng paine in the pyt of hell. So that more cause haue Christians to be thankfull to this author, than were the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> to both them. Notwithstanding he desireth not (though his deserts be vnspeakeable) to be honoured with the rites of <hi>Hercules</hi> (suche idolatrie he abhorreth) nor to be kept in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with a glorious Image (such memoriall he misliketh) he only craueth that Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s would weigh what is said, and looke to them selues: he seeketh the saluation of all, not his owne glory. But howe soeuer he be esteemed of others, I trust your Lordships wyll like of this woorke: and so like it, that ye wyll allowe it: and so allowe it,
<pb facs="tcp:15674:3"/>
that yee wyll both against the euyll woordes of the enuious, and the captious tongues of malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons, willingly protect it. It pleased the Author, to chuse for Patrons, at the first, two noble Earles: but mee thinkes none so meete for defence thereof, being a Spirituall Discourse, as Spirituall men: and because it tendes to the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away of securitie, who better Patrons than they, whose office is to be vigilant, whereof they haue their names? And among Bishoppes, who fitter than they, whose authoritie is such, as none may better, and zeale so great, as none wyll soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner seeke, and promote the glorye of God? Wherfore I trust, both because it is diuine, your Lordships wyll vouchsafe: and because it was wel accepted by two worthy men, but yet Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, your honours wyll much more willyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowe the same, being Spirituall. And that you may doo so, God, for whose glory it was first made, and is nowe translated, put into your myndes.</p>

               <hi>We must all appeare before the tribunall seate of Christ, that euery one may beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way those things which he hath in his body doone ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which he hath committed, be it good or bad?</hi> Wherefore of these may certaynly be gathered that none of them beleeue eyther the sweete promises of God, or seuere and horrible threates, which stubbornly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist his commau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dements, and do not obey them. For it cannot be that either beleeuers should lyue after the flesh,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Luc.</hi> 16.</note> or lyuers after the flesh, should be beleeuers: because, not beleeuers, but lyuers after the flesh, shall dye. And of this we haue a manifest example in that rich man, crauyng of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would send <hi>Lazarus</hi> to his fiue brethren, to warne them, least they came into that place of torment. By which no doubt he would signifie, that they would more esteeme the aucthoritie of <hi>Lazarus</hi> commyng from the dead, then <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophetes. And therefore what marueyle if he contemned charitie, when he cared not for faith? That when he flowed with such abundance of all things, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all fauoured poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> lying miserably before hym? And therfore, because he was without fayth and charitie, beyng departed from this world, was cast headlong into hell. And as this vnbeliefe is the very spring of sinne, and of all vngratiousnes the gulfe, in which, all vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb facs="tcp:15674:7"/>
are drowned: so contrarywise, true and Christian fayth (by which we haue a sure trust to Gods mercy, and free remission of our sinnes, promised to vs through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Christ the sonne of God) is the liuely fountaine in Christ, by the helpe of the holy ghost, of loue both of God and our neighbour: and it is (at one woorde) the cause of all spiritual good, which follow her as necessarily (as heate doth fire.) Because it is meete (if beleeuers liue after the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite) that the holy ghost stirre in them like motions, to hym selfe. But yet alas, great infirmitie and weakenesse is in the faithfull, although regenerate, so that not seldome they stande in doubt of Gods promises, and therefore haue great neede of proppes, to keepe them from falling: for we are more delighted with apparant and present things, than with future and inuisible. For naturally those things which are obiect vnto vs, doo more moue our senses,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.</note> than those which are of faith, which is the substance of things to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, an argument of things not appearing, whose litle sparke sometyme appeareth in vs, and is much to be raised by the woord of God, that it may the more increase, and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our dead members with the heate of the holy Ghost. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in our greatest temptations, and most cruell persecution, the Diuell, togeather with our vile fleshe, bring great doubts into our myndes, of the promises of God, especially when we behold the vngodly to liue in this world in al pleasure to their hartes desire, ioyfully: which thing that kingly Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> in his Psalmes dooth at large and plainly teach vs.<note place="margin">

               </note> And therefore the miseries of this lyfe are the more easily borne, when we doo as it were behold the ende of them before our eyes. Of which it commeth, that to the godly (truely thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them selues to wander in this world, not to liue in their owne countrey) the remembraunce of these euylles is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, and is a great comfort in all miseries, to thinke by death, in that last commyng of Christ, at the length that they shall haue a most free entrance into that celestial Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, sweete, and eternall Countrey, of which, in a most assured hope by fayth, they knowe them selues citizens.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15674:8"/>Wherfore I haue thought it very expedient, by certaine arguments, to set against all infidelitie, the doctrine of the Prophetes and Apostles, concernyng the last commyng of Christ to the vniuersall iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, before which, in the ruine of this wretched world, shall in a moment appeare the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the flesh, and a sodaine change of all men liuyng.

For his commyng in this last age of the world, without doubt is not farre, and maketh great hast, and wyll not (as many suppose) linger.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, in this litle woorke, I haue determined by some euident places of the Scripture,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The argument of the booke.</hi>
               </note> first to proue, that there shal be one day a generall destruction of this world and an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall and last iudgement of our Lord Iesus Christ the sonne of God, in which all the promises of God shall to the vttermost be fulfilled, and his great threates shall take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Then by the testimonies of holy Scripture we wil shew, that the age of this world shall not be more then sixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeres: &amp; that the sixt thousand (in which we now liue, whose tyme is more than halfe past) because of intollerable wickednesse, and shamelesse securitie of men, shall not be fully finished. And to this shalbe added certaine singuler signes by course of tyme, and yeares woonderfully agreeing with the inclinations of the Starres, (if credit may be geuen to Mathematicians) which things notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding I referre to the iudgement of the Church, and doctors of more discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Last of al, certain proofes out of Scripture shalbe brought of the maner of Christ his commyng, and of the effect of the last iudgement: with an exhortation to watchfulnesse, for that most ioyful commyng of our bridegrome.</p>

But about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle age of the world, when as three thousande yeeres were past, to wit, in the time of <hi>Iosaphat</hi> King of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and <hi>Achab</hi> King of <hi>Israell,</hi> did this diuine Prophet vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Prophecie, by which he did signifie the true and certaine tyme of Moses gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Messias or sonne of God, which should manifest himselfe, preach, and be crucified of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> And he shewed, that almost a thousande yeeres did remaine, before Christ should come and the Gospell begin to be preached: &amp; about two thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeres after his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, the world should perish and come to nought. Nowe sith according to this Prophecie of <hi>Elias,</hi> the euent hath proued two thousande yeeres to haue beene past before Circumcision, and manifesting the lawe, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande also to haue passed when Christ came, (for vntill the thirtie yeere of Christes age, at which tyme Iohn did prepare the way to the Lord, and Christ began to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the will of his father, did the fourth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande continue) it is to be thought vndoubtedly, that nowe in the olde age of the world, the euent will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare to his prophecie, and that as in the middle, and flourishing state of the world, God carried <hi>Elias</hi> by a firy chariot into heauen, so in the ende and vanishing tyme thereof, he wil exalt vs with him self into the celestial ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of which no doubt <hi>Elias</hi> was a figure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stituted of god.

But when al those euyls imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the preaching of the Gospel, haue come on heapes abundantly vppon vs, and more than euer they dyd in any age long before vs, no doubt they do prognosticate and foretel vs, of the consummation of this most wicked worlde. Besides, that these tokens which Christ dyd recite, do foreshewe the worldes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and not the subuersion of the Temple, it is apparant, because he saith, <hi>that people against people, and kingdome against kingdome shall arise.</hi> Whiche thyng was not done before the destruction of Hierusalem, that euer I could reade. For then,<note place="margin">An answere vnto certayne obiections.</note> what kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst kingdome? what people against people: what, and howe great warres were then? All which we do not onely see to haue been done, but also to our paine feele them, besides more greeuous things not yet heard of, but more to be feared, and circumstances bring vs to that mynd, to thinke that more intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things are prepared to vexe vs, both of Turke and Papist. And that also in the same place (as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) the Lord vnderstoode the last preaching, not the beginnyng of his Gospel, thereof it is euident, because by and by he adioyneth, That the Gospell beginnyng to shine euery where, a visitation shal come, and end of all thyngs. Otherwise, if this place were to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode of the first openyng of the Gospel, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, no doubt this ende had been come many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

yeares agoe. Besides, the Euangelist returneth to the former question of the Temples, and Hierusalems destruction, from whence he digressed. Peraduenture also the Euangelistes haue confounded these two, that not by the same wordes they might finish nowe that, now this particularly: because peraduenture they were of this opinion, that they thought, that after the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of Hierusalem, should immediately follow the destruction of the world: whose ende (as Christ said) should be so sodaine, as nothing coulde be more. But Christ our Lorde coulde of his owne accorde disioyne those things, to make them darke for a tyme, which he would not haue to be knowen, and could make them manifest, when it were for his glory, and our profite, at a tyme conuenient.</p>
               <p>But to make of these tokens foretold of Christ, any long discourse, it were a great labour, and peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tedious to the Reader, because the thing it selfe, and experience do sufficiently proue, these signes after the manifesting of the Gospel, to haue been fulfylled, except onely those in the Sunne, and Moone, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Starres, as yet haue not appeared, whiche Christe doth tel, should eyther shew them selues a litle before, or in his very comming. The <hi>Mathematicians</hi> and <hi>Astronomers</hi> iudgement notwithstanding is, that in many hundred yeeres past, were neuer seene so manye Eclipses in the Sunne and Moone, nor yet so strange copulations of Planets as wyll appeare within fewe yeeres, which no doubt are to threaten vnto vs daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and miserable dayes, as hereafter shalbe shewed.

But (I beseech you) let vs call to our remembraunce, all those euils, which as yet we doo as it were beholde and haue tasted, not heard of, doo see with our eyes, and to our great griefe suffer them continually. What a greeuous pestilence and plague these many yeeres, both with vs and in other places hath reygned, and tyrannically dooth exult ouer all persons, and bring very many to their graues, and according to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the learned (which are in opinion that it will and must continue yet moe yeeres) will dispach many moe?

either on those which liue in pouertie, or careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reserued to some other good vse? For as plentye brings pride and hautines of mynde: so pouertie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth contempt, not onely of Ministers, but of the Ministrie also, which being disdayned for lacke of preferment, mens cogitations are so turned, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had to bynd their sonnes to some seruile oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, then bring them vp in liberall instruction: by which, must needes followe not onely the great scarsitie of learned men,<note place="margin">Contempt of the ministerie.</note> but also greeuous want of godly Ministers, and so consequently, the miserable estate and ouerthrowe of the Church. Now what remayneth but that we certaynly perswade our selues, that rhese are playne and euident signes and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Gods great displeasure agaynst vs for dispising his Ministers, whose contempt he neither can for his holines, nor will for his iustice suffer any time, as the the manifold miseries &amp; plagues that be euery where, doo shewe vnto vs. And as the sonne of God Christ sayd before, that after the preaching of the Gospell, destruction should follow, I hope the time is so farre from being differred, that it will spedely come vppon vs. For it cannot be but that the prophecie of Christ should be true: which could not be, if those dayes of barbarousnes and ignorance of true religion (which we are lyke to fall into) were not by his speedy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming preuented.</p>

Now, if we wil compare tyme present with that which is past, and set the manners of all men before our eyes, we shall perceyue wickednes to haue come to his ripenes, and to raigne almost without control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

For we see continually that many through their cogging, prating, pride, and flatterie, without all honestie, learning, or Christianitie, in hope of profit, and preferment, prickt thervnto, beate their braines, and bende al their studyes, to be gratious in their eyes, which sit in chiefest place aboue other men. By which it commeth to passe, that for a time they are well accepted euen of the best: but good Princes can

smell them out, and wil banishe them their companie, perswading themselues that that friendship is not of continuance, whose ende and grounde is not the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foorth, and encrease of vertue.

And here we shall see a wonderfull concente, and agreeing of tymes, that so by things past, we may looke for the euent of things to come, vndoubtedly by the singular prouidence, counsayle, and ordinance of God. For no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can I render, sith I cannot perswade my selfe, that
<pb facs="tcp:15674:27"/>
these things, can by chance so wonderfully agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather. First, by the true accompt of yeeres, it is playne, that from the comming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and publishing of the lawe, vnto the Natiuitie of Christ, are numbred a thousand, fiue hundred, and nine yeres. Now if the yeeres from the Natiuitie of Christ, vntill this time, in which Christ began agayne to be borne to the world, and to be brought into the light as it were through the preaching of the Gospel, by <hi>Luther,</hi> and other famous men, were numbred, they are in summe, a thousand, fiue hundred, and seuenteene. Agayne, from the departure out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> vntill the death of Christ, the yeeres are accompted to be a thousand, fiue hundred, fortie and two. And this number also dooth marueilously agree with that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Persecution in <hi>Germanye</hi> made by <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and the Pope, which happened in the yeere a thousand, fiue hundred, fortye and seuen. So that these numbers of yeeres beyng compared togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wilbe found not much to differ in quantitie of number.</p>
               <p>But from these poore mentions, I will goe higher to those things, which especially doo agree to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. It is manifest, that <hi>Moses</hi> gouernment, vntyll the last destruction of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> by <hi>Titus,</hi> did stand in all, one thousand, fiue hundred, eightie &amp; three yeeres. Neyther is it to be doubted of any, but that that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and wasting (of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>) is a manifest fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the last ruine of this world. And therfore doth our Lord speake of these things together, and sayth: those dayes were the dayes of <hi>Noe</hi> in respect of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the securitie of mans lyfe. Nowe at length, what shall we gather of these things? That the terme of the worlds destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should agree with the former number of yeeres of <hi>Moses</hi> gouernment? Which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15674:27"/>
not the sonne of an Emperour, or chiefest Monarch, as was Ierusalem: but the sonne of God much mightier than all Emperours, an euerlasting king, can bring to naught.<note place="margin">Melancthonin vita Vaspati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani.</note> Which thing <hi>Melancthon</hi> seemeth plainly to point at in the lyfe of <hi>Vespasian</hi> in his Chronicles: and the like reason is here, which is in the former compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, if things to come may be gathered by things past already.

<pb facs="tcp:15674:29"/>
of the tymes foretold, the signes and starres seeme to agree togeather, and without all doubt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the same thing. In lyke manner may we bring foorth other comparisons of tyme, which by reason of lyke euentes, agree togeather wonderfully. Of which this one is not of least wayght: To witte, that same tyme from the natiuitie of Christ vnto the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> is almost equall with that, when <hi>Luther</hi> first of all set himselfe agaynst rhe Popes Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and began to preach the Gospell to this yeere eyghty and eyght, in which or about the same, by this marueylous ioyning togeather of Planets, which shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be foure yeeres before, by the singuler prouidence of God, so direful destinies of the world shall meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather. For from the byrth of Christ vntyll the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> are numbred seuentie and three yeeres: and from the tyme <hi>Luther</hi> and others first began to preach Christ and his Gospell, vntill the eyghtie and eyght yeere, are acompted seuentie and one. The number is iust with that before, (and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king allegorically,) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may Christ be sayd to be born againe, when as his doctrine, so long by Papisticall dreames darkened, &amp; fond illusions so deeply buried, is as it were borne anewe, and doth clearely shine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs. But if those yeeres from the birth of Christ vntill his preaching, and suffering of death, with that generall persecution done by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifte and the Pope: and againe those yeeres from rhe death of Christ vntill the destruction of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> wyth these yeeres, which came since that general persecution, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the eightie and eight yeere, were compared: we shall see also that in number of yeeres they doo not much differ. For between Christes birth and his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, there was thirtie yeeres: and so to his death .33. yeeres, and somewhat more. But from that seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15674:29"/>
yeere, when the Euangelicall doctrine began to shine againe, vntill the fortie and sixe yeere in all, when <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour began to arme himself against the states of the Empire, so to abolish the doctrine of Christ, are numbred twentie and nine yeeres. Againe, from the death of Christ to the ouerthrowe of <hi>Heru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> there was fortie yeeres. And from that generall persecution, which happened in the fortie and sixe yeere, vntill the eightie and sixe yeere, are accompted fortie yeeres: which is the middle yeere between the eightie foure, when that exceeding straunge vniting together of the Planets shall appeare, and the eyghtie eight, about which that coniunction shall take his full force.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, I find, that these tymes, in which those two wonderfull coniunctions dyd appeare, sixe yeres before the byrth of Christe, and in the dayes of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and the thyrd, and last, which shal happen before the ful expiryng of sixe thousand yeres, the thousand, fiue hundred, eighty and foure beyng at hand, do fyll the same number. For <hi>Cyprian Leouitius</hi> doth write, that that other vnityng of Planets in the tyme of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, chaunced in the yeare, seuen hundred, eighty and nyne, after the natiuitie of Christ. If to this number so many moe were added, the yeares would be, one thousand, fyue hundred, seuenty, and eight. Nowe, if to these were added, those sixe yeares before Christ was borne, when the first of these three coniunctions happened, there shall aryse, countyng from the Natiuitie of Christ, as it were from an effect of the former coniunction, the same number of yeares in full quantitie agreeing with that dreadfull yeare, eighty foure, aboue a thousande fiue hundred: onely that first, from this last, which is to come, differyng those sixe yeares before Christes byrth.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:15674:30"/>I confesse my selfe not to be skilfull in Astronomie, although I do greatly esteeme that Arte (if it be sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vsed, and not vainely abused) which some, because they are not acquainted therewith (as commonly it happeneth) doo not onely despise, but also with euyll wordes, because it is abused of some, deface.

               <p>And therefore from these thyngs doo cunnyng A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers fetch their coniectures, bycause through a certayne order which the Starres doo keepe, they haue by long vse obserued very many thyngs, that so, from a true obseruation of principles, they may bring foorth generall coniectures, whose euents doo marueylously agree togeather.

Truely, as oft as I consider these things, I am not only exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in mynd, but as it were compelled to beleue, that that especiall tyme of the end of this world, is nigh at hand: because the Lord among other things also hath gyuen as certayne tokens, these to wyt: that before his commyng, there shalbe a darkenyng of the Sunne and Moone, and that the qualities of the heauens shalbe troubled.

And yet notwithstanding these, as I said before, decrees of Popes, although they be cleane contrarie to the wyll of God, haue had more aucthoritie among men, than the eternall woord of God. Bycause those, although in deede wicked and vngodly, yet haue been called holy, and Catholike, and they which haue been conuersant in them, our chiefe masters, and doctors were counted, to whom the sacred Scripture was most vnsauerie. So that to take an honest woman to wyfe (which <hi>Paule</hi> commaunded his Byshops to doo) was dishonestie, and more dishonestie than either openly to vse a concubine, or secretly to commit adulterie. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so on the Friday to eate flesh, was a great sinne and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie: and yet on that day to follow drunkennes and carnalitie, was no shame, but highly commended. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse to heare the blasphemous Masse, to reuerence an Idolatrous peece of breade, and to carry the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a pompous Procession, was no impietie but good Religion, and yet to celebrate the Supper of the Lord soberly according to his institution, was no god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes, but great abhomination. At a woord, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Christ, a good and godly conuersation, was of them suspected, as erronious: &amp; yet forsooth their deuilish decrees, and damnable doctrine was holy, and nothing pernicious. Their impuritie, great pietie: their hypocrisie, great holynes, their damnable cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, was the diuine seruice of God. So that all Christian Religion was vtterly banished, and no token of the true seruice of God could be seen. But now in
<pb facs="tcp:15674:42"/>
the yeare of the Lorde a thousand fyue hundred nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and three after Christes birth, which is the fyue thousand, fyue hundred, and fiue yeare after the world was made, that expiring of fyue hundred yeares draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nygh, in which these decrees of Popes gathered together by publike aucthoritie to the great defacing of Gods woord, and the merites of Christ, shall haue theyr ende.

Vndoubtedly that number of fyue hundred yeeres in lyke manner as the others spoken of before, doo presage the same lyke thing: the Prognostications of the starres (as may be gathered by that which is spoken) take their effect about the same tyme: The preaching of the Gospell, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tokens mentioned of Christ is gonne before: and the Iustice of God especially dooth exacte the same.</p>

               <p>But that more playnly these things may be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode, it must be knowen what we call Arithmeticall proportion, and Geometricall, according to iustice: and also how these two proportions are perfectlye contayned in this yeere of the .5555. which in the yeere .95. ensuing,<note place="margin">The definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Arithmety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> shalbe the the yeres since the worlds foundation. Arithmeticall proportion is, when as three, or moe numbers being set, all without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of proportions doo differ by equall ods, as .1.2.3.4.5. Here continually one number differs from the other but in vnitie, as also .2.4.6.8.10. in which one differeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, but the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of two.<note place="margin">Melant. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit. mo.

This Arithmeticall proportion, <hi>Aristotle</hi> ascribeth to the exchangeable iustice. For euen as euery number playnly doth differ from other in equall summe: so a great equalitie, there must be between the ware, and the price, least while one is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured, the other by his losse and dammage become riche. The Geometrical proportion is,<note place="margin">Geometrical proportion whar,</note> when as three or moe summes being set, we consider not the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of numbers, but marke the equalities of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.

and man: and that the state of a common weale is then best, when it consisteth of a Geometricall equalitie, which appointeth persons, and ordaineth offices ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatnes and worthines of giftes, and bestoweth rewardes to worthy persons, whereof it is well called of the Philosophers a distributiue Iustice. For examples sake, as in the gouerning of a ship, the ruling of the same is not committed to any man, but vnto him which is skilfull, and for his cunning, and well guiding therof he receyueth a better stipend than other which are vnskilful: so also to a vertuous, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, iust, constant, and graue person, the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the common Weale is to be committed, and withall a woorthy honour: least by a gouernment, which is rude, wicked, and tyrannicall, the common weale be brought to destruction. Also in the affaires of priuate persons, this Geometricall equalitie is to be obserued. For a greater honour and reuerence is due to the Magistrate, than to an other man, to our paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes than to straungers: to an old man, than to a yong, to a learned, than to an ignorant.

And therfore by these we plainly perceyue, that in this world no Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call equalitie according to the distributiue iustice (which is the best) is any where obserued, But yet
<pb facs="tcp:15674:47"/>
(sith God is iust) all kinde of iustice necessarily to all must be extended, so that to the worthy, all things must be giuen, but from the wicked, all things which falsely they haue taken to themselues, and abused to the molesting of the godly, shall vtterly be taken away. Wherefore needes must there be another lyfe after this, and therfore for those reasons alledged we set downe, that the Lorde God dooth foreshowe to the studious, by this dubble proportion or equalitie of numbers, a certaine finishing of things with an vtter destruction of this wicked world, and withall, he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly dooth giue vs to vnderstand, and signifies the beginning of the building anewe of the eternall kingdome of Christ, which with vpright iudgement, and by equalitie in euery respect, he will establish per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, and make it endure world without end.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:15674:49"/>
such like reasons and examples cause me to thinke. For in many places of the Scripture, we often find, that the Lord hath been greatly delighted in geuyng them, either by plaine wordes, or secret prouidence, fyt and proper names, by whom it hath pleased hym, for the glory of his name, to bestowe vppon his Church any great benefite. Hereof is <hi>Abram</hi> called of God, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and the forerunner of the Sonne of God, is called <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Sonne of God hym selfe receyued a name from the Angell, and was called <hi>Iesus,</hi> that is, a Lord, and Sauiour, redeeming the worlde from sinne: which afterward receyued a name, according to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was called <hi>Christ,</hi> that is, Annoynted, annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs with his holy spirit, that so we might acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be our Christ. Wherfore let it not seeme straunge vnto vs, if those letters, by the diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, doo containe many and great mysteries within them. For the Lorde God by a certaine incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible prouidence, not according to mans wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or foreknowledge of things to come, doth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouerne the thoughtes and tongues of men, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, and Cities, in which the Lord God wyll shewe eyther his singular fauour, and marueilous woorkes of mercie, or his anger and heauie displeasure, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue fatall names accordingly. And therefore by this reason it came to passe no doubt, that king <hi>Dauid,</hi> which signifyeth well beloued, should receyue a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name: as also the Prophet <hi>Daniell</hi> his, signifying the iudgement of the Lorde. Because in him the Lord God dyd shewe foorth his singular kindnes manye wayes, and in this his secrete iudgement concerning the Empyres of the world, and their endes, and of the two commings of Christ, the first vyle in the fleshe, the second victorious, to iudgement. So likewyse <hi>Babylon,</hi> receyued a fit name, but in a diuers respect, not onely
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15674:49"/>
because that in her there was made a confusion of tongues: but especially because of the confounding of manners, and wickednes, of Religion, and Idolatry together.

partlye also, because it ariseth of seuen, seuen times dubbled. But experience, and the assertion of the learned, proues, that euery seuen yeere from their byrth, to their death, is very daungerous, contrary to noble wits, and notable men of the best nature by a certaine agreement they haue with their maker. For sith all that is made hath been created by the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wisedome of God, and by a certaine secret power ingrafted, tendes to his natural conseruation, &amp; seekes that is best for his good estate, it very likely appeares, that famous men, haue a more affinitie with theyr se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond byrth, the most artificiall nature beyng made of God, than eyther beast, or beastly men: and therefore that they are of God more tyed wyth nature her self to a certaine tyme. But these are counted especially cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macterian yeeres, which by seuenfolde ascend, as is the 21. yeere, which dooth consist of three times seuen. such be .42. and 63. yeeres, counting aswell by nynes, as by seuens, and therefore be they iudged to be very hurtfull to notable fellowes.

All which (to speake the truth) were coniectures of no waight, and could proue nothing, did not Christ and Paule in plaine woordes signifie vnto vs, that the worldes ende, together wyth the glorious comming of the sonne of God to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are at hand: and as it were at our doores, when we shall plainely perceiue the Gospell of the kingdome of Christ to be preached throughout all the world, and the sonne of perdition by the spirit of Gods mouth to be so confounded, that nothing shal seeme to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, but his vtter defamation: and to this purpose finally doo serue other coniectures, as is aboue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>Here by reason of numbers, one thing more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be marked, because it agrees with that aboue mentioned, comes into my mynde, the which was told me by an honest man, skilfull in Astronomy, and Geometrie, and of good credit. For he sayd, that in the .1568. when <hi>Ericus</hi> King of <hi>Suethland</hi> (which then was in armes) had by force taken from the <hi>Liuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> a certayne Castle situated in the Iland <hi>Osila,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sonenborch,</hi> he by good fortune, was lodged with a certayne noble Astronomer,<note place="margin">Of the golden number.</note> with whom by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their studies he was very familiar. Being in talke one day, he brake out into these words, and said, O miserable, and hotrible dayes, which from the yeare .1570. now at hand, shall ensue, and continue many yeares. His guest asked him how so? He aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweared: Because, when the number of the yeares of Christes Natiuitie dooth containe within it, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15674:52"/>
yeares the Golden number of euery yeare, which is seldome seene, then it hath of long tyme been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, and histories doo witnes the same, that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite calamities, and intolerable troubles haue chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. But now from the 70. yeare now at hand, vntill the yeare .77. there shalbe among the yeares of the birth, of Christ, and between the golden number of euery yeare such an agreement: as .1.5.7. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ioyned togeather by addition, do make .13. Now this number .13. is the Golden number of the yeare 1570. &amp; in the six other immediatly ensuing. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did affirme that in that yeare the watrie Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should gouerne, and should presage great ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of water. But in the yeare 73. which is the middle of these seuen, the Earthy Element, for some notable cause, should lose of his vertue, by reason whereof, a wonderful scarsetie of all things should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, as afterward it came to passe. Moreouer, he said, that in .76. yeare, the aire should be corrupt, and the plague should be in euery place. After which should succeede three yeares, the first of which .1577. dooth by the fore sayd reason comprehend in it twentie in number, and if from this number .19. which is the chiefest golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> number, and the golden number to the yeare going befor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, were taken away, then one, which is the beginning of the number, and the golden num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thys yeare dooth remayne, and so in the other two following, and no further. And therefore in the yeare .77. the firie Element shall trie his force, and breede discention and warres, and agayne in the yeare .78. a greeuous pestilence shall dispatch verye many. And in the yeare .79. agayne shall come great scarsetie of all fruit. Finally he sayd, because .19. is the highest golden number, it shalbe found that that number from the .70. yeare (when this first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
<pb facs="tcp:15674:53"/>
began (counting .19. shall as it were by a finger, poynt vnto the .88. yeare. For from the .70. yeare to the .88. so many yeares come betweene: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which tyme (according to the opinions almost of all Mathematicions) verie dyreful, and miserable things shalbe come to passe. Because by good expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, he boldly sayd, that the Lord God maker and keeper of all order, did orderly by a certain number, measure, and aspect of the starres, rule and gouern the whole Firmament of heauen.</p>
               <p>And therefore, because of these things which haue ben spoken we do wel ynough, and sufficiently know, that the kingdome of God is at hand: let vs lyft vp our heades to heauen, let vs contemne all worldly things: let euery man cast away securitie and desire of pleasure, by whose inticementes, the mind is suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: let euery man frame himselfe to learne what is good, and godlines: let hym prepare himselfe to the Crosse, let hym profit in good woorking, in true cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vppyn the name of the Lord, and put on the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of righteousnes, that if the aduersarie challenge vs into combate, we may by no flaterie, by no force, by no terrour, by no tormentes be drawen and pluckt away from Christ. The almightie God be present with vs continually with his diuine asistance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende vs euermore agaynst all the inuasions of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell by which he would bring vs from our faith, driue vs out of hope, and so bar vs from our kingdome which is in heauen.</p>

               <p>Now I hope these testimonies alledged, may suffice to proue vnto vs, the manner of the commyng of the Sonne of God, and of the worldes ouerthrow. For it is not for man to speake more of the same, then he
<pb facs="tcp:15674:56"/>
hath learned out of holy Scripture. Yet somewhat longer wyll we tarry in the greatnesse of an happy life, and paynes of the vngodly: and yet no further wyll we goe, then the holy Scripture dooth leade vs to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Certayne it is, and without all controuersie, that nothing can be imagined of greater happinesse, and better estate, than is God the chiefest good: and that that felicitie which is in God, is as great and insearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as is his omnipotencie, by which he created both heauen and earth of nothing, by his woorde alone. And therfore it foloweth, that those which are of one mynde in Iesu Christe with God, be also partakers of those goodes which are in God, be also as beloued children in Christ, and heyres of all their fathers ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which are infinite and incomprehensible. And therfore <hi>Paul</hi> saith out of <hi>Esay:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. Esay. 64.</note> 
                  <hi>That the eye hath not seene, nor the eare heard, nor hath it entred into the hart of man, what God hath prepared for such as loue hym.</hi> But those celestiall and inuisible are not so apparant, and shine before our eyes, as do earthly and visible thyngs, to which we are too too greatly addicted, and therfore the holy Ghost by <hi>Iohn</hi> in his <hi>Reuelation,</hi> helping the weaknesse of our iudgement, dooth liken the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God to a certaine great and large citie, which he dooth call the holy <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apo. 21.</note> whose gates are of precious stones, and whose walles and streates are of pure golde, then the which nothing is more excellent in the sight of men. And he dooth also call that citie, (of the which all the elect shalbe perpetuall citizens) <hi>Tabernaculum Dei cum hominibus, &amp; habitabit cum eis, &amp; ipsipopuli eius erunt, &amp; ipse Deus cum eis erit: The Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of God with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shalbe his people, and he shalbe their God.</hi> Finally, that there is the fulnesse of all felicitie, where God is all in all, in which place we shall know hym perfectly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15674:56"/>
euen as he is. And therfore true is that voyce, which <hi>Iohn</hi> in his <hi>Reuelation</hi> heard from heauen: <hi>Beati mortui qui in Domino moriuntur: Blessed are the dead which dye in the Lord:</hi> or those are blessed, which the Lord at his commyng shall finde vigilant, wise, and sober.</p>
               <p>Now, if nothing be more happy (as in deede no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to inioye the sight of the euer liuing God, and to be inheritours of eternall lyfe: certainly by a contrary, nothing can be imagined more wretched and miserable, then with Diuels to be cast for euer out of the sight of God, into eternall torments and paines of hell, at whose very remembraunce, the Diuell hym selfe in an horrible rage dooth quake and tremble. For sith God is altogeather infinite, and his iustice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible, and sinnes be cleane contrary to his vnspeakeable iustice, it must needes folow, that they also must be punished with eternall paynes. And that this is true, our heauenly father sheweth most plainly in his only begotten sonne, which for our sake he sent into the flesh, that he might take vpon hym the forme of a seruaunt, and suffer death for our offences. For the iustice of God, for our sinnes in our flesh, dyd exact sufficient satisfaction, and his diuine pitie an infinite mercy towards all the elect. And therfore the Sonne of God, of one substance with his eternall father, and clearenesse of his glory, was almost compelled to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect hym selfe vnder hym, that so he might pacifie Gods anger, and publish his vnspeakable mercye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards al mankynd: especially towards al them which would with a liuely faith take hold, and imbrace hym. Now that the mynd of man might conceiue the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Gods displeasure, agaynst our sinnes, the holy Scripture fetchyng similitudes from sensible things, dooth liuely set the same before our eyes, that so if our fleshly and flexible harts geue any credit to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
<pb facs="tcp:15674:57"/>
woord of God, and be not hardened like stones, we might conceyue the greatnes of the same. For Christ dooth compare that eternall casting out of his fauour,<note place="margin">Math. 25. Lucae. 13. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>O that blyndnes of mans mynde, and that madde doubting of these diuine promises of eternall lyfe: O that hardned and flintie hart of ours, which is not mooued, no not wyth these horrible threates of Gods heauie displeasure, but continuing securely in all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, neuer asketh pardon for such wilfull offending, and amendeth: euen as though the scripture were but lyes, and these diuine Oracles &amp; prophane fables. For by those things which haue come to passe, and by true demonstrations of Gods holy spirit, it is apparant, that nothing is more certaine than that the end of all

things ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our shoulders. Truly great is the force of sinne, and marueilous is the rage of Satan in these latter dayes, he endeuoureth by all meanes that possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he can to bring the whole world into a desperate securitie of life, that so he may haue many partakers of his tormentes in hell, from which there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. But how much better had it been, we had eyther neuer been borne, or at the least been voyde of reason with beastes and serpentes, or els been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactht as soone as we were borne, if either we enioy not that place, for which we were created, or come not to the celestyall Paradyse, and to the marryage of our Spouse our Lord and sauiour Iesu Christ, where shalbe the ful abundance of all delightes, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all pleasure.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let vs cast from vs, both our carelesse securitie, and mistrust of the promises of God,<note place="margin">An exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes.</note> let vs renounce the diuell, and all the woorkes of the flesh, which are not sufferable by the word of God, &amp; let vs liste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the friendly admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Sauiour Christ,<note place="margin">Lucae. 21.</note> warning vs in these wordes. <hi>Take heed, least at any tyme your mindes be ouerladen with surfetting, and dronkennes, and cares of this life, and so the suddayne day of the Lord take you vnawares: for euen as a snare, it shall come vppon all which sit vppon the face of the earth.

                  <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ye knowe not the houre in which your Lorde wyll come) praying, that ye may escape all these things which are to come, and may stand before the Sonne of man.</hi> For if the comming of theeues and stealers of our earthly goods be to be feared, with how great care, with how great diligence and watchfulnes, should we seeke to escape those enemies which would spoyle vs of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall riches, and kingdome of heauen. Here we vse great heede and wisedome to preserue our mortall
<pb facs="tcp:15674:58"/>
bodyes from hurt and daunger: but to saue our soules which are immortal from eternal paynes in hel, we are altogeather carelesse, nothing circumspect. And yet more would it beseeme the children of lyght, to be more carefull in seeking and keeping those things which are celestiall, than are wordlings paynfull in enriching themselues with such things as they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sure to enioy while they are aliue: nor can assure them of any ioy when they are dead. Yea let vs thinke and perswade our selues, that in the sight of God it is not shamefull, but abhominable, that the elect or chosen people of God which should be wise and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect, shall in this care be surpassed of wicked worldlings, and the more hyghly we displease our god, by how much the things which we so litle esteem, are more excellent than that which they so hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, betweene which (so surpassing is the treasure prepared for the godly) that there is no comparison. This exhortation though it pertayne to all men at all tymes, yet now especially in these daungerous dayes, in which, euery where we see so many by suddayne and strange endes to be taken out of this world. and because euery man shall dy (though the certayne houre and daye none dooth knowe) and shall either woofully be sent among the diuels in hell, or ioyfully be receyued into the felowship of the faythfull in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>Wherefore sith the spirit in the faythfull is willing, but the flesh very weake, and blinde in heauenly things, we are to beseech our heauenly father in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall prayers, that by his holy spirit he would dayly more and more encrease, and strengthen our weake and feeble fayth. And therefore we hartely desire thee O eternall father, that thou wilt not vtterly breake vs, though we bowe not as we should, neither deale with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15674:58"/>
iustice, though we doo not our duties, according to thy wyll: but keepe vs good God in thy welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued sonne, illuminate our myndes with thy holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by which we may be prepared to all good workes, in true holines, &amp; newnes of life: that so with <hi>Paule</hi> we may desire to leaue this world &amp; to be with Christ, and so in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Lord, being found ready with oyle in our Lamps, and adorned with our wedding garmentes, we may find entrance to the Lordes mariage, which thou for thy son, &amp; his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued spouse the holy church hast prepared, and appointed, from the beginning of the world.
