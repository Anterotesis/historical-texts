            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to the number of two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

(being ſituated ouer the Gate-houſe

is a leading paſſage by a doore cloſe to
the vtter gate of the ſaid houſe, but

paſſage many men and women vſed to

Prieſts chambers there.</p>
            <p>There is alſo out of the ſaid Lord
Ambaſſadors with-drawing Chamber,
another paſſage meeting with this, and
both leading into the ſaid Garret. Which
Garret was within the ſide walls, about
ſeuenteene foot wide, and fortie foot
long: at the vpper end whereof was a
new partition of ſlit Deale, ſet vp to
make a priuate roome for one of the

and a ſmall table before it. In this place
the Auditorie being aſſembled, and
ſome of the better ſort hauing chaires
and ſtooles to ſit on, the many ſtanding
in throng, and filling the roome to the
doore and ſtaires, all expecting the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
hee came forth out of an inner

girt about his waſte with a linnen girdle,
and a Stole of Scarlet colour hanging
downe before him from both his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

ten thouſand Talents. And hauing not
whence to repay it, his Lord commanded
that he ſhould bee ſold, and his wife and

the Lord of that ſeruant moued with pitie,

And when that ſeruant was gone forth, he

they came, and told their Lord all that was
done. Then his Lord called him: and hee
<pb facs="tcp:3302:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaid vnto him, Thou vngracious ſeruant,
I forgaue thee all the debt becauſe thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoughteſt
me: oughteſt not thou therefore
alſo to haue mercy vpon thy fellow-ſeruant,
euen as I had mercy vpon thee? And his
Lord being angry, deliuered him to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters,
vntill he repayed all the debt. So
alſo ſhall my heauenly Father doe to you,
if you forgiue not euery one his brother
from your hearts.</p>
            <p>Which when he had read, hee ſat
downe in the chaire, and put vpon his
head a red quilt cap, hauing a linnen
white one vnder it turned vp about the
brimmes: and ſo vndertooke his Text;
firſt ſhewing in plaine and familiar ſtile
the occaſion of our Sauiours deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this parable, then diſtributing the
whole into parts, as they depended
one on the other; out of which he choſe
three principall points of doctrine,
which he propounded to inſiſt vpon
in that Sermon, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 The debt which man oweth to
<pb facs="tcp:3302:8"/>
God: and the accompt which he is to
make vnto him of that debt.</p>
            <p>2 Gods mercy in remitting this great
debt.</p>
            <p>3 Mans hardneſſe of heart, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe,
both towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his brethren: together with the
remedies, which man may vſe for the
procuring of Gods mercy, and curing
himſelfe from this contagious diſeaſe
of ingratitude.</p>
            <p>Mans debt he amplified in regard of
our creation, and redemption, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
and temporall benefits, which
we enioy in this world, and in Gods
Church, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Vpon the following parts hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
with much vehemency, inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
eſpecially vpon thoſe words, <hi>I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue
thee all thy debt, ſhouldeſt not thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
haue had compaſsion on thy fellow, euen
as I had pitie on thee?</hi> And thence extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the infinite mercy and goodneſſe
of God, whereby he doth not only giue
<pb facs="tcp:3302:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs all that we haue, but forgiues vs all
our treſpaſſes and offences, be they net
uer ſo deepely ſtained with the ſcarle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
dye and tincture of our guiltineſſe
Which mercifull bounty of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father is here parabolized vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs by <hi>a certaine man that was a
king, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two or three of that auditory auow
with ioynt teſtimony, that, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of the latter part, which he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
he earneſtly laid open the terrors
and burthen of the heauy debt of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
which we are to pay at the
laſt iudgement, if the debt of ſinne be
not acquitted before. Declaring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
the mercy of God in prouiding
meanes to cancell this debt, by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
ordained in the Catholique
Church, in ſpeciall by the Sacrament
of Penance; and therein by Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Confeſſion, and Satisfaction. And
thence inferring in what miſerable caſe
<pb facs="tcp:3302:9"/>
Heretiques are, who want all ſuch
meanes to come out of this debt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are not members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church.</p>
            <p>But whatſoeuer the matter, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his laſt ſpeech was, I doe not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
enquire, as making interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods iudgement in ſtopping the
currant of his ſpeech at that inſtant.
Leſt in ouer forward cenſuring the ſame,
we ſhould be deemed as vncharitable,
as our Aduerſaries, eſpecially the Ieſuits,
are againſt thoſe Churches and perſons
that admit not the Papacy.</p>
            <p>Moſt certaine it is, and ouer manifeſt
by lamentable euidence, that, when the
ſaid Ieſuite had proceeded about halfe
an houre in this his Sermon, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell
that Preacher and Auditorie the
moſt vnexpected and ſuddaine calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that this age hath heard of to come
from the hand, not of Man, but God, in
the middeſt of a ſacred exerciſe, of what
<pb facs="tcp:3302:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
kinde or religion ſoeuer. The floare,
whereon that aſſembly ſtood or ſate,
not ſinking by degrees, but at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
failing and falling, by the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
aſunder of a maine Sommier or
Dormer of that floare; which beame,
together with the Ioyces and Plancher
thereto adioyned, with the people there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ruſhed downe with ſuch violence,
that the weight and fall thereof, brake
in ſunder another farre ſtronger and
thicker Sommier of the Chamber ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
directly vnderneath: and ſo both
the ruined floares, with the people ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapped
and cruſhed vnder, or betweene
them, fell, (without any time of ſtay)
vpon a lower third floare, being the
floare of the ſaid Lord Ambaſſadors
withdrawing Chamber; which was
ſupported vnderneath with Arch-work
of ſtone, (yet viſible in the Gate-houſe
there) and ſo became the bundarie or
terme of that confuſed and dolefull
<pb facs="tcp:3302:10"/>
heape of ruines, which otherwiſe had
ſunke yet deeper by the owne weight
and height of the downfall: the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the higheſt floare, whence
the people fell, to the loweſt, where
they lay, being about two and twentie
foot in depth.</p>
            <p>Of the Gallery floare only ſo much fell,
as was directly ouer a Chamber of 20.
foot ſquare, called <hi>Father Redyates</hi>
Chamber, and being the vſual Maſſing
roome for the Engliſh reſorting thither.
The reſt of the Gallery floare, being
not ſo full thronged, ſtood firme, and
ſo was a refuge and ſafeguard to
thoſe of the Auditorie that had planted
themſelues at that end. From whence
they beheld that moſt Tragicall Scene
of their brethrens ruine; themſelues
alſo being not onely ſurprized with the
ſtupifying paſſions of affright, and
apprehenſion of that danger, which as
yet they could not think themſelues to
<pb facs="tcp:3302:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue eſcaped, but alſo, for the time, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
in the place it ſelfe; from
whence there was no paſſage by doore,
or otherwiſe, vnleſſe they ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
to leape downe into the gulfe
of their fellowes wofull eſtate. In this
perplexity, diſmay it ſelfe not bereauing
them of counſaile, but rather admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
ſtrength to their trembling
hands, they with their Kniues opened
the Loame-wall next vnto them, and ſo
making their paſſage thence into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Chamber, eſcaped that danger.</p>
            <p>As for the reſt (being the farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of this Aſſembly) who in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

floare, their caſe, as it can ſcarce be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled
with a like example of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
ſo hardly be deſcribed with the due
and true circumſtances. Who can to
the life expreſſe the face of Death, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
it ſelfe in ſo ruefull and different
ſhapes?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3302:11"/>

               <l>Temperet à lachrymis?</l>
            </q>
            <p>What eare, without tingling, can
heare the dolefull and confuſed cries of
ſuch a troope, men, women, children,
all falling ſuddenly in the ſame pit, and
apprehending with one horror the
ſame ruine? What eie can behold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
inundation of teares, ſuch a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of men ouerwhelmed with brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of weighty timber, buried in rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh,
and ſmothered in the duſt? What
heart, without euaporating into ſighes,
can ponder the burthen of deepeſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
and lamentations of parents,
children, husbands, wiues, kinsmen,
friends, for their deareſt pledges, and
chiefeſt comforts in this world, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft
and ſwept away with one blaſt of
the ſame diſmall tempeſt?</p>
            <p>Such was the noiſe of this dreadfull
and vnexpected downefall, that the
whole city of London preſently rang
<pb facs="tcp:3302:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of it, and forthwith the Officers of the
city (to whom the care of good order
chiefly appertaineth) and in ſpeciall <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant
Finch</hi> the Recorder, repaired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſame euening, carefully proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for the ſafety of the ſaid Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
houſe and familie, and, for preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all diſorders in ſuch a confuſion,
that might ariſe by the confluence of
the multitude, ſhut vp the gates and
ſet guards vpon the paſſages. With all
ſpeed poſſible ſome were imployed for
the releeuing and ſauing ſuch as yet
ſtruggled for life vnder this heauy load:
Which could not ſo ſoone be effected,
as they in charity deſired; for that the
ruines, which oppreſſed the ſufferers,
did alſo ſtop vp entrance to the helpers:
who thereupon were faine to make a
breach in through an vpper window of
ſtone. From hence they haſted downe
with pickaxes and other inſtruments,
to force aſunder, and take of, by peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale,
<pb facs="tcp:3302:12"/>
the oppreſſing load of beames,
ioyces, and bords. At the opening
whereof, what a <hi>Chaos?</hi> what fearefull
obiects? what lamentable repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
Here ſome bruiſed, ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
ſome onely parts of men:
there ſome wounded, and weltering in
their owne and others bloud, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
putting forth their fainting hands
and crying out for helpe. Here ſome
gaſping and panting for breath, others
ſtifled for want of breath. To the moſt
of them being thus couered with duſt,
this their death was a kinde of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Haue the gates of death beene opened

               <note place="margin">Iob. 38. 17.</note> 
               <hi>or haſt thou ſeene the doares
of the ſhadow of death?</hi> Verily if any
man could looke in at thoſe gates, and
returne, he would report ſuch a pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait
as was this ſpectacle.</p>
            <p>In this dolefull taske of withdrawing
thoſe impediments, laying forth the
<pb facs="tcp:3302:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dead bodies, and tranſporting the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
all that night, and part of the next
day was ſpent, though charitie and skill
did whet their endeuours with all dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie
and expedition.</p>
            <p>The next morning, according to the
Lawes of our Land, which prouide that
the Kings Maieſtie ſhould haue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his Subiects dying <hi>Per infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi>
the <hi>Coroners</hi> Inqueſt was there
impanelled vpon the dead corpſes, that
after their view of them, they might
be buried with conuenient ſpeed.</p>
            <p>By the ſaid <hi>Coroner,</hi> and <hi>Iury,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
care was taken to ſuruey the place,
and materialls of the ruines with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
for the finding out the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
cauſe and manner thereof: the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for that it was giuen out by ſome
preſently vpon the miſchance, that ſome
Proteſtants, knowing this to be a chiefe
place of their meetings, had ſecretly
drawne out the pins, or ſawed halfe a
<pb facs="tcp:3302:13"/>
ſunder ſome of the ſupporting Timber
of that building. Which was found to
be a calumny no leſſe ridiculous, then
malitious.</p>
            <p>The moſt probable apparant cauſe of
the ſuddaine failing of that floare, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with ſuch a weight of people, was
iudged to bee in the maine Sommier
thereof, which being not aboue ten
inches ſquare, had in the very place,
where it brake, on each ſide a mortaiſe
hole directly oppoſite the one againſt
the other, into which were let the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of two great pieces of Timber,
called Girders: ſo that betweene thoſe
Mortaiſes, there was left not aboue
three inches of Timber. This Sommier
was alſo ſomewhat knottie about that
place, which, in the opinion of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects,
might make it more brittle, and
readie to knap in ſunder. The maine
Sommier of the lower roome, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thirteene inches ſquare, without
<pb facs="tcp:3302:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any ſuch Mortaiſe; and brake, not (as
the former) in the middeſt, but within
fiue foot of one end, and more oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſhiuering then the other. No
foundation, nor wall failed. The roofe
of the Gallery with the ſeeling vpon it
remaine yet intire; as alſo a ſmall filling
wall, faſtned to the rafters, which yet
hangeth where the floare is gone.</p>
            <p>This downefall was not to al deadly:
to ſome only frightfull, or in part hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
who being thus taken vp out of the
pit of horrible danger, nay plucked
out of the very iawes of Death, as alſo
thoſe other of this Aſſembly, who (as
before ſaid) fell not at all, but yet ſtood
in the verie brinke of this mortall ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardie,
haue all great cauſe neuer to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
this day, but to enter it into their
Kalender for a mercifull and miraculous
deliuerance. Neither is it enough for
them to lift vp their hearts in thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing
to God (as I make no doubt they
<pb facs="tcp:3302:14"/>
doe) for this vnexpected reſcue from
ſo great an vnſuſpected death, but they
are alſo to lay it to their hearts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this ſudden ſtroake and cracke be
not the hand, and voice of God, to
call them home from wandring after
forraine Teachers, that lead the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
people captiue and carry them
hood-winked into the ſnares of danger,
corporall, ciuill, and ſpirituall: that
hereupon they may ſeriouſly conſider
what ground they haue to forbeare, or
forſake our Church-aſſemblies, and to
refraine from hearing ſo much as our
diuine ſeruice, againſt which they haue
no other exception, but this, that in
hearing it they may heare, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
whereas in the Romiſh Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
euen in the <hi>Euen-ſong</hi> then inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in this conuenticle, <hi>audientes audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
&amp; non intelligerent, videntes vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
&amp; non cernerent.</hi> The women, and
common people might vnderſtand as
<pb facs="tcp:3302:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much as they doe this ſentence in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
taken out of the Prophet <hi>Iſay,</hi> too
truly prophecying of ſuch.</p>
            <p>Of thoſe that fell, and eſcaped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any notable hurt, I heare of by
name ſome perſons of note, as Miſtris
<hi>Lucie Penruddock</hi> of a worthy family,
who fell betweene two that then peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
the Lady <hi>Webb</hi> and her owne maid
ſeruant, yet was herſelfe preſerued aliue
by the happy ſituation of a chaire,
which falling with her, reſted hollow
ouer her, and ſo became to hir a ſhelter,
or penthouſe to beare off other ruines:
alſo the Lady <hi>Webbs</hi> daughter, though
falling neere vnto hir mother, and <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
Saunders,</hi> who was couered with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that fell vpon hir, yet by Gods
mercy, recouered out of thoſe bloudy
ruines.</p>
            <p>There was alſo a Scholler, (whom
my ſelfe ſince ſaw and had ſpeech with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all)
who was the eaſier drawne to that
<pb facs="tcp:3302:15"/>
Aſſembly, becauſe he formerly was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
and warping to that ſide, as hath
appeared by publike euidence. He was
alſo inuolued in this common downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall,
whereout he eſcaped beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation:
being one of the vndermoſt
in that heape, and lying vpon the very
floare, and ouerwhelmed with the
boards and timber, which lay vpon
him, yet not ſo flat, and ſad, as vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but ſomewhat hollow and ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
by the leaning of ſome of the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
againſt the wall. Out of this den of
death he, with maine ſtrength &amp; much
difficulty, wrought himſelfe, by tearing
the laths of the ſeeling, and creeping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two ioyces, from vnder the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to an hole where he eſpied light: &amp;
then one of the Ambaſ. family opening a
doore releeued him being yet ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
that he ſcarce was apprehenſiue
of the courteſie done to him. Who
thus refreſhed, preſently returned and
<pb facs="tcp:3302:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vſed his beſt ſtrength to draw others
out of that ſnare, which he himſelfe had
newly broken, without any other detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than of his clothes; of which faire
eſcape I hope, he will make good vſe, &amp;
often call to minde our Sauiours caueat,
(which ſince in my hearing hath beene
rung in his eares) <hi>Vade &amp; ne pecca am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plius,
ne deterius conting at tibi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was alſo (as he reporteth) a
young girle of the age of ten yeeres, or
thereabout, who then crying ſaid vnto
him, O my Mother, O my ſiſter, which
are downe vnder the timber and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh.
But hee wiſhing her to be patient,
and telling her that by Gods grace they
ſhould get forth quickly, the child repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that this would proue a great ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall
to their Religion. A ſtrange ſpeech
proceeding from a childe of ſo tender
yeeres, who, euen in that perplexity, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to haue a deeper apprehenſion of
publique ſcandall, then of priuate loſſe.
<pb facs="tcp:3302:16"/>
               <hi>A leſſon fit for farre elder to learne,</hi> ex
ore infantium, &amp; lactentium, &amp;c. Out of
the mouth of babes and ſucklings thou haſt
ordained ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, one of the men that fell,
then ſaying, O what aduantage will
our aduerſaries take at this; another of
them replied thereto, If it be Gods will
this ſhould befall vs, what can wee
ſay to it? A pious anſwer, and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
reſolution, borrowed, as it ſeemes,
from the patience of the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
Tacui, Domine, quia tu feciſti. I held
my peace, becauſe thou, Lord, hast done it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An hard taske it were to vndertake
the giuing a particular account of the
number and quality of thoſe that any
waies ſuffered in this fall, the diuerſity
of reports, according to mens priuate
inclinations, enlarging or contracting
the ſame. In generall moſt euident it is
that of the people that fell, thoſe that
eſcaped beſt for bodily hurt, were, at

               </gap> howſoeuer deeply ſtricken in their
minds with affright and feare: others were
bruiſed or wounded, but not mortally,
receiuing only a gentle ſtripe from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
hand of a chaſtizing father; others
for the preſent came forth, or rather were
carried out, with life, but enioyed it for a

homes within a few daies, yea ſome
not many houres, as by after-enformation
to the Coroners Iury, yet depending, may
appeare. But the greater number of thoſe
that fell neuer roſe againe, nor ſhall, till the
Elements ſhall melt with heat, and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of a farre greater fabrique than that
houſe, (euen of the whole earth with the
workes thereof) ſhall awake them, and vs
all, out of the bed of death, to giue account
of what we haue done in the body.</p>
            <p>Of theſe, whom it pleaſed God thus to
call out of this world, the number is moſt
currently eſtimated to be betweene 90. and
100. If any man, out of affection to them,
or curioſity, enquire more exactly, of the
<pb facs="tcp:3302:17"/>
Ambaſſadours houſe, was digged a great
pit, (eighteene foot long, and twelue foot
broad) in which were laied foure and forty
corpſes in order, piled one vpon the other,
partners in the ſame bed, as a little before
they were in the ſame paſſage to it. Vpon this
common Graue, was ſet vp in the earth, a
blacke Croſſe of wood, about foure foot
high, which on Tueſday in the afternoone,
was by one of the Ambaſſadors ſeruants
taken vp and carried into the houſe, leſt (as
it ſeemeth) any ſcandall ſhould bee taken
thereat by the people, that then, and after,
came to that houſe to view the Stage of this
mournfull Tragedy.</p>
            <p>There was alſo another pit, (long twelue
foot, broad eight foot) made in the ſaid Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
Garden neere adioyning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3302:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
As for interpretation and applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

a Chriſtian and charitable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>Too well knowne it is to the world,
how hardly our aduerſaries conceiue,

and tumbling downe all of vs

pulpits thunder out, their printing
preſſes grone vnder, their pamphlets
and libells proclaime; all wee are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb facs="tcp:3302:18"/>
gone for Caſt-awaies, Miſcreants,
damned Heretiques; With vs no
Church, no Faith, no Religion, no
God.</p>
            <p>If ſuch a calamitie had befallen any
flocke of ours in our Common prayer,
or Sermons, all muſt haue gone quicke
to hell: there would haue beene more
inuectiue ſeuerall cenſures and bookes
againſt vs than were here perſons ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.
What exclamation of the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
of hereſie, of the paſſing away of
nouelties with a cracke, of receiuing a
terrible blow, of the very beames in the
wall crying out againſt vs, of the ruine
of old wormeaten hereſies, of the traſh
and rubbiſh of the new Goſpell demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.
In ſuch ſort vpon leſſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are wee and our profeſſion tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and ſlandered publikely beyond
the ſeas, and priuately in corners at
home. Nor is it maruell that ſuch
flaſhes to ſcorch vs in our good names,
<pb facs="tcp:3302:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are caſt forth out of that fiery <hi>Aetna</hi> of
Romiſh zeale, which hath ſent forth
materiall flames to conſume many of
our liuing bodies, and ſome alſo of
our dead. <hi>Hic liuor nec poſt fata qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcit.</hi>
And though this fire hath beene
couered with aſhes in theſe parts, for
many happy yeares, yet of late a ſparke
thereof brake forth, euen in the middeſt
of the bonfires kindled in London at
the happy returne of our Prince; when
as a certaine Roman Zelote,<note place="margin">This party was one of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a marke of reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance there, by a peece of wood, who thus a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before took care for ſauing wood.</note> repining
at the exceſſiue expenſe of fuell therein,
ſaid openly in the hearing of many that
if ſuch waſte of wood were made, there
would ſhortly be neuer a fagot left to
burne heretiques.</p>
            <p>But we haue otherwiſe learned
Chriſt, who <hi>being reuiled, did not reuile
againe, but committed his cauſe to him that
iudgeth righteouſly; Et preces effudit pro
ijs etiam, qui ſanguinem eius effuderu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t;</hi> and
powred out prayers for thoſe, that ſhed
<pb facs="tcp:3302:19"/>
and powred forth his bloud, (as ſaith
an ancient Father.) From him we learne
not to inſult ouer our enemies, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
at their ruine, but to weepe at
their calamitie: not to enter into Gods
ſecrets, but to tremble at his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>And therefore our dutie, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their perſons, is firſt to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and carefull how ſo much as in our
inward thoughts we paſſe any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
iudgement vpon them. For though
the euent it ſelfe may ſeeme to offer a
topicall inference from the fall of both
the floores; namely, of the preaching
and the Maſſing roome, that both
their Doctrine and Sacrifice are weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſlenderly ſupported, and that
God was diſpleaſed as well with their
Pulpits, as Altars; yet for the particular
eſtate of thoſe who were combined in
that action, and enueloped in the ſame
paſſion, it were moſt vncharitable and
<pb facs="tcp:3302:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
groundleſſe from their temporall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
in this time and place, to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
their eternall confuſion.</p>
            <p>And howſoeuer our Aduerſaries for
the truth of their Church draw an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
no leſſe vnnaturall than vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable,
from the ſuppoſed, ſudden,
and vnhappy ends, of ſome of thoſe
whom they call Heretiques, and to that
end forge hideous fables of the death
of <hi>Luther, Caluin,</hi> &amp;c. and in particular,
very lately ſome of them haue paſſed
an heauy cenſure vpon Doctor <hi>Sutton,</hi>
a learned and painefull Preacher, and
ſolid Refuter of their errors, whom to
the great loſſe of our Church,</p>
            <q>Abſtulit vnda vorax &amp; funere merſit
acerbo,</q>
            <p>Ouer whom they triumph, as if the
deepe therefore ſwallowed him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was vnworthy to tread vpon
the earth, or breathe in the ayre; Yet we
ought to be, and are farre from ſaying
<pb facs="tcp:3302:20"/>
that the Plancher of that building
would not beare theſe <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were more loaden with the
weight of ſinne, then others. Wee are
taught by the Chapter appointed in the
Kalender to bee read in our Churches
the very next morning after this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
accident, to iudge otherwiſe. <hi>Luke</hi>
13. <hi>There were preſent at that ſeaſon,
ſome that told him of the Galileans, whoſe
bloud Pilate had mingled with their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.
And Ieſus anſwered, and ſaid vnto
them, Suppoſe yee that theſe Galileans
were greater ſinners then all the other Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileans,
becauſe they haue ſuffered ſuch
things? I tell you nay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, wee are to condole for
them, and that in three reſpects. Firſt,
out of naturall humanitie, as they are
men, of the ſame mould with vs, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
all to the ſame paſſions, and liable
<pb facs="tcp:3302:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the ſame outward calamities, and
dangers of this mortall life. In this
conſideration euery of vs is to ſay to
himſelfe, of himſelfe and others.</p>
            <q>Homo ſum, humani nihil à me alienum
puto.</q>
            <p>Secondly, out of morall ciuilitie, as
fellow-borne Country-men, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Subiects vnto the ſame moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
King, in whoſe eies the death of his
meaneſt Subiects is precious. In this
reſpect euery of vs, either preſently
viewing that Tragicall ſpectacle of ſo
many bruiſed and battered carkaſes, ſo
many ſmothered corpſes, which yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
breathed the ſame Engliſh aire with
vs: Or ſhortly after hearing of ſo wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
an Hiſtorie, is, with teares in the
eye, and melting griefe in the heart, to
deplore at leaſt with ſome ſuch Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph,
<pb facs="tcp:3302:21"/>
or funerall Elegie, as was vſed by
a <hi>Lacedemonian.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</q>
            <p>Thirdly and principally, out of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
charitie, as towards thoſe who
profeſſe the name of Chriſt, and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his worſhip, howſoeuer tainted
with many errors and ſuperſtitions, of
which their Leaders and Guides are
more guilty than the ſimple obedient
flocke miſled by them. In this duty
we are euery of vs to grieue for thoſe
that are gone, and to commiſerate
with the holy Apoſtle, the preſent
eſtate of ſuch other as remaine cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuated
in the ſame blindneſſe of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
<hi>Rom. 9. &amp; 10. I have great
heauineſſe, and continuall ſorrow in my
heart, for my Brethren, my Kinſmen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the fleſh. Brethren, my hearts
deſire and praier to God for Iſrael, is
that they might bee ſaued. For I beare
them record, that they haue a zeale of
<pb facs="tcp:3302:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God, but not according to knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This for our conſtruction hereof, as
we looke downe vpon others in their
fall. Now for our inſtruction as this
example reflecteth vpward vpon our
ſelues. Wherein firſt our ingratitude is
checked, and thankefulneſſe awaked
which we owe vnto God for our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
preſeruations, as in other kindes
perpetually, ſo not ſeldome in this.
Surely if our heauenly Father ſhould
ceaſe his care of preſeruing vs, as we
too oft giue ouer our due care of ſeruing
him, nor field, nor houſe, nor Church
it ſelfe ſhould be ſafe vnto vs: carnall
ſecurity and forgetfulneſſe of God cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
into not only our chambers, halls,
and receptacles of mirth and iollity, but
too oft euen into the houſe of God it
ſelfe: the Temple of our ſpirituall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
being not ſo reuerently frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as our duty and profeſſion require.
And yet, howſoeuer wee may obſerue
<pb facs="tcp:3302:22"/>
Gods hand ſometimes to haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
diuers of our brethren by down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
vpon the earth, or into the water,
and of late by the fearefull dint of fire
darted from heauen with thunder, and
other humane caſualties, at home or
abroad, yet haue our ſacred aſſemblies
(for ought I can remember) beene
free from mortality by ruine. And
whereas we haue many examples of
the decay and ſudden lapſe of diuers
our materiall Temples made with
hands, yet hath God ſo diſpoſed of the
time or manner of ſuch ruines, that
none of the liuing Temples of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt haue beene demoliſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
Witneſſe in London the Churches
of <hi>Lothbury,</hi> of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Butolfs,</hi> of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Giles</hi>
in the fields, and the Church it ſelfe of
the <hi>Black-Friers:</hi> in all which the ſtones
forbare their downeward motion, till
the peoples abſence. And moſt lately
in the Towne of <hi>Neteſherd</hi> in <hi>Norffolk,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3302:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the beames of the Church roofe being
by the fall of the ſteeple beaten downe
among the people in time of Prayer, yet
not one periſhed thereby. To theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
many reading and pondering this,
can adde other examples of the like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations
in other places of this land.
The memory whereof muſt reuiue our
hearty thanks to God, with praier for
our future protection, eſpecially in
the houſes of praier, wherein he is
worſhipped in ſpirit and truth by vs,
and his word preached ſoundly and
faithfully vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, foraſmuch as ſome few of
this Aſſembly were not in opinion
<hi>Romaniſts,</hi> nor came thither out of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the Popiſh partie, but rather
out of curioſitie, to obſerue their rites
and manner of Preaching, eſpecially
vpon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame giuen out, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of then and there hearing a rare
man, an admirable Ieſuite, a Preacher
<pb facs="tcp:3302:23"/>
               <hi>Nonpareil,</hi> in compariſon of whom the
greateſt Lights of the Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
are but Glowormes; this may be
a ſpeciall <hi>Caueat</hi> to ſuch roauing wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
as only taſted of that Cup where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
others dranke the Dregs: they were
ſome of them iuſtly ſtricken in body,
though not mortally, but all in minde,
with terror, amazement, and horrible
conſternation. And one, as is ſaid, felt the
vtmoſt of that ſtroke, and for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tooke part with thoſe in death, with
whom he conſented not in life and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
<hi>Plinie</hi> the elder (as his Nephew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of him) paid deare for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of his curioſitie, when, not
content with Contemplation, and
Relation from others, hee would
needes in perſon approach neere, to
behold with his eies the very flames
of the burning hill <hi>Veſuuius</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
the ſulphureous ſmoake and vapour
whereof, preſently ſtifled him. To
<pb facs="tcp:3302:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
come neerer to our ſelues, thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
eſcaped not much better, who
(as both <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue)
when they were preſent at the
Theaters and ſhewes, inſtituted to the
honour of the Heathen gods, were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
ſurpriſed and vexed by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
who was nimble enough to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his claime to them, by pleading
<hi>Inueni in meo,</hi> I tooke them as I found
them, vpon mine owne ground. What
though the Romaniſts preſume farre
without warrant, and dare out-face
our Lawes, which wholeſomly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
againſt ſuch conuenticles, yet let
euery obedient ſubiect and childe of
our Church, beware how he put his
foot into ſuch ſnares: reſoluing rather
with the holy Patriarch, and ſaying in
his heart, <hi>O my ſoule, enter not thou into
their ſecret:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 6</note> 
               <hi>vnto their aſſembly mine
honour be not thou yoaked.</hi> In ſuch caſes
the Prophets haue vſed and enforced
<pb facs="tcp:3302:24"/>
from exorbitant examples argument,
not of imitation, but auerſation, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
<hi>Though Iſrael tranſgreſſe, yet
let not Iuda ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, for vs all, theſe dead corpſes
ought to bee a liuely mirror, wherein
we are to behold what we may expect
in that kinde, or ſome other, euen farre
worſe, if we doe not preuent and auert
Gods iudgements by iudging our ſelues,
and vnfeinedly repenting of our ſinfull
courſes. Out of ſuch examples our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
readeth vs a double Lecture, not
onely of charitie, in not cenſuring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but alſo of repentance, in cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and condemning our ſelues, that
we be not condemned of the Lord. <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
yee repent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 13. 4.</note> 
               <hi>yee ſhall all likewiſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi>
A vaine plea it will be, That wee
haue caſt out of our Churches Romiſh
ſuperſtitions, if wee ſtill reteine in our
ſoules and bodies our predominant
corruptions; that our faith &amp; doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:3302:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is moſt pure, if our liues remaine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure;
that we haue faire leaues &amp; bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes
in our outward profeſſion, if we
bring forth no fruit in our practiſe and
conuerſation. <hi>Reatus impij pium nomen,</hi>
ſaith the moſt religious Biſhop <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian.</hi>
An holy Title and profeſſion,
if the life bee not ſutable, is, not a plea,
but a guilt, not a diminution of offence,
but an improuement. Well ſaid <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
of himſelfe that, whereto euery of
vs is to ſubſcribe his owne name, <hi>Ego
omnium notatoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peccator, nulli rei, niſi poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiae,
natus. A ſinner I am, marked with
ſpots of all kinds, &amp; born to no other end, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to make my life a taske of repentance.</hi> We
are all by profeſſion bound apprentiſes
to this Chriſtian trade, nay borne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a kinde of intereſt and propriety to
it. Of all intelligent natures onely man
is capable of that. God cannot repent,
becauſe he cannot ſinne, nor erre: an
Angell, though mutable in his owne
<pb facs="tcp:3302:25"/>
nature, (and ſo liable to ſinne) yet once
falling by ſinne, can neuer riſe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
Onely man, falling, both in
the vniuerſall ruinous eſtate of all his
kinde, and daily in his actuall lapſes,
hath by the hand of Gods grace and
mercy in Chriſt, the cords of loue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
forth, and let downe into the pit
vnto him, whereof by repentance and
faith he taketh hold, thence to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to newneſſe of life, and ſo forward
to eternall life, through the merits and
paſſion of our bleſſed Redeemer, who
came, not to call the righteous, but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to repentance.</p>
