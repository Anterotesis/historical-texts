         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear and Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Send You this to expreſs my
hearty Wiſhes, That You may
enjoy a Happy Chriſtmaſs and
New-Year. And alſo to let You
know, That the kind Letter You
writ me long ſince (wherein You
deſire me to conſider the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church of <hi>Tyre,</hi> of
the Holy Sepulchre, and of the
Apoſtles at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
and deſcribed by <hi>Euſebius,</hi>
in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, &amp;c.)
came again lately to my Hands,
with ſome imperfect Eſſays of
<pb facs="tcp:102660:3"/>
Schemes, that I then drew of
thoſe Noble Structures. Theſe I
have now again review'd and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
and have added a ſhort
Diſcourſe to them, containing ſome
general Conſiderations on the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Churches, or Publick places
of God's Worſhip; as an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
to my Obſervations on
theſe Magnificent Structures.</p>
            <p>For the more clear Illuſtration
of all which, I have added a
<hi>Plane</hi> of the Ancient <hi>Greek
Church;</hi> according to my own
Obſervations of Several very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Structures, with an Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the uſe of Each part: And
then I may Conclude with an
Application, relating to our Own
Religious Aſſemblies; which may
be uſeful to thoſe who ſhall come
to Conſider of proper Mediums,
to Reconcile the Small Differences
that are between the Diſſenters
and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, concerning theſe Matters.
For by theſe things, it is moſt
manifeſt; That the Primitive
<pb facs="tcp:102660:3"/>
Chriſtians did endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Publick Worſhip of GOD,
with as great External Reverence
and Magnificence, as poſſible; joyned
to the Internal Truth, Fervency
of Spirit and Mind.</p>
            <p>I wiſh You could have ſeen theſe
Papers before I Publiſht them;
either to Alter, Correct, or Amend
what You may find Amiſs, or leſs
to the Purpoſe. For You are a
Perſon upon whoſe Judgment, I
ſhall ever Entirely Rely; knowing
the Great Candour, Perſpicuity,
Learning and Faithfulneſs of it.
But ſince I cannot eaſily have that
Satisfaction, I ſhall preſent You
with them as I may; as a Token
of the Great Reſpect and Value
I have for You, upon many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts;

            <head>CHAP. I. 
Concerning the Primitive
Churches, or Places of
God's Worſhip.</head>
            <head type="sub">The Introduction.</head>
            <p>TO give a juſt Account of
the Publick Places of
God's Worſhip in the
Chriſtian Church, it will be fit to
begin our Obſervations from the
Practice of the firſt Author and
Miniſters of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>For thô it be manifeſt, that
GOD is Omnipreſent, and the
Heaven of Heavens cannot contain
him; becauſe he contains both
them and the Infinite Abyſs of
Space; yet, that he appointed the
Separation and Conſecration of a
Peculiar Place, to place his Name
there; to be Worſhipped and
Glorified therein, by thoſe that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102660:5"/>
acknowledged his infinite Power
and Authority over them, is ſo
manifeſt, that it needs not to be
more than mentioned.</p>
            <p>That This in the time of their
Travel to their Promiſed Country,
and whilſt their unſettled State of
Warfare laſted, was like themſelves,
moveable and unfixt alſo.</p>
            <p>But ſo ſoon as They were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to a ſettled State, and to the
glory and happineſs of the higheſt
Pitch of Empire, They began im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to reſolve, to give all
poſſible Glory to GOD, by
eſtabliſhing the Place of His Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worſhip with the greateſt
Magnificence they were able.</p>
            <p>This <hi>David</hi> made the Subject
of his Zeal and Vows, and his Son
<hi>Solomon,</hi> whom he made ſole Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
to his Throne and Piety,
accompliſhed it.</p>
            <p>When again this moſt Glorious
Edifice ſuffered Deſtruction and
Deſolation in the Puniſhment of
the King and People for their Sins,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102660:5"/>
it was again Rebuilt by Propheſy,
and was honoured with the Glory
and Preſence of the Eternal High-Prieſt
himſelf.</p>
            <p>Who always performed his
Publick and Stated Devotions to
his Father and our Father, To his
God and our God, There.</p>
            <p>And when at laſt he had offered
up the only true and real Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory
Sacrifice of himſelf, and
was entred into the Real Holy of
Holies, with his own Blood, ever
to make Interceſſion for us; Thoſe
that he left to be his Succeſſors in
the Miniſtry of Holy things, did
not deſiſt from doing their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
there, ſo long as It and They
continued on Earth.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, it is obſervable,
That our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
never forſook the Synagogues,
but ever joyned in the External
Worſhip of God, Doctrine and
Diſcipline of their Country, and
as oft as occaſion offered, taught
the People there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:102660:6"/>
And when afterward (by God's
Appointment and the Perſecution
of their own Countrymen) they
were diſperſed into all Nations,
They ſtill Repaired to the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
and Oratories of the Jews,
and there firſt Preached the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And when they were no longer
ſuffered to continue their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
with them,<note place="margin">Act. 19. 9.</note> then only we
find that they ſeparated the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and taught them in another
Place.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is no doubt, but
in ſuch Caſes they ſtill made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for ſome other Places, as
thoſe Times and Conveniency
would permit.</p>
            <p>And that There they did their
Peculiar Devotions as Chriſtians,
to wit, the Celebration of the
Lord's Supper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For we read in the</hi> 2d <hi>of the</hi>
Acts, <hi>that</hi> they which believed
were Baptized, continued ſtedfaſtly
in the Apoſtles Doctrine, Fellowſhip,
Breaking Bread, and Prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:102660:6"/>
Thô they continued daily in
the Temple with one Accord, yet
they Brake Bread <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
at Home, or every one at his
Houſe; or <hi>Domatim</hi> in each others

with Portico's built Croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to each other, ſo as to encloſe
the Place in the form of a Square.
That is, This Square Court was

it; <hi>i. e.</hi> The Spaces between the
Pillars were encloſed with Wood,
of a proportionable height, wrought
in the form of a Net. That is,
a kind of Latice-work to look

Theſe I ſuppoſe were two Fonts

<hi>Pluribus

made the Entrances into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

I ſuppoſe this Cloyſter met up to
the Front of the Temple, which
was Adorn'd, Beautified and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
with ſeveral other Ranks
of Pillars between it and the Doors
of the Temple. As that of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta
Sophia</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is; and
indeed every conſiderable Church
among the Ancients had ſuch a
Porch or <hi>Pronaos,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
As that at <hi>Corfu,</hi> built by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Jovian:</hi> That at <hi>Troas,</hi> if it
was a Church, and at the Covent
of St. <hi>Luke</hi> under the <hi>Helicon,</hi>
built by the Emperor <hi>Romanus.</hi>
Thô they ſeem to be much leſſer

Pompous deſcription.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:102660:17"/>
This therefore as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
it in Ancient Buildings, I

Deſcription.</p>
            <p>

<hi>Euſebius</hi> joyns three Doors on the
ſame ſide; one great one in the
middle, and two leſſer on each
hand. This exactly agrees with
that great Building at <hi>Troy;</hi> which
has three great Arches remaining
at the Front of the Building. That
in the middle is much bigger, than
thoſe that are on each hand. Theſe
three Doors led into three Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the Church, made by the
two Ranks of Pillars, or four great
Supporters of the <hi>Cupalo</hi> in the

underſtand this right, there were
three Cloyſters, if not four to this

one. Which muſt needs make the

rather tranſlate it, <hi>On each ſide of
the whole Temple.</hi> And then there
muſt be alſo one at the Eaſt end;
and ſo the Symetry is full. But
this would make an extraordinary
difference in the Scheme from other
Churches, that are now extant.
For if ſo, it might probably have
four Doors at Eaſt, Weſt, North

Ancient Churches, I ever ſaw yet

<hi>Ipſam verò aedem Regiam, The
Royal Edifice,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Church:</hi>
For ſo we ſhall find the Famous
Churches (Cathedrals eſpecially)
often named by <hi>Euſebius</hi> and
others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Enſebius</hi> gives us not a perfect
Platform of this; ſo that we muſt
be forced to Collect from others
to make up this Defect. <hi>Euſebius</hi>
leaves us at the Entrance of the
three great Doors, which were it
ſeems at three ſides, if not four.
If at four ſides, then the Platform
muſt be an exact Square, with a
great <hi>Cupalo,</hi> or <hi>Dome</hi> in the middle,
ſuſtained by four great Pilaſters,
as that of <hi>Jovian</hi> at <hi>Corfu;</hi> which
to my beſt Remembrance hath but
four <hi>Pilaſters</hi> ſuſtaining the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palo;</hi>
and I think <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi>
at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> hath no more.
But if it was an oblong Square,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102660:19"/>
then I ſuppoſe there were more
Pillars between thoſe that held up
the <hi>Cupalo</hi> and the great Doors.
I ſhall ſuppoſe this to be an exact
Square; becauſe of the equal
Number of Cloyſters and Doors
at each ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>With
Thrones on high,</hi> or <hi>in the higheſt
or chiefeſt place.</hi> Where, or how
theſe Thrones were placed in this
Church, <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Rhetorical
Style renders difficult to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
If he means in the Higheſt
or Chiefeſt place, it muſt be at the
Eaſtern-ſide of the Church, under
the half <hi>Cupalo</hi> making a Semi-circle.
As there are ſeveral in
<hi>Greece,</hi> remaining to this Day.
As at <hi>Athens,</hi> in the Temple of

Church turn'd into a Moſque:
And as Monſieur <hi>Grelot</hi> deſcribes
it in <hi>Sancta Sophia</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
But if there were Doors and Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
on each of the four Sides,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102660:19"/>
this could not be. And he muſt
only mean <hi>Altiſſimis Thronis,</hi> as the
Tranſlator underſtands it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If ſo
they muſt be placed under the
Circle of the great <hi>Cupalo,</hi> which
was ſeparated from the reſt of the
Church with Latice work of Wood,

Figures.<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veridg.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in Can. <hi>Nicen.</hi> XI. ſec. 14.</note> For this <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Synthronon</hi> (as it was alſo called)
was placed within the Sacred Place

               </gap> muſt be

Semicircular form, as I have ſeen
it; only with this difference, That
in thoſe it is againſt the Wall at

was left between it and the Eaſt

            <p>So I ſhall place the Altar in the

which I conceive was ſeparated
from the reſt of the Church by
<hi>Cancelli,</hi> or open work of Wood,
curiouſly carved and wrought in
various Figures and Flowers. And
and at the Eaſtern ſide of this
Circle I ſhall place the Thrones,
or the <hi>Synthronon;</hi> becauſe it was
the General uſe of the Primitive
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102660:20"/>
Chriſtians to Worſhip God towards
the Eaſt: And in figure like that
remaining at <hi>Athens,</hi> which is
thus: Three large Degrees or Steps
of White Marble, one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in a Semicircular form; high
enough to ſit upon, and broad
enough for the Feet of thoſe ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

thoſe ſitting thereon beneath.
Upon the uppermoſt Step, is a
large Chair of beautiful White
Marble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the middle of the Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
alone againſt the Window,
which I ſuppoſe was for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop.
The uppermoſt Step, I
ſuppoſe, was for the Biſhop's
Collegues, when they met upon
Conſecrations of Biſhops, Synods,
&amp;c. as the Ancient Canons ordain;
and the next for the Presbyters:
For that they uſe to ſit with the

That the Biſhop ſit on a Seat on

the Duty of his Office, to look

and to inſtruct them, as given to be
Fellow Labourers to the Biſhop.</p>
            <p>From whence we learn not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That the Biſhop and Presbyters
ſate together on High Seats or
Thrones; but alſo that this was
placed within the Holy Place, he
calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which plainly
in this place ſignifies not the Altar,

in <hi>Euſebius</hi> may (for ought I ſee)
be underſtood. And if ſo, then
the placing of it in the Middle of
this Church becomes neceſſary:
But it muſt be acknowledged, that
this place and the Holy Table are
indifferently called by the ſame
Name <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, either from the

was ordinarily the moſt remote
place and part of the Church to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Eaſt, as I ſhall ſhew
afterwards. But in this Famous
Church of <hi>Tyre,</hi> it ſeems to be
placed in the Middle of the
Church under the great <hi>Cupolo</hi>
alſo, by its being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,

            </p>
            <p>From this Paſſage of <hi>Zonaras</hi>
we are alſo inform'd, that from
hence the Biſhop and Presbyters
uſe to Preach and inſtruct the
People; which may alſo be proved
by ſeveral others as great, if not
greater Authorities. And ſo the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of it here in the Middle was
moſt convenient for a great Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Auditors, to ſtand round
about him; the <hi>Faithful</hi> neareſt,
and the <hi>Katechumenoi</hi> and <hi>Penitents</hi>
next to them. So therefore I will
place it in this Scheme of the
Church of <hi>Tyre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>What theſe <hi>Exhedrae</hi> and great
Edifices were, I find the Learned
<hi>Valetius</hi> is at a ſtand to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine:
He ſuppoſeth they were the
<hi>Baptiſtory,</hi> or place where they
uſed to Baptize; or <hi>Secretarium,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:102660:22"/>
the Veſtery; <hi>Salutatorium,</hi> or the
Place to keep the Sick in, an
Hoſpital. Indeed in ſeveral Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Weſtern Churches, I have ſeen
the Baptiſtory by it ſelf a diſtance
from the Churches, as at <hi>Piza</hi> and
<hi>Spalato;</hi> but I never ſaw it in the
Eaſtern. Beſides <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpeaks
of them, as the two Fountains in
the Inner-Court or Cloyſter; which
he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>the Symbols of holy Cleanſing or
Purifying.</hi> He alſo aſſigns the uſe
of them, to wit, for Manſions for
thoſe who have need of Baptiſm,
and thoſe that have need of Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
to wit, the <hi>Katechumenoi,</hi> who
ſtaid there for to Study and to have
Inſtruction; and the <hi>Penitents,</hi>
who ſtaid there, to intreat the
Church for Abſolution, and to do
the Penance appointed by the
Canons of the Church.</p>
            <p>But ſome of theſe Buildings
indeed might be aſſigned for Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals
for the Poor and Sick; and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102660:23"/>
eſpecially for Ancient Widows for
whom the Ancient Church had all
the Care and Veneration ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
            <p>I do not doubt, but among
theſe alſo were Apartments for
the Miniſters attending the Divine
Service and Prayers Night and
Day; if not for the Biſhop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
Such as are mentioned by
<hi>Euſebius,</hi> to be annexed to the
<hi>Portico</hi> about the Church of the
Apoſtles at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> to wit,
Palaces Baths, Lodgins for Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
and ſeveral other Neceſſary
places, for the uſe of thoſe that
kept the Temple; that is, the
Miniſters thereof, which were built
to the Cloyſters.</p>
            <p>The Placing of theſe (as near as
I can gueſs) was parallel to the
Great <hi>Veſtibulum</hi> or <hi>Porch</hi> on each
ſide; and from thence in a ſingle
Row, or in two Quadrangles, to
joyn up to the <hi>Baſilico</hi> or inward
Temple. For ſo he makes them
on the one part to be joyned to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102660:23"/>
the <hi>Baſilico,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
And
at the other to the Gates of the
Middle Edifice: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
I have made them therefore to fill
up the vacant Angles, between the
Courts on each hand; ſo that they
might have Doors into the ſeveral
Cloyſters, or <hi>Portico's</hi> to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſeems to intimate
before, when he ſaith, <hi>Thoſe Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
were a convenient Habitation,
for thoſe that yet had need of the
firſt Inſtitution or Inſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the other two Spaces
at the Eaſt End were filled up with
Buildings, is not certain; but to
fill up the Beauteous Symetry, he
every where expreſſeth, I am apt
to believe, they were either for
Houſes for the Miniſters, or Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
for the Poor, Sick and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:102660:24"/>
And now I think every one
muſt needs confeſs, That they
never ſaw any thing more Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
Magnificent and Uniform than
this Primitive Cathedral of <hi>Tyre;</hi>
which was built immediately, as
ſoon as they had either Capacity
or Liberty to do it. And we read
of no Murmurers, that envyed
the coſtly Devotion of thoſe Pious
Biſhops and People beſtowed on
GOD their Saviour and Mighty
Redeemer: Nor were they by any
charged with Superſtition (either
upon that or any other account)
in that Glorious Age of the

            <p>This Place (as the moſt Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Monument of the Truth of
the Chriſtian Religion,) the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens

with Rubbiſh and Earth, and then
built a Temple to their moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Goddeſs <hi>Venus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Memory of it being
preſerved by the Chriſtians, this
Prophane Temple was demoliſhed,
and the whole unſanctified Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
quite carried away, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the Rock, by the Command
of the Emperour; where they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102660:28"/>
found that Venerable Monument
entire and perfect after ſo many
years.</p>
            <p>Which gave great Joy to the
whole Church, and eſpecially the
Pious Emperour; who reſolved
there to erect a Glorious Church,
beyond any extant in any City
in the World; to be a Triumphant
Trophy of the Glorious Victory
of Chriſt over <hi>Death, the World,</hi>
and <hi>the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to that end wrote Letters
to <hi>Macarius</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
to conſult about the Matter

Preſidents and Governours of thoſe

Neceſſary, and with all the moſt
Precious Materials, and ableſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects
and Workmen. And this

            <p>At the Eaſt-ſide there is a great
Gate, but now it opens only into
the Body of the Church: But in
<hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Time it ſeems there was

was the Front of the

to his Deſcription was a vaſt
Great Church:<note place="margin">Cap. 36.</note> But now muſt be
either much. Bigger than it was
then, or it muſt have been built
further Eaſtwards; but the Rock
of Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> to the Foot of
which this Temple reaches, ſeems
to hinder this: So that where the
preſent Body of the Church is
built, I take to be the place
where that great Court or Cloyſter
was.</p>

Towards the Sun-Riſing; <hi>i. e.</hi> Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
from the Sepulchre, on the

About both ſides of the Temple
were two rows of double <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico's,</hi>

            <p>But I do not know, but that
by double <hi>Portico's,</hi> he may mean

which Mr <hi>Sands</hi> deſcribes at <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
Lib. 3. p.</hi> 178. which has two
Rows of Beautiful Marble Pillars

<hi>Oppoſite to theſe,</hi> i. e. The Doors
and the <hi>Portico's, was the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere;</hi>
i. e. that the <hi>Italians</hi> call a

               </gap>. <hi>Valeſius</hi> ſeems
much out in this matter, thinking
that <hi>Euſebius</hi> calls this improperly
ſo; and would rather have it a
<hi>Hemicyclus,</hi> or rather a <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cylender:</hi>
For <hi>Euſebius</hi> means not
that ſort of a Quadrant of a
Sphere, as is to be ſeen at the Eaſt-End
in ſome Churches; as <hi>Sancta
Sophia, &amp;c.</hi> where the Altar was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in ſuch Churches; but properly
a <hi>Cupolo,</hi> which is a <hi>Hemiſphere</hi> and
was here ſuſtained by Twelve Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
under it indeed I ſuppoſe
was the Altar placed in the Center
of the Circle; as at that of <hi>Tyre:</hi>
But more plain here, for at the
Eaſt-End were alſo Doors to this
Church, more evidently than that
of <hi>Tyre.</hi> And in Reality here is
yet a great <hi>Cupolo</hi> ſtanding, as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102660:33"/>
Mr. <hi>Sands</hi>'s Draft deſcribes it, and
may be the ſame <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpeaks
of, for ought I know. Thô there
ſeem to be many other Alterations
now from the Ancient Church.</p>
            <p>There is indeed a Semicircle
below; but <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpeaks of its
reaching up to the Summit of the
Building, where I doubt not but
it was properly a Hemiſphere. But
I do not think with him, that it
was the furtheſt Eaſtern part of
the Church; but ſo that there was
place to go about it without ſide,
where the two double <hi>Portico's</hi>
met, as the Figure I have made of
it, or as it is on the Eaſt-End of
<hi>Weſtminſter-Abby:</hi> For,</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thence
going forward to the Entrance before
the Temple, he placed an open
Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thence going forward,</hi> ſhews
plainly, That there were Eaſtern-Gates
or Paſſages that led into a
great Court, or Cloyſter; which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102660:34"/>
led to outward Gates, and ſo to
the Street and Market in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Series. Therefore I take
it to be plain. That the Altar was
here placed under the <hi>Cupolo,</hi> but
more toward the Eaſtern-End,
than that I deſcribed at <hi>Tyre;</hi>
but ſo with a Semicircle at the
bottom, as the <hi>Synthronon</hi> might
there be placed. And by a Walk
under the double <hi>Portico</hi> (on each
hand) was a Space both about it, and
between it and the Eaſtern Wall,
and there Doors to go out into
the Eaſtern-Cloyſter, Gates and
Street. The preſent Platform doth
not altogether anſwer this; for all
the Cloyſters and Courts are gon,
and the Entrance now is only
South.</p>

it was plac'd in the midſt of a

which were joyned Palaces, Baths,
Places to Lodge Strangers, and

And the Magnificent Temple of
Chriſt's Diſciples, divided in four
Parts, with Sides in Form of a

            <p>That is, I ſuppoſe, Square
without, and Divided within into
four Parts, in Form of a Croſs;
as moſt of the Ancient Churches
I have ſeen in <hi>Greece,</hi> and now
extant, remain to this day: As
that of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople;
Jovianus</hi> at <hi>Corfu;</hi> of
<hi>Romanus</hi> at S. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Convent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

filling up each Corner. Which
being covered with Braſs, and
Gilt with Gold, muſt needs make
a moſt Splendid ſhow to all that
beheld it afar off, and near at

            <p>Indeed Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> gives us a

there was a Separation between the

<hi>Penitents</hi> and <hi>Learners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this we find plain, That

The Order the Chriſtian Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
were held in.</head>
            <p>AS Their CHURCHES
were Grave, and yet Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent:
ſo was the ORDER
of their Aſſemblies managed with
great Simplicity, and yet with
great Authority and Spiritual Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor;
with great Order, yet with
uſeful Plainneſs. Their Ritual ſeems
to be but ſhort; yet much better
than the Great Volumes of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
the World has ſince ſeen
in both the Eaſtern and Weſtern
Churches. The Order of their
Aſſemblies ſeem to be comprized
in that ſhort, but excellent Canon
of the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
Can. 19.</p>

their own Devotions privately, alone,
or by himſelf; After that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of the Biſhops, and the
Prayers of the Catechiſts is to be
performed: And after the going
out of the Catechiſts, the Prayer of
the Penitents is to be performed;
and after theſe are Miniſtred to,
and departed, thus ſhall the Three
Prayers of the Faithful be made:
One, to wit, The firſt in Silence;
but the ſecond and third ſhall be
performed with a Loud Voice. After
which, thus ſhall the Peace be given:
After the Presbyters have given
the Peace to the Biſhop, the Laicks
ſhall give the Peace; and ſo the
Holy Offering or Sacrament to be
celebrated. And it is fit that only
the Clergy ſhould enter in unto the
Altar, and there to Communicate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:102660:62"/>
               <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> deſcribes the
Chriſtian Aſſemblies to be held in
much the ſame manner; only he
mentions the Reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
before the Sermon.</p>
            <p>On the Day which is called <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Juſt.</hi> Apol. 2.</note>
there is a Meeting together in
one place, of all that remain in the
Cities and Countries: And there
they Read both out of the Apoſtles,
and out of the Writings of the
Prophets, ſo much as is ſufficient for
the time. Then when the Reader
leaves off, the Biſhop or Preſident
Preaches a Sermon, Exhorting them
to the Imitation of thoſe Good
things. After which, we uſually all
ſtand up and pour forth Prayers:
And (as I ſaid before) when we
deſiſt from Praying, Bread and
Wine, and Water is offered, and
the Biſhop according to his ability
offers Prayers and Thankſgiving,
and the People with a chearful Voice
ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi> Then follows the Giving
and Receiving of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to
Every one; And to thoſe that are
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102660:63"/>
not preſent, it is ſent by the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.
Thoſe that are Rich, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
every one, according to his own
Pleaſure, gives what he pleaſeth.
What is Collected, is depoſited with
the Biſhop or Preſident, and he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenceth
it to the Orphans and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
Sick, or thoſe who upon any
Account are in want, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This Order ſeems very natural,
proper, and moſt uſeful; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for thoſe Times, when the
World was to be taught, and not
forced (as by the <hi>Romans</hi>) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
what they either cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand;
or the more they do,
they ſee it to be Error, Nonſenſe,
and Contradiction.</p>
            <p>And concerning the Truth it
ſelf, Children may; but Men will
not be forced to learn. Therefore
truly, ſince ſo great a Part of
Mankind are, and ever will be,
either Ignorant, Prejudiced, or
Invincibly Obſtinate, and ſo very
much incapable of Inſtruction;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102660:63"/>
or at leaſt, being ſo perfectly
Inſtructed in the higheſt Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that they will be hardly
Reconciled to what even their true
Spiritual Guides and Superiours
judge moſt Agreeable to the Glory
of GOD in His Worſhip, and
fitteſt for their Edification.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I ſay, it would
certainly be very happy for the
Chriſtian World, That ſome ſuch
Rational Method were Ordered,
as may with more Eaſe <hi>Lead</hi>
them into Chriſt's Flock, rather
than <hi>Drive</hi> them. For Mankind
was ever naturally averſe to Force
and Violence. It is only Force of
Argument, that can convince the
Rational Soul.</p>
            <p>And what better ORDER can
be Invented, than this Ancient
Tryed Method; By which the
World was overcome, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Chriſtian? For thô we
have not the ſame ſorts of Men
in all points now-adays, now the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102660:64"/>
World is Profeſſedly Chriſtian;
yet in ſome ſort all are ſo, who
are not Reconciled, or do not
conſent to the Univerſal Doctrine
and Practice of Chriſt in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi>
and <hi>Charity;</hi> who have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the Perfect Building up
in the moſt Holy Faith. Yet ſo
far as they have obtained, I am
perſwaded that this Method would
be the beſt to Incite them to ſuch
a <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> as ſo far to Walk all by
the Same, if ſuch a Rule.</p>

The Application to the Church

            <p>THis ORDER might with

            <p>For, Bleſſed be God, we have an
Orthodox and Learned Clergy;
conſiſting of Biſhops, Presbyters

as Pious, Noble, and Well-informed;

            <p>Who both Delight and Rejoyce

Our <hi>Catholick,</hi> I mean <hi>Orthodox

Deliberation in divers Synods

Prudence, Moderation and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

fervently Love to perform their

accompanied with that Beauty of
Holineſs that She directs; for the
ſetting forth the Glory of God,
and ſetting forward the Salvation
of All Men. Theſe ought to be

the <hi>Faithful,</hi> and <hi>Perfect</hi> of the

ſpeaks, and the Ancients are not

            <p>But there are ſome, who thô
they are well Inſtructed, and
Believe well, and Externally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the Rules of the Church;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102660:65"/>
yet are highly wanting in the
Practice of Holineſs of Life and
Converſation. Theſe ought (in
great Compaſſion to their Souls)
to be made ſenſible of their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and for their Recovery ought
to be Conſidered and Intreated as
<hi>Penitents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are yet Others, who
acknowledg the ſame Orthodox
Faith that We do, and are (as
far as we know) Pious and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout;
yet Divide from Us upon
the Account of Diſcipline, and
Form of Worſhip: Who having
been Miſinformed concerning Us,
have thereupon forſaken Our
Communion in Prayers and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:
Yet I know they
would be contented to hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and the Holy Scriptures,
Read with Us. Therefore why
ſhould we not have Our Sermons
at ſuch a Convenient time of the
Service, as may Invite Them to
come and be Our Auditors, for
their further Inſtruction, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102660:66"/>
both Themſelves and Us?
Which might in time Reconcile
them Entirely to Us; being the
Thing We ſo much wiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
This requires but the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of One Indifferent Rule,
and no Subſtantial part of the
<hi>Liturgy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what more Convenient
Time than the Beginning, either
before Morning or Communion-Service,
when Mens Senſes are
freſh, and open for Inſtruction?</p>
            <p>After Theſe are ſeveral Others,
as <hi>Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> who want Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and thô Aged, yet are
Children in the Knowledge and
Grace of Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe are
truly <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> and are by all
means, to be Invited to hear
Reaſon and Religion, and to be
inſtructed in their Diſſenting Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith and Good Manners:
For whom Sermons and Cateche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Diſcourſes (ſuch as are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
diſcourſed to Children, and
are moſt plain and eaſie) are moſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102660:66"/>
Proper. For to ſuch all Sorts of
Mankind might properly come,
who may not be Admitted to
Holy Myſteries, nor Devotions,
without Impiety and Profanation
of them. Yet ſuch ought, and
perhaps would be willing to hear
the Holy Scriptures a Sermon or
Catechizing; which might prove
for their Edification, and in time
their Effectual Converſion. So
that if I were worthy to be
heard, That <hi>Rubrick,</hi> and that
Part of the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi>
(concerning <hi>Sermons</hi>) ſhould be
the firſt that I would beſeech the
Church to alter; as the only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
Neceſſary one, I know,
to be Altered in our preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
whereby all that are
not Reconciled, ſo as to be in
Communion with Us, might have
the Liberty orderly to leave the
Congregation, when the Sermon
or Catechetical Diſcourſe is ended.
As to <hi>Penitents,</hi> They might be
Aſſigned another Time, as the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102660:67"/>
Synod (with Reſpect to this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
and our Liturgy) might Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe</p>
            <p>But becauſe the mixture of the
Aſſembly makes great Diſorder
and Confuſion in their Leaving
the Congregation; therefore it
would yet be more commodious,
if Diſſenters had a particular
Place aſſigned them for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>It would not be a matter of any
great Difficulty, or Charge, to
Accommodate Our Churches ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Manner of the
Primitive Church: Eſpecially the
Cathedrals, where they have Space
enough to do this many ways:
They being neither Encumbred
with Pues, nor otherwiſe ſtraitned.
It is but Removing their Shrines
or rather Screens in moſt of them.
And the Holy Table ſtands where
it Anciently did; and ſetting a
Reverend Pulpit, Adorned with
the Commandments, in the place
of the Throne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:102660:67"/>
Thus within the Choirs would
be ſufficiently Capacious for the
<hi>Faithful,</hi> and within the Rails for
the <hi>Clergy</hi> and other Miniſters:
And then there would be ſufficient
Place for <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of all Sorts in
the Iles, with Liberty to come and
go when they think ſit; or rather
by the Admonition of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</p>
            <p>Or as it is in ſome Churches
yet: The Sermon might be firſt
Preached in the Body of the
Church, according to <hi>S. Chryſoſtom</hi>'s
Way: which prevailed in After-Ages;
and then the <hi>Clergy</hi> and
<hi>Faithful</hi> might retire thence to
their Devotions: Firſt to the Choirs
for Morning-Service; and then at
laſt within the Chancel, or Rails
for the Communion.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (till
within this two or three years)
had the Morning Prayers at Seven
or Eight of the Clock in the
Morning; the Sermon at Ten in
the <hi>Audit houſe;</hi> and then the reſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102660:68"/>
of the Communion-Service, and
Communion, in the <hi>Choir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Worceſter</hi> the Morning-Prayer
is yet Early; alſo the <hi>Litany</hi> at
Ten of the Clock, and then, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the Communion Service; and
then the Sermon in the Body of
the Church, whence they Return
to the Communion in the <hi>Choir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pariſh Churches might alſo
(without any great Difficulty or
Charge) be in like manner thus
Accommodated. The Complaint
is now with ſome Reaſon. Thar the
Choirs are ſo long and ſo diſtant
from the Bodies of the Churches,
that when the Communion-Service
is Celebrated there, it cannot be
well heard. Thô indeed for this
there is a Remedy provided by
the <hi>Rubrick;</hi> to wit, that the Holy
Table ſhall ſtand either in the
Body of the Church, or in the
Chancel: So that no New Rule
need be made for this. And in
many Churches the Pulpit is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
thus placed, at the Upper-End
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102660:68"/>
of the Body of the Church: So
that there only needs a Decent
Place, with a Rail to be before it,
to place the Communion Table
in.</p>
            <p>As this is agreeable to the moſt
Ancient manner; ſo hath it alſo
Modern Example to warrant it:
For this was the Form of moſt of
the Proteſtant Churches beyond
the Seas. The Great <hi>French Church</hi>
of <hi>Charenton,</hi> had the Pulpit (which
they properly call the <hi>Chaiſe,</hi> or
<hi>Chair,</hi> it being the Chair of Chriſt,
in oppoſition to that of <hi>Moſes</hi>)
placed about a fourth part of the
whole Length of the Temple from
the Eaſt-End, with a Large Square
place before it; fenced in by a
Low Wenſcot, accommodated with
Seats about it within for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
and whole Conſiſtory.</p>
            <p>The Cathedral at <hi>Geneva</hi> is juſt
ſo accommodated (to the beſt of
my Remembrance;) which perhaps
was the very ſame manner with
the Ancients, till they had the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102660:69"/>
Magnificence of the Empire, to
accommodate them with Richer
Materials, and greater Splendor.</p>
            <p>In ſome of their Churches, I
have obſerved their Communion-Table
kept within this; eſpecially
at <hi>Blois;</hi> and, as I am ſince In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
in ſeveral Places. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I wonder that their Learned
<hi>Monſieur Colomiés,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Parallele de la Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctique de l' Eſgliſe Ancienne, &amp; de celle des <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans de</hi> France, &amp;c.</note> ſhould make
this a matter of Reproach to them,
as therein to diſſent from all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.
I muſt needs avow with all
the Reſpect I ought, that that whole
firſt Chapter is a great Miſtake:
For the <hi>French Churches</hi> have this
Separation from the reſt of the
Church, for the Miniſters and
Conſiſtory, which are their Clergy.
And Women and Men do not ſit
promiſcuouſly together, but on
Benches by themſelves: And in
many Churches, in a Part of the
Temple by themſelves; as at
<hi>Blois</hi> (I remember) the Women
ſat in the Middle of the Church,
and the Men as their Guard round
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102660:69"/>
about them, nearer to the Walls.
But he makes the beſt Amends
he can now make, by confeſſing
his Error, and the Juvenility of
the Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>I believe this Diviſion of Sex
was formerly in our Churches:
For in many Country Churches
(where the Grandees have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
them, by making ſome
High and ſome Low, to be Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to their whole Families) is
yet to be ſeen not only <hi>Dextra
&amp; Siniſtra Pars virorum;</hi> but alſo
the Right and Left-hand Seats for
the Women. The Seats for the
Men being next to the Chancel,
and the Seats for the Women, next
from the Middle-Doors to the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fery;
with an Alley up to the
Middle of the Church, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Croſs that to the North and
South-Doors.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a <hi>Rubrick,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
the Men decently to Place
themſelves at the Right-hand, and
the Women at the Left, at the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102660:70"/>
Celebration of the Lord's Supper,
in the firſt Common-Prayer Book
of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth.</p>
            <p>But the General Mixture of all
Ages and Sexes, as in moſt of the
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Churches,
is very Indecent; not to ſay (as
ſome ſay, and others make it)
Scandalous.</p>
            <p>I think it may not be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
here to give a Specimen,
to ſhew how Our <hi>Liturgy</hi> might
be Accommodated to the Ancient
Manner, as it is already to the
Ancient Matter of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>For the Week-Days, when only
the Aſſembly of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> or
<hi>Penitents</hi> of our Communion are
Expected, I ſee no juſt Reaſon to
Alter any thing in Matter or
Order, in Morning or Evening
Prayer: Only the <hi>Penitents,</hi> by
the Admonition of the Deacon,
might Leave the Congregation,
if any there, after the Belief.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102660:70"/>
On Sundays alſo, when they ſay
the Morning Prayer. Early, between
Six and Nine the ſame Order
might well ſtill continue.</p>
            <p>But when the Aſſembly of the
whole Congregation is expected, it
might well be done in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Order, with theſe few Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:</p>
            <p>At the Appointed Hour, whilſt
the Congregation is coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
might be Sung a Pſalm in
Metre; either out of thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in uſe, or rather another
better Edition, ſet forth by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
collected out of the beſt
of the Several Editions of them;
done by ſeveral Hands. As I do
not doubt, but there was Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for thoſe in uſe, when firſt
ſet forth. For not only that at
the Front of them teſtifies as
much, in the oldeſt Editions; but
alſo there is a Form of Prayer and
Thankſgiving ſet forth by Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and Her Council,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102660:71"/>
wherein one of thoſe Pſalms are
ordered to be Sung, not long after
that Edition, in the ſame Reign
in which they came forth.</p>
            <p>After this might follow a Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
out of the Old Teſtament, as
Appointed; and then the Epiſtle and
Goſpel as Appointed; either from
the Pulpit, Reading-Desk, or as in
Cathedral Churches.</p>
            <p>Then might follow the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>After this, the Miniſter might
Conclude with ſome ſuch Sentence
as This:</p>
            <p>He that cometh to God, muſt
Believe that he is; and that he is
a Rewarder of all them that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
ſeek him.</p>
            <p>With the Heart man believeth
unto Righteouſneſs, and with the
Mouth confeſſion is made unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore make Confeſſion
of our Chriſtian Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:102660:71"/>
Then might follow one of the
Creeds, either to be ſaid or ſung
diſtinctly.</p>
            <p>Then might follow the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
after ſome ſuch Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Scripture as this:</p>
            <p>Ye ſay,<note place="margin">Jam. 2. 19,</note> you believe there is One
God; ye do well:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Devils alſo believe and
Tremble;</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 26.</note> as the Apoſtle S. <hi>James</hi>
aſſures us. And that,</p>
            <p>As the Body without the Spirit
is dead, ſo Faith without Works is
dead alſo.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore alſo keep God's
Covenant,<note place="margin">Pſal. 103. ver. 18.</note> and conſider his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
to do them.</p>
            <p>Which are the ſame which God
ſpake in the Twentieth Chapter of
<hi>Exodus;</hi> Saying,</p>
            <p>I am the Lord thy God &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. Thou ſhalt have no other Gods
but me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Lord have mercy, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Sum of all which is Love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:102660:72"/>
Let us therefore Love the Lord,
our God, with all our Hearts, with
all our Souls, with all our Powers,
and with all our Strengths.</p>
            <p>And, Let us love our Neighbours
as our ſelves; by doing unto all men,
as we would they ſhould do unto us:
For on theſe two depend the whole
Law and the Prophets.</p>
            <p>Then might follow an Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for thoſe that are thus minded
to Stay; and for thoſe that are
otherwiſe minded, to Depart

in the Afternoon.</p>

            <p>Then the <hi>Exhortation</hi> for the

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102660:72"/>
Sentences, Collection and Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
&amp;c. as Appointed. When
there is none; after the Offertory,
the Lord's Prayer, the General
Prayer, Collects, and General
Thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>Then to Conclude with,
<q>The Peace of God, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At Evening: After a Pſalm, as
before; or the Pſalms, as Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;
or both; might follow
the Leſſons out of the Old and
New Teſtament, as Appointed;
the Catechiſm, and then the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>Then the Belief, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
as before; or inſtead
of the Commandments the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
as in the 27 <hi>th</hi> Chapter
of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi>

            <p>Then the Diſſenters to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
            <p>And then one or more of the
Sentences of Scripture for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
Then the Exhortation,
Confeſſion, and Abſolution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:102660:73"/>
Then the Penitents admoniſhed
to Depart; And then the Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

            <p>The Lord be with you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And with thy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Then the reſt as follows, and
according as it is Appointed.</p>
            <p>So you ſee that the Primitive
Order of Divine-Service, might be
adapted to our Preſent Liturgy
without altering any thing of the
Matter, and not very much of the
Manner of it.</p>
            <p>Now that ſuch things, for the
Glory of God, and the Peace of
his Church, may (by the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Authority of the Church and
State) be Altered, and otherwiſe
Eſtabliſhed, Our Church acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
in that excellent Preface to
the Common-Prayer Book, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Ceremonies; why ſome
be Aboliſhed, and why ſome are
Retained. Which is ſo Pious,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102660:73"/>
Diſcreet, and Rational an Account
of thoſe things, that it ſeems
wonderful, that it did not ſatisfie
all Men of either Piety, Learning,
or Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And indeed, I ſee no Reaſon why
Men ſhould fall out at all about
Innocent Ceremonies, ſince we
find the Earlieſt Times of the
Univerſal Church, did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
themſelves about ſuch ſmall
Differences in Indifferent Practices
of divers particular Churches.

Frivolous Accounts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:102660:74"/>
I wiſh our Diſſenting Brethren
would be followers of that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Example and Temper; and
not Divide their own Church upon
ſuch Accounts, but ſtrive toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>Now leſt I ſhould grow Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
about Small Matters, at a
time when ſuch great and weighty
Concerns are under Conſideration
in Church and State I will come
to a Concluſion; hoping that I
ſhall not be overmuch cenſured
with Impertinency, for ſpending
ſo much of my own, and the
Readers time, on this Subject:
Since it was ſo wiſe a Man that

            <p>He that deſpiſeth Small things
ſhall fall by little and little.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that conſider, that it is
about ſuch ſmall things, if the
Reverend and Decent Worſhip of
God may be ſo called, that a very
Great part of our Nation have
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102660:74"/>
Separated themſelves from the
National Church, will be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mind. For if <hi>Mediums</hi> might
be found out, to bring us to ſuch
a Right underſtanding with each
other, as would bring us to Agree

without excluding Decency and

is nothing more deſirable in this
World; ſo nothing ſhould be more
earneſtly Endeavoured by thoſe
that have the Weighty Charge of
Chriſt's Sheep and Lambs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their Charge, than to
bring them into Chriſt's Fold;
to be at perfect Unity in Faith,

And I muſt profeſs my
