            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A view of ſome Exceptions to the <hi>Practicall Catechiſme,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing it again appears to me by a <hi>book,</hi> that came to this town on Saterday laſt, (entituled, <hi>A Teſtimony to the truth of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. pretending to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by 52 <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt within the Province of London)</hi> that it is Gods good pleaſure to deliver me up to be evil ſpoken of, and accuſed, and to bear a yet deeper part of his bitter cup, then many others of my Brethren have done, I deſire to bleſſe and praiſe his name for this his goodneſſe and mercy to me, and to embrace all thoſe, who have joyn'd their hands to be inſtruments in this, as thoſe whom by <hi>Chriſts</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand (particularly belonging to me on this occaſion) I am bound <hi>to love, to bleſſe, to pray for,</hi> and not to think of any other way of return toward them. This, I thank God, I can moſt cheerfully doe, and would ſatisfie my ſelf to have done it in private, between <hi>God</hi> and my own ſoul, were there not another occaſion, which makes it a little neceſſary for me to ſay ſomewhat publickly; and that is the vindication of the <hi>truth of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> which they who are willing to give <hi>teſtimony</hi> to it, will, I hope, take from me in good part.</p>
            <p>Theſe men <hi>pag.</hi> 4. in the beginning of the ſecond branch of their teſtimony, (which it ſeems by <hi>pag.</hi> 37. the whole number of the 52 Miniſters have ſubſcribed) make mention of <hi>unſound opinions, eſpecially abominable errors, damnable hereſies, and horrid blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102873:3"/>
which are broached and maintained here in</hi> England <hi>among us, under the notion of</hi> New lights, <hi>and new truths; many of which they have reaſon to judge deſtructive to the very fundamentall truths of Chriſtianity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All of them utterly repugnant to the ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, the occaſion of much grief of heart to all the friends of truth and piety at home, the ſcandal and offence of all the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches abroad, the unparalleld reproach of this Church and Nation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally inconſiſtent with the Covenant, and the covenanted Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in a word, the very dregs and ſpawn of thoſe old accurſed hereſies which have been already condemned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>After this preface and expreſſion of their zeale to Gods truth, they conclude the period with a profeſſion, that they <hi>more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly abominate theſe infamous and pernicious errours of late publiſhed among us, and hereafter recited in this enſuing Catalogue,</hi> viz. <hi>Errours,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In this Catalogue, three particulars there are recited from the <hi>Practical Catechiſme of H. Hammond,</hi> 2. Edit. <hi>London,</hi> 1646.</p>
            <p>For which premiſes, I ſuppoſe, any Reader will conclude, that thoſe three particulars are by theſe Miniſters thought guilty of all thoſe Charges which they had affixt to <hi>All</hi> the unſound opinions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> noted by them, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are <hi>utterly repugnant to the ſacred Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. and in the modeſteſt of their expreſſions, that they are <hi>infamous and pernicious errours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this ſuppoſition, I hold it my duty by ſetting down theſe three particulars punctually, to referre to all impartiall Chriſtians to judge whether it be <hi>a Teſtimony to the truth of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to paſſe ſuch cenſures on them.</p>
            <p>The firſt is recited by them, <hi>p.</hi> 9. and it is this, That <hi>Chriſt was given to undergoe a ſhamefull death voluntarily upon the Croſſe, to ſatisfie for the ſin of</hi> Adam, <hi>and for all the ſins of all mankinde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is thus plainly ſet down in their catalogue of <hi>infamous and pernicious errors,</hi> but without the leaſt note to direct what part of this propoſition is liable to that charge, any farther then may be collected from the title of the <hi>Errors</hi> under which 'tis placed, viz: <hi>Errors touching univerſall or generall redemption.</hi> From whence I preſume to diſcern their meaning to be that to affirm Chriſt to have <hi>ſatisfied for,</hi> or <hi>redeemed all mankinde,</hi> is this <hi>pernicious error</hi> by them <hi>abominated.</hi> And ſuch I confeſſe I ſhould acknowledge
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102873:3"/>
it to be, if it had any right to be joyn'd with that other by theſe men ſet under the ſame head <hi>[that the damned ſhall be ſaved]</hi> but I hope that errour hath received no patronage from that <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm,</hi> nor ſure from that aſſertion of <hi>Chriſts redeeming all mankind.</hi> Theſe two propoſitions being very reconcileable, that <hi>Chriſt redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all men,</hi> and yet that the whole number of the impenitent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleiving, reprobate world ſhall never be <hi>ſaved</hi> by him. If there were any need of it, I ſhould eaſily ſhew the way of reconciling theſe two, by adding that the great Benefits of <hi>Chriſts death,</hi> which I affirm to be generall, are given upon <hi>condition,</hi> not abſolutely (as <hi>Gods love</hi> to the <hi>world,</hi> and, the effect of it, <hi>given his Son,</hi> is not deſigned, that all <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but that all <hi>conditionally,</hi> i. e. <hi>whoſoever beleiveth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life)</hi> &amp; that they which doe not perform that <hi>condition</hi> (as God knows a great multitude doe not) ſhall never be <hi>ſaved</hi> by his <hi>death:</hi> To which purpoſe is that of <hi>Proſper,</hi> one farre enough from all kindneſs to the <hi>Pelagians, Redemptor mundi dedit pro mundo ſanguinem ſuum, &amp; mundus redimi noluit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Redeemer of the world gave his blood for the world, and the world would not be redeemed. ad Gal: cap.</hi> 9. But, to confine my diſcourſe (without conſideration of the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences)</hi> to the aſſertion it ſelf; I deſire it may be obſervd, that this was not crudely ſet down in that <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> but with this immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate addition <hi>[to taſt death for every man, Heb.</hi> 2. 9.] by that plain teſtimony of Scripture confirming the truth of what was aſſerted, as punctually as could be imagined. For ſure <hi>[every man]</hi> ſignifies all mankind, as that notes <hi>ſingulos generis humani,</hi> in the largeſt notion of the word, and <hi>taſting death</hi> for them is ſatisfying for their ſins. If this teſtimony (ſo clear, that it alone hath, to my knowledge, convinc'd one as learned a man as doth in this Church of ours maintain the doctrines contrary to the <hi>Remonſtrants)</hi> be not thought ſufficient to ſupport this aſſertion, I ſhall then <hi>ex abundanti</hi> adde theſe other plain teſtimonies; Not onely that of <hi>Gods giving his onely ſonne,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Chriſt</hi> as an effect or expreſſion of his <hi>love to the world,</hi> (which it would not be, if he did not give him for the <hi>world,</hi> whom he is ſaid to <hi>love)</hi> but (to prevent all diſtinctions concerning the notion of the world, as if it ſignified, onely the Elect) more particularly theſe two; Firſt that of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. where <hi>the Lord,</hi> i. e. <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:102873:4"/>
is plainly ſaid to have <hi>bought</hi> (i. e. paid the price, ſatisfied for) <hi>them, who deny him, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction:</hi> to which agrees chat of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 11. where the <hi>weak brother,</hi> of whom 'tis ſaid, that by another mans ſcandal he <hi>ſhall periſh,</hi> is deſcribed to be one <hi>for whom Chriſt died.</hi> The other teſtimony which I ſhall adde, is that of S. <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 14. which I deſire the intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obſerve: Where ſpeaking of the <hi>conſtreining</hi> obliging <hi>love of Chriſt,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead,</hi> that is, ſurely, <hi>All</hi> in the full latitude, not only the <hi>elect</hi> but <hi>All others;</hi> and this concluſion the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> infers by this <hi>medium,</hi> becauſe <hi>one,</hi> i. e. <hi>Chriſt died for all,</hi> which being a proof of the other, muſt certainly be as true, and as acknowledged (if not more) as that which 'tis brought to prove: and particularly the <hi>[all]</hi> for whom he <hi>died,</hi> be as unlimited as the <hi>[All]</hi> that were prov'd from thence to be <hi>dead,</hi> or elſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> could not <hi>judge</hi> (as he ſaith he doth) or conclude the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>all</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> by that <hi>mediu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> From this arguing of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> I ſhall make no queſtion to infer, that in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> divinity, <hi>Chriſt died for all who are dead in Adam;</hi> and on that occaſion I ſhall adde, by the way, that the contrary doctrine [of <hi>Chriſts</hi> not dying for all] was by the <hi>Antients</hi> affixt on <hi>Pelagius</hi> upon that ground, of his affirming that all (i. e. that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants) were not faln in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo needed not to be redeem'd by Chriſt. Thus is appears by S. <hi>Aug: cont. 2. Epiſt. Pelag: l. 2. c. 2. Pelagiani dicunt Deum non eſſe omnium aetatum in hominibus mundatorem, ſalvatorem, liberatorem, &amp;c.</hi> and when the <hi>Maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> to vindicate themſelves from that charge of S. <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> confeſſe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died <hi>for all mankinde,</hi> as it appeares by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers Epiſtle) Proſper</hi> expreſſes no manner of diſlike of that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but formes other charges againſt them. And the truth is, there is ſcarce any antient Writer before <hi>Pelagius,</hi> but hath directly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted <hi>Chriſts</hi> dying for all, The teſtimonies of <hi>Irenaeus, Clemens, Origen, Macarius, Cyrill of Jeruſalem, Euſebius, Athanaſius,</hi> and many others might readily be produced, if that were needfull. And then let it be gueſt alſo, which of the two poſitions, the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or the negative, beſt deſerves the charge of being the <hi>ſpawn of thoſe old accurſed hereſies, which have been already condemned, &amp;c.</hi> The ſame I could adde from many the learnedſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which never were thought to be tainted with any antient or modern
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102873:4"/>
hereſie (though others I know have expreſt themſelves otherwiſe) but I need not ſuch auxiliaries. To conclude this point, I ſuppoſe in affirming or vindicating this poſition, I have born <hi>teſtimony</hi> to the <hi>truth of Chriſt,</hi> from whom, and whoſe Apoſtles I profeſſe to have learn'd this truth, and to conceive it (for the ſenſe of it) as fully teſtified by plain Scriptures, as many Articles of the Creed; and for the expreſſion uſed in the <hi>Pract: Catechiſme</hi> of <hi>[all mankind]</hi> I muſt acknowledge to have learn'd it from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (of which I doe yet with joy profeſſe my ſelf an obedient ſon and member) in thoſe words of her <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> eſtabliſht by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> and inſerted in the Book of <hi>Lyturgie,</hi> where I was taught, <hi>[to beleive in God the Father, who created me and all the world, In God the Son, who redeemed me and all mankinde, and in God the holy Ghoſt, who ſanctified me and all the elect people of God;</hi> where <hi>mankinde</hi> as it is of a <hi>narrower</hi> extent on one ſide then all the world of creatures, ſo is it to be underſtood of a <hi>larger,</hi> then <hi>all the elect people of God;</hi> and ſo much for the firſt charge.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is ſet down <hi>pag.</hi> 15. and it is this. <hi>That neither</hi> Paul <hi>nor</hi> James <hi>exclude or ſeparate faithfull actions or acts of faith from faith, or the condition of juſtification, but abſolutely require them, as the only things by which the man is juſtified.</hi> What is thus ſet down I acknowledge to be <hi>in terminis</hi> in the <hi>Practical Catechiſme,</hi> but cannot eaſily gueſſe wherein the errour or perniciouſneſſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to lie, unleſſe it ſhould poſſibly be thorow a miſtake of the phraſe <hi>[the only things by which the man is juſtified]</hi> as if by that ſpeech ſhould be underſtood, either that the <hi>faithfull actions or acts of faith without faith it ſelf,</hi> were the <hi>only things by which we are juſtified,</hi> or elſe that all the things there ſpoken of, <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>faithfull actions,</hi> or <hi>acts of faith</hi> are the only CAUSE, and ſo ſome CAUSE of our <hi>juſtification,</hi> or by which, as by a CAUSE, we are juſtified; either of theſe I confeſſe might paſſe for an errour, but both theſe doctrines I have ſufficiently diſclaim'd; and indeed in this very propoſition 'tis affirm'd that the <hi>faithfull actions or acts of Faith are not excluded or ſeparated from Faith</hi> (which they muſt be if they juſtifie without <hi>Faith) or the condition of juſtification (i. e.</hi> from that faith which is conſidered as, and affirm'd to be the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of our juſtification) but <hi>by thoſe two Apoſtles abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi> to what? Why <hi>to faith, or the condition of our juſtification,

as the only things</hi> together with it by which as by a <hi>condition,</hi> and only ſo (as 'tis clearly ſet down all over that part of the <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> which handles <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Juſtification)</hi> the man is <hi>juſtified.</hi> This I ſuppoſe may give theſe men ſome light of their miſtake, if it were ſuch: but if they underſtand the ſpeech as then and now I doe, and yet think it error, and pernicious, I muſt then only prove that what was ſaid from S. <hi>James</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> was not by me falſly impoſed upon them, and then they muſt either maintain my ſpeech, or fall with me in the ſame condemnation. That S. <hi>James</hi> doth not <hi>exclude or ſeparate faithful actions, or acts of Faith, from Faith, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Juſtification, but require them, (i. e.</hi> Faith, and faithfull actions, or acts of faith) <hi>as the only things by which, as by a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the man is juſtified</hi> will be clear by the definition of a <hi>condition</hi> in <hi>Logick,</hi> and the plain words of S <hi>James;</hi> A <hi>Condition</hi> is a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the ſubject required to make him capable, or a <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non;</hi> and ſo a condition of <hi>juſtification</hi> is no more, then that without which a man cannot be juſtified; and that is the direct affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of S. <hi>James, c. 2. 24. Ye ſee that by works (i. e.</hi> faithful actions, or acts of faith) <hi>a man is juſtified, and not by faith only:</hi> and again, <hi>Faith if it have not works,</hi> v. 17. and <hi>Faith without works,</hi> v. 20. <hi>is dead,</hi> and ſo ſure, not ſuch as by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we are juſtified. From whence I form this <hi>ſyllogiſme, That, without which, in S.</hi> James's <hi>opinion, we are not juſtified, and by which joyn'd with faith we are juſtified, not by faith only, is not by S.</hi> James <hi>excluded or ſeparated from Faith, or the condition of our juſtification, but required together with Faith, as the only things by which</hi> (as by a condition) <hi>the man is juſtified.</hi> But <hi>without acts of faith or faithfull actions, in S.</hi> James's <hi>opinion, we are not juſtified, and by them we are juſtified, and not by faith only,</hi> Therefore <hi>faithfull actions, or acts of Faith are not by S.</hi> James <hi>excluded or ſeparated from Faith, or the condition of our juſtification, but required together with faith, as the only things by which</hi> (as by a condition) the <hi>man is juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt propoſition is clear from the nature of a <hi>Condition;</hi> the ſecond from the words cited out of S. <hi>James,</hi> and then I hope the concluſion will neither be <hi>errour</hi> nor <hi>pernitious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then for S. <hi>Paul</hi> 'tis made evident in the <hi>Pract: Catechiſm</hi> that the <hi>faith</hi> by which according to his doctrine <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> (and not by <hi>works) Rom.</hi> 4. was not only a depending on God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102873:5"/>
for the performance of his promiſe (which yet was a <hi>faithfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or <hi>act of Faith,</hi> but alſo a reſigning himſelf up wholly to him to obey his precepts; or more clearly, was a <hi>Faith,</hi> which, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was tried by promiſes or commands, did anſwer <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Acts of faith,</hi> or <hi>faithfull actions;</hi> and ſo was accepted by God (without abſolute unſinning obedience, much more without obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Moſaicall law, i e.</hi> without <hi>works)</hi> all which is clear in the ſtory of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and I ſuppoſe need not farther be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And then concerning S. <hi>Pauls</hi> part in the buſineſſe, my ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme ſhall be this, <hi>He that affirms</hi> Abraham <hi>to be juſtified by that Faith, which, howſoever 'twas tried, did anſwer God in acts of faith or faithfull actions, doth not exclude or ſeparate faithfull actions or acts of faith from faith, or the condition of our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but abſolutely requires them, &amp;c.</hi> But S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms <hi>Abraham to be juſtified by that faith, which howſoever 'twas tried, did anſwer God in faithfull actions, or acts of faith,</hi> Therefore S. <hi>Paul doth not exclude or ſeparate faithfull actions,</hi> &amp;c. The firſt propoſition I conceive wants little proving, after that which hath been already premiſed in this matter. And for the ſecond I ſhall deſire that <hi>Abrahams faith,</hi> as it hath juſtification attributed to it by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> may be viewed both in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the <hi>Rom.</hi> and the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the <hi>Heb.</hi> In the former his <hi>faith</hi> was tried by the promiſe of a numerous ſeed, &amp;c. and he anſwered that with one <hi>act of faith,</hi> or <hi>faithfull action, beleived in hope, beyond hope,</hi> v. 18. was <hi>ſtrong in faith</hi> and <hi>gave glory to God,</hi> v. 20. was <hi>fully perſwaded, that what God had promiſed, he was able to perform,</hi> v. 21. all which what are they but <hi>acts of faith,</hi> or <hi>faithfull actions;</hi> all, which (when the object of the <hi>faith</hi> is Gods abſolute promiſe) the matter is capable of, and for this it <hi>was counted to him for righteouſneſſe,</hi> or he was juſtified, v. 22. and thence ſure I may conclude, that theſe were ſo required, as the <hi>condition</hi> by which he was, and without which he ſhould not be juſtified. In the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the <hi>Heb.</hi> many other <hi>acts</hi> of his <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>faithfull actions</hi> are mentioned, v, 8. <hi>By faith he obeyed to goe out of his own country, not knowing whither he went,</hi> and v. 9. <hi>by faith he ſojourn'd in a ſtrange land,</hi> v. 10. <hi>by faith he expected a city, that hath foundations,</hi> v. 17. <hi>by faith he offered his Son,</hi> and v. 19. <hi>counted that God was able to raiſe him up from the dead,</hi> v. 20. <hi>by faith he bleſſed</hi> Iſaac <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102873:6"/>
things to come.</hi> What are all theſe but acts of faith, or faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full actions in all kinds of tryals? And therefore I ſuppoſe all this being out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as the former out of S. <hi>James,</hi> 'twill be no errour or pernicious from their very words to have affirm'd this doctrine, and affixt it on them. I ſuppoſe alſo this may ſerve for the ſecond propoſition.</p>
            <p>The third is ſet down <hi>p.</hi> 18. from <hi>Pract: Catech: p.</hi> 120. and <note place="margin">Edit. II<hi rend="sup">Ꝫ</hi>. <hi>but</hi> p. 136. Edit. V<hi rend="sup">Ꝫ</hi>. An. 1649.</note> 'tis this, That <hi>[Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain]</hi> is undoubtedly no more then <hi>[thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf.]</hi> To this Charge I anſwer firſt, that it is a little ſtrange, that a bare explication of a phraſe of Scripture, a part of the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement in <hi>Exod.</hi> though it were acknowledged falſe, or forc'd, ſhould yet be ſo farre improvable by any, as to come under the title of an <hi>infamous pernicious errour,</hi> a <hi>ſpawn of the old accurſed hereſies, &amp;c.</hi> and be capable of all thoſe other aggravations at firſt mentioned, which being affixt to all the errours in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, muſt alſo be affixt to this which is ſet down for one of them.</p>
            <p>But then ſecondly, for the truth, (moſt undoubted certain truth) of this explication, or interpretation, thus cenſured, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly at large made it appear, that the words <hi>[to take the name of God]</hi> ſignifie to <hi>ſwear,</hi> and no more, and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> which we render <hi>in vain,</hi> ſignifies <hi>[falſly]</hi> and is ſo rendred in the ninth Commandment, and agreeable to that, <hi>Pſal. 15. to lift up the ſoul to vanity,</hi> is to ſwear by the ſoul or life <hi>falſly,</hi> as it there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>nor ſworn to deceive his neighbour,</hi> and beſide my own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this matter, back'd with the conſent of as learned as this age hath, or the Antient Church had any, I conceived that I had a moſt authentick warrant from <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who renders it <gap reason="foreign">

And indeed this was the only occaſion of delivering thoſe words in the <hi>Practical Catech:</hi> to ſhew that Chriſt did not miſreport the words of the Commandements, nor yet referre to any other place but that Commandment in thoſe words of his. And though I have many other things, that I could ſay to that matter, able to free that ſpeech from all imaginable inconveniences (eſpecially when in that place Chriſts prohibition is explain'd to be againſt all kind of ſwearing (by any other as well as by God) in ordinary conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, or in any caſe but wherein it is neceſſary to confirm by oath) yet I am very willing to leave the matter here, upon this account at this time given of it, <hi>

            <p>I beſeech God to forgive them which have brought this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary trouble upon the Reader; and for my ſelf I have to them theſe two only requeſts, 1. That they will examine themſelves ſincerely, and as in Gods ſight, what the motive or deſign was, which perſwaded them to ſingle out me alone (who profeſſe my ſelf, and am by all that know me acknowledged to hold nothing contrary to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and will juſtifie it to any man that knows what the Church of <hi>England</hi> is) and joyn me with the Broachers of all the blaſphemies and hereſies of this age: And 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, that they will lay to heart the conſequences which may natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flow from hence, if God doe not uphold weak Chriſtians, who ſeeing ſo many doctrines of very diſtant natures blended together, with the ſame brand of <hi>[hereſie and blaſphemy, infamous and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious]</hi> faſtned on them, and no kind of proofs annext, that any are ſuch (beſide the judgment of the Cenſors) may poſſibly find ſome of them to be the infallible truths of God, and be tempted (if they have not ſtronger antidotes then this bare <hi>Teſtimony</hi> will afford them) to have the ſame thoughts of the other alſo; Or if not, whether they will not be inclined to have the ſame ſeverity and condemnation for me, or any other Aſſerter of ſuch propoſitions as theſe, as they are taught to have for the Authors of thoſe other <hi>blaſphemous</hi> propoſitions, and ſo be tempted to uncharitableneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:102873:7"/>
Having ſaid thus much, I ſhall hope it may find ſome good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe among ſome who have ſubſcribed that <hi>Teſtimony:</hi> But if I am miſtaken in all of them, I ſhall then deſire that this impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous Paper may gain me but thus much, that either the firſt ſubſcriber M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
