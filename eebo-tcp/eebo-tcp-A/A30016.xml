            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Teſtimony and Caution to ſuch as do make a Profeſſion of Truth, who are in ſcorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and more eſpecially ſuch who profeſs to be Miniſters of the Goſpel of Peace, That they ſhould not be concerned in Worldly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</head>
            <p>WE have for a long time been deeply ſenſible of the great hurt that many, profeſſing the ſame Truth with us, (called in ſcorn <hi>Quakers</hi>) have received, and do remain under in theſe Parts, as to their Souls inward ſtate in the growth and proſperity of Truth, and the work and effect of it upon them, ſo that to our certain Obſervation divers are come to a great loſs and decay thereby, as to their inward ſtate in the Truth, by their medling with Worldly Government, in the ſeveral parts of it, and reſpective Offices thereunto belonging; as ſome being Judges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are or may be concerned to paſs Sentence of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Puniſhment upon ſome, as not only of an Eye for an Eye, but of Life for Life; the which, although proper and neceſſary to be executed by Worldly Rulers and Judges, yet ſeeing Chriſt hath forbid it unto his Followers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.38, 39. it is not proper for ſuch as profeſs to follow Chriſt, according to the moſt perfect and clear Goſpel Diſpenſations and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56429:2"/>Miniſtration profeſſed by us; and as it doth not become any of our Profeſſion to receive or undertake the Office of a Worldly Judge, to judge in a matter of Life and Death, or any degree of corporal Puniſhment, ſo it is our Judgment and Perſwaſion, that thoſe of our Profeſſion of the faithful People (called in ſcorn <hi>Quakers</hi>) ſhould not meddle or be concerned with any other part or office of any worldly Rule or Government, as to be Juſtice, Sheriff or Conſtable, or Jury-man in any Criminal Cauſes, or to chuſe or be choſen ſo to ſit in an Aſſembly or Provincial Council to make Laws againſt Criminal Offenders, extending either to the taking away of Life or any other corporal puniſhment. And for this our Perſwaſion, we give theſe following Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Becauſe Chriſt hath expreſly forbid it to his Followers, <hi>To take an Eye for an Eye, or a Tooth for a Tooth, nor to reſiſt Evil;</hi> for the ſame Reaſon, not to take Life for Life, or Limb for Limb, or to uſe any Corporal Puniſhment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, in behalf of himſelf and all good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> according to that clear Goſpel Diſpenſation that they were come unto, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The Weapons of our War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare are not Carnal.</hi> Epheſ. 2.12. <hi>And we wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Becauſe Chriſt our Leader and Example ſaid, <hi>He came not to destroy mens Lives, but to ſave them,</hi> Luke 9.56. And when the Woman taken in Adultery was brought before him, though by the Law ſhe deſerved Death, yet he did not condemn her, but ſaid, to her, <hi>Go, ſin no more,</hi> John 8.11. And when ſome of his Diſciples asked him, <hi>Wilt thou that we command Fire to come down from Heaven to conſume them?</hi> Luke 9.54. he turned, and rebuked them, and ſaid, <hi>Ye know not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56429:2"/>what manner of Spirit ye are of;</hi> and theſe concerning whom ſome of the Diſciples ſpake, were <hi>Samaritains,</hi> that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Village, who would not receive Chriſt into their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, which was a great breach of Humanity and humane Society, and by his words it appeareth, that to call for fire from Heaven to deſtroy the Life of Man, or kindle a fire upon Earth to do it, belongeth not to the perfect Goſpel Spirit or State, but is of the Law.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4thly.</hi> Becauſe Chriſt has expreſly forbidden his Diſciples <hi>To exerciſe Lordſhip,</hi> or <hi>to lord it over their Brethren,</hi> Luke 22.25, 26. And he ſaid unto them, <hi>The Kings of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>exerciſe Lordſhip over them, and they that exerciſe Authority upon them are called Benefactors; but ye ſhall not be ſo, &amp;c.</hi> And ſince Chriſt hath allowed and appointed in his Church a ſpiritual Rule and Authority, that ſome are to have over others, by the Power of his Spirit in them, that place <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood to forbid amongſt his Diſciples &amp; Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, a ſpiritual Government and Rule in his Church; and therefore what he forbids is Worldly Government among his Followers, according to the World, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. &amp; 5.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5thly.</hi> From theſe &amp; other places of Scripture, our Friends from the beginning have ſolemnly declared againſt all uſe of the carnal Sword, or of any carnal Weapon to hurt the Body of any man, or take away the Life of any man or men in any eaſe, whether offenſive or defenſive; and for our part we do ſee it very clearly and plainly, that the uſe of the Sword, or o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſome carnal or bodily Weapons, is ſo neceſſary to the Worldly Magiſtrate to puniſh ſuch as deſerve it, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive part of his Office cannot in an ordinary way (and without Miracles) be done without it; and Practice doth ſufficiently confirm it in this part of the World, where ſome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56429:3"/>profeſſing the ſame Principle with us againſt the uſe of the carnal Sword, or other carnal Weapons, yet becauſe of their Office (ſome being Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) have paſſed Sentence of Death, and other corporal Puniſhment upon Offenders; and they could do no leſs to anſwer the Truſt of the Office they had taken unto them; and all rational men will judge, that a pair of Stocks, Whipping Poſt and Gallows, are carnal Weapons, as really as Sword or Gun, and ſo is a Conſtables Staff, when uſed, as hath been by ſome, to beat and knock down the Bodies of ſome obſtinate Perſons <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </gap>nd if Bodily Violence may be uſed by a Conſtable with his Staff againſt one, if that one get Ten to reſcue him from the Conſtable and his Aſſiſtance, this doth neceſſarily engage into a carnal way of Fighting in the purſuance of Juſtice againſt Offenders; for it is not the number being great or ſmall that makes a thing to be right or wrong: If it be a tranſgreſſion of Chriſts Command to raiſe 1000 men with Clubs, Swords and Guns to ſubdue &amp; bring under 1000 men that are unjuſt Purſuers and Invaders of other mens Properties and Liberties, it is by the ſame Reaſon to raiſe ten or five. And if any Invaſion by Gods permiſſion, ſhould happen by <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Indians</hi> againſt the Inhabitants in theſe parts, if any of us be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates at that time, they cannot diſcharge the truſt and duty that belongeth to them, as ſuch, without raiſing force of Arms againſt them; which would be a plain contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the former Teſtimony of our Friends; and to uſe any Violence to the Body of man, by any Bodily Force, is a Contradiction to that great and Goſpel Promiſe, <hi>They ſhall beat their Swords into Plo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56429:3"/>of way concerned in any part of Office-bearing in worldly Government or Execution of Juſtice, that toucheth the Body or Life of Man, by any corporal Puniſhment, ſo more eſpecially to ſuch it is moſt improper and unbecoming, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="7+ letters">

            <p>But to prevent all occaſion of miſtakes or offence, we do ſolemnly declare our perſwaſion, That we really believe, and are perſwaded, that Magiſtracy and Worldly Government is an Ordinance of God, and every Magiſtrate, lawfully called to his Office, is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil, and that he beareth not the Sword in vain, the which Sword is the Sword of Juſtice, that ought to be drawn to puniſh Offenders with corporal Puniſhment, greater or ſmaller, according to the nature of the Offence, <hi>Knowing</hi> (Tim. 1.9.) <hi>that the Law is not made for a Righteous Man, but for the Lawleſs and Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, &amp;c.</hi> And alſo, we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d ſincerely believe and declare, according to our ſincere Faith and Perſwaſion, That every
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56429:4"/>one profeſſing <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ought to be ſubject to all lawfull Commands of the Magiſtrate, as all ſuch are that neither contradict any of the Laws of God, teſtified and recorded in the holy Scriptures, nor incroach upon the true Liberty of Conſcience in things pertaining to the Worſhip of God; and that this Subjection to the Magiſtrate, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ought to be given by all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> from the higheſt to the loweſt degree in the Truth, <hi>not only for Wrath, but for Conſcience ſake;</hi> and that it is well conſiſtent with the higheſt degree and growth in <hi>Chriſtianty,</hi> to give all due ſubjection to the Magiſtrate in all lawful things, whether the Magiſtrate be <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſo called, or by any other Name. Yet notwithſtanding, we judge that the bearing Office in any Worldly Government of Magiſtracy, doth not belong to the perfect and clear Diſpenſation and Miniſtration of the Spirit, under the clear Goſpel Day of Chriſt that is dawned amongſt us, after the long dark Night of Apoſtacy. And before the dark Night of Apoſtacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, the clear Goſpel and perfect Day of Chriſt, and clear Goſpel Diſpenſation and Miniſtration of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of Chriſt did ſhine in great Glory from the time immediately after Chriſts Aſcention and giving the holy Ghoſt, during which time of the clear Goſpel and perfect Day of Chriſt, we find not that any ſincere <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did bear the Office of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate under Kings or Princes of this World, until the Night of Apoſtacy came upon the generality of Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> the which Night came gradually upon them, and not all at once; and in this Night of Darkneſs there hath been a great Mixture of Truth and Error, as well as of Law and Goſpel, that hath had place among the general ſort of Profeſſors, and many or moſt that have been called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that have had a meaſure of ſincerity &amp; integrity,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56429:4"/>have been more of a legal or Law Spirit than of a Goſpel Spirit, and have been rather under the firſt Miniſtration of the Spirit than under the ſecond, in great part. And Wars, even in caſe of Defence, and Worldly Government belong to the firſt Miniſtration of the Spirit, that is of the Law, common to pious <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and many called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but are not proper, nor belonging to the ſecond Miniſtration of the Spirit, that brings to perfection in the <hi>Chriſtian Life</hi> and <hi>Vertues;</hi> Therefore we caution and exhort all, who have the perfect Life and State of Chriſtianity, and the Virtues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2+ letters">

            <p>Object. 1.

            <p>To this we anſwer, <hi>firſt,</hi> Men ought not to do evil that good may come of it, ſeeing Chriſt hath commanded his Diſciples, <hi>Not to exerciſe Lordſhip or Worldly Authority over men;</hi> they muſt regard his Commandment, hoping that all will be turned unto good to them that fear and love God.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> There may be found men that are more fitted and qualified for Worldly Government, to adminiſter Juſtice in partially, than the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> becauſe they may be more knowing and expert in the Laws, and may be men of a juſt Principle, in whom the juſt Principle of Truth may in good meaſure rule, though they be not of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, nor of our Faith or Perſwaſion in many things; for there are juſt men that may be found, and have been found amongſt thoſe called <hi>Heathens</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and why not much rather amongſt the lower Profeſſions in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who though they are not come clearly to the ſecond Miniſtration of the Spirit, yet may be under the firſt Miniſtration thereof, and may be both juſt men, and better skilled in the Laws than them called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and therefore more qualified for bearing Office in Worldly Government. And as concerning Perſecution and Cruelty, there is a hand of God in ſuffering thoſe things, when they come, either for the ſins of the People, or to try their Faith and Patience, and for the exerciſe of their <hi>Chriſtian Virtues;</hi> and if Perſecution and Cruelty be uſed or Injuſtice done to any, it is more tolerable that others be the Inſtruments of it, than any called <hi>Quakers;</hi> for if any called <hi>Quakers</hi> do any unjuſt thing, it is a great Reflection upon the whole Profeſſion; but if none of them have any Office in the Government, and any thing be done amiſs therein, they will not be chargeable with it. But we hope none will conſtrue our ſence or intention, as if we deſired Perſecution to come either upon us, or any others; for we do judge and eſteem, that outward peace, quiet and freedom from Perſecution is a great mercy and bleſſing of God, which we deſire to bleſs God for, and all his other Mercies; and our Prayer to God is that none may abuſe their outward Liberty, but that it may be bleſſed to them,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56429:5"/>and that they may uſe it to Gods Glory, and their Souls peace and proſperity in the Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. And if any further Objections be made againſt this Poſition, we may conclude they are ſuch as can be made againſt that poſition, <hi>That under the pure Goſpel Diſpenſation we are not to war nor fight with carnal Weapons;</hi> which our Friends have plainly witneſſed againſt; nor will this poſition give any just cauſe of Offence to ſuperiour Magiſtrates, but rather it will give them great Satisfaction, to find us a people that are no wiſe ambitious of Worldly Government, and wholly principled to be ſubject to their Authority in all things, either actively or paſſively: By this means all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of jealouſie or diſtruſt will be removed from them, after they have good tryal of us, by finding us conſtant to our Principle, that they can be in no danger by us, of being guilty of any Plots or Conſpiracies againſt the Government; and it can give as little cauſe of offence to inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, becauſe men commonly deſire places of Office in Magiſtracy and Government, and if all of our Profeſſion refuſe ſuch Places and Offices, this will the more oblige them, by their having the more ready opportunity to have their minds anſwered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. But if any further object, <hi>What if one that is a Magiſtrate be convinced and perſwaded to be of our Way, muſt he leave off being a Magiſtrate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this it is eaſily anſwered, If he be really convinced and perſwaded by the Spirit of God to be of our way, the ſame. Spirit that hath convinced him of the Truth of our Way in other things, will convince him of the Truth of it in that alſo; and if ſo, he will freely and willingly deſire to lay down his former Power as a Magiſtrate, to receive greater Power and Honour to be a Diſciple and Follower of Chriſt, who
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56429:6"/>ſaid, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World;</hi> and as his Kingdom is not of this World, ſo nor will ours be, if we be faithful Followers of him. Nor is this to unchriſtian all others who are Magiſtrates, or may not be of our mind in this caſe; for we diſtinguiſh betwixt the firſt and ſecond Miniſtration of the Spirit, and betwixt the preſent <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> that many have, as it is partly Legal and partly Evangelical. And to ſuch who aim to arrive to this degree, it may be ſaid, If thou wilt be perfect leave the Worldly Government, and follow Chriſt, in order to attain the deſired Perfection; for as there are higher and lower degrees in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſo it may be more tolerable or excuſable to one in his lower degree, that Teeth no further, and is not convinced of any further diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, than to another that ſeeth further, and hath a further and clearer Diſcovery. And far be it from us to judge men no <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that ſee nor equally into all things pertaining either to the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> or <hi>Practice,</hi> provided they hold the Head, and build on the true Foundation, which is Chriſt Jeſus, and have Faith in him, by the help of his Spirit in us, <hi>as he dyed for our Sins and roſe again for our Juſtification,</hi> who is at the right Hand of God, and alſo maketh Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us, and hold the moſt neceſſary and Fundamental Principles of <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> and obey the Commands of Chriſt in ſo far as they are convinced of them, we ought in Charity to allow them to be our <hi>Chriſtian Brethren</hi> in general, (yet not of our particular Fellowſhip or Society) tho' in ſome things we differ from them, having further diſcoveries of Light into ſpiritual things and myſteries, as particularly in the caſe of <hi>Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Fighting,</hi> or uſing the outward Weapon in Self-defence, and in the caſe of <hi>Paying Tythes</hi> to uphold a Worldly Miniſtry. It is generally confeſſed by the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that to <hi>Swear</hi> or <hi>pay Tythes</hi> are ſhort of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56429:6"/>
               <hi>Christian Perfection,</hi> and ought not to be done, and yet they are more Charitable than to judge, that no man is in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> that doth <hi>Swear</hi> or <hi>pay Tythes,</hi> or contribute to a Worldly Miniſtry, becauſe there are many yet ſee not the evil of thoſe things, and yet in other things are conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious, and endeavour to walk in faithfulneſs to what they know. And as Charity ought to be extended unto them who <hi>Swear</hi> and <hi>pay Tythes,</hi> if they ſee no further, and do not willfully ſhut their Eyes againſt a further diſcovery, ſo the like Charity may be extended to them who may be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Wars or Government, if they do not ſee into it, that it belongeth not to the <hi>Perfect Diſpenſation of Chriſtianity.</hi>

            <p>IT is well known that the deſpiſed People of God, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have been great Sufferers for their Teſtimony againſt <hi>Swearing</hi> in any caſe, ſome by long and cloſe Impriſonments, and others by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the Sentence of Praemunire, to the looſing their Eſtates, and remaining Priſoners during Life, and others have ſuſtained great loſſes and damages for want of taking of Oathes in Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby they could not clear the Titles of their Lands, nor prove their Debts, and thereby have loſt them; and many Books have been writ and publiſhed by the ſaid People againſt Swearing in any caſe, particularly that called, <hi>A Treatiſe of Oathes, containing ſeveral weighty Reaſons why the People called</hi> Quakers <hi>refuſe to Swear, and thoſe confirmed by numerous Teſtimonies out of</hi> Gentiles, Jews <hi>and</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56429:7"/>Chriſtians, <hi>both Fathers, Doctors and Martyrs. Preſented to the King and Parliament in the Year</hi> 1675. and ſubſcribed on the behalf of the reſt of our Friends, by <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and twelve more. Now we being, and deſiring to remain in Unity with our faithful Friends, and with their living &amp; faithful Chriſtian Teſtimony againſt Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any caſe, do hold ourſelves obliged to maintain and ſtand up for the ſaid Teſtimony, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.54. <hi>But I ſay unto you, Swear not at all.</hi> and <hi>James</hi> 5.22. <hi>Above all things, my Brethren, Swear not.</hi> Therefore we declare unto all People, that we cannot for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience fake take an Oath, or tender it to any other, neither in the form as uſed in <hi>England,</hi> by kiſſing the Bible, nor are we free in our Conſcience to take that manner of Atteſtation as uſed here in <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania,</hi> when adminiſtred in their Courts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> viz. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſolemnly declare in the Preſence of God and this Court, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe to ſay, <hi>I do ſolemnly declare in the Preſence of God,</hi> is a calling upon God to be Witneſs to the truth of the Teſtimony given, which we look upon to be no leſs than a preſumptuous Tempting of God to ſummon him as a Witneſs, not only to our Terrene, but Trivial Buſineſſes, as W.P. &amp;c. hath expreſly ſaid in that before-cited Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, pag. 17. with which we do cordially agree. But to the grief of our Souls we may ſay, ſuch Darkneſs, Ignorance and Apoſtacy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth the hearts of many of thoſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> here in <hi>Pennſilvania,</hi> that they are frequently found in the aforeſaid Practices, and do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſe Arguments in the defence thereof; therefore we can do no leſs than to give forth this our Chriſtian Teſtimony againſt <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Fighting</hi> in any caſe, as above, hoping the Lord will be with us, and preſerve us, and enable us to ſtand faithful in the aforeſaid Teſtimony, whatever Tryals, Sufferings, Loſſes and Temptations may attend us for the ſame.</p>
