            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT's unto you, into whoſe Orders I am now Admitted, and by whom I am Owned, ſince the <hi>Quakers</hi> have denied me, that I make my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the <hi>Quakers</hi>; that caſt on me ſuch Aſperſions, that its evident and demonſtrable out of my Books, what I have ſaid of you, as theſe following evince, <hi>viz.</hi> That you Ran, and the Lord never ſent you; and that you were Covetous and Ambitious, ſeeking how to pleaſe Men, for your own Ends; and it's true, That I cried againſt your <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and your <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,</hi> ſaying, They are the <hi>Stews of Antichriſt,</hi> out of which comes your ignorant, profane, ſcandalous <hi>Miniſtry</hi>; and that the Generality of you have not the True Faith; and that in proceſs of Time, your <hi>whole Miniſtry</hi> will conſiſt of ungodly Men; the Wicked being ſtill preferr'd by the Wicked: And ſo, they ſay, I am preferr'd among the reſt; and by contrivance and deſign, now I am ſo Old, as to have ſo much Natural Wit, as to ſee I muſt make ſome ſhift how to live; having caſt my ſelf out from among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſeeing it is the far eaſieſt of many or moſt Trades, to be a Preacher, to get Money, and become one of the Man-made Miniſtry, where All is done for Money: Therefore, <hi>Learned Brethren,</hi> I come among you; for you know, <hi>No Money, No Preaching</hi>; as the Old Proverb is, <hi>No Penny, No Pater Noſter.</hi> And the <hi>vile Quakers</hi> ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me in theſe, and other matters of Truth, by ſaying, You (and I may now ſay, We, <hi>Brethren</hi>) Preach not Chriſt; but ſay contrary, That is not Chriſt which convinceth every Man of his ſins, and tells him all that ever he did; it is but a Humane Principle, and not Divine: And to Read Set-Forms of Prayers out of a Book, which to read, whether in private or publick, and call that Reading <hi>Prayer,</hi> is not (I affirm) any part of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Worſhip; neither was it known in the Church, either in <hi>Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> or <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Time, who lived above 300 Years after Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:32775:3"/>And, <hi>Learned Brethren,</hi> theſe <hi>Heathens,</hi> as I call the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in my late Sheet, Reproach me with another thing that I ſaid of them, whilſt I was one of them, concerning ſuch as you (and I) that now oppugn the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> with <hi>groſs</hi> and <hi>horrid Lyes,</hi> and <hi>falſe Calumnies,</hi> and <hi>meer Abuſes,</hi> like unto the ways that ever the <hi>worſt</hi> of the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> of Truth have uſed againſt the <hi>True Witneſſes</hi> of it; and yet ſaid I, It never yet hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, nor never will, that the Religion profeſſed by the ſincere and faithful People, called in ſcorn <hi>Quakers,</hi> is either <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> or any other thing than <hi>Real Chriſtianity</hi>; and notwithſtanding I have ſo ſaid, I do Retract, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own, and Deny whatſoever is to be found in any of my Books, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Holy Scriptures. Yet theſe Heathens, <hi>Learned Brethren,</hi> do not forbear to Reproach me with what I have truly ſaid, concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments Chriſt hath ordained in his Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Two only, as generally neceſſary to Salvation, as we profeſs; that is to ſay, <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord. Viz.</hi> As for <hi>Infants Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Sprinkling</hi> a Child of <hi>Eight Days</hi> Old more or leſs, on the Forehead, and call it <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> I ſaid hath no footing in all the Scripture, neither of <hi>Precept</hi> nor <hi>Practice</hi>; neither was it in uſe for an Hundred Years and more after the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days, among <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>; and that we cannot <hi>Prove</hi> it, altho' we <hi>Practice</hi> it, and get Money by it, but do it by a <hi>bare Imitation,</hi> and a <hi>meer pretended Call,</hi> which is great <hi>Preſumption,</hi> yea, <hi>Superſtition</hi>; altho' we call it <hi>Chriſt's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> and ſay, <hi>It's Commanded by Chriſt</hi>; yet he hath given us no <hi>Command</hi>; but we ſet up the <hi>Commandments of Men</hi> in the Room of <hi>God's Commands,</hi> like the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> as they ſhew in their late Sheet, entituled, <hi>The Chriſtianity of the People called Quakers aſſerted by</hi> (me) <hi>George Keith</hi>; and in their Book, called <hi>The Creed-Forgers detected,</hi> they ſhew, that I ſaid, <hi>Tertullian</hi> was againſt <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> and that we cannot (as true it is) give any Evidence in <hi>Church-Hiſtory,</hi> that Chriſt commanded thoſe Words to be uſed, which we uſe in <hi>Baptiſm</hi>; and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> is againſt us in this Caſe; and that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24. proves no Inſtitution of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> at all; and that we, <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Brethren,</hi> own (as you know we do) and acknowledge, that there is no abſolute neceſſity of uſing that called the <hi>Supper,</hi> ſo as that none can be <hi>Saved,</hi> but ſuch that partake of it: And that whatever Outward thing God Commands, brings along with them a <hi>real Advantage</hi> to Men's Souls; and you know, we hold this to be an <hi>Outward thing,</hi> and <hi>Viſible Sign.</hi> And for my part, <hi>I ſtill adhere,</hi> as I ſaid in my Retractations, <hi>to my former Advice, that nothing be required by one ſort (i.e.</hi> by us, or any others) <hi>from another, as an Article of Faith, or Doctrine, in common to be Believed, but what is expreſly delivered in the Scriptures, in plain expreſs Scripture-Terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>Learned Brethren,</hi> you know, we hold the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, or Doctrine, to be believed; and yet cannot we prove it by what is expreſly delivered in the Scripture, in <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>expreſs</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Terms. What, <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſhall I do with this <hi>Gang</hi> of <hi>Quakers?</hi> Altho'
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32775:4"/>
I charge them not either upon the <hi>Generality</hi> (pray mind that) far leſs the <hi>Univerſality</hi> of all them called <hi>Quakers</hi>; yet I muſt confeſs, I have <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> ſaid in my late Sheet, That I have proved the <hi>Quakers</hi> (without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception) <hi>Heathens</hi>; notwithſtanding thoſe that have but a little ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may <hi>eaſily find,</hi> I do not contradict my ſelf in any thing, nor do I continue to hold palpable Contradictions; for I have declared in <hi>Print,</hi> Thoſe that continue to hold <hi>palpable Contradictions,</hi> all <hi>Ingenious</hi> Perſons will conclude great <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> for none but <hi>ſtark Mad</hi> and <hi>Crazed</hi> in their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, will hold perfect <hi>Contradictions,</hi> for what I hold is agreeable to Holy Scripture; therefore theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> that I have charged with the Gangreen of their Vile and Groſs Errors and Hereſie, that is, a Complex of the worſe ſort of Errors and Hereſies, Demand of me to prove by <hi>plain</hi> Scripture, and in <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Expreſs</hi> Scripture Terms, that the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Infants,</hi> and <hi>Signing</hi> them with the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>the Lord's Supper,</hi> as uſed by us, and our ſet Forms of Prayer, and our taking Tythes, and pleading for the Divine Right thereof, and our requiring they ſhould be paid to us (the Miniſters of the Nation) as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, and that as ſuch we ſhould receive Tythes and Stipends; to <hi>prove</hi> all this, and much more, from <hi>plain</hi> Scripture, and in <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>expreſs</hi> Scripture Terms, they do demand; becauſe I ſtill ſay, <hi>I adhere to my former Teſtimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, If I believe theſe things to be <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> to be believed, and many other things that we Hold and Practice; theſe Quakers would have plain Scripture for all ſuch things, and in <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>expreſs</hi> Scripture Terms they would have it <hi>proved</hi>; is not this unreaſonable, <hi>Brethren?</hi> I have indeed declared, in publick Print, That <hi>I have been above 30 Years among the Quakers</hi>; and ſince I left them, have publiſh'd to the World, that <hi>I Reverence Divine Providence that I became a Quaker:</hi> And have <hi>Affirmed,</hi> That they held the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Doctrines,</hi> and that <hi>I knew</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> and their <hi>Principles,</hi> having <hi>been Converſant with them in their publick Meetings,</hi> as well as <hi>private Diſcourſes, with the moſt noted and eſteemed amongſt them for 30 Years; yet have ſaid,</hi> to <hi>Excuſe</hi> my ſelf ſince I left them, <hi>If I had known they had ſuch Errors among them, I would as ſoon have put my Head in the Fire, as have owned them</hi>: Yet in my <hi>Retractations,</hi> I declare, <hi>I am of the ſame Faith as I have been above 30 Years. Thus they ſay,</hi> I ſay and unſay, and pretend Ignorance when I well knew, and <hi>vindicated</hi> thoſe <hi>Doctrines ſtoutly,</hi> and in the Name of the Lord, which I now chargeas <hi>Errors</hi> upon them, <hi>many</hi> of which were writ before I was a Quaker; and therefore as to my pretence, <hi>that if I had known the Quakers had ſuch Errors, I would as ſoon have put my Head in the Fire, as have own'd them</hi>; which the Quakers eſteem an idle Story, for they will not believe I was ſo Ignorant, as not to know them, becauſe I vindicated them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they account there is no need for me to put my Head in the Fire, becauſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32775:4"/>
they think me too <hi>hot-headed already</hi>; and that if what I have ſaid be true, That I <hi>am</hi> of the ſame <hi>Faith ſtill,</hi> that I was when a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and that I have been for above 30 <hi>Years</hi> paſt; then I muſt be a <hi>Quaker ſtill</hi>; and if I never was a <hi>Quaker,</hi> then they pretend they do not underſtand what reaſon I had to publiſh to the World, <hi>That I reverence divine Providence that I became a Quaker</hi>; thus they reflect upon me, and endeavour to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me in <hi>palpable Contradiction,</hi> and to ſhew that by my own Saying, I <hi>prove</hi> I am an <hi>Apoſtate, a great Hypocrite, Crazed in my Underſtanding, and ſtark Mad:</hi> But, <hi>Learned Brethren,</hi> ſeeing I meet with theſe things, I make my Complaint to you, to whoſe <hi>Service,</hi> for my <hi>Wages, Stipend,</hi> or <hi>Reward,</hi> I am now Devoted.</p>
            <p>And I ſay, and do what I can, by calling the Quakers <hi>Heathens, Deiſts</hi>; their <hi>Divinity,</hi> mad Divinity; their <hi>Religion,</hi> the Religion of <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate</hi>; and render them <hi>Stoicks, Platoniſts,</hi> and what not; and aſſert I have proved them <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> telling them in my late Sheet, That I think not at preſent to take particular Notice of the Pamphlets which charge me with ſome Paſſages in my former Books, particularly the <hi>Account of a National Church,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Animadverſions</hi> thereon, the <hi>Portraiture of</hi> G.
