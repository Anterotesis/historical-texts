            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>To Our <hi>Lyon</hi> King at Arms, and his Brethren Heraulds, Macers, or Meſſengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly and ſeverally ſpecially conſtitute, Greeting:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>We being fully and by legal Proofs aſſured of the late Horrid and Bloody Murther committed upon <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, being the Third Day of <hi>May</hi> inſtant, by Ten or Eleven Fanatick and Execrable Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, upon the Perſon of the moſt Reverend Father in GOD, <hi>JAMES</hi> late Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> Primate of all <hi>Scotland;</hi> which Barbarous and Inhumane Aſſaſſination will (we doubt not) ſpread Horrour and Amazement in the Hearts of ſuch as believe that there is a GOD, or a Chriſtian Religion; A Cruelty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Barbarity of Pagans and Heathens, amongſt whom the Officers and Miniſters of Religion are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be Sacred, and are by the reſpect born to a Deity whom they Adore, ſecured againſt all ſuch Bloody and Execrable Attempts; A Cruelty exceeding the belief of all true Proteſtants, whoſe Churches have juſtly Stigmatized with the Marks of Impiety all ſuch as defile with Blood thoſe Hands which they ought to hold up to Heaven; and a Cruelty equal to any with which we can reproach the Enemies of this True and Reformed Church! By which alſo not only the Principles of Humane Society, but our Authority and Government (the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> being one of Our Privy Council) is highly violated, and Example and Incouragement given for Murthering all ſuch as ſerve Us faithfully according to the Preſcript of Our Laws and Royal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: Daily Inſtances whereof We are to expect whilſt Field-Conventicles, thoſe Rendezvouſes of Rebellion, and Forgers of all Bloody and Jeſuitical Principles, are ſo frequented and followed, to the ſcandal of all Government, and the Contempt of Our Laws; and which Murther is as far as is poſſible rendered yet more deteſtable by the unmasked Boldneſs of ſuch as durſt openly with bare Faces in the midſt of Our Kingdom, at Mid-day aſſemble themſelves together, to Kill in Our High-Way the Primate of Our Kingdom, and one of Our Privy Council, by ſo many Strokes and Shots, as left his Body as it were but one Wound, and many of which being given after they knew he was Dead, were remarkable Proofs they were acted by a Spirit of Helliſh and Inſatiable Cruelty:</p>
            <p>Have therefore, with Advice of Our Privy Council, thought ſit hereby to Command and Charge all Sheriffs, Stewards, Bayliffs of Regalities and Bayliaries, and their Deputies, Magiſtrates of Burghs, and Officers of Our Standing Forces, to Search, Seek, Take, and Apprehend the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Guilty of the ſaid Horrid Murder, or any Suſpected by them, until they be brought to Juſtice; and all our good and faithful Subjects to concur in the Taking and Securing (as far as is in their power) thoſe Aſſaſſinates. And in reſpect there is a Company of vagrant and skulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ruffians, who, to the great Contempt of all Government, do Ride through this Our Kingdom, Killing Our Soldiers, Deforcing ſuch as put Our Laws in Execution, and Committing ſuch Horrible Murders, who might be eaſily Diſcovered, if all ſuch, amongſt whom they Converſe, did, according to their Duty, endeavor to Apprehend them, or give Notice of their Reſidence. We have therefore thought fit, Conform to the 144 Act of Parliament 12, King <hi>James</hi> 6. to Command and Charge all Our Subjects, that whenever any unknown Men or Vagabonds happen to repair amongſt them, That they with all poſſible ſpeed Certifie any of Our Privy Council, Officers of Our Forces, or any having Truſt under Us thereof; With Certification to them, That if they omit the ſame, they ſhall be puniſhed with all Rigor, Conform to the ſaid Act. And ſince ſeveral of the ſaid Aſſaſſinates are known to have been Tenants in the Shire of <hi>Fiffe,</hi> whoſe Faces will be known to ſuch of the Witneſſes as were preſent. We hereby Require and Command all the Heretors and Maſters of the ſaid Shire of <hi>Fiffe</hi> and <hi>Kinroſſe,</hi> to bring their Tenants, Cottars and Servants, living in the reſpective Presbyteries, upon the ſeveral days, and to the places following, <hi>viz.</hi> To St. <hi>Andrews, &amp;c.</hi> There to be ſeen by the ſaid Witneſſes, and to continue there until they be Examined; With Certification to ſuch of the ſaid Tenants, Cottars and Servants as ſhall be abſent, they ſhall be reputed as acceſſory to the ſaid Crime; And the Maſters, if they produce them not, or if hereafter they harbor any that ſhall not Compeer, they ſhall be reputed as Favorers of the ſaid Aſſaſſination; And whereas there are ſeveral Perſons under Caption and Intercommuning in the ſaid Shire for ſeveral Cauſes, and left Perſons, who are innocent, may be thereby debarred from appearing, We have thought fit hereby to ſiſt and ſuperſede all Execution upon any Letters of Caption or Intercommuning, or any other Warrant, for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Perſons for the ſpace of Forty eight hours, after the ſaid Diets of appearance. And to the end the ſaid cruel Murder may be the more eaſily diſcovered, We do hereby offer and give full aſſurance of our Indempnity to any one of the ſaid Aſſaſſinates, who ſhall diſcover his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, and ſuch as hounded them out, and preſent payment of the Sum of Ten Thouſand Merks to any who ſhall inform who were the ſaid Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinates, if upon his Information they, or any of them can be apprehended, that they may be brought to condign Puniſhment. And We Ordain theſe Preſents to be Printed and Publiſhed at the Market-Croſs of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and other Places needful.</p>
