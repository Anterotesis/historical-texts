            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>GOD and the KING.</head>
            <p>GOvernment, in general, is, the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Exerciſe of that Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which the Superiour hath over the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour; which, at the very inſtant of the Creation of the world, took beginning; For the very firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which God made, being inferiour to him both in Glory and Power, became ſubject unto his Guidance, Rule, and Government. And God, who is a God of Peace and Unity, to the end to eſtabliſh and preſerve peace and unity amongſt his Creatures of different Kinds and Natures, did by his Providence and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom create all their kinds in ſeveral Degrees of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority and Subordination, that as one kind did natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe a <hi>Rule,</hi> ſo the other might as naturally yield Submiſſion and Obedience. So that Government, being a word of Relation, neceſſarily requires a Correlatum, which is Subjection, the one not exiſting without the other. And therefore as Government is an undeniable Inſtitution of God (as in the Series of the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is moſt evident and clear, every Creature having a certain Rule Dominion, and Dependancy one of anoher) ſo Subjection or Obedience, being its neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Correlate, is as undeniably requiſite and neceſſary. For the wiſdom of God which ſaw the preſervation of the Univerſe, to have a neceſſary dependance upon the mutual peace and unity of theſe three ſeveral kinds of Creatures, <hi>(viz.</hi> the Angelical, Intellectual, and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41399:4"/>
Agents) whereof the Univerſe was compoſed, and that peace and unity to have the like dependancy upon their Order and Government, did likewiſe ſee it neceſſary that the ſame means ſhould have the ſame efficacy in the particulars of each of theſe three ſpecies, leſt confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in particulars ſhould produce the diſtruction of the ſpecies, and by conſequence of the Univerſe. For <note rend="inter">lib. de Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione in diſp. Servand.</note>moſt true is that Saying of <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Order is the Mother and preſerver of all things. Therefore the Lord did not terminate the influence of Order and Government in the ſpecies of any of the three ſeveral ſorts of Creatures, but did alſo originally conſtitute the particulars of each in different degrees of Superiority and ſubordination or ſubjection. As amongſt the holy Angels we find Arch-Angels, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 16. and, <hi>Jude</hi> v. 9. And amongſt the Devils <hi>Belzebub,</hi> the Prince of Devils, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 34. And the obedience of Angels (I mean not that of the whole ſpecies unto God, but their obedience unto one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) is ſtrongly intimated by Chriſt in the third Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Prayer (which he gave to all Chriſtians as a precept, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 11.) wherein we deſire that our obſervance of Gods Will here on earth, may be ſuch as the Angels perform in heaven: But our obſervance of Gods will is not terminated in the obedience of the ſpecies unto God, but further comprehends the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe duties, adhibited in the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment between Inferiours and Superiours, whether it be in political or paternal Government.</p>
            <p>And amongſt the natural Agents which by a natural inſtinct are dependant and ſubſervient one to another; as the Heavens to the Earth, the Earth and Heavens
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41399:4"/>
to the Plants and theſe three to Senſible Creatures; amongſt whom the Lyon is inveſted with a certain na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Power and Authority over the Beaſts of the field; the Eagles over the Fowles of the Air, and the Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than or Whale over the Fiſh of the Sea. And <hi>Jerome</hi> affirmeth the ſame order to be obſerved <note rend="inter">Ad ruſticum Monachum.</note>amongſt every particular Society of Senſible Creatures. The dumb beaſts and wild herds (faith he) do follow their Leaders; the Bees have their King, and the Cranes flye after one another like an Alphabet of Letters.</p>
            <p>But this Wiſdom and Providence of God in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Degrees of Superiority and Subordination amongſt the particulars of the immediate ſpecies of the Univerſe, is moſt manifeſt and perſpicuous in the ſpecies of the Rational Creatures. For God, in the very firſt beginning of the world inveſted <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 1. 26. not onely with the Rule and Dominion over all the other Creatures of the world, but likewiſe with a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Supremacy; not onely Oeconomical over the one created family in Paradiſe, but Political over a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety conſiſting of many families, which were to deſcend of <hi>Adam.</hi> For the ſame Law which commanded obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Parents did oblige all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this Monarchical obedience to <hi>Adam.</hi> Now although this Government be ſtyl'd moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paternal, becauſe all <hi>Adams</hi> Subjects could derive their Pedigree from the blood Royal; Yet is it the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame with that we term Regal. Therefore the Holy Ghoſt, to demonſtrate unto us that the name did not create any real difference between this Paternal and Regal Government, did afterwards in the Penning of the Decalogue, uſe onely the word, <hi>Father,</hi> to expreſs all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41399:5"/>
ſorts of Government. And this indeed is the ground of Monarchy: which, as a Learned Divine hath well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, is <hi>a Politick Government inſtituted and approved by God, conſiſting in the prudential Adminiſtration and Exerciſe of the Supreme Power and Authority of one Perſon over all other within the ſame Society, for the preſervation of Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in order to God's Glory, the Kings honour, and the Peoples welfare.</hi> Where we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Efficient cauſe of Monarchy.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The End or Final cauſe thereof,</p>
            <p>The Efficient cauſe of Monarchy, is, either Principal or Inſtrumental. The Principal Efficient cauſe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is God, by whom all <hi>Power</hi> is ordained, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. For God is the univerſal, principal, and primary Efficient cauſe of all things (ſin only excepted) <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 18. there we find a King of Gods own making, and His <hi>Regal Power</hi> of God's own Inſtitution. For <hi>Sem</hi> (alias <hi>Melchiſedec)</hi> was by Gods ſpecial Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance a Type of Chriſt, both in his <hi>Regal</hi> and <hi>Sacerdotal Office, Heb.</hi> 7. 12. And therefore is ſtiled by the Holy Ghoſt, the King of Righteouſneſs, and King of <hi>Salem,</hi> which is <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where this <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> raigned until <hi>Jacob</hi>'s time. And alſo ſeveral perſons receiv'd their Regal Inveſtiture from Gods immediate and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Conſignation, who had no other Title to that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Honour and Supremacy; as, <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 14. and <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſrael, Jeroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 30. <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. <hi>Kings</hi> over the ten Tribes; and amongſt the Heathens, <hi>Hazael,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 16. was made King of <hi>Syria</hi> by Gods particular appointment; and <hi>Cyrus, Iſa.</hi> 45. 1. who, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Heathen, is there called Gods Annointed, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41399:5"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be Objected. That when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> asked God for a King, He was very angry with them, and did declare his diſlike thereof by a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Thunder and Rain, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 18. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> To this I Anſwer; that God was not angry with the Peoples deſire of a King, as in relation to the Object of their deſire, <hi>viz.</hi> Monarchy, but rather was well pleaſed therewith, being the very Ordinance of God himſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 14, 15. and therefore was ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the people with the promiſe of a bleſſing, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. and further confirmed unto them by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own particular Election of another King, <hi>viz.</hi> King <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own heart: But as in relation to the end of their deſire, which was Idolatrous and ſinfull, laying the hopes of their deliverance, from thoſe preſſures under which they then groaned, upon the King, looking for deliverance from him, and not from God, He was angry with them; as God deolared unto <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me;</hi> Imputing more to the power of a King for their deliverance than unto my power, ſo forgetting me their Creator and Preſerver.</p>
            <p>And for the further manifeſtation of the Divine Right of Monarchy God was pleaſed to ſanctifie it with the Bleſſing of Divine preſcription. For Monarchy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo continued in his Poſterity ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively until the Flood; and after the Earth was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed, the Church was limited to <hi>Sem</hi> (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he Reigned till <hi>Jacob</hi> was fifty years of Age. Who went down to <hi>Egypt</hi> with all his poſterity, and there lived in Bondage and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, till God raiſed up <hi>Moſes</hi> their Monarch and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, by whoſe hand he delivered them, and after Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41399:6"/>
continued that Monarchical Rule over them (as is manifeſt in the holy Hiſtory of the <hi>Iſraelites)</hi> even from <hi>Moſes</hi> unto our Saviour Chriſt, King of Kings, and the true King of the <hi>Jewes, Matth.</hi> 2. 2. Except where their ſin and ingratitude made them incapable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the great bleſſings and favour of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Government, and brought that heavy curſe of Anarchy upon them. For whilſt there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in thoſe dayes every man did what was right in his own eyes, meaſuring their Actions by the Law of their own Luſts. All which enormities the Holy Ghoſt juſtly imputeth to the want of a King and Regal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Although they had their <hi>Synedrim</hi> and great Council amongſt them; Yet it pleaſed God in all their Captivities and Diſtreſſes during thoſe ſinful times wherein they wanted a King and <hi>Regal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to raiſe them up occaſional Judges and Monarchs for their occaſional deliverances; thereby to manifeſt to them the benefit of Monarchy, and how conducent <hi>Regal</hi> and Monarchical Government was to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſecurity and happineſs; God himſelf honouring this bleſſing of Monarchy with many gratious Pactions and promiſes, as to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. To <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. yea and to wicked <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. and Idolatrous <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. and therefore a token of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of that calling of Monarchy, as a natural gift and bleſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> requiſite to humane perfection, for the Lord did never thus directly declare his approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any curſe or privation of theſe bleſſings, which was an effect of ſin; nor of any calling which was grounded thereupon, ſuch as that Monkiſh mendicancy which is uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt to the young man in the Goſpel was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41399:6"/>
principally probatory; and all Chriſts promiſes made, either to him, or his Diſciples for remuneration of their piety, who forſake all for his ſake, relate primarily and properly to the love of Chriſt, and to ſuch diſvaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deſertions of worldly and natural gifts and bleſſings, onely Accidentally and in a Secundary ſenſe, when they come in competition with Chriſt, who is to be preferred above all other things whatſoever, although never ſo dear unto us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 25: But I ſay ſuch curſes and privations of Worldly and natural gifts and bleſſings were never directly and poſitively honoured with a Sanction of a remunerative promiſe, as Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy is in the prementioned Texts. And this I hope may ſuffice to evidence the Primary and principall cauſe of Monarchy, to be God alone. Now it reſts to ſpeak of the Secondary or Inſtrumental cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p>In Crowns as in all other (nay much more than in any other) Poſſeſſions, he that entreth not in by the door of Right and Juſtice is a Thief and a Robber whoſe intent is but to <hi>Rob</hi> and <hi>Steal,</hi> whereby to ſatisfie his own Ambition and Avarice, as the conſtant event hath manifeſted in all Uſurping Traitors, <hi>Abimelech, Abſalom, Baaſha, Zimri, Omri,</hi> and many others both Antient and Modern, as that Traitor the bane of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation <hi>O. Cromwell,</hi> whoſe wickedneſs (I fear) hath drawn thoſe National Judgements upon us, which ſince we have ſuffered: whoſe name (I call God to Record with me) when I remember, makes my fleſh tremble, ſtupifies all my ſenſes to think fleſh and blood ſhould be guilty of ſuch execrable Acts, the perpetration whereof Hell with all its damnable Crue ſcarcely could or ever did exceed. But the prodigious guilt of this Miſcreant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41399:7"/>
ſo much exceedeth the mild point of my pen, that in the further proceſs, I ſhould but leſſen my own reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſeem to favour that which is the fitteſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for the greateſt <hi>Satyre</hi> in the world.</p>
            <p>The inſtrumental cauſe of Monarchy, is the ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means which God makes uſe of, for the immediate collation of this Supremacy upon any man, whereby to Intitle him to the <hi>Regal Diadem,</hi> and that, either Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, when God doth declare his will by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary revelation, and that either for a bleſſing to his people, over whom he placeth him, by making him a Miniſter of his favours and mercies, or for the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Judgements for the puniſhment of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſins.</p>
            <p>Or Ordinary, when God doth advance a man to this <hi>Regal Dignity</hi> and Honour by thoſe ordinary wayes and means, which are conſtant <hi>Rules</hi> for us to judge of, whereby to acknowledge this Soveraignty and yeild our obedience; and this likewiſe either, when the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power is attained by thoſe ordinary wayes and means which are approved and warranted by the word of God, and the <hi>Rules of Reaſon and Equity:</hi> Or when the ſame is attained by Violence and Injuſtice, and ſuch curſed wayes and means, as are repugnant to the word of God, and the <hi>Rules of Juſtice and Equity.</hi> The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the former would be arrogant and impious; for the extraordinary wayes of God, are far above our Judgement, and further above our imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: God never intending ſuch for a preſident whereby to frame our Actions, but onely our Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions thereunto. And therefore I ſhall inſiſt upon thoſe ordinary wayes and means which are the rule of our Actions in this kind; which (as I have ſaid) is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41399:7"/>
Either when attained by violence and injuſtice, and repugnant to the word of God, and the <hi>Rules of Juſtice and Equity;</hi> which is called <hi>Vindicative:</hi> Or when it is attained by thoſe ordinary means which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and warranted by the word of God; and this is called <hi>Gratious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning which, there are two opinions, the one, propugned by ſome, that the Right of the <hi>Royal Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture</hi> pertaineth to the people. The other, and that moſt certainly, is imputed to <hi>Birthright</hi> and <hi>Hereditary</hi> Succeſſion. Their Arguments, whereupon they ground the former opinion, are, partly inſtantial, and partly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
            <p>The inſtances alleadged for the propugnation hereof, are the Inaugurations of thoſe Kings which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures mention, to be made or Annointed by the people; as <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 15. All the people of the Land came to <hi>Gilgal</hi> to make him King. And <hi>David</hi> whom all the men of <hi>Juda</hi> Annointed King at <hi>Hebron,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 4. And afterwards was Annointed King over <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Hebron</hi> by all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 3. And <hi>Solomon</hi> who was likewiſe Annointed by the people, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 20. And <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> whom the people made King, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 20. And <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> whom the people of the Land made King, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 21. And <hi>Jehoahas,</hi> who (although he was the ſecond Son of <hi>Joſhuah)</hi> was made King by the people in his fathers ſtead, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 20.</p>
            <p>The reaſon, they ground this opinion upon, is taken from that <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> principle, <hi>Honor eſt in honor ante, &amp; non in honorato.</hi> And therefore the honour (ſay they) and Submiſſion, which Kings receive, is originally in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41399:8"/>
people. And therefore they think it not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the people ſhould be obliged to give obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and yield honour to any perſon but him whom they think and judge worthy of it, and ſo manifeſt their Judgement of his worth, by their Election of him to be their King and Soveraign.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, they add St. <hi>Peters</hi> Teſtimony, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. who terms <hi>Regality</hi> an Ordinance of Man, which were falſe, if it did proceed from God, and not from the people; for then it were an ordinance of God and not of Man.</p>
            <p>Now from theſe grounds they deduce two damnable (becauſe Rebellious) Conſequences and Corollaries.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That though the King be <hi>Major ſingulis,</hi> yet he is <hi>Minor univerſis;</hi> and therefore that is no Rebellion, but duty in the people, to reſiſt and oppoſe the King, nay to depoſe and dethrone him, where the people judge it neceſſary in relation to the defence of their own ſafety.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the King doth receive and enjoy this honour onely by vertue of a ſtipulation or Covenant between himſelf and the people. And therefore if the King do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late this Covenant and break the Truſt repoſed in him by the people, by any acts which are deſtructive, <hi>ad Salutem populi,</hi> (whereof they preſuppoſe themſelves to be Judges:) that then the people are abſolved from their Allegiance grounded upon that Truſt and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and may Lawfully provide for their own ſafety and welfare, either by reſiſtance, depoſition, dethrone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any ſuch means as themſelves ſhall judge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto conducent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41399:8"/>
Now to confute this opinion concerning the Peoples Right and Power in this <hi>Regal Investiture,</hi> and in anſwer, to the Arguments alleadged for the propugnation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to thoſe damnable and execrable inferences grounded thereupon; we muſt know, that theſe acts of the People, mentioned in the premiſed inſtances of Scripture of making and Annointing Kings, are,</p>
            <p>Either acts of Homage and Duty, by way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement and teſtification of the Supremacy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Legally confirmed upon the perſon to whom theſe duties are performed; which in Scripture are expreſſed upon two ſeveral occaſions; The one, where God did confer this Supremacy and <hi>Regal</hi> Honour, by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary wayes and means, as in <hi>Saul, David, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> The other, where God uſed their means for the vindication of the Kings juſt Title againſt an Uſurper, as in <hi>Joas,</hi> whom <hi>Jehoida</hi> the Prieſt, and the Captaines, and the people crowned and annointed King in the Temple; reſtoring him to his juſt Rights which had been uſurped by his Grandmother <hi>Athaliah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 12, 13. And in <hi>Hoſiah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Amaziah</hi> whom the people reſtored to his juſt Power, which the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> (who ſlew his Father) had uſurped: And in both theſe caſes, the acts of the People are good and Lawful, and approved by God; being declared to be the will of God, upon the former occaſion, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily; upon the latter, ordinarily. And indeed is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the peoples neceſſitated aſſent and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of joy, for that bleſſing which God hath beſtowed upon them; and therefore bound to perform all acts of obedience and Loyalty to him ſo Inveſted, whereunto they do by this act of theirs ſilently and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41399:9"/>
implicitely promiſe and engage. And not by this act of theirs ſtipulating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or adding any Authority or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy to the perſon ſo inaugurated; as in thoſe inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if ſeverally and ſeriouſly conſidered, will appear: For, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 1. we find <hi>Saul,</hi> and that by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment (where the Text faith) hath not the Lord annointed thee to be Governour over his inheritance? as alſo <hi>David,</hi> who was Annointed King by <hi>Samuel,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods command, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 13. <hi>Solomon</hi> by <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc</hi> the Prieſt and <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 34. <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Ahijah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 30, 31. all which being performed by the immediate command of God, declaring his will and pleaſure concerning the advancement of them to their ſeveral Power and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence by Extraordinary Revelations, do evidence, the Right of Royal Inveſtiture, to pertain onely to God; <hi>by whom Kings Raign:</hi> And that, not onely when he doth ſo declare his will by thoſe Extraordinary means; but alſo, when that Power is attained by thoſe ordinary wayes and means, which are warranted by Gods word and the Rules of Reaſon and Equity; as in <hi>Joas</hi> whom <hi>Jehoida</hi> the Prieſt made King in purſuance to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God to his ſervant <hi>David</hi> that his houſe ſhould be eſtabliſhed for ever.</p>
            <p>Or elſe theſe acts of the people are acts of ſeeming Power or Authority, collating this Supremacy and <hi>Regal Power</hi> upon ſome perſon, who hath no other <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Title</hi> thereunto, neither of Birth-right, nor of Revelation from God; as upon <hi>Abſalom, Adonijah, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoadas, Judas, Theudas,</hi> and <hi>Barchozba,</hi> (who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and drew the people into Rebellion againſt the <hi>Roman Emperor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41399:9"/>
thoſe wars wherein <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Jewes were deſtroyed,) and theſe acts of the People are execrable, ſinful, and Rebellious, and ſo declared by Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereupon, for whereſoever the Scriptures men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the conſtitution of a King after this manner, you ſhall find that they likewiſe record (not onely the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the peoples endeavours, but alſo) that they were fruſtrated by ſome heavy and ſudden Judgements of God, both upon the Uſurper (whereby he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded from his undue honour) and the people, who preſume to confer that honour upon him without a warrant from God, and ſo by that means to obtrude a Deputy upon God of their own and not of Gods Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Whereof we have a lively inſtance in the madneſſe of the People of <hi>England</hi> in theſe late times, placing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth their (Lord Protector) by thoſe horrible ſins of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> and <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> not onely perpetrated againſt the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of our late dread Soveraign, but even againſt his Sacred and moſt <hi>Royal Perſon.</hi> O Heaven! O Earth! what ſatisfaction can be made for that Sacred blood, ſhed, to ſatiate the gluttonous and Sacrilegious luſt of Traytors and Rebells, who build up <hi>Sion</hi> with blood, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with iniquity? But ſurely God will avenge the blood of his Servant, crying (like the blood of <hi>Abel)</hi> for vengeance.</p>
            <p>Theſe acts of the people in Annointing of Kings are onely mentioned where ſome of theſe occaſions happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (that is) where there was an interruption of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means of conferring the Supremacy by birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and Hereditary Succeſſion; either by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Gods juſt Prerogative in the Advancement of ſome Perſon by Extraordinary and Immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41399:10"/>
or elſe by the uſurpation of ſome who had no right or Title at all, but Force and Violence, (either private of themſelves and ſome few partners, wherein God ſtirred up the people to vindicate the Kings right; or Publick of the people) but where the Supremacy and Soveraign Power (with all the Appendages) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended by Birthright; there is no mention at all made of the people; though the act of Duty and Homage was as neceſſary to be performed to all who enjoyed the Crown by Hereditary Succeſſion (as to <hi>Abijah, Aſa, Jehoſaphat, Jehoram,</hi> and the reſt, to whom the people were no leſs obedient and ſubject than to thoſe who were appointed by God) but I ſay in thoſe caſes, the peoples acts of Submiſſion and Homage are not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but preſuppoſed, as known acts of Duty to thoſe Kings who attained the Supremacy by thoſe ordinary and known means of Birthright. And how many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are there in Scripture of the inefficacy of the peoples endeavours in this kind, as in <hi>Aarons</hi> and the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> honouring and Proclaiming the Golden Calf, to be a God and Guide in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtead, yet did not that popular Election Legitimate that Calfes power and Title, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. And <hi>Abſalom</hi> was proclaimed King by all the thouſands of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet did not that act of the people Legitimate <hi>Abſaloms</hi> Title to the Crown. For the Holy Ghoſt termeth it a Conſpiracy when it was at the very height, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 12. <hi>Shcba</hi> had Ten Tribes for him, when <hi>David</hi> had but one, and yet was he never term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a King, but a man of Belial, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. <hi>Adonijah</hi> confeſſeth that (although the faces of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſet on him to make him King, yet) he never had any juſt Title or Right to the Kingdom; for the Lord had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41399:10"/>
it for his Brother <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 15. upon all which God manifeſted the guilt of their ſin, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe fearful judgements both upon the people and the Traitors ſo exalted.</p>
            <p>To the reaſon grounded upon that principle <hi>(quod honor eſt in honorante &amp; non in honorato)</hi> let it be premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; that honour involves a twofold relation: The one primarily and <hi>per ſe</hi> to that quality or excellency which is found in the perſon, for which he is honoured and eſteemed. The other ſecondarily and <hi>virtute prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> to the act of honour and eſtimation whereby we judge well of the perſon ſo and ſo qualified; and therefore all acts of honour in the ſecondary ſence are acts of duty, as being the effect of that qualification in the perſon ſo magnified and honoured. So that it is evident the honour and ſubmiſſion which the people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite to their King, even from this ground and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> are not acts of favour to be conferred and diſpoſed voluntarily at their own will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but acts of Duty, not onely morally, as the acts of honour in the premiſed principle meerly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates; but alſo by a Divine neceſſity, being thereto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by the Law of God. And therefore muſt be performed to ſuch, as God eſteems worthy of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be his Deputies; and not upon ſuch as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves judge worthy to be their Rulers: For you know the people are obliged to exhibite acts of honour and reverence to a Judge; but it doth not therefore follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the people make that man a Judge, but he is made ſuch by Letters Patents from the King, without asking any conſent from the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41399:11"/>
To <hi>St. Peters</hi> Teſtimony I anſwer, that the Apoſtles expreſſion there, relates to the ſubject of Soveraignty and Power, which is the King, and thoſe who are over us under him; As manifeſtly appears by the immediate fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words of the Text, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 13, 14. <hi>Submit your ſelves unto every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as Supreme or unto Governours as them that are ſent by him:</hi> (as if he had ſaid) Submit your ſelves to every Humane Power and Authority that God hath ſet over you, not onely to the King himſelf, but alſo to his Miniſters and Magiſtrates, although they are his Subjects as well as you: for there is no power but of God, and whoſoever reſiſteth the Power, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the Ordinance of God. And they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 13. But it doth not at all relate to the Original and Efficient cauſe of that Power, which is God, and neither King nor people.</p>
            <p>And now (I hope) the profanity of that former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of theirs is perſpicuous, appearing moſt damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble being directly contradictory to that expreſs Rule, which God himſelf hath preſcribed in this caſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil, neither agree in a controverſie to decline after many.</hi> Where God plainly declares that the univerſality of the offenders cannot legitimate the fault; as appears in the ſin in erecting the Golden Calf, and <hi>Abſaloms</hi> Conſpiracy. For though it be a Maxime in Policy, that <hi>Multitudo peccantium tollit peccatum</hi> (i. e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>Poenam peccati:</hi> and therefore in crimes of the blackeſt dye the offenders of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times eſcapes their due puniſhment. It is as true a Maxime in Divinity, that <hi>multitudo peccantium aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat peccatum</hi> (i. e.) <hi>culpam peccati;</hi> and the more I ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41399:11"/>
the more guilt I contract: Although the multitude of partakers may ſecure me from puniſhment, <hi>in foro judicii humani,</hi> yet I am ſure to receive the juſt reward of that ſin at Gods Tribunal; from which the whole Society of men and Devils, cannot ſecure me.</p>
            <p>But not to bind theſe nice Diſputants to an Argument of Conſcience (which indeed is ſcarce to be found amongſt them) to evince their error, let us conſider the abſurdity and ſenceleſneſs of their opinion both in Policy and Reaſon. For if the Major part of the people be Superiour to the King, then the Government is not Monarchical, but Democratical, every ſpecies of Policy deriving its Denomination and nature from thoſe that are Inveſted with the Supremacy: But that Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is the baſeſt kind of Policy (Confuſion and Deſtruction being the concluſion of ſuch a Government) both expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and the general conſent of all Politians do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and ſo aſſerted both by <hi>Jerome,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and even <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf (although a favourer of the Peoples Right, in appointing of their King and Monarck) <note n="*" rend="inter">Jerom. cap. <hi>1.</hi> ad Titum Ep. ad Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grium.</note>

               <hi>That a Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand;</hi> but every Democracy muſt neceſſarily divide a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom againſt it ſelf, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. That Democracy muſt neceſſary divide a Kingdom againſt it ſelf, is proved from another of Chriſts own Maximes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 24. <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters</hi> (much leſſe three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred maſters) but in every Democracy there are (at leaſt) two Maſters. And therefore no man can be a true Subject or ſervant in ſuch a Common-wealth; but (as Chriſt faith) muſt neceſſarily be factious, by loving one and hating all others, and adhering to one, and rebelling againſt others. And therefore it is obſerved, that in Chriſts time, when <hi>Eſay</hi> had propheſied, that there ſhould be an Univerſal peace over the whole Earth; that then, there was not any kind of Polarchy in any Kingdom in the world; becauſe in its own nature every Polarchy is inconſiſtent with Peace and Unity; the end and concluſion thereof being abſolute ruine and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (the common fate of all divided Kingdoms) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God in his mercy, prevent the ſame by the reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch a Government to a Monarchy; a manifeſt experience whereof we have both in the <hi>Athenian, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſan, Lacedemonian,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealths; whoſe Polarchical Diſſentions occaſioned many Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Wars and Tragical Conflicts, which in fine muſt neceſſarily have produced the ruine and deſolation of them all, if the opportune reducement of thoſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchies to a Monarchy had not prevented it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, every individual member of the ſame Society is obliged to exhibit acts of Obedience and Loyalty to their Lawful Prince (as the former part of this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe ſubtile Logicians intimate) allowing the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41399:12"/>
King to be <hi>Major ſingulis,</hi> but upon what grounds they deny his Authority <hi>in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſis,</hi> I leave to the Cenſure of every rational Judgement ſeriouſly conſidering this deduction, <hi>Peter</hi> is obliged to exhibit acts of obedience to his Prince, ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo <hi>John,</hi> and ſo every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual member of the ſame Society; <hi>Ergo,</hi> (according to that Logical Maxime, <hi>a particularibus ad univerſale valet conſequentia)</hi> they all in univerſal, are obliged to exhibit acts of Obedience to their King.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond Inference <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the King doth receive and enjoy this honour onely by vertue of a ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation or Covenant between himſelf and the people; and therefore if the King doth violate this Covenant, and break the Truſt repoſed in him by the people; that then the people are abſolved from their Allegiance, grounded upon that Truſt and Covenant, and may Lawfully provide for their own ſafety and welfare, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Reſiſtance, Depoſition, Dethronement, or any ſuch means as themſelves judge to be moſt conducent to their own ſecurity. To this I anſwer that this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (its true) implyeth a mutual engagement of the parties therein concern'd; but the parties primarily and originally concerned are, God upon the one party, and the people upon the other party, as <hi>Moſes</hi> declareth, when he reciteth that Original and general Covenant (which is indeed the ground of all other particular Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants) <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 4. maketh this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant a ground why people ſhould obey the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, not as the Kings, but as Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe Vicegerent the King is; for where the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41399:13"/>
               <hi>word of the King is there is power, and who ſhall ſay unto him what doeſt thou? for the Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the Rivers of water he turns it which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will,</hi> Prov. 21. 1. And therefore the King is onely the deputative party aſſigned by God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by him for the performance of the Covenant upon Gods part, either for a vengeance, or recompence to the people, as the Lord himſelf judgeth of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And though the King may ſpare the wicked and perſecute the Righteous even unto death, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did our Saviour, yet even in that the King doth but execute Gods Decrees, as the Holy Ghoſt doth declare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that unjuſt Judgement of <hi>Pilates, Acts</hi> 4. 28. for <hi>Pilate</hi> did nothing but what God had <hi>Determined before to be done, For every mans judgement is from the Lord, Prov.</hi> 29. 26. and not from the Judge or Ruler. So that (in a word) the King may do <hi>male</hi> (that is) a wrong to himſelf, (for which he is accountable to God) but he cannot do <hi>malum</hi> (that is, any wrong to us) by inflicting any thing upon us, which is not juſt and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our deſerts from God, whoſe place the King ſupplies in Judgement, which is the ground of <hi>Solomons</hi> aſſertion, that, <hi>The Kings lipps do pronounce Divine ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and that his mouth tranſgreſſeth not in Judgement, Proverbs</hi> 16. 10. Now therefore upon theſe grounds of <hi>Solomons</hi> it is manifeſt, that there is no ſence, why the people ſhould claim any power over the King by vertue of this Covenant.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe the King is not their Deputy, but Gods, and every man muſt accompt to him for his Actions, who doth conſtitute and depute him; as when the King doth depute a Judge for any Province or City, the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41399:13"/>
people under his Command have no power to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for any act which they conceive unjuſt, but either by Petition to that Judge, or elſe by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the King his Maſter, whoſe truſt all corrupt Judges do deceive, and not the Truſt of the people; for they receive not any Power or Authority from the people, but from the King: And in like manner the people for redreſs of their grievances from the Kings oppreſſions, muſt addreſs themſelves to the King by Petition, and if that prevail not, then to God by prayer, (who is the Kings ſole Lord and Maſter, and from whom he receives his Power, and whoſe Truſt all Tyrannical Kings break by acts of Injuſtice) which is the <hi>ultimum refugium,</hi> as <hi>Samuel</hi> declares when he Propheſieth of <hi>Sauls</hi> Tyranny, whereby the people ſhould be grievouſly oppreſſed; for redreſſe whereof the people (when the King would not hear) ſhould cry unto the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 18. other means of remedy than which, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Samuel</hi> did not dream of, nor could preſcribe to the people to make uſe of; and whereas if he had conceived reſiſtance to be Lawful, he might ſoon have found out that way, and have the people ſo to provide for their own ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe the people never receive Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice from the King, if they look upon themſelves; for the Judgment is the Lords, who cannot do inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, nor break the Covenant upon his part; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his Miniſter and Deputy may fail and offend in the execution of his Office in his own particular, which is his own guilt. As a Hangman that Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41399:14"/>
the juſt ſentence of death upon a Malefactor, if in doing his office, his intentions have not refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ſentence of Juſtice, but the ſatisfaction of ſome private grudge, or ſome Covetous Deſign or the like, that Officer is guilty of Murther, although the Malefactor receive from his hand nothing but his due deſerts. And thus much (I hope) ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the error and vanity of that opinion, that the peoples conſent and approbation, are the ordinary and inſtrumental means and cauſes of that Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and <hi>Soveraign Power,</hi> which doth Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence the Monarch above all others within the ſame Society.</p>
            <p>Now it reſts to ſpeak of that opinion, which (and that moſt certainly) imputeth the Secondary and Inſtrumental cauſe of Monarchy and <hi>Regal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> to Birth-right and Hereditary Succeſſion; the Efficacy whereof Holy Writ doth manifeſt, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminencing, the firſt born above all his Brethren in Honour and Poſſeſſions, as the Lord declared to <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4. 7. nor was it in the Fathers power, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for love or hatred, to alter the Law of the firſt born, and to tranſmit the Honour and Inheritance due to him, to his younger Brother, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 15. and in that ſtatute, which the Lord himſelf made, ordering the deſcent of honours and poſſeſſions, <hi>Num.</hi> 27. the Lord doth direct that they be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Birthright and Hereditary <hi>Succeſſion;</hi> and not by the <hi>Election</hi> or <hi>Diſcretion</hi> either of <hi>Moſes</hi> or the people.</p>
            <p>But more ſpecially to our Caſe, the Lord was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41399:14"/>
pleaſed to honour it with the promiſes of perpetuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Honours and Royal Dignities unto any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which were alwayes grounded upon the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the Royal Iſſue, in giving Sons that ſhould ſit upon the Throne, as appears in his promiſes to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 12. to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 4. to <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 30. and moſt manifeſtly upon <hi>Jacobs</hi> Propheſie, which upon this very ground Entailed the Crown and Scepter unto <hi>Judah,</hi> until <hi>Shiloe</hi> came, <hi>Gen,</hi> 49. 10.</p>
            <p>The performance of which gratious promiſe was executed in <hi>Abijam,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and <hi>Aſa</hi> him, <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> him, and <hi>Jehoram</hi> him, and ſo in the reſt, as the Sacred Chronicle doth at large relate, who all inherited the Crown by vertue of this Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, without the concurrence of any other cauſe or meancs. And this may ſuffice as touching that Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and ordinary means <hi>(viz.</hi> Gratious) whereby God doth advance a man to the Regal Diadem, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Honour, and which is a conſtant Rule for us to Judge of whereby to acknowledge this Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and yield our obedience.</p>
            <p>The other Inſtrumental means of this Supremacy, which creates a Right and Title to the Crown, is Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative, and that is Sword and Conqueſt, which the Lord declareth to be one of the ſevereſt and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt of his Curſes and Judgements upon a Nation, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 25. And the Lord ſtyled the victorious King of <hi>Aſſyria, Iſa.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>The Rod of his wrath,</hi> and <hi>ſtaffe of his Indignation;</hi> becauſe by his ſword he was reſolved to pour out the Vials of his fierce wrath upon the

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41399:16"/>
God in Electing of a King unto the people. And the like was uſed by the Eleven Apoſtles, when they had no warrant from God to Appoint or Elect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtle, nor durſt preſume to confer that High calling upon any man without a warrant from God, as you may read, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 23. So that in both thoſe caſes mentioned in this queſtion, we are to uſe the means of Lots; for that means is likewiſe warranted by God, where his will is not otherwiſe known and declared, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 33. but the peoples Election is abſolutely unlawful (as the premiſes, (I hope) have ſufficiently manifeſted) either in thoſe or any other caſes. And this of the Efficient Cauſes of Monarchy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Final Cauſes</hi> thereof, are, either Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, and that is Gods Glory and the Kings Honour; or leſs Principal, and that is, the Subjects welfare. The principal End of Monarchy is, either, (as the Schoolmen term it) <hi>Originans,</hi> which is Gods Glory; or <hi>Originatus,</hi> that is, the Kings Honour. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Original Principal End</hi> which is Gods Glory, it is to be underſtood that we do not ſpeak of it here in its extent and latitude, as it is the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal end of all things, but onely as it is limited to Monarchical Actions and Duties; in which ſence, Gods Honour and the Kings, are not really, but modally onely different, both of them conſiſting in the very ſame Duties, and are of the ſame Nature in reference to Monarchy. For all excellency, worth and goodneſs is radically and eſſentially in God, from whom is communicated <hi>Perſonae honoratae</hi> that worth and goodneſs for which he is honoured and eſteemed.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41399:16"/>
And therefore this Politick honour which Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences the Monarch above all others in the ſame So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, is that excellency which God communicates to him, enabling him for the execution of the Duties of his Calling, in the Rule and Government of his people and ſubjects; and with a Power to conſtitute and Enact Laws and Statutes for the Publick good, and benefit of the Common-wealth; and with power to execute the ſame Lawes, either by remunerating the integrity of pious and juſt men, according to the merits of their ſervice and obedience; or by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting and puniſhing the Delinquences of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and evil men: For a Seditious perſon ſeeketh onely evil, <hi>and a cruel meſſehger ſhall be ſent againſt him, Prov.</hi> 17. 11.</p>

               <p>Now as God did deligate unto Kings a Power over our perſons in his Ordinance, for their Primary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority; ſo did he likewiſe give them a Power over our <hi>Eſtates,</hi> for the Magnificent Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſupport of that Honour, which is their Secondary honour of Maintenance and Revenue: Which was the ground of Chriſts command, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 21. to render a Tribute of our Goods to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> intimating that this temporal honour of Tribute, was (by vertue of Gods Deligation) as due unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as the ſpiritual honour of Praiſe and Worſhip was unto God.
