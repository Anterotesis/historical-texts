         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

you, this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
had been confined to
the Auditory it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for: I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that is ſhould find
that Candor and favour
with every Reader, as it did with the
Hearers. When it muſt ſpeak to All, the
guilty will hear, and then it will gall. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
is patient in hearing a reproof, and
charitable in the interpretation; but Guilt
<pb facs="tcp:52141:6"/>
will ſmart and quarrel, and uſually
<hi>make</hi> a fault in him that <hi>findeth</hi> one in
them. Yet I confeſt this is but a poor ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
of his ſilence, that hath a Call to
ſpeak. Both my <hi>Calling</hi> and this <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
would condemn me, if on ſuch
grounds I ſhould draw back: But my Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs
was cauſed by the reaſon
which I then tendred your Lord-ſhip as my
excuſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe here is nothing but
what is common, and that it is in as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and homely a dreſs. And I hope we
need not fear that our labours are dead, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the Preſs ſhall give them life. We
bring not Sermons to Church, as we do a
Corps for a burial: If there be life in them,
and life in the Hearers, the connaturality
will cauſe ſuch an amicable cloſure, that
through the Reception, Retention, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the ſoul, they will be the immortal
ſeed of a life everlaſting. But yet ſeeing
the preſs hath a louder voice then mine,
and the matter in hand is of ſuch exceeding
neceſsity, I ſhall not refuſe upon ſuch an
<pb facs="tcp:52141:6"/>
invitation, to be a rememberancer to the
the world, of a Doctrine and duty of ſuch
high concernment: thongh they have heard
it never ſo oft before. Seeing therefore
I muſt preſent that now to your eyes, which I
lately preſented to your ears, I ſhall take the
boldneſs to add one word of Application in
this Epiſtle, which I thought not ſeaſonable
to mention in the firſt delivery; and that
ſhall be to your Lordſhip and all others in
your preſent caſe, that are elected members
of this expected Parliament. Be ſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the intereſt of your ſoveraign, the
great Lord Protector of Heaven and Earth:
And as ever you will make him a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
accompt of your Power, Abilities, and
Opportunities of ſerving him, ſee that you
prefer his intereſt before your <hi>own,</hi> or
any mans on earth. If you go not thither
as ſent by Him, with a firm reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſerve him firſt, you were better ſit
at home: forget not that he hath laid
claim to you, and to all that you have, and
all that you can have, and all that you can
<pb facs="tcp:52141:7"/>
do I am bold with all poſsible earneſtneſs, to
entreat you, yea as Chriſts Miniſter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
you, in his Name, to ſtudy and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
his buſineſs and intereſt; and ſee that it
have the chief place in all your conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Watch againſt the incroachments of
your own carnal intereſts, conſult not with
fleſh and blood, nor give it the hearing
when it ſhall offer you its advice. How ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly
will it inſinuate, how importunately
will it urge you, how certainly will it marr
all, if you do not conſtantly and reſolvedly
watch! O how hard, but now happy is it to
conquer this carnal <hi>ſelf:</hi> Remember ſtill
that you are <hi>not your own,</hi> that you have
an unſeen Maſter that muſt be pleaſed, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be diſpleaſed; and an unſeen Kingdom
to be obtained, and an inviſible ſoul that
<hi>muſt</hi> be ſaved, though all the world be loſt.
Fix your eye ſtill on him that made and
redeemed you, and upon the ultimate end of
your Chriſtian race; and do nothing wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
unworthy ſuch a Maſter, and ſuch an
end. Often renew your ſelf-reſignation,
<pb facs="tcp:52141:7"/>
and devote your ſelf to him; ſit cloſe at his
work, and be ſure that it be His, both in the
Matter, and in your Intent. If Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ſhould at any time ask, <hi>(Whoſe
work are you now doing?)</hi> or a man
ſhould pluck you by the ſleeve, and ſay, (Sir,
<hi>Whoſe Cauſe are you now pleading?)</hi>
See that you have the anſwer of a Chriſtian
at hand; delay not Gods work till you have
done your own, or any ones elſe: You'l beſt
ſecure the Common-wealth and your own
intereſt, by looking firſt to His. By negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
this, and being carnally wiſe, we have
wheel'd about ſo long in the Wilderneſs, and
loſt thoſe advantages againſt the Powers of
Darkneſs, which we know not whether we
ſhall ever recover again. It is the great
aſtoniſhment of ſober men, and not the leaſt
reproach that ever was caſt on our holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion,
to think with what a zeal for the
work of Chriſt, men ſeemed to be animated
in the beginning of our diſagreements; and
how deeply they did engage themſelves to
him in ſolemn Vows, Proteſtations, and
<pb facs="tcp:52141:8"/>
Covenants; &amp; what advantages carnal ſelf
hath ſince got, and turned the ſtream another
way! ſo that the ſame men have ſince been
the inſtruments of our calamity, in breaking
in pieces, and diſhonouring the Churches of
Chriſt; yea and gone ſo neer to the taking
down (as much as in them lay) the whole
Miniſtry that ſtand approved in the Land:
O do not by trifling, give advantage to the
Temper to deſtroy your work and you toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Take warning by the ſad experiences
of what is paſt; beſtir you ſpeedily and
vigoruoſly for Chriſt, as knowing your oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
and the ſhortneſs of your time: <hi>Bleſſed
is that ſervant whom his Lord when
he commeth ſhall find ſo doing.</hi> If
you ask me wherein his intereſt of Chriſt
doth conſiſt? I ſhall tell you but in a few
unqueſtionable particulars. 1. In the main,
that truth, godlineſs, and honeſty, be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
and encouraged, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries
by all fit means ſuppreſſed. 2. In
order to this, that unworthy men be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, and
<pb facs="tcp:52141:8"/>
the places ſupplyed with the fitteſt that can
be had. 3. That a competent maintenance
may be procured where it is wanting, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for Cities and great Towns, where more
Teachers are ſo neceſſary in ſome proportion
to the number of ſouls, and on which the
Country doth ſo much depend. Shall an age
of ſuch high pretences to Reformation, and
zeal for the Churches, alienate ſo much, and
then leave them deſtitute and ſay, It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be had? 4. That right means be uſed
with ſpeed and diligence, for the healing of
our diviſions, and the uniting of all the true
Churches of Chriſt (at leaſt in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and O that your endeavours might be
extended much further) to which end I
ſhall mention but theſe two means of moſt
evident neceſsity. 1. That there be one
ſcripture-Creed, or confeſsion of Faith,
agreed on by a general aſſembly of able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
duly and freely choſen hereunto,
which ſhall contain nothing but matter of
evident Neceſsity and Verity. This will
ſerve 1. For a Teſt to the Churches, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb facs="tcp:52141:9"/>
the ſound Profeſſors from the unſound
(as to their doctrine) and to know them
with whom they may cloſe as Brethren, and
whom they muſt reject. 2. For a Teſt to
the Magiſtrate, of the Orthodox to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
and of the intoller ably Heterodox,
which it ſeems is intended in the 37. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the late formed Government, where all
that will have liberty, muſt profeſs (faith
in God by Jeſus Chriſt) which in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſenſe muſt comprehend every true
fundamental, or Article of our faith: And,
no doubt, it is not the bare ſpeaking of thoſe
words, in an unchriſtian ſenſe that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.

of the neceſſary liberty of the Churches, to
meet by their Officers and Delegates on
all juſt occaſions, in aſſemblies ſmaller or
greater, (even National when it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary)

<pb facs="tcp:52141:9"/>
of the Churches is not like to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
I exclude not the Magiſtrates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
or overſight, to ſee that they do not
tranſgreſs their bounds. As you love
Chriſt, and his Church and Goſpel, and mens
ſouls, neglect not theſe unqueſtionable points
of his intereſt, and make them your firſt and
chiefeſt buſineſs, and let none be preferred
before him, till you know them to be of more
authority over you, and better friends to you
then Chriſt is. Should there by any among
you that cheriſh a ſecret Root of Infidelity,
after ſuch pretences to the pureſt Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and are zealous of Chriſt leſt he ſhould
over-top them, and do ſet up an intereſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with his ſoveraignty, &amp; thereupon
grow jealous of the liberties &amp; power of his
Miniſters, and of the unity and ſtrength of
his Church; and think it their beſt policy
to keep under his Miniſters, by hindering
them from the exerciſe of their office, and
to foment diviſions, and hinder our union,
that they may have parties ready to ſerve
their ends: I would not be in the Caſe of
<pb facs="tcp:52141:10"/>
ſuch men, when God ariſeth to judge them,
for all the Crowns and Kingdoms on earth!
If they ſtumble on this ſtone, it will break
them in pieces: but if it fall upon them, it
will grind them to powder. They may ſeem
to prevail againſt him a while when their
ſuppoſed ſucceſs is but a proſperous ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying:
but mark the end, when his wrath
is kindled, yea, but a little: and when theſe
his enemies that would not he ſhould raign
over them, are brought forth and deſtroyed
before him, then they will be convineed of
the folly of their Rebellon: in the mean
time let wiſdom be juſtified of her Children.</p>

life of the ſuperſtructure. Like
the Vitals and Naturals in the
body, which are firſt neceſſary
for themſelves, and then alſo for
the quickning and nouriſhing of
the reſt: there being no life or growth of the
inferiour parts, but what they do receive from
the powers of theſe; its but a dead diſcourſe
which is not animated by theſe greater Truths,
what ever the bulk of its materials may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52141:11"/>
of. The frequent repetition therefore of
theſe, is an excuſable as frequent preaching.
And they that nauſeate it as loathſome batto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,
do love Novelty better then Verity, and
playing with words to pleaſe the fancy, rather
then cloſing with Chriſt to ſave the ſoul. And
as it is the chief part of the cure in moſt exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
maladies to corroborate the vital and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
powers, which then will do the work
themſelves; ſo is it the moſt effectual courſe, for
the cure of particular miſcarriages in mens lives,
to further the main work of grace upon their
hearts: could we make men better Chriſtians,
it would do much to make them better Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
Councellors, Jurers, Witneſſes, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
Neighbours, &amp;c. And this muſt be done
by the deeper impreſs of thoſe vitall Truths,
and the Good in them exhibited, which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate
objects of our vital graces. Could we
help you to wind up the ſpring of faith, and ſo
move the firſt wheel of Chriſtian Love, we
ſhould find it the readieſt and ſureſt means to
move the inferior wheels of duty. The flaws and
irregular motions without, do ſhew that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

we might the eaſier mend the reſt: I ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
therefore that I need no more apologie for
chuſing ſuch a ſubject at ſuch a ſeaſon as this,
then for bringing bread to a feaſt. And if I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate

ſenſleſs Paralytick members, or the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Convulſive motions of any hearers, I have
the warrant of the Apoſtles example in my
Text. Among other great enormities in the
Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> he had theſe three to
reprehend and heal: Firſt their ſidings and
diviſions occaſioned by ſome factious ſelf-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
teachers. Secondly, their perſonal conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by Lawſuites, and that before unbelieving
Judges. Thirdly, the foul ſin of fornication,
which ſome among them had faln into; the great
cure which he uſeth to all theſe and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to the laſt, is the urging of theſe great
foundation Truths; whereof one is in the words
before my text; <hi>viz.</hi> the Right of the Holy
Ghoſt; the other in the words of my Text;
which contains firſt A denial of any Right of
propriety in themſelves. Secondly, An aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſts propriety in them. Thirdly, the
proof of this from his purchaſe, which is the
Title. Fourthly, their duty concluded from the
former premiſes; which is to glorfie God, and
that with the whole man; with the ſpirit,
becauſe God is a ſpirit, and loaths hypocriſie;
with the body, which is particularly mentioned,
becauſe it ſeems they were encouraged to forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by ſuch conceits, that it was but an act of
the fleſh and not of the minde, and therefore as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52141:12"/>
they thought the ſmaler ſin. The Apoſtles words
from laſt to Firſt, according to the order of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
do expreſs, firſt mans duty, to glorifie
God with ſoul and body, and not to ſerve our
luſts! Secondly, the great fundamental obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this duty, Gods dominion or propriety.
3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The foundation of that Dominion, Chriſts
purchaſe; according to the order of execution
from firſt to laſt, theſe three great fundamentals
of our religion, lie thus. Firſt Chriſts purchaſe.
Secondly, Gods propriety thence ariſing. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
mans duty, wholly to glorifie God, ariſing
from both The argument lies thus. They that
are not their own, but wholly Gods, ſhould
wholly glorifie God, aud not ſerve their luſts:
but you are not your own, but wholly Gods:
therefore you ſhould wholly glorifie God &amp; not
ſerve your luſts. The major is clear by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
light of nature. Every one ſhould have the
uſe of their own. The Minor is proved thus.
They that are bought with a price are not their
own, but his that bought them; <hi>but you are
bought with a price:</hi> therefore, &amp;c. For the
meaning of the terms briefly: [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>]
<hi>veſtri,</hi> as the vulgar; <hi>veſtri juris,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> and
others; is moſt fitly expreſſed by our Engliſh-[your own]
[ye are bought:] a <hi>Synecdoche
generis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Piſcator;</hi> for [ye are redeemed]
[with a price] There is no buying without a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52141:12"/>
price: This therefore is an Emphaticall <hi>Pleonaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
as <hi>Beza, Piſcator,</hi> and others: as to ſee with
the eyes, to hear with the ears: Or elſe [a
price] is put for [a great price] as <hi>Calvin,
Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Piſcator</hi> rather thinks:
And therefore the Vulgar adds the Epithet
[<hi>magno</hi>] &amp; the Arabick [<hi>pretioſo</hi>] as <hi>Beza</hi> notes;
as agreeing to that of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. I ſee not
but we may ſupoſe the Apoſtle to reſpect both
the purchaſe and the greatneſs of the price; as
<hi>Grotius</hi> and ſome others do, [Glorifie God]
that is, by uſing your bodies and ſouls wholly
for him, and abſtaining from thoſe luſts which
do diſhonour him. The Vulgar adds [<hi>&amp; por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi>]

                  <p>The reſt of the explication ſhall follow the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52141:13"/>
Doctrines, which are theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. We are bought with a price.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Becauſe we are bought to, we are not

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Becauſe we are not our own,
but wholly Gods, therefore we muſt not ſerve
our luſts, but glorifie him in the Body and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
In theſe three conclusions is the ſubſtance
of the Text; which I ſhall firſt explain, and
then make application of them in that order as
the Apoſtle here doth.</p>
                  <p>The Points that need explication are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in what ſenſe we are ſaid to be
bought with a price? who bought us? and of
whom? and from what? and with what price?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, How we are Gods own upon the
Title of this purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How we are not our own.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, What it is to glorifie God in Body
and in Spirit on this account.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Who they be that on this ground are
or may be urged to this duty.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the firſt of theſe, whether <hi>buying,</hi> here
be taken properly or Metaphorically, I will not
now, enquire.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, mankind by ſin became guilty of death,
liable to Gods wrath, and a ſlave to Satan, and
his own luſts. The ſentence in part was paſt
and execution begun, the reſt would have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52141:13"/>
followed, if not prevented. This is the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
from which we are redeemed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he that redeemed us, is the Son of
God; himſelf God and man; and the Father
by the Son. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>He purchaſed us with
his own blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the price was the whole humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſt; in the firſt act whereof (his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation)
the Godhead was alone, which by
humbling it ſelf, did ſuffer reputatively, which
could not really: In the reſt the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was the ſufferer, but ſtill the humane nature
Really, and the Divine but Reputatively. And
why we may not add as part of the price the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of that obedience wherein his ſuffering did
not conſiſt, I yet ſee not. But from whom
were we redeemed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> From <hi>Satan</hi> by reſcue againſt his will:
From Gods wrath or Vindictive juſtice by his
own procurement and conſent. He ſubſtituted
for us ſuch a ſacrifice, by which he could as
fully attain the ends of his righteous Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the Demonſtration of his juſtice and
hatred of ſin, as if the ſinner had ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
And in this ſound ſenſe it is far from being
an abſurdity, as the Socinian dreameth, for
God to ſatisfie his own <hi>Juſtice, or to buy us of
himſelf: or redeem us from himſelf,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Next let us conſider, how we are Gods
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52141:14"/>
upon the Title of this purchaſe. By [God]
here is meant both the Son, who being God,
hath procured a right in us by his Redemption;
and alſo the Father, who ſent his Son, and
redeemed us by him, and to whom it was that
the Son redeemed us <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
us to God by thy Blood.</hi> In one word, it
is God as Redeemer, the manhood alſo of the
ſecond perſon included, that hath purchaſed
this right. Here you muſt obſerve that God
as Creator had a plenary Right of propriety
and Government, on which he founded the Law
of works that then was. This right he hath
not loſt: Our fall did loſe our Right in him,
but could not deſtroy his right in us. Becauſe it
deſtroyed our right, therefore the promiſſory
part of that Law was immediately thereupon
diſſolved, or ceaſed through our incapacity
(and therefore Divines ſay, that as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
it ceaſed) but becauſe it deſtroyed not
Gods Right, therefore the prec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ptive, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
parts of that Law do ſtill remain. But how
remain? In their being: but not alone, or
without remedy. For the Son of God became
a ſacrifice in our ſtead; not that we might ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,
immediately, or <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> be fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
or that any man ſhould <hi>ab ipſa hoſtia</hi>
from the very ſacrifice as made, have a right
to the great benefits of perſonall plenary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52141:14"/>
and Remiſſion, and everlaſting
life; but that the neceſſity of periſhing through
the unſatisfiedneſs of juſtice for the alone of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
againſt the Law of works being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from mankind they might all be delivered
up to him as <hi>Proprietary &amp; Rector,</hi> that he
might rule them as his redeemed ones, and make
for them ſuch new Laws of grace, for the
conveyances of his benefits, as might demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
the wiſdom and mercy of our Redeemer,
and be moſt ſuitable to his ends. The world is
now morall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dead in ſin, though naturally alive.
Chriſt hath redeemed them, but will cure them
by the actuall conveyance of the benefits of
Redemption, or no at all He hath undertaken
to this end, himſelf to be their Phyſitian, to cure
all that will come to him, and take him ſo to be,
and truſt him, and obey him in the Application
of his Medicines. He hath erected an Hoſpitall.
his Church to this end; and commanded all to
come into this Ark. Thoſe that are far diſtant,
he firſt commandeth to come nearer; and thoſe
that are neare, he inviteth to come in. Too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
do refuſe and periſh in their refuſall. He will
not ſuffer all to do ſo, but mercifully boweth
the wills of his Elect, and by an inſuperable
powerfull drawing, compells them to come in.
You may ſee then that here is a <hi>Novum us
&amp; Dominii &amp; Imperii,</hi> a new right of Propriety
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52141:15"/>
and rule, founded on the new bottom of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:
But that this doth not deſtroy the old
which was founded on Creation; but is in the
very nature and uſe of it, an emendative additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Redemption is to mend the Creature, not of
any defect that was left in the Creation, but
from the ruine which came by our defacing
tranſgreſſion. The Law of grace upon this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
is ſuperadded to the Law of nature
given on the Creation: not to amend any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
in that Law, but to ſave the ſinner
from its unſufferable penalty, by diſſolving its
obligation of him thereto And thus in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and uſe it is a remedying Law. And ſo you
may ſee that Chriſt is now the Owner, and by
right the Governor of the whole world, on the
Title of redemption, as God before was, and
ſtill is on the Title of Creation.</p>
                  <p>3. By this you may alſo percive in whit ſenſe,
<hi>we are not our own.</hi> In the ſtricteſt ſence there
is no proprietary, or abſolute Lord in the world
but God. No man can ſay this is fully and
ſtrictly mine. God gives us indeed whatever
we enjoy; but his giving is not as mans: we part
with out Propriety in that which which we give: but
God gives nothing ſo. His giving to us makes
it not the leſs his own. As a man giveth his
goods to his ſteward to diſpoſe of for his uſe,
or inſtruments to his ſervant to do his work with,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52141:15"/>
ſo God giveth his benefits to us. Or at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
as you give cloathes to your child, which
are more yours ſtill then his, and you may take
them away at your pleaſure. I confeſs when
God hath told us that he will not take them
away, he is as it were obliged in fidelity to
continue them, but yet doth not hereby let go
his propriety. And ſo Chriſt bids us call no man
on Earth Father, that is, our abſolute Lord or
Ruler, becauſe we have but one ſuch maſter,
who is in Heaven. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 7, 8, 9, 10. So
that you may ſee by this, what Propriety is
left us, and what right we have to our ſelves,
and our Poſſeſſions: Even ſuch as a ſteward in his
Maſters goods; or a ſervant in his tools, or a
child in his coat, which is a propriety impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
ſubordinate and <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> and will
ſecure us againſt the uſurpation of another: One
ſervant may not take his fellows inſtrument
from him, nor one child his brothers coat
from him, without the Parents or Maſters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
They have them for their uſe, though not
the full propriety: It may be called a propriety
in reſpect to our fellow ſervant, though it be not
properly ſo as we ſtand in reſpect to God.
We have right enough to conſute the Leveller:
but not to exempt either us or ours from the
claim and uſe of our abſolute Lord.</p>
                  <p>4. For the fourth Queſtion, What it is to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52141:16"/>
glorifie God in body, and ſpirit, I anſwer in
a word: It is, when upon true believing appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of his right to us, and of our great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
to him as our Redeemer, we heartily
and unfeignedly devote our ſelves to him, and
live as a people ſo devoted; ſo bending the
chiefeſt of our care and ſtudy, how to pleaſe him
in exacteſt obedience, that the glory of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and holineſs, and of his wiſe and righteous
Laws, may be ſeen in our converſations; and
that the holy conformity of our lives to theſe
Lawes, may ſhew that there is the like confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in our minds, and that they are written
in our hearts; when the exellency of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion is ſo appareut in the excellency
of our lives, cauſing us to do that which no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
can imitate, that the luſtre of our good
works may ſhine before men, and cauſe them to
glorifie our Father in Heaven. To conclude,
when we ſtill reſpect God as our only Soveragin,
and Chriſt as our Redeemer, and his Spirit as
our Sanctifier, and his Law as our Rule; that the
doing of his will, and the denying, of our own, is
the daily work of our lives, and the promoting
of his bleſſed ends is our end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God that hath Redeemed us.</p>
                  <p>5. The laſt queſtion is, who they be that are
&amp; may be urged to glorifie God on this ground,
that the hath bought them? Doubtleſs, only
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52141:16"/>
thoſe whom he hath bought: but who are
thoſe? It diſcourageth me to tell you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
among the godly, it is a controverſie;
but if they will controvert points of ſuch great
moment, they cannot diſoblige or excuſe us
from preaching them. Among the variety of
mens opinions, it is ſafe to ſpeak in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the holy Ghoſt, and accordingly to
believe, <hi>viz</hi> that [as by the offence of one,
Judgement came upon all men to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the
free gift came upon all men to Juſtification of
life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8.] And that he gave himſelf
a ran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ome for all, and is the only Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and man. <hi>1 Tim.</hi> 2. 5, 6. That he
is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for
ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole
world. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 2. That God is the Saviour of
all men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 10. That he is the Saviour of the world.
<hi>John</hi> 4. 42. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 14. 15. That he taſteth
death for every man. <hi>Heb. 2. 9.</hi> with many
the like. It is very ſad to conſider, how mens unskilfulneſs to reconcile Gods general grace
with his ſpecial, and to aſſign to each its proper
part, hath made the Pelagians and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
to deny the ſpecial grace, and too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of late, no leſs dangerouſly to deny the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
grace; and what contentions theſe two
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52141:17"/>
errroneous parties have maintained, and ſtill
maintain in the Church, and how few obſerve
or follow that true and ſober mean which
<hi>Auſtin</hi> the Maul of the Pelagians; and his
ſcholars <hi>Proſper</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius</hi> walked in!
If when our dark confuſed heads are unable to
aſſign each truth its place, and rightly to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
each wheel, and pin in the admirable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of Gods Revelations, we ſhall therefore
fall a wrangling againſt them, and reject them,
we may then be drawn to blaſpheme the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
to reject either Chriſts humane nature or
his Divine; and what truth ſhall we not be in
danger to loſe? ſo think this general grace
to be inconſiſtent with the ſpecial, is no wiſer
then to think the foundation inconſiſtent with
the Fabrick that is built thereupon; and that
the builders themſelves ſhould have ſuch
thoughts, is a matter of compaſſionate conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to the friends of the Church. Doubtleſs
Chriſt dyed not for all alike, nor with equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of ſaving them; and yet he hath born
the ſins of all men on the Croſs, and was a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
propitiation and ranſom for all. Even
they that bring in damnable hereſies, deny the
Lord that bought them, and bring on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſwift deſtruction. <hi>2 Pet. 2. 1. God ſent
not his Son into the world, to condemn the world,
but that the world through him might be ſaved.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52141:17"/>
He that believeth on him is not condemned; but
he that believeth not, is condemned already, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath not believed in the name of the only
begootten Son of God. And this is the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that light is come into the world, and men
loved darkneſs rather then light, becauſe their
deeds were evil.</hi> John 3. 17, 18, 19. I doubt
not but my Text doth warrant me to tell you
all, that you are not your own, but are bought
with a price, and therefore muſt glorifie him
that bought you: And I am very confident,
that if any one at judgement will be the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
of an unbeliever, and ſay he deſerves not
a ſorer puniſhment for ſinning againſt the
Lord that bought him, his plea will not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
Or, if any ſuch would comfort the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
in Hell or go about to cure them of
ſo much of their torment, by telling them, that
they never ſinned againſt one that redeemed
them, nor ever rejected the blood of Chriſt ſhed
for them, and therefore need not accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of any ſuch ſin, thoſe poor ſinners would
not be able to believe them. If it be only the
Elect with whom we muſt thus argue [you
are not your own. you are bought with a price,
therefore glorifie God] then can we truly
plead thus with none till we know them to be
Elect; which will not be in this world. I do
not think <hi>Paul</hi> knew them all to be Elect that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52141:18"/>
he wrote to; I mean, abſolutely choſen to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
nor do I think he would ſo perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
affirm them to be bought with a price, who
were fornicators, defrauders, contentious, drunk
at the Lords ſupper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from hence have
argued againſt their ſins, if he had taken this
for a Priviledge proper to the elect. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſay to ſcandalous ſinners [you are bought
with a price, therefore glorifie God] then
[you are abſolutely elect to ſalvation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
glorifie God.] And I believe, that as it is
the ſin of Apoſtates to [Crucifie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the Son of God afreſh] <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 5, 6.
So is it their miſery that [<hi>there remaineth no
more ſacrifice for ſins, but a certain fearful look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for of judgement, and fiery indignation which
ſhall devour the adverſaries, becauſe they have
trodden under foot the Son of God, and counted
the blood of the Covenant wherewith they were
ſanctified an unholy thing.</hi> Heb. 10. 26, 27, 28.
Laſtly, I judge it alſo a good argument to draw
us from offending others, and occaſioning their
ſin, that [through us, our weak Brother ſhall
periſh for whom Chriſt dyed. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 3.]
So much for explication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I would next proceed to the confirmation of
the Doctrines here contained, but that they
are ſo clear in the
Text, and in many other,
that I think it next to needleſs; and we have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52141:18"/>
now no time for needleſs work; and therefore
ſhall only cite theſe two or three Texts, which
confirm almoſt all that I have ſaid together.</hi>
Rom. 14. 9. For to this end Chriſt both dyed and
roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord both
of the dead and living. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. We
thus judge, that if one dyed for all, then were
all dead; and that he dyed for all, that they which
live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves,
but unto him which dyed for them and roſe again.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 19, 20. All power is given me in
Heven and in Earth. Go ye therefore, Diſciple
all Nations, Baptizing them, &amp;c. Teaching
them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have
commanded you. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17, 18. If ye call on
the Father, who without reſpect of perſons
judgeth every man according to his works, paſs the
time of your ſojourning here in fear; foraſmuch as
ye know that ye were not redeemed with corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things, as ſilver and gold, from your vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation—but
with the pretious blood of
Chriſt, as of a lamb without blemiſh, and without
ſpot. <hi>Theſe Texts ſpeak to the ſame purpoſe
with that which I have in hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> In applying theſe very uſefull truths,
would time permit, I ſhould begin at the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
with a confutation of divers contrary er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and a collection of many obſervable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectaries.
It would go better with all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52141:19"/>
and Princes on Earth, if they well
conſidered, that the abſolute Propriety and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
of God-Redeemer, is the Baſis of
all lawfull Societies and Governments: and
that no man hath any abſolute Propriety, but
only the uſe of the Talents that God doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt
him with: that the ſoveraignty of the
Creature is but Analogical, <hi>ſecundum quid;</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,
and ſubordinate to God the proper
Sovereign; that it belongs to him to appoint
his inferior Officers; that there is no power
but from God; and that he giveth none againſt
himſelf; that a Theocracy is the Government
that muſt be deſired and ſubmitted to, whether
the ſubordinate part be Monarchical, Arriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical,
or Democratical: and the rejecting
of this was the Iſraelites ſin, in chooſing them
a King; that it is ſtill poſſible and neceſſary to
live under this Theocracy, though the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
be not by ſuch extraordinary means
as among the Iſraelites; that all humane Laws
are but by-Laws ſubordinate to God. How
far his Laws muſt take place in all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
How far thoſe Laws of men are <hi>ipſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto
Null,</hi> that are unqueſtionably deſtructive
of the Laws of God: How far they that are not
their own, may give Authority to others; and
what aſpect theſe Principles have upon Liberty
in that latitude as it is taken by ſome, and upon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52141:19"/>
the Authority of the multitude, eſpecially in
Church-Government; ſhould I ſtand on theſe
and other the like Conſequents, which theſe
Fundamentals in hand might lead us to diſcuſs,
I ſhould prevent that more ſeaſonable applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which I in tend, and perhaps be thought in
ſome of them to meddle beyond my bounds. I'le
only ſay, That God is the firſt and the laſt, in
our Ethicks and Politicks, as well as in our
Phyſicks; that as there is ho Creature which he
made not, ſo it is no good right of Property or
Government which he ſome way gives not;
that all Commonwealths not built on this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
are as Caſtles in the air, or as childrens
tottering ſtructures, which in the very framing
are prepared for their ruine, and ſtrictly are no
Commonwealths at all; and thoſe Governors
that rule no more for God then for themſelves,
ſhall be dealt with as Traitors to the Univerſal
Soveraign. Thus far at leaſt muſt our Politicks
be Divine, unleſs we will be meet confederate
Rebels.</p>
                  <p>But it is yet a cloſer application which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.
Though we are, not our own, yet every
mans welfare ſhould he ſo dear to himſelf, that
methinks every man of you ſhould preſently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
how far you are concerned, in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which we have in hand. I'le tell you how
far. The Caſe here deſcribed is all our own.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52141:20"/>
We are bought with a price, and therefore not
our own, and therefore muſt live to him that
bought us. We muſt do it, or elſe we violate
our Allegiance, aud are Traitors to our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
We muſt do it, or elſe we ſhall periſh as
deſpiſers of his blood. It is no matter of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,
nor a duty which may be diſpenced
with. That God who is our Owner by Creation
and Redemption,, and who doth hitherto keep
our ſouls in theſe bodies by whoſe meer will
and power you are all here alive before him
this day, will ſhortly call you before his bar,
where theſe matters will be more ſeriouſly and
ſearchingly enquired after. The great, Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the day will then be this, Whether you
have bin heartily devoted to your Redeemer,
and lived to him? or to your carnal ſelves?
Upon the reſolution of this Queſtion, your ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Salvation or Damnation will depend.
What think you then? Should not this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be now put home, by every rational Hearer
to his own heart? But I ſuppoſe ſome will ſay,
There is no man that wholly lives to God, for
all are ſinners: how then can our Salvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
ſo much on this? I anſwer in a word:
Though no man pay God all that he oweth
him, yet no man ſhall be ſaved, that giveth him
not the preheminence. He will own none as
true Subjects, that do not cordially own him in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52141:20"/>
his Soveraignty. Be it known to you all, there
ſhall not a man of you enter into his kingdom,
nor ever ſee his face in peace, that giveth him
not the cheifeſt room in your hearts, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not his work your cheifeſt buſineſs. He
will be no underling or ſervant to your fleſh.
He will be ſerved with the <hi>Beſt,</hi> if he cannot
have <hi>All</hi> And in this ſenſe it is that I ſay the
Queſtion will be put, in that great day, by the
Judge of all, Whether God or our carnal
ſelves were preferred? and whether we lived to
him that bought us, or to our fleſh? Beloved
Hearers! I will not ask you whether you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
believe that there will be ſuch a day, I will
take it for granted, while you call your ſelves
Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſtians, much leſs will I queſtion whether
you would then be ſaved or condemned. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will not ſuffer you to be willing of ſuch a
miſery, though corruption make you too will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the cauſe. But the Common ſtupidity of
the world doth perſwade me to ask you this,
Whether you think it meet that men who muſt
be ſo ſolemnly examined upon this Point, and
whoſe life or death depends on the deciſion,
ſhould not examine themſelves on it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
and well conſider what anſwer they muſt
then make? and whether any pains can be too
great in ſo needfull a work? and whether he
that miſcarrieth to ſave a labour, do not madly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52141:21"/>
betray his ſoul unto perdition? as if ſuch ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
diligence were worſe then Hell, or his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
carnal eaſe were more deſirable then his
Salvation. Let us then rouſe up our ſelves Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
in the fear of God, and make this a day
of judgement to our ſelves. Let us know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are Children of Life or of Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h. O
how can a man that is well in his wits, enjoy
with any comfort the things of this world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he know, at leaſt in probability, what he
ſhall enjoy in the next! How can men go cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
up and down about the buſineſs of this
life, before they have faithfully laboured to
make ſure, that it ſhall go well with them in the
life to come! That we may now know this
without deceit, let us all as in the preſence of
the Living God, lay bare our hearts, examine
them, and judge them, by this portion of his
word according to the evidence.</p>
                  <p>7. Whoever he be that takes not himſelf for
his own, but lives to his Redeemer, he is one
that hath found himſelf really undone, and hath
unfeignedly confeſſed the forfeiture of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and finding that Redemption hath been
made by Chriſt, and that there is hope and life
to be had in him, and none but in him, as he
gladly receives the tidings, ſo he carefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
the right of his Redeemer, and in
a ſober, deliberate and voluntary Covetant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52141:21"/>
the world, the fleſh and the Devill,
and reſigneth up himſelf to Chriſt as his due.
He ſaith [<hi>Lord, I have too long ſerved thine
Enemies and mine own; by cleaving to my ſelf,
and forſaking God, I have loſt both my ſelf and
God. Wilt thou be my Saviour and the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
of my ſoul, and waſh me with thy blood, and
repair the ruins of my ſoul by thy ſpirit, and I am
willing to be thine; I yield up myſelf to the conduct
of thy grace, to be ſaved in thy way, and fitted for
thy ſervice, and live to God from whom I have
revolted.</hi>] This is the Caſe of all that are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By many Scriptures we might quickly confirm
this, if it were lyable to queſtion.</hi> Luke 14.
25, 26. If any man come to me, and hate not his
Father, and Mother, and Wife And Children,
and Brethren and Siſters and his own life alſo, he
cannot be my Diſciple; and whoſoever doth not
bear his Croſs and come after me, cannot be my
Diſciple; <hi>So ver.</hi> 33. Whoſoever he be of you that
forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my
Diſciple; <hi>which is expounded,</hi> Mat. 10. 37. He
that loveth Father or Mother more then me, is
not worthy of me. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. If any man will
come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his
Croſs, and follow me; for whoſoever will ſave his
life ſhall loſe it; and whoſoever will loſe his life for
my ſake ſhall finde it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25, 26, 27. Whom
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52141:22"/>
have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon
earth that I deſire beſides thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 5. The
Lord is the Portion of mine Inheritance, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi>
11. 24, 25, 26. Moſes refuſed honor, choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſuffer affliction with the People of God,
then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming
the reproacb of Chriſt greater riches then
the treasures of Egypt; for he had reſpect to the
recompence of the reward. <hi>I forbear citing more,
the caſe being ſo evident, that God is ſet higheſt
in the heart of every ſound Believer, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Covenant reſigned to him as his</hi> Own.
<hi>On the contrary, moſt of the</hi> unſanctified <hi>are
Chriſtians but in name, becauſe they were edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to this profeſſion, &amp; it is the common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of the Country where they live, and they
hear none make queſtion of it; or if they do, it
is to their own diſgrace, the name of Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
got this advantage to be everywhere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us well ſpoken of even by thoſe that ſhall
periſh for neglecting him and his Laws. Theſe
men have reſigned their names to Chriſt, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
their hearts to fleſh pleaſing vanities. Or
if under Conviction aud terror of Conſcience,
they do make any reſignation of their ſouls to
Chriſt, it comes ſhort of the true reſignation of
the ſanctfied in theſe particulars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. It is a firm and rooted belief of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
which is the cauſe of ſincere resignation to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52141:22"/>
Chriſt. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ney are ſo fully perſwaded of the truth
of thoſe things which Chriſt hath done, and
promiſed to do hereafter, that they will venture
all that they have in this world, and their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
ſtate upon it: Wheras the belief of ſelf-d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ceivers
is only ſuperficial, ſtaggering, not
rooted and will not carry them to ſuch adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 2l, 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>2. Sincere ſelf-reſignation is accompanied
with ſuch a love to him that we are devoted to,
which over-toppeth (as to the rational part)
all other love. The ſoul hath a prevailing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
in God, and cloſeth with him as its
chiefeſt good; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. &amp; 63. 3. But the
unſanctified have no ſuch complacency in him;
they would fain pleaſe him by their flatteries,
left he ſhould do them any hurt; but might they
enjoy but the pleaſures of this world, they
could be well content to live without him.</p>
                  <p>3. Sincere ſelf-reſignation is a departing
from our carnal ſelves and all Creatures as they
ſtand in competition with Chriſt for our hearts;
and ſo it containeth a Crncifying of the fleſh,
and mortification of all its luſts. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8 1. to 14. There is a hearty renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of former contrad ctory Intereſts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
that Chriſt may be ſet higheſt and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delighted in. But ſelf deceivers are never
truly mortified, when they ſeem to devote
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52141:23"/>
themſelves moſt ſeriouſly to Chriſt: there is a
contrary prevailing Intereſt in their minds;
their fleſhly felicity is nearer to their hearts, and
this world is never unfeignedly renounced.</p>
                  <p>4. Sincere ſelf-reſignation is reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
deliberation, and not a raſh inconſiderate
promiſe, which is afterwards reverſt. The illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
ſee that perfection in God, that vanity
in the Creature,, that deſirable ſufficiency in
Chriſt, and emptineſs in themſelves, that they
firmly reſolve to caſt themſelves on him, and
be his alone; And though they cannot pleaſe
him as they would, they'l dye before they'l
change their Maſter; but with ſelf-deceivers it
is not thus.</p>
                  <p>5. Sincere reſignation is <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</hi>
Such do not Capitulate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Chriſt [I will be thine ſo far, and no
further; ſo thou wilt but ſave my eſtate, or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
or liſe.] But ſelf-deceivers have ever ſuch
<hi>Reſerves</hi> in their hearts, though they do not
expreſs them, nor perhaps themſelves diſcern
them. They have ſecret Limitations, Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Conditions: they have ever a ſalve
for their worldly ſafety or felicity, and will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
venture upon a threatned Miſery which
they ſee not, though everlaſting, then upon a
certain Temporary miſery which they ſee. Theſe
deep Reſerves are the ſoul of Hypocriſy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:52141:23"/>
6. Sincere ſelf-reſignation is fixed and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituate;
it is not forced by a moving Sermon,
or a dangerous ſickneſs, and then forgotten
and laid aſide; but it is become a fixed habit in
the ſoul; it is otherwiſe with ſelf-deceivers;
Though they will oblige themſelves to Chriſt
with vows in a time of fear and danger, yet ſo
looſe is the knot, that when the danger ſeems
over, their bonds fall off. Its one thing to be
affrighted, and another to have the heart quite
changed and renewed. Its one thing to hire
our ſelves with a Maſter in our neceſſities, and
then ſerve our ſelves, or run away; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to nail our ears to his door, and ſay,
I love thee, and therefore will uot depart.</p>
                  <p>So much for the firſt mark of one that lives not
as his own, but as Gods, to wit, <hi>sincere ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is this.</p>
                  <p>2. As the heart is thus devoted to God, ſo
alſo is the life, where men do truly take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for his: And that will appear in theſe
three particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. The principal ſtudy and care of ſuch
men, is how to pleaſe God, and promote his
intereſt, and do his work: this is it that they
moſt ſeriouſly mind and contrive. Their own
felicity they ſeek in this way, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 32. 33.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 11. 13, 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 10. &amp; 3, 1, 2, 3.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52141:24"/>
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20. 21, 24. It is not ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified,
they drive on another deſign. Their
own work is principally minded, and their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
intereſt preferred to Chriſts. They live to
the fleſh and make proviſion for it, to ſatisfie
its deſires, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14.</p>
                  <p>2. It is the chiefeſt delight of a man devoted
to God, to ſee Chriſts intereſt proſper and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
It doth him more good to ſee the Church
flouriſh, the Goſpel ſucceed, the ſouls of men
brought in to God, and all things fitted to his
bleſſed pleaſure then it would do him to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
himſelf in the world; to do good to mens
bodies, much more to their ſouls, is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to him, then to be honourable or rich.
To give is ſweeter to him, then to receive.
His own matters he reſpects as lower things,
that come not ſo neer his heart as Gods. But
with the unſanctified it is not ſo their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and honours are moſt of their delight,
and the abſence of them their greateſt trouble.</p>
                  <p>3. With a man that is truly devoted to God,
the intereſt of Chriſt doth bear down all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
intereſt in the ordinary courſe of
his life: As his own unrighteous righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo his own renounced carnal intereſt, is
loſs and dung to him in compariſon of Chriſts,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. 9. He cannot take himſelf to be a
loſer by that which is gain to the ſouls of men,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52141:24"/>
and tendeth to promote the intereſt of his Lord.
He ſerveth God with the firſt aud beſt, and lets
his own work ſtand by till Chriſts be done, or
rather <hi>owneth</hi> none but Chriſts: His own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
being lighter to him then Chriſts, and
a ruined eſtate leſs grievous then a ruined
Church; therefore doth he firſt ſeek Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and its righteouſneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. and
chuſeth rather to neglect his fleſh, his gain,
his friends, his life; then the cauſe and work
of Chriſt it is far otherwiſe with the umſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified;
they will contentedly give Chriſt the
moſt glorious titles, and full-mouthed commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
<hi>Luke</hi> 6. 46 But they have one that
is neerer their hearts then he, their carnal ſelf
muſt ſway the Scepter, God ſhall have all
that the fleſh can ſpare; if he will be content
to be ſerved with its leavings, they will ſerve
him if not, they muſt be excuſed; they can
allow him no more. The crying time, is the
parting time; when God or the world muſt
needs be neglected. In ſuch a ſtraite, the
righteous are ſtill righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 11.
But the unſted faſt in the Covenant, do manifeſt
their unſtedfaſtneſs; and though they will not
part wlth Chriſt profeſſedly, nor without ſome
witty diſtinctions and evaſions, nor without
great ſorow, and pretence of continued fidelity,
yet part they will, and ſhift for themſelves
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52141:25"/>
and hold that they have as long as they can,
<hi>Luke.</hi> 18. 23. In a word, the ſanctified are
heartily devoted to God, and live to him,
and were they uncapable of ſerviug or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r lives would afford them little
content, what ever elſe they did poſſeſs: But
the unſanctified are more ſtrongly addicted to
their fleſh, &amp; live to their carnal ſelves; &amp; might
they ſecurely enjoy the pleaſures of this world,
they could eaſily ſpare the fruit on of God, and
could be as willing to be diſpenced with for his
ſpirituall ſervice, as to perſorme it. And thus
I have given you the true diſcription of thoſe
that live to their Redeemer, as being not their
own; and thoſe that live to themſelves, as if
they were not his that bought them.</p>
                  <p>Having thus told you what the Word ſaith,
it followeth, that we next enquire what your
hearts ſay, you hear what you muſt be; will you
now conſider what you are? Are all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that hear me this day, devoted in heart and
life to their Redeemer? Do you all live as
Chriſt's, and not your own? If ſo, I muſt
needs ſay, it is an extraordinary Aſſembly, and
ſuch as I had never the happineſs to know.
O that it were ſo indeed, that we might rejoyce
together, and magnifie our deliverer, in ſtead
of reprehending you, or lamenting your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs.
But alas, we are not ſuch ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52141:25"/>
in the World, as to be guilty of ſuch a
groundleſs judgement. Let us enquire more
particularly into the caſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Are thoſe ſo ſincerely devoted to Chriſt?
and do they ſo deny themſelves, whoſe daily
thoughts and care, and labour, is how they
may live in more reputation and content, and
may be better provided for the ſatisfying of
their fleſh? If they be low and poor, and their
condition is diſpleaſing to them, their greateſt
care is to repair it to their minds; if they be
higher and more wealthy, their buſineſs is to
keep it or increaſe it; that hunt after honour,
and thirſt after a thriving and more plenteous
ſtate; that can ſtretch their conſciences to
the ſize of all times, and humour thoſe that
they think may advance them, and be moſt
humble ſervants to thoſe above them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly
neglect whoſoever is below them;
that wil put their hands to the feet of thoſe that
they hope to riſe by, and put their feet on the
necks of their ſubdued adverſaries, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
upon all that ſtand in their way; that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
not men for their honeſty, but their
worldly honours, and will magnifie that man
while he is capable of advancing them, whom
they would have ſcorned if providence had laid
him in the duſt: that are friends to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend
their intereſt and deſigns, and enemies
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52141:26"/>
to the moſt upright that croſs them in their
courſe; that love not men ſo much, becauſe
they love God, as becauſe they love
them; Are theſe devoted to God, or to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
Is it for God or themſelves, that men
ſo induſtriouſly ſcramble for Honours and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Government, or of Gain, Will they
uſe their offices or honours for God, that hunt
after them as a prey, as if they had not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
enough already, nor Talents enough to
anſwer for neglecting! Are thoſe men devoted
to God, that can tread down his moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
intereſt on earth, when it ſeems to
be inconſiſtent with their own! Let the Goſpel
go down, let the Church be broken in pieces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
let ſound doctrine be deſpiſed, let Miniſters be
hindered or tired with vexations, let the ſouls
of people ſink or ſwim rather then they ſhould
be hindered in the way of their ambition. I ſhall
leave it to the trial of another day, whether
all the publike actions of this Age, with their
effects, have been for God, or for ſelf? This
doth not belong to my examination, but to his
that will throughly perform it ere long, and
ſearch theſe matters to the quick, and open
them to the world. There were never higher
pretences for God in an Age, then have been in
this; had there been but anſwerable intentions
and performances, his affairs and our own, had
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52141:26"/>
been in much better caſe then they are; but
enough of this. Should we deſcend to mens
particular families and converſations, we ſhould
find the matter little better with the moſt.
Are they all for God that follow the world ſo
eagerly, that they cannot ſpare him a ſerious
thought? an hours time for his worſhip in their
families, or in ſecret? that will ſee that their
own work be done; but for the ſouls of thoſe
that are committed to their charge, they regard
them not. Let them be never ſo ignorant, they
will not inſtruct them, nor cauſe them to read
the Word, or learn a Catechiſm nor will ſpend
the Lords peculiar day in ſuch exerciſes; and
its much if they hinder not thoſe that would.
Is it for God that men give up their hearts
to <hi>this World,</hi> ſo that they cannot have while
once a day, or week to think ſoberly what they
muſt do in the <hi>next?</hi> or how they may be ready
for their great approaching change? Is it for
God, that men deſpiſe his Miniſters, reject his
Word, abhor reformation, ſcor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> at Church, Government,
and deride the perſons that are
addicted to his fear, and the families that call
upon his Name? Theſe men will ſhortly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
a little better then now they will do,
whether indeed they lived to God, or to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>2. If you are devoted to God, what do you
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52141:27"/>
for him? Is it his buſineſs that you mind? How
much of your time do you ſpend for him? How
much of your ſpeech is for him? How much of
your Eſtates yearly is ſerviceable to his intereſt?
Let Conſcience ſpeak whether he have your
ſtudies and affections; let you familiars be
witneſſes, whether he have your ſpeeches and
beſt endeavors; let the Church witneſs, what
you have done for it; and the Poor witneſs,
what you have done for them; and the ſouls
of ignorant and ungodly men, what you have
done for them; ſhew by the work you have
done, who you have lived to; God or your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſelves; If indeed you have lied to God,
ſomething will be ſeen that you have done for
him; nay it is not a <hi>ſomething</hi> that will ſerve
the trun. It muſt be the <hi>Beſt.</hi> Remember that
it is by your Works that you ſhall be judged,
and not by your pretences, profeſſions or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements;
your Judge already knows your Caſe,
he needs no witneſſes, he will not be mocked
with ſaying you are for him; ſhew it, or ſaying
it will not ſerve.</p>
                  <p>Methinks now the conſciences of ſome
of you ſhould prevent me, and preach
over the ſharper part the Sermon to your
ſelves, and ſay, [<hi>I am the man that have
lived to my ſelf</hi>] and ſo conſider of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents
of ſuch a life: But I will leave this to

next proceed to the exhortative part of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

that I come hither upon, is to proclaim <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

or would uſe your ſeles. He will not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy

daſh you in pieces. He will not ſeduce you
with ſwiniſh ſenſualities, and keep you in play

You need not feare ſuch dealing as this from

is willing to pardon all that is paſt, and put
up all the wrongs that you have done him,
ſo you will but repent of them, and now at
laſt be heartily and intirely his, not onely
in tongue, but in deed and life: Well, I have
proclaimed Gods right to you; I have offered
you his gracious acceptance if yet you demur,
or ſleepily neglect it, or obſtinatly reſiſt him,
take that you get by it; remember you pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
not without warning. The confeſſion of

be forced to remember though you had rather

                  <p>1. Conſider the fulneſs of Gods Right to

made you of nothing, and therefore you have
nothing which is not his. He Redeemed you
when you were fallen to worſe then nothing:
Had not Chriſt ranſomed you by being a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

to everlaſting perdition give him therefore his

to your ſelves; if you have, how came
you by it? Did you make your ſelves? did you
Redeem your ſelves? do you maintain and
preſerve your ſelves? If you are your own,
tell God you will not be beholden to him for
his preſervation: Why cannot you preſerve

Why cannot you recover your ſelves from

                  <p>6. You can never have a better Maſter
then God, nor yet a ſweeter employment then
his ſervice. There is nothing in him that
may be the leaſt diſcouragement to you,
nor in his works that ſhall be diſtaſtefull. The
reaſon why the world thinks otherwiſe, is
becauſe of the diſtempered averſneſſe of their
ſouls. A ſick ſtomack is no fit Judge of the
pleaſantneſſe of meats. To live to God is to
live to the trueſt and higheſt delights. His
Kingdome is not meats and drinks, but in
Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy
Ghoſt. His ſervants indeed are often troubled;
but ask them the reaſon, and they I quickly tell
you, that it is not for being his ſevatns, or for
ſerving him too much: but for fear leſt they
are not his ſervatns, or for ſerving him no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
It is not in his waies, or at leaſt not for them,
that they meet with their perplexities, but in
ſtepping out of them, &amp; wandring in their own.
Many beſides the ſervants of God, do ſeek feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and ſatisfaction to their minds, and ſome
diſcover where it lyeth; but only they attain it
and enjoy it.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrray, he hath an ill Maſter
that is ruled by himſelfe. A Maſter that is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52141:31"/>
blind and proud and paſſionate, that will lead
you to precipices, and thence deject you; that
will moſt effectually ruine you, when he thinks
he is doing you the greateſt good: whoſe work
is bad, and his wages no better; that feedeth
his ſervants in plenty but as ſwine, and in the
day of famine denyeth them the husks; what
ever you may now imagine while you are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
with ſenſuality; I dare ſay, if ever God
bring you to your ſelves, you will conſider that
it is better be in your Fathers houſe, where the
pooreſt ſervant hath bread enough, then to be
fed with dreams and pictures, and to periſh
with hunger; Reject not God till you have
found a better Maſter.</p>

your ſelves, you diſengage: God from dealing
with you as <hi>His</hi> in a gracious ſenſe. If you will

as you can, ſave your ſelves in danger cure your

men, will take you for their friend no

once you need them, or ſtand in their way you

common and unclean, but ſeparated in reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
affection and converſation from the

Office of the holy Ghoſt, to work you to this;

                  <p>11. Gods abſolute dominion and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
over us, is the very foundation of all
Religion, even of that little that is found
left among Infidels and Pagans, much more
evidently of the ſaving Religion of Chriſtians:
He that dare ſay he believeth not this, will
never ſure have the face to call himſelf a
Chriſtian. Is it not a matter of moſt ſad conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that ever ſo many millions ſhould think
to be ſaved by a Doctrine which they believe
not, or by a Religion that never went deeper
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52141:33"/>
then the braine, and is openly contradicted by
the tenour of their lives! Is a true Religion
enough to ſave you, if you be not true to
that Religion? How do men make ſhift to
quiet their Conſciences in ſuch groſs hypocriſie?
Is there a man to be found in this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that will not confeſs that he is rightfully
his Redeemers? But hath he indeed their hearts?
their time, their ſtrength, and their intereſt?
follow ſome of them from morning to night,
you ſhall not hear one ſerious word for Chriſt,
nor ſee any ſerious indeavours for his intereſt.
And yet theſe men will profeſſe that they are
his; How ſad a caſe is it, that mens own
Confeſſions ſhould condemn them, and that
which they called their Religion, ſhould judge
them to that everlaſting miſery, which they
thought it would have ſav'd them from! And
how glorious would the Chriſtian Religion
appeare, if men were true to it, if Chriſts
Doctrine had its full impreſſion on their hearts,
and were expreſſed in their lives! Is he not
an exellent perſon that denyeth himſelfe,
and doth all for God? that goeth on no
buſineſſe but Gods, that ſearcheth out Gods
intereſt in every part of his calling and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and intendeth that, <hi>that whether
he eat or drink, or whatever he doth, doth
all to the glory of God,</hi> 1. Cor. 10. 31. that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52141:33"/>
can ſay as <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2, 20. <hi>I am crucified with
Chriſt; nevertheleſſe I live, yet not I, but Chriſt
liveth in me;</hi> And <hi>Phil,</hi> 3. 7, 8. <hi>What things
were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt, yea
doubtleſs, and I count all things, but loſs, for
the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my
Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all
things, and do count them but dung, that I may
win Chriſt.</hi> And Phil. 1. 21. <hi>For to me to live is
Chriſt, and to dye is gaine.</hi> Perhaps you think
that the degree of theſe examples is unimitable
by us: but I am ſure all that will be ſaved, muſt
imitate them in the <hi>truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. Self-ſeeking is ſelf-loſing; and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up your ſelf and all you have to God, is the
only way to ſave your ſelves, and to ſecure all.
The more you are <hi>His,</hi> the more you are your
own indeed: and the more you deliver to him,
and expend for him, the greater is your gain.
Theſe Paradoxes are familiar tryed truths to

<hi>Luke</hi> 19. 23. The great buſineſs of
that day will be, not ſo much to ſearch after
particular ſins, or duties, which were contrary
to the ſcope of heart and life; but to know
whether you lived to God, or to your fleſh;
whether your time, and care, and wealth, were
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52141:35"/>
expended for Chriſt in his members and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt?
or for your carnal ſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. In as
much as you did it not to theſe, you did it not
to him. You that Chriſt hath given Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to, ſhall then be accomptable, whether you
improved it to his advantage? You that he
hath given honor to, muſt then give account,
whether you improved it to his honor? In
the fear of God, Sirs, caſt up your accounts in
time, and bethink you what anſwer will then
ſtand good: It will be a doleful hearing to a
guilty ſoul, when Chriſt ſhall ſay, I gave thee
thirty or fourty years time: thy fleſh had
ſo much in eating, and drinking, and
ſleeping, and labouring, in idleneſs and vain
talking, and recreations, and other vanities;
but where was my part? how much was laid
out for the promoting of my glory? I lent you
ſo much of the wealth of the world; ſo much
was ſpent on your backs, and ſo much on your
bellies, ſo much on coſtly toyes, or ſuperfluities,
ſo much in revengeful ſuits and contentions,
and ſo much was left for your poſterity; but
where was my part? how much was laid out to
further the Goſpel, and to relieve the ſouls
or the bodies of your brethren? I gave thee a
family, and committed them to thy care to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
them for me, and fit them for my ſervice:
but how didſt thou perform it? O Brethren,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52141:36"/>
bethink you in time what anſwer to make to
ſuch Interrogatories; your judge hath told
you, that your doom muſt then paſs according
as you have improved your talents for him;
and that he that hideth his Talent, though he
give God his own, <hi>ſhall be caſt into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
where is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi>
Mat. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 30. How eaſily will Chriſt then evince
his right in you, and convince you that it was
your duty to have lived unto him? Do you
think ſirs, that you ſhall then have the face to
ſay, I thought Lord, that I had been made and
redeemed for my ſelf? I thought I had nothing
to do on earth, but live in as much plenty as I
could, and pleaſure to my fleſh, and ſerve thee
on the by, that thou mighteſt continue my
proſperity, and ſave me when I could keep the
world no longer; I knew not that I was thine,
and ſhould have lived to thy glory. If any of
you plead thus, what ſtore of Arguments hath
Chriſt to ſilence you! He will then convince
you, that his Title to you was not queſtionable:
He will prove that thou waſt his by thy very
Being, and fetch unanſwerable Arguments
from every part and faculty: He will prove it
from his Incarnation, his life of humiliation,
his bloody ſweat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his crown of Thorns, his
Croſs, his Grave; He that had wounds to ſhew
after his Reſurrection, for the convincing of a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52141:36"/>
doubting Diſciple, will have ſuch Scars to
ſhew then, as ſhall ſuffice to convince a ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
Rebel: All theſe ſhall witneſs that he was
thy rightful Lord: He will prove it alſo from the
diſcoveries of his Word, from the warnings
of his Miniſters, from the mercies which thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivedſt
from him, that thou waſt not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of his Right, and of thy duty; or at leaſt,
not ignorant for want of meanes: He will
prove it from thy Baptiſmal Covenant and
renewed engagements: The Congregation
can witneſs that you did promiſe to be his, and
ſeale to it by the reception of both his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:
And as he will eaſily prove his right:
ſo will he as eaſily prove, that you denyed it to
him: He will prove it from your Works, from
the courſe of your life, from the ſtreame of
your thoughts, from your love, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the reſt of the affections of your

                  <p>O Brethren, what a day will that be, when
Chriſt ſhall come in perſon with thouſands of
his Angels, to ſit in judgment on the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
world, and claim his due which is now
denyed him: when Plaintiff and Defendant
Witneſſes and Jurors, Councellors and Juſtices
Judges, and all the Princes on Earth, ſhall
ſtand equal before the impartial Judge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52141:37"/>
to be ſentenced to their unchangeable
ſtate: then if a man ſhould ask you, [what
think you now, Sir, of living to God? Is it
better to be devoted to him, or to the fleſh?
which now do you take for the better maſter?
what would you do now, if it were all to do
again?] what would you then ſay to ſuch a
Queſtion? how would you anſwer it? would
you make as light of it as now you do? O
ſirs, you may hear theſe things now from your
poor fellow-creature, as proud-hearted Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,
or as ſelf-conceited Deriders, or as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted

I muſt expect, that thoſe of you that are taken,
and are neereſt to the pit, ſhould be leaſt fearful
of the danger, and moſt confident to eſcape,
though you are conſcious that you live not

50. 22.</p>
                  <p>Beloved Hearers, Believe as you pretend to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52141:39"/>
Believe, and then live as you do Believe; If you
believe that you are not your <hi>own,</hi> but his
that made you, and bought you with a <hi>Price,</hi>
and that he will thus try you for your lives,
and everlaſting comforts, on this Queſtion,
Whether you have lived to him, or to your
ſelves? then live as men that <hi>do indeed believe it.</hi>
Let your Religion be viſible, as well as audible;
and let thoſe that ſee your lives, and obſerve
the ſcope of your endeavours, ſee that you <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
it. But if you believe not theſe things,
but are Infidels in your hearts, and think you
ſhall feel neither pain nor pleaſure when this
life is ended, but that man dyeth as the beaſt,
then I cannot wonder if you live as you believe.
He that thinks he ſhall dye like a Dogg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is like
enough to live like a Dogg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even in his filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and in ſnarling for the bones of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vanities, which the Children do contemn.</p>
                  <p>Having ſpoken this much by way of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
I ſhall add a few words for your more
particular direction that you may ſee to what
my Exhortation doth tend, and it may not be
loſt.</p>
                  <p>1. Be ſure that you look to the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of your heart, in this great buſineſs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting
your ſelves to God; eſpecially ſee,</p>
                  <p>1. That you diſcern and ſoundly believe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52141:39"/>
that excellency in God, which is not in the
Creature; and that perfect felicity in his love,
and in the promiſed glory, which will eaſily
pay for all your loſſes.</p>
                  <p>2. And that upon a deliberate comparing
him with the pleaſures of this world, you do
reſolvedly renounce them, and dedicate your
ſelves to him.</p>
                  <p>3. And ſpecially that you ſearch carefully
leſt any <hi>Reſerve</hi> ſhould lurk in your hearts and
you ſhould not deliver up your ſelves to him
abſolutely, for life and death, for better and
worſe, but ſhould ſtill retain ſome hopes of an
earthly felicity, and not take the <hi>unſeen</hi> felicity
for your portion: <hi>It is the lot of the wicked to
have their portion in this life, Pſal.</hi> 17. 14. And
let me here warn you of one deluſion, by which
many thouſands have periſhed, and cheated
themſelves out of their everlaſting hopes: they
think that it is only ſome groſſer diſgracefull
ſins, as ſwearing, drunkenneſs, whoredom,
injuſtice, &amp;c. that will prove mens perdition;
and becauſe they are not guilty of theſe, they
are ſecure, when as it is the predominancy of
the intereſt of the fleſh, againſt the intereſt of
God in their hearts and lives, that is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
evidence of a ſtate of Damnation, which
way ſoever it be that this is expreſſed. Many a
civil Gentleman hath his heart more addicted
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52141:40"/>
to his worldly intereſt, and leſs to God, then
ſome Whoremongers and Drunkards. If you
live with good reputation for Civility, yea for
extraordinary ingenuity, yea for religious zeal,
and no diſgracefull vice is perceived in your
lives; yet if your hearts be on thoſe things which
you poſſeſs, and you love your preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
better then God and the glory that
he hath promiſed, your caſe is as dangerous as
the Publicans and Harlots; you may ſpend
your days in better reputation but you will end
them in as certain deſolation as they. The
Queſtion is only, Whether God have your
hearts and lives? and not, Whether you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
them to him with a plauſible Civility:
nay it is meerly for their carnal elves, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their reputation, that ſome men do forbear
thoſe groſſer, Crimes, when yet God hath as
little of them as of the more viſibly prophane.
<hi>Love not the world nor the things that are in the
world; If any man love the world, the love of the
Father is not in him.</hi> 1 John 2. 15.</p>
                  <p>2. If you are <hi>wholly,</hi> Gods, live <hi>wholly</hi> to
him, at leaſt do not ſtint <hi>him,</hi> and grudge him
your ſervice. It is grown the common Conceit
of the World, that a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fe of Abſolute Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to God, is more adoe then needs. What
needs all this adoe, ſay they; cannot you be
ſaved with leſs adoe then this! I will now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52141:40"/>
of theſe men but an Anſwer to theſe few

                     </gap>ons.</p>
                  <p>1. Do you fear giving more to God then
his due? Is not all his <hi>own?</hi> And how can you
give him more then all?</p>
                  <p>2. He is not ſo backward in giving to you,
that <hi>owes</hi> you nothing, but gives you plenty,
variety and continuance of all the good you
enjoy; and do you think you well requite
him?</p>
                  <p>3. Chriſt ſaid not of his life and precious
blood, It is too much; And will you ſay of
your poor unprofitable Service, It is too
much?</p>
                  <p>4. Who will you give that to which you
ſpare from God? that time, and ſtudy, and
love and labour? to any that hath more right
to it or better deſerves it, or will better reward
you then he will do?</p>
                  <p>5. Are you afraid of being loſers by him?
have you cauſe for ſuch Fears; is be unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
or unable to performe his Promiſes? will
you repent when you come to heaven, that you
did too much to get it? will not that bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
pay you to the full?</p>
                  <p>6. What if you had not wages but your work?
is it not better to live to God then to man? is
not purity better then impurity? If feaſting
he grievous, it is becauſe you are ſick; if the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52141:41"/>
be your pleaſure, it is becauſe you are
ſwine, and not becauſe the condition is deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>7. Will it comfort you more in the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and review, to have laid out your ſelves
for God, or for the World? Will you then
wiſh that you had done leſs for heaven, or for
earth? Sirs, theſe Queſtions, are eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
if you are but willing to conſider
them.</p>
                  <p>8. Doth it be ſeem thoſe to be afraid of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God too much, that are ſuch bankrupts
as we are, and are ſure that we ſhall not give
him the twentieth part of his due, if we do the
beſt we can: and when the beſt that are ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the world for their forwardneſs, do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
themſelves for their backwardneſs! yea
could we do all, <hi>we are but unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
and ſhould do but our duty, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10.
Alas, how little cauſe have we to fear leſt we
ſhould give God too much of our hearts or of
our lives?</p>
                  <p>3. If you are not your <hi>own,</hi> remember that
nothing elſe is your <hi>own;</hi> what can be more
your own then your ſelves?</p>
                  <p>1, Your Parts and Abilities of minde or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
are not your own; uſe them therefore for
him that owneth them.</p>
                  <p>2. Your Authority and Dignities are not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52141:41"/>
your <hi>own;</hi> ſee therefore that you make the beſt
of them for him that lent them you.</p>
                  <p>3. Your Children themſelves are not your
own; deſign them for the utmoſt of his ſervice
that truſts you with them; educate them in
that way as they may be moſt ſerviceable to
God. It is the great wickedneſs of too many of
our Gentry, that they prepare their Poſterity
only to live plenteouſly and in credit in the
world, but not to be ſerviceable to God or the
Commonwealth. Deſign them all that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
to Magiſtracy or Miniſtry, or ſome uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
way of life: And whatever be their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
endeavour to poſſeſs them with the
fear of the Lord, that they may devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to him. Think not the Preaching of
the Goſpel a work too low for the Sons of
the Nobleſt perſon in the Land. It would be
an excellent furtherance to the work of the
Goſpel, if Noble men and Gentlemen would
addict their Sons to the Miniſtry that are fit
for it, and can be ſpared from the Magiſtracy;
They might have more reſpect from their
People, and eaſier Rule them, and might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
win them with bounty then poor men can
do: They need not to contend with them for
Tythes or maintenance.</p>
                  <p>4. If you are not your <hi>own,</hi> your whole
Families are not your <hi>own:</hi> uſe them therefore
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52141:42"/>
as Families that are dedicated to God.</p>
                  <p>5. If you are not your <hi>own,</hi> then your wealth
is not your own honour God therefore with
your ſubſtance, and with the firſt fruits of
your increaſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 9. Do you ask how?
Is there no poor people that want the faithful
preaching of the Goſpel for want of means or
other furtherance? Is there no godly Scholers
that want means to maintain them at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,
to fit them for this Work? Is there
no poor Neighbors about you, that are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that if you buy them Bibles and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmes,
and hire them to learn them, might
come to knowledge and to life? Are there no
poor Children that you might ſet Apprentices
to godly Maſters, where ſoul and body might
both have helps? The poor you have always
with you. It is not for want of objects for your
charity, if you hide your Talents or conſume
them on your ſelves; the time is coming when it
would do you more good to have laid them out
to your maſters uſe then in pampering the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Some grudge that God ſhould have the
Tenths, that is, that they ſhould be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
to the maintenance of his ſervice;
but little do theſe conſider that <hi>All</hi> is <hi>His,</hi> and
muſt <hi>All</hi> be accounted for. Some queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
now there be ſuch a ſin as Sacriledge in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but little do they conſider that every ſin
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52141:42"/>
is a king of ſacriledge. When you dedicated
your ſelf to God, you dedicated all you had;
and it was Gods before; do not take if from
him again remember the halving of <hi>Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as!</hi>
and give God all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection,</hi> But muſt we not provide for our
Families?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Yes, becauſe God requires it and
in ſo doing you render it to him: That is given
to him, which is expended in obedience to him,
ſo be it you ſtill prefer his moſt eminent inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If you are not your <hi>own,</hi> then muſt
not your Works be principally for your ſelves,
but for him that <hi>oweth</hi> you. As the ſcope of
your lives muſt be to the honor of your Lord,
ſo be ſure that you hourly renew theſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
when you ſet your foot out of your doors,
ask whether your buſineſs you go upon be for
God: when you go to your Reſt, examine
your ſelves what you have done that day for
God; eſpecially let no opportunity over-ſlip you,
wherein you may do him extraordinary ſervice.
You muſt ſo perform the very labours of your
Callings, that they may be ultimately for God;
ſo love your deareſt friends and enjoyments,
that it be God that is principally loved in them.</p>
                  <p>More particularly as to the buſineſs of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52141:43"/>
Day, what need I ſay more then in a word to
apply this general Doctrine to your ſpeciall
Work?</p>
                  <p>If the Honourable Judges, and the Juſtices
will remember, that they are Gods, and not
their own, what a Rule and ſtay will it be to
them for their Work? what an anſwer will it
afford them againſt all ſollicitations from car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſelf or importunate friends? <hi>viz.</hi> I am not
mine own nor come I hither to do mine own
Work; I cannot therefore diſpoſe of my ſelf or
it, but muſt do as he that <hi>owes</hi> me, doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
me, How would this alſo incite them
to promote Chriſts intereſt with their utmoſt
power and faithfully to <hi>own</hi> the Cauſes which
lie <hi>owneth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. If all Councellors and Solliciters of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
did truly take themſelves for Gods, and not
their <hi>own,</hi> they durſt not plead for, nor ſollicite
a Cauſe which they knew God diſowneth;
They would remember that what they do
againſt the Innocent, or ſpeak againſt a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Cauſe, is done and ſaid againſt their
Lord from whom they may expect ere long to
hear, In as much as you ſaid, or did this againſt
the leaſt of theſe, you ſaid, or did it againſt
me. God is the great Patron of Innocency,
and the pleader of every righteous Cauſe; and
he that will be ſo bold as to plead againſt him,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52141:43"/>
had need of a large Fee to ſave him harmleſs.
Say not, it is your Calling which you muſt live
by, unleſs you that once liſted your ſelves in
your Baptiſm under Chriſt will now take pay &amp;
make it your profeſſion to fight aggainſt him:
The emptier your Purſes are of Gain ſo got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
the richer you are; at leaſt the fuller they
are, you are ſo much the poorer; As we that
are Miniſters do find by experience, that it was
not without provocation from us, that God of
late hath let looſe ſo many Hands, and Pens,
and Tongues againſt us though our calling is
more evidently owned by God, then any one in
the world beſides; ſo I doubt not but you may
find upon due examination, that the late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
which hath been caſt upon your profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is a reproof of your guilt from God who
did permit it. Had Lawyers and Divines leſs
lived to themſelves, and more to God, we
might have eſcaped, if not the ſcourge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
Tongues, yet at leaſt the laſhes of
Conſcience. To deal freely with you, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
it is a matter that they who are ſtrangers
to our profeſſion, can ſcarce put any fair
conſtruction upon; that the worſt cauſe for a
little money ſhould find an Advocate among
you! This deiveth the ſtanders by upon this
harſh Dilemma, to think that either your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
or your Conſciences, are very
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52141:44"/>
bad. If indeed you ſo little know a good cauſe
from a bad, then it muſt needs tempt men to
think you very uhskilful in your profeſſion.
The ſeldom and ſmaller differences of Divines,
in a more ſublime and myſterious profeſſion,
is yet a diſcovery ſo far of their ignorance,
and is imputed to their diſgrace: But when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every Cauſe, even the worſt that comes
to the Barr, ſhall have ſome of you for it, and
ſome againſt it; and in the palpableſt caſes you
are ſome on one ſide, and ſome on the other,
this ſtrange difference of your judgements,
doth ſeem to bewray their weakneſs: But if
you know the Cauſes to be bad which you De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
and to be good which you oppoſe, it more
evidently bewrayes a deplorate Conſcience:
I ſpeak not of your innocent of excuſable
miſtakes in Caſes of great difficulties; not yet
of excuſing a Cauſe bad in the main from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
aggravations; But when Money will hire
you to plead for injuſtice againſt your own
knowledge, and to uſe your wits to defraud the
Righteous, and ſpoil his Cauſe or vex him with
delays for the advantage of your unrighteous
Clyent, I would not have your Conſcience for
all your gains, nor your Accomp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to make for
all the world; Its ſad that any known unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Cauſe ſhould have a profeſſed Chriſtian
in the face of a Chriſtian Judicature to defend
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52141:44"/>
it, and <hi>Sathan</hi> ſhould plead by the Tongues of
men ſo deeply engaged to Chriſt: But its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
more ſad, that almoſt every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
Cauſe ſhould find a Patron; and no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
malicious perſon ſhould be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to do wrong, then ſome Lawyers to defend
him, for a (dear bought) Fee! Did you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
obey God, and ſpeak not a word againſt
your judgement, but leave every unjuſt man to
defend his own Cauſe, what peace would it
bring to your Conſciences? what honour to
your now reproached Profeſſion? what relief
to the oppreſſed? and what an excellent cure
to the troubleſome contentions of proud or
malicious men?</p>
                  <p>3. To your Jurers and Witneſſes I ſhall
ſay but this, you alſo are not your own; and
he that <hi>oweth</hi> you, hath told you, <hi>That he will
not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his Name in
vain:</hi> Its much into your hands that the
law hath committed the Cauſe of the Juſt;
ſhould you betray it by perjury and falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
while there is a Conſcience in your guilty
breaſt, and a God in Heaven you ſhall not
want a witneſs of your ſin, or a revenger of the
oppreſſed, if the blood of Chriſt on your ſound
repentance do not reſcue you.</p>
                  <p>4. If Plantiff and Defendant did well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that they are not their own, they would
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52141:45"/>
not be too prone to quarrels, but would loſe
their right, when God the chief Proprietor did
require it. Why do you not rather take
wrong and ſuffer your ſelves to be defrauded,
then do wrong and defraud, and that your
Brethren? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I earneſtly intreat you all that
have heard me this day, that when you come
home, you will betake your ſelves to a ſober
conſideration of the claim that God hath laid
to you, and the Right he hath in you, and all
that you have; and reſolve without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delay to give him his <hi>own,</hi> and give it not
to his enemies, and yours. When you ſee the
Judgement ſet, and the Priſoners waiting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their ſentence, remember with what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable
Glory and Terror your Judge
will ſhortly come to demand his due; and what
an enquiry muſt be made into the tenor of
your lives. As you ſee, the Ecclipſed Sun
withdraw its light,<note place="margin">This Sermon was proached in the time of the Ecclipſe.</note> ſo remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
how before this dreadful
final Judgement, the Sun and
Moon, and whole frame of Nature ſhall be
diſſolved! and how God will withdraw the
light of his countenance from thoſe that have
neglected him in the day of their Viſitation.
As ever you would be <hi>His,</hi> then ſee that you
be <hi>His</hi> now: <hi>own</hi> him as your abſolute Lord, if
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52141:45"/>
you expect he ſhould <hi>own</hi> you then as his
People. Woe to you that ever you were
Born, if you put God then to diſtrain for his
<hi>Due,</hi> and to take that up in your puniſhment,
which you denyed to give him in voluntary
obedience. You would all be <hi>His,</hi> in the time
of your extremity; then you cry to him, as your
God for deliverance. Hear him now if you
would then be heard: live to him now, and
live with him for ever. A Popiſh Prieſt can
perſwade multitudes of Men and Women, to
renounce the very poſſeſſion of worldly Goods,
and the exerciſe of their outward Callings, in a
miſtaken devotedneſs to God. May not I then
hope to prevail with you, to devote your ſelves
with the fruit of your Callings, and Poſſeſsions
to his unqueſtionable ſervice? Will the Lord
of mercy but faſten theſe perſwaſions upon
your hearts, and Cauſe them to prevail; what a
happy day will this prove to us all. God will
have his <hi>Own!</hi> the Church will have your utmoſt
help, the ſouls of thoſe about you will have
the fruit of your diligence and good examples,
the Common-Wealth will have the fruit of
your fidelity, the poor will have the benefit of
your charity, I ſhall have the deſired end of
my labour, and your ſelves will have the great
and everlaſting gain.</p>

                  <p>The chiefe ſcope of the Pſalm is, To fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell

                  <p>1. Whether the Lord in v. 11. and the Son in v.
12. be both meant of Chriſt the ſecond perſon?</p>
                  <p>2. Whether the Anger here mentioned, be the
anger of the Father or the Son [<hi>leſt he angry.</hi>]
I might ſpend much time here to litle purpoſe,
in ſhewing you the different judgement of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
of theſe when in the iſſue there is no great
difference which way ever we take them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:52141:50"/>
3. What is meant by [Kiſſing the Son]
I anſwer, According to it's threefold ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it hath a threefold duty contained in
it.</p>
                  <p>1. We kiſs the feet in token of Subjection;
ſo muſt we kiſs the Son.</p>
                  <p>2. We kiſs the hand in token of Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
ſo muſt we kiſs the hand of Chriſt; that
is, Reſign our ſelves to him, and expect all our
happineſs and receivings from him.</p>
                  <p>3. We kiſs the mouth in token of love and
friendſhip; and ſo alſo muſt we kiſs the
Son.</p>
                  <p>4. What is meant by [<hi>Periſhing in the way</hi>]
I anſwer, (omitting the variety of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations)
it is their ſudden unexpected periſhing
in the heat of their rage, and in purſuit of
their deſigns dgainſt the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I know no other terms of any great difficulty
here.</p>
                  <p>Many Obſervations might be hence raiſed:
As,</p>
                  <p>1. Serving the Lord is the great work and
buſineſs that the World hath to do.</p>
                  <p>2. This ſervice ſhould be accompanyed
with rejoycing.</p>
                  <p>3. So ſhould it alſo with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:52141:50"/>
4. There is no ſuch oppoſition between
ſpiritual Joy and Fear, but that they may and
muſt conſiſt together.</p>
                  <p>5. Scripture uſeth familiar expreſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
mans communion with Chriſt (ſuch as
this; <hi>Kiſs the Son.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>6. There is anger in God, or that which we
cannot conceive better of then under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Anger.</p>
                  <p>7. There is a way to kindle this Anger; it is
man that kindleth it.</p>
                  <p>8. The way to kindle it chiefly, is, not kiſsing
the Son.</p>
                  <p>9. The kindling of it will be the periſhing of
the ſinner.</p>
                  <p>10. The Enemies of Chriſt ſhall periſh ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
and unexpectedly.</p>
                  <p>11. A little of Gods anger will utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
them.</p>
                  <p>12. They are bleſſed men that ſcape it, and
miſerable that muſt feeel it.</p>
                  <p>13. It is therefore notorious folly to neglect
Chriſt and ſtand out.</p>
                  <p>14. Kings, Judges, and Rulers of the
earth, are the firſt men that Chriſt ſummons
in, and the chief in the Calam tie if they ſtand
out.</p>
                  <p>But I will draw the ſcope of the Text into
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52141:51"/>
this one Doctrine; in the handling whereof, I
ſhall ſpend the time allotted me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> No power or priviledge can ſave that
man from the fearful ſudden conſuming wrath
of God, that doth not unfeignedly love, depend
upon, and ſubject himſelf unto the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>If they be the greateſt Kings aud Judges,
yet if they do not kiſs the Mouth, the Hand,
the Feet of Chriſt, his wrath will be kindled,
and they will periſh in the way of their rebellion
and neglect.</p>
                  <p>In handling this point I ſhall obſerve this
Order.</p>
                  <p>1. I will ſhew you what this love, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and ſubjection are.</p>
                  <p>2. What wrath it is that will thus kindle and
conſume them.</p>
                  <p>3. Why this kiſsing the Son is the only way
to eſcape it.</p>
                  <p>4. Why no Power or Priviledge elſe can
procure their eſcape.</p>
                  <p>5. The Application.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, I ſhall only give you a naked
deſcription, wiſhing that I had time for a fuller
explication.</p>
                  <p>1. Subjection to Chriſt is, The acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52141:51"/>
of his abſolute ſoveraignty both as he
is God Creator and as Redeemer, over all the
world, and particularly our ſelves; and a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
conſent to this his overaignty, eſpecially
that he be our Lord, and his Laws our Rule,
and a delivering up our ſelves to him to be
governed accordingly.</p>
                  <p>2. This dependence on Chriſt is, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
the ſufficiency of his ſatisfaction,
and his power, and willingneſs to ſave all that
receive him manifeſted in his free univerſal
offer in the Goſpel we do heartily accept him
for our only Saviour, and accordingly (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
all other) do wait upon him belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
for the benefits of his ſufferings and
office, and the performance of his faithful
Covenant to us, in reſtoring us to all the
bleſſings which we loſt, and advancing us to a
for greater everlaſting Glory.</p>
                  <p>3. This affection to Chriſt is, when in the
knowledge and ſenſe of his love to us, both
common and eſpecial, and of his own excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
and the bleſſedneſs of enjoying him, and
the Father, and life by him; our hearts do
chuſe him and the Father b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him as our only
happineſs, and accordingly love him above all
things in the world.</p>
                  <p>As this three fold Deſcription containeth
the ſum of the Goſpel, ſo hath it nothing but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52141:52"/>
what is of neceſſity to ſound Chriſtianity. If
any one of theſe three be not found in thy
heart, either I have little, skill in Divinity, or
thou haſt no true Chriſtianity, nor canſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in that condition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But doth not the Scripture make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the condition of the Covenant? but here
is a great deal more then believing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sometime Faith is taken in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
ſenſe, and then it is not made the ſole
condition of the New Covenant, but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and forgiving others, are joyned with it as
conditions of our forgiveneſs; and obedience,
and perſeverance as conditions of our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
juſtification and ſalvation. But when
Faith is made the ſole condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
then it comprehendeth eſſentially (not
only ſuppoſeth as precedent or concomitant)
if not all three, yet at leaſt the two firſt of the
fore deſcribed qualifications, <hi>viz.</hi> Dependence
and Subjection; which if it were well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
would much free the common ſort of
Chriſtians from their ſoul deſtroying miſtakes,
and the Body of Divinity from a multitude of
common errors, and our Religion from much
of that reproach of Soliſidianiſm which is caſt
upon it by the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>2. I muſt be as brief in opening the ſecond
thing, <hi>viz.</hi> What wrath is it that will thus
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52141:52"/>
kindle and conſume them? What wrath is in
God, we need not here trouble our ſelves to
enquire; But only what is intimated in the
threats or curſes of the Covenants. As there
are two Covenants, ſo each hath his proper
penalty for its violation.</p>
                  <p>1. Then ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l men do come in and ſubmit to
Chriſt, they lie under the wrath of God for all
their ſins as they are againſt the Covenant of
Works; or they are lyable to the curſe of that
Covenant: Chriſts death hath taken away the
curſe of the Covenaut, not abſolutely from any
man, but conditionally, which becomes abſolute
when the condition is performed. The Elect
themſelves are not by nature under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, but remain under the curſe of
the firſt Covenant, till they come in to
Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>2. Whoſoever rejecteth or neglecteth
this Grace, and ſo finally breaketh the New
Covenant, muſt alſo bear the curſe or penalty
thereof, beſides all the former, which will be a
far greater curſe, even as the bleſsings of this
Covenant are far greater then thoſe of the firſt.
It was a heavy puniſhment to be caſt out of
Paradiſe, and from the preſence and favour of
God, and to be curſed by him, and ſubjected to
eternal death, and all Creatures below curſed
for our ſakes, to bear all thoſe curſes and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52141:53"/>
plagues threatned in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. <hi>and</hi> 28. and to
have the wrath of God ſmoak againſt us, &amp;c.
as <hi>Deut.</hi> 29 20. <hi>But of how much ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhall he be thought worthy, that doth tread
under foot the blood of this Covenant, and do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
to the ſpirit of Grace!</hi> Heb. 10. 28, 29. It is
true, that for all other ſins, the wrath of God
cometh upon the Children of Diſobedience (or
Unperſwadableneſs) that is, on them that will
not be perſwded to obey the Lord Chriſt,
<hi>Epha</hi> 5. 6. But it is on no other with us; for this
is the condemnation <hi>that light is come into the
world, and men love darkneſs rather then light,</hi>
John 1. 19.</p>
                  <p>3. Why is this kiſsing the Son, (that is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
depending on, and ſubmitting to him)
the only way to eſcape theſe curſes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The moſt proper and primary
reaſon which can be given is, The will of the
great Law-giver, who having abſolute ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
over us might diſpoſe of us as he pleaſe,
and make us ſuch Laws and Conditions as
ſeem beſt to his wiſdom, upon which our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and ſalvation ſhould depend; He hath
reſolved that this ſhall be the only condition
and way, and that as no man ſhall be juſtified
by a meer Chriſt or his death abſtracted from
Faith (that is of Age and uſe of Reaſon:)
ſo this Faith ſhall be the condition upon which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52141:53"/>
they ſhall be juſtified: or, as a Chriſt neglected
ſhall ſave no man, ſo the accepting or receiving
of him, ſhall juſtifie and ſave them, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diton
of the Covenant performed, under which
Notion it is that Faith juſtifieth.</p>
                  <p>2. Yet other improper or ſubordinate Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
(which receive their life from the former,
and without it would be no Reaſons) may be
given; as 1. From the equity; and 2. From the
ſutbleneſs and conveniency.</p>
                  <p>1. It is but equal that he who hath bought
us, and that ſo dearly, and from a ſtate ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
and deſperate as we were in, ſhould
be acknowledged and accepted for our Saviour
and our Lord; and that we who are not our
own, <hi>but are bought with a price, ſhould glorifie
him with our bodies and ſouls which are his,</hi>
1 Cor. 6. 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. 23. Epecially when for that
end he both <hi>dyed</hi> aud <hi>roſe again,</hi> that he might
rule or be Lord over both <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>dead,</hi> Rom.
14. 9. If one of you ſhould buy a man from
the Galleyes or Gallowes, with the price of
your whole eſtate, or the life of your only
Son: would you not expect that he ſhould
be at your diſpoſe? that he ſhould love you,
depend on you and be ſubject to you?</p>
                  <p>2. And as ſalvation by free Grace through
Chriſt is a way moſt ſutable to Gods honor,
and to our own neceſsities and low condition,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52141:54"/>
ſo in ſubordination thereto, the way of
believing is moſt rationally conducible to the
ſame ends. As we could not have had a fitter
way to the Father then by Chriſt, ſo neither
could there be a fitter way to Chriſt, or means
to partake of him then by Faith. For though
I cannot call it the inſtrumental Cauſe of our
juſtification, either Active or Paſsive; yet is
this Faith (or Acceptation of Chriſt, for our
Saviour and King, which is here called [<hi>Kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Son</hi>] the faireſt condition that we could
reaſonably expect, and the moſt apparently
tending to the honor of our Redeemer; apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and appropriating to our ſelves the perſon,
righteouſneſs, and benefits procured and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the leaſt of the houor of the
Work. All we do is but to accept what Chriſt
hath procured, and that muſt be by the ſpecial
aſsiſtance of his Spirit too.</p>
                  <p>4. The fourth thing I promiſed, is to ſhew
you, Why no other Priviledge or Power in the
world can ſave him that doth not kiſs the
Son? It may here ſuffice, that I have ſhewed
you Gods determination to the contrary. But
further conſider if any ſhonld hope to ſcape
by their Dignities, Titles, Friends, Strength or
any other endowments, or virtuous qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)

power to perform it?</p>

1. They muſt reſiſt the unreſiſtible will of
God; They muſt do that which Heaven or
Earth, Men or Devils were never able yet to
do: They have reſiſted his Laws and his love;
but they could never reſiſt his purpoſe or his
power. The power that undertaketh to ſave
the Enemy or Neglecter of Chriſt, muſt firſt
overcome the power of the Almighty, and
conquer him that doth command the World:
And who hath the ſtrength that is ſufficient for
this? Sinner, before thou venture thy ſoul upon
ſuch a mad conceit, or think to be ſaved whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God will or not, try firſt thy skill and
ſtrength in ſome inferiour attempt; Bid the
Sun or Moon ſtand ſtill in the Firmament, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the ſeveral ſeaſons of the year. Bid the
ſnow and froſt to come in Summer, and the
flowers and fruits to ſpring in Winter: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the ſtreams to turn their courſe, or the
Tide its times, or the winds their motion. If
theſe will obey thee, and thy word can prevail
with them againſt the Law of their Creator,
then maiſt thou proceed with a greater confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and courage, and have ſome hopes to
ſave the neglecters of Chriſt: Or try firſt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou canſt ſave thy preſent life againſt the
courſe of nature and will of God; call back
thine age and years that are paſt, command thy
pains and ſickneſs to be gone: chide back this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52141:55"/>
bold approaching death: Will they not obey
thee? Canſt thou do none of theſe? How then
canſt thou expect the ſaving of thy ſoul againſt
the determinate will and Way of God? Where
dwelleth that man, or what was his name, that
did neglect Chriſt, and yet eſcape damnation?
Who hath hardned himſelf againſt him, and
hath proſpered? <hi>Job</hi> 9. 4. And doſt thou think
then to be the firſt? Thou maiſt perhaps knock
boldly at the Gate of Heaven; and plead thy
Greatneſs, thy virtues, thy Almsdeeds and formal
devotion: but thou ſhalt receive a ſadder an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
then thou doſt expect: <hi>Jeſus</hi> we know
and <hi>obediential</hi> Faith in him we know; but
who are ye?</p>
                  <p>2 He that will ſave the ſoul that loveth
not, dependeth not on and ſubjecteth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to Chriſt, muſt firſt make falſe the word of
God, and make the true and faithful God a
lyer; this is another part of his task; God
hath given it under his hand for truth, <hi>That
he that believeth not, is condemned already,</hi> Joh.
3. 18. <hi>That he ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of
God abideth on him,</hi> Joh. 3. 36. That they who
are invited to Chriſt, and make light of it, or
make excuſes, <hi>ſhall never taſte of his Supper,</hi>
Luke 14. 24. Mat. 22. 5. 8. <hi>That it ſhall be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for</hi> Sodom <hi>in the day of Judgement, then for
that City which refuſeth the offers of the Goſpel,</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:52141:55"/>
Mat. 12. 15. That whoſoever would not have
Chriſt to raign over them, <hi>ſhall be brought forth
at laſt, and deſtroyed before him as his Enemies,</hi>
Luk. 19. 27. <hi>That they ſhall all be damned that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not the truth but have pleaſure in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi>
2 Theſ. 2. 12, &amp;c. And hath the Almighty
ſaid that thus it ſhall be? Who then is he that
dare ſay it ſhall not be? Is this the concluded
Decree of Heaven? what power or policy is able
to reverſe it? hath God ſaid it &amp; wil he not do it?</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee his task, that will undertake
to ſave one neglecter of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>2. Let us now conſider, what Power that is
that muſt perform it: If it be done, it muſt be
either, 1. By Wiſdom: or 2. By Strength;
whereas the chiefeſt of men even the Kings and
Judges of the Earth, are both ignorant and
Impotent.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Ignorant.</hi> Though Judges are learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the repute of the World: Alas, poor
crawling breathing duſt! Do you know the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of your Maſters counſel? and are you
able to over reach them, and fruſtrate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns?
Doth this Book know what is written in
it? Can the Seat you ſit on, over-top your
counſels? more likely then for you to over-top
the Lord: ſilly worms, you know not what God
is, nor know you any one of his unrevealed
thoughts, no more then that Pillar doth know
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52141:56"/>
your thoughts: you know not what you are
your ſelves, nor ſee any further then the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of your skin; what is thy ſoul? and
when didſt thou receive it? Doſt thou know
its form, or didſt thou feel it enter? which part
didſt thou feel it firſt poſſeſs? Thou canſt call
it a Spirit, but knowſt thou what a Spirit is? or
rather only what it is not; Thou knoweſt not
that whereby thou knoweſt; and how was thy
body formed in the womb? what was it an
hundred years agoe? what is that vital heat
and moiſture? what cauſeth that order and
(diverſity of its parts? when will the moſt expert
Anatomiſts and Phyſitians be agreed? Why,
there are myſteries in the ſmalleſt worm which
thou canſt not reach; nor couldſt thou reſolve
the doubts ariſing about an Ant or Atome,
much leſs about the Sun, or Fire, or Air or

ſelf, nor the ſmalleſt part of thy ſelf, nor the
ſmalleſt Creature? and yet canſt thou over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach
the everlaſting Counſels?</p>
                  <p>2. And is thy might and Power any greater
then thy Policy? Why, what are the Kings and
Rulers of the Earth, but lumps of Clay, that can
ſpeake and go? moving ſhadows, the Flowers
of a day, a corruptible ſeed, blown up to that
ſwelled conſiſtence in which it appears, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

again; &amp; that little duſt which corruption
leaves by the force of fire, may be diſſipated yet
more, and then where is this ſpecious part of
the man? Surely now that body which is ſo
much eſteemed, is but a loathſome lump of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
fleſh, covered with a ſmooth skin,
and kept a little while from ſtinking by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence

bodies by food, one part whereof doth
turn to their vital blood and ſpirits, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ſo neere is the kin between their Beſt and
Worſt. Judge all you that have common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
whether he that cannot keep himſelf alive
an hour, and ſhortly will not be able to ſtirr a
finger to remove the worms that feed upon his
heart be able to reſiſt the ſtrengh of Chriſt, and
ſave the ſoul, that God hath ſaid and ſworn
ſhall not be ſaved? Ah poor ſouls, that have

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. You have here a Text that will fully
inform you, how you are like to ſpeed at the
Barr of Chriſt; who ſhall dye, and who ſhall
live; The great Aſſize is neare at hand, the
feet of our Judg are even at the dore; go thy way
unbelieving ſinner, when thou haſt had all the
pleaſure that ſin will afford thee, lye down in
the duſt and ſleep a while, the rouſing voice
ſhall quickly awake thee, and thine eyes ſhall
ſee that dreadfull day! O bleſſed! oh dolefull
day! bleſſed to the Saints, dolefull to the
wicked: O the rejoycing! O the lamenting
that there willbe! the triunphant ſhoutings of
joyful Saints! the hideous roaring cries of the
ungodly! when each man hath newly received
his Doom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and there is nothing but eternal
Glory, and eternall fire. Beloved hearers,
every man of you ſhall ſhortly there appeare,
and wait as the trembling priſoner at the Barr,
to hear what Doom muſt paſs upon you;
Do you not believe this? I hope you doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it. Why what would you give now to
know for certain how it ſhall then go with you?
why here is the Book by which you muſt be
judged, and here is the ſumme of it in my Text,
&amp; the grounds upon which the Judge will then
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52141:57"/>
proceed. Will you but go along with me, and
anſwer the Queſtions which hence I ſhall put to
you, and ſearch and judg your ſelves by them
as you go, and you may know what Doom you
may then expect; onely deal faithfully, and
ſearch throughly; for ſelf flatery will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
your ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>And here you muſt know; that it is the kiſs
of the heart, and not of the lips, which we muſt
here enquire after: The queſtion will not be at
the Great Day, Who hath ſpoke Chriſt fair?
or who have called themſelves by the name of
Chriſtians? or who hath ſaid the Creed or the
Lords Prayer oftneſt? or cryed, Lord, Lord?
or come to Church? for carryed a Bible? or who
hath held this opinion? or who that? It would
make a mans heart ake to think how zealouſly
men will honour the ſhadow of Chriſt and bow
at his Name, and reverence the Image of
the Croſs which he dyed on, and the
names and reliques of the Saints that dyed
for him, and yet do utterly neglect the
Lord himſelfe, and cannot endure to be
governed by him, and reſiſt his ſpirit, and
ſcorne his ſtrict and holy waies, and diſpitefully
hate them that moſt love and obey him, and yet
belive themſelves to be real Chriſtians. For God
ſake, Sirs, do not ſo delude your immortal ſouls,
as to think your Baptiſm and your outward
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52141:58"/>
devotion, and your good meanings (as you
call them) and your righteous dealing with
men, will ſerve the turn to prove you Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:
Alas, this is but with <hi>Judas,</hi> to kiſs the
mouth of Chriſt, and indeed to fetch your
death from thoſe bleſſed lips, from whence the
Saints do fetch their life: I will ſhew you ſome
ſurer ſigns then theſe.</p>
                  <p>1. And firſt let me a little enquire into your
ſubjection to Chriſt. Do you remember the
time when yon were the ſervants of ſin, and
when <hi>Sathan</hi> led you captive at his will? and
the Prince of darkneſs ruled in your ſouls?
and all within you was in a carnal peace? Do
you remember when the Spirit in the word
came powerfully upon your hearts, and bound
<hi>Sathan,</hi> and caſt him our, and anſwered all your
r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſonings, and conquered all your carnal wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and brought you from darkneſs to light,
and from the power of <hi>Sathan</hi> unto <hi>God, Acts</hi>
26. 18. Or at leaſt are you ſure, that now you
live not under the ſame Lord and Laws as the
ungodly do? Hath Chriſt now the only ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
in your ſouls? Is his word thy Law
which thou dareſt not paſs? doth it bind thy
thoughts, and rule thy tongue? and command
thy ſelf and all thou haſt? Haſt thou laid all
down at the feet of Chriſt? and reſigned thy
ſelf and all to his will? and devoted all to his
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52141:58"/>
diſpoſe and ſervice? If cuſtom bid thee curſe
and ſwear, and Chriſt forbid thee, which doſt
thou obey? If thy Appetite bid thee take thy
cups and fare deliciouſly every day; If thy
company bid thee play the good-fellow, or
ſcorn the Godly; If thy covetouſneſs bid thee
love the world, and Chriſt forbid thee, which
doſt thou obey? If Chriſt bid thee be Holy, and
walk preciſely, and be violent for Heaven and
ſtrive to enter in, and the world and the fleſh
be enemies to all this, and cry it down as te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
folly; which doſt thou obey? Doſt thou
daily and ſpiritually worſhip him in private, and
in thy Family, and teach thy Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to fear the Lord? I intreat you Sirs, deal
truly in anſwering theſe Queſtions; never man
was ſaved by the bare title of a Chriſtian; If
you are not ſubject to Chriſt, you are not
Chriſtians, no more then a Picture or a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe
is a man; and your ſalvation will be ſuch as
your Chriſtianity is: ſubjection is an eſſential
part of thy Faith, and obedience is its fruit
In ſhort then; doſt thou make him thy fear?
and tremble at his word? Dareſt thou run upon
fire, or water, ſword or canon, rather then
wilfully run upon his diſpleaſure? wouldſt
thou rather diſpleaſe thy deareſt friend, the
greateſt Prince, or thine own fleſh, then wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
provoke him? When Chriſt ſpeaks
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52141:59"/>
againſt thy ſweeteſt ſin, thy nature or cuſtom,
or credit, or life, againſt thy rooted opinions,
or thy corrupt traditions: Art thou willing to
ſubmit to all that he revealeth? Doſt thou ſay,
<hi>Speak, Lord, for thy Servant heareth? Lord,
what wouldſt thou have me to do? I am ready to
do thy will, O God,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beloved Hearers, This is the frame of every
Servant of Chriſt, and this is the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and accepting him for your Lord. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you cozen not your ſouls with ſhews and
formalities: if ever you be ſaved without this
ſubjection, it muſt be without Chriſts merits or
mercy: It muſt be in a way that Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth
not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nay, it muſt be in deſpite of God;
his truth muſt be falſified; his power muſt be
maſtered before the diſobedient can be ſaved
from his wrath.</p>
                  <p>2 Examine alſo your Dependence on Chriſt,
whether you kiſs his Hands as well as his Feet.
Do you underſtand that you are all by nature
Condemned men and lyable to the everlaſting
wrath of God? that Chriſt hath interpoſed
and paid this Debt, and bought us as his own
by the ſatisfaction of that juſtice; that all
things are now delivered into his hands, <hi>John</hi>
1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. and he is made Head over all things to
his Church <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 21, 22. Doſt thou take
him for thy onely Saviour? and believe the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52141:59"/>
Hiſtory of his Life and Paſſion, the truth of his
divine and humane nature, his Reſurrection,
his Office, and his approaching Judgement?
Doſt thou ſee that all thy ſuppoſed Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is but vanity and ſin, and that thy ſelf art
unable to make the leaſt ſatisfaction to the
Law by thy Works or Sufferings; and if his
blood do not waſh thee, and his righteouſneſs
juſtifie thee, thou muſt certainly be damned
yet, and periſh for ever? Doſt thou therefore
caſt thy ſelf into his arms, and venture thy
everlaſting ſtate upon him, and truſt him with
thy ſoul, and fetch all thy help and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from him? When ſin is remembred and
thy Conſcience troubled, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts
of judgement do amaze thy ſoul, doſt
thou then fetch thy comfort from the view of
his blood, and the thoughts of the Freeneſs
and Fulneſs of his Satisfaction, his Love,
and Goſpel-offers and promiſes? Doſt thou
ſo build upon his promiſe of a Happineſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
that thou canſt let goe all thy happineſs
here, and drink of his Cup, and be baptized
with his Baptiſm, and loſe thy life upon his
promiſe that thou ſhalt ſave it? Canſt thou
part with goods and friends, and all that thou
haſt, in hope of a promiſed Glory which thou
never ſaweſt? If thou canſt drink with him of
the Brook in the way, thou ſhalt alſo with him
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52141:60"/>
lift up the head <hi>Pſal</hi> 110 <hi>v.</hi> laſt. Doſt thou
perceive a Mediator as well as a God in all
thy mercies, both ſpecial and common, and taſt
his blood in all that thou receiveſt, and wait
upon his hand for thy future ſupplies? Why, this
is kiſſing the hand of Chriſt, and depending
upon him. O how contrary is the Caſe of the
World! whoſe confidence is like the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
worſhip; they truſt God and their Wits
and Labours; Chriſt and their ſuppoſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
I would I might not ſay, Chriſt and deceit
and wicked contrivances. Oh blaſphemous joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of heaven and hell to make up one foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of their truſt!</p>
                  <p>3. Examine a little alſo your love to Chriſt,
Do you thus kiſs the Son? do your ſouls
cleave to him, and embrace him with the
ſtrongeſt of your affections? Sirs though there
is nothing that the blind world is more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in then this [that they love Chriſt with
all their hearts] yet is there nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are more falſe and faulty; I beſeech
you therefore deal truly in anſwering here. Are
your hearts ſet upon the Lord Jeſus? do you
love him above all things in this World? do
you ſtick at your anſwer? do you not know?
ſure then at beſt you love him but little, or
elſe you could not chooſe but know it. Love
is a ſtirring and ſenſible Affection; you know
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52141:60"/>
what it is to love a Friend; Feel by this Pulſe,
whether you live or dye: Doth it beat more
ſtrongly toward Chriſt then to any thing elſe?
Never queſtion man, the neceſſity of this;
he hath concluded, <hi>If thou love any thing
more then him, thou art unworthy of him, nor
canſt be his Diſciple.</hi> Are thy thoughts of Chriſt
thy freeſt and thy ſweeteſt thoughts? are thy
ſpeeches of him thy ſweeteſt ſpeeches? when
thou awakeſt, art thou ſtill with him, and is he
next thy heart? when thou walkeſt abroad, doſt
thou take him in thy thoughts? canſt thou
ſay and lye not, that thou wert ever deeply
in love with him, that thou doſt love him but as
heartily as thou loveſt thy friend, and art as
loth to diſpleaſe him; and as glad of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and art as much troubled at his ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or abſence? Hath thy Miniſter or godly
Acquaintance ever heard thee bemoaning thy
ſoul for want of Chriſt, or inquiring what thou
ſhouldſt do to attain him: or thy Family heard
thee commending his excellency, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to kindle their affections towards him? why
love will not be hid; when it hath its deſire,
it will be rejoycing!: and when it wants, it will
be Complaining. Or at leaſt, Can thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
witneſs thy longings, thy groans, thy
prayers for a Chriſt? Wilt thou ſtand to the
Teſtimony of theſe Witneſſes? Do you love
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52141:61"/>
his weak, his poor deſpiſed Members? Do
you viſit them, cloath them, feed them to
your power? not only in a Common Natural
Compaſſion to them as they are your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors:
but do you love or relieve a <hi>Prophet</hi> in
the name of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or a <hi>Diſciple</hi> in the name
of a <hi>Diſciple? Mat</hi> 10. 40, 41, 43. ſhall all
theſe decide the Queſtion?</p>
                  <p>Beloved Hearers, I profeſs to you all in the
Name of our Lord, that it is not your bold
and confident affirming that you love Chriſt,
which will ſerve your turn when Chriſt ſhall
judge: he will ſearch deep, and judge accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the truth in the inward parts. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thouſands will then periſh as his utter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that verily thought themſelves his friends?
How eaſily now might they finde their miſtake,
if they would but be at the pains to examine
themſelves? Oh try, try, Sirs, before God try
you; judge your ſelves before Chriſt judge
you. It would grieve a mans heart that knows
what it is to love Chriſt, to believe, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to him, to ſee how rare theſe are in the
world and yet how confident and careleſs moſt
men are! It may be that you may think much
that I ſo queſtion your love; yet Chriſt that

know not your conditions or inclinations: yet
judge me not cenſorious if I fear the worſt, and
if I meaſure you by the reſt of the world; and
then I may confidently and ſadly conclude
that Chriſt hath few loving Subjects among
you. If we could hear your Oaths and vain
ſpeeches turned to heavenly ſoul-edifying diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
and your covetouſneſs to conſcionable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and ſee that the word of Chriſt were your
Law, and that you laid out your endeavours for
heaven in good earneſt, then we ſhould ſay;
<hi>Theſe People are the loving Subjects of Chriſt.</hi>
But when men are enemies to Chriſts Doctrine,
and ways and worſhip, and had rather live
after the fleſh, and the world, and the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their Fathers, and are notorious for
profaneſs, ſuperſtition and enmity to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who can chuſe but condole your caſe?
and if your obſtinacy will not endure us to help
you, yet you ſhall give us leave whether you
will or no, to lament you.</p>

to Exhortation: And oh that you would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
me with your reſolution to obey! My
buſineſs here to day is as his Herauld and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,
to proclaim the Lord Jeſus your
King and Saviour; and to know whether you
will heartily acknowledg and take him ſo to be,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52141:62"/>
or not: and to perſwade you to take ſo fair an
offer, while you may have it: and to kiſs the
Son, leſt his wrath be kindled. This is my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
here, in which if I had not ſome hope to
ſpeed, the Lord knows I would not have been

yet ever was on the face of the Earth) but is it as
common to receive Chriſt in love &amp; obedience? I
would it were I know the name of Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
the Swearer doth ſwear by it; the Beggar
begs by it, the Charmer puts it into his charms,
and the Jeſter into his jeſts, and every Papiſt
and ignorant Proteſtant doth mutter it oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
over his Prayers: But who trembleth at
it? or triumpheth in it? who maketh it his
Fear and his Joy? and give up their ſouls
and lives to be governed by Chriſt? I do here
ſolemnly proclaim to you, that the Lord Jeſus
will not be put off with your complements; he
cares not for your meer name of Chriſtianity,
nor your Cap, nor your knee; If thy heart
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52141:62"/>
be not ſet upon him, thou art none of his; His
word muſt be your Law, and you muſt
depend on him alone for ſoul and body, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
look for mercy at his hands; He is the
Author of eternal ſalvation to them (only)
<hi>that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 9.</p>
                  <p>What ſay you then, Sirs, in anſwer to my
meſſage? and what courſe do you reſolve upon?
ſhall Chriſt be your love, and your Lord, or
not? Will you kiſs the Son, or will you ſleight
him ſtil? methinks you ſhould eaſily be reſolved,
and ſay, Away with pleaſure, and credit, and
worldly gain; away with theſe bewitching de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
and companions; Chriſt hath bought my
heart, and he ſhall have it, he is my Lord, and
I will be ruled by him. Hearers, I hope God
hath kept your alive till now to ſhow you mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and brought ſome ſinners hither to day to
prevail with their hearts: And my hope is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſtrengthened by Gods diſpoſal of my own
Spirit: I was ſtrongly tempted to have preached
this Sermon in the enticing words of humane
wiſdom, tending to a proud oſtentation of
parts: But Chriſt hath aſſiſted me to conquer
the temptation, and commanded me to preach
him in plainneſs and evidence of the Spirit. I
come not to perſwade you to opinions or
factions, to be for this ſide, or for that; but to
be with all your hearts for Chriſt, as ever you
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52141:63"/>
look that Chriſt ſhould be for you: to love
him as he that hath bought you from eternal
wrath, and dyed to ſave you from the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
burnings; to lay hold on him with moſt
earneſt affectionate apprehenſion, as a man
that is ready to drown would do upon a bough,
or upon the hand of his friend that would pull
him to the ſhore: to wait for the Law of thy
direction from him, and do nothing till thou
haſt asked counſel at his word, and know his
mind whether thou ſhouldſt do it or no; till
thou feel thy Conſcience bound by his Law,
that thou canſt not ſtirr till he give thee leave;
that the commands of parents and Princes may
ſtoop to his, much more the commands of
cuſtome and company, of credit or pleaſure,
of the world or fleſh: Theſe are the things that
I exhort you to and I muſt tell you that Chriſt
doth flatly expect them at your hands.</p>
                  <p>I will here back theſe Exhortations with
ſome perſwading Conſiderations. Think of
what I ſay, and weigh it as we go. If I ſpeak
not truth and reaſon, then reject it with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
and ſpare not: but if it be and thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
tell thee ſo, take heed then how thou
doſt neglect or reject it, leſt thou be found a
fighter againſt the Spirit, and leſt the curſe of
God do ſeize upon that heart that would not
yield to truth and reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:52141:63"/>
And I will draw theſe Conſiderations only
from my Text.</p>
                  <p>1. Thou art elſe a Rebel againſt thy Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Lord. This I gather from the command
in my Text: and indeed the ſcope of the whole
<hi>Pſalm.</hi> God hath given thee into the hands of
his on and made him Lord and King of all,
&amp; commanded all men to accept him, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto him. Who can ſhew ſuch title to the
Soveraignty? ſuch right to rule thee as Chriſt
can do? He is thy maker and ſo is not Satan;
he dearly bought thee, and ſo did not the
world; <hi>Thou waſt not Redeemed with ſilver and
Gold, and corruptible things.</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18. I make
this challenge here in the behalf of Chriſt; let
any thing in the world ſtep forth and ſhew a
better title to thee, to thy heart, and to thy
life, then Chriſt doth ſhew: and let them take
thy heart, and take thy rule. But why do I
ſpeak thus? I know thou wilt confeſs it; and
yet wilt thou not yield him thy chiefeſt love and
obedience? out of thy own mouth then art
thou condemned and thou proclaimeſt thy ſelf
a knowing and wilful Rebel.</p>
                  <p>2. To deny thy affections and ſubjection to
Chriſt, is the moſt barbarous unkindneſs that a
ſinner can be guilty of. Did he pitty thee in
thy loſt eſtate, and take thee up when thou laiſt
wounded in the way, and make thee a plaiſter
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52141:64"/>
of the blood of his heart? And is this thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital?
Did he come down from heaven to
earth, to ſeek thee when thou waſt loſt, and
take upon him all thy dept, and put himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the priſon of the world and fleſh? hath he
paid for thy folly, and born that wrath of God
which thou muſt have ſuffered for ever? and
doth he not now deſerve to be entertained with
moſt affectionate reſpect? but with a few cold
thoughts inſtead of hearty love, and with a
few formal words inſtead of worſhip? What
hurt had it been to him if thou hadſt periſhed?
what would he have loſt by it if thou hadſt lain
in Hell? would not Juſtice have been glorified
upon a diſobedient wretch? Might not he have
ſaid to his Father, What are theſe worms and
ſinners to me? muſt I ſmart for their folly?
muſt I ſuffer when they have ſineed? muſt I
debaſe my ſelf to become man, becauſe they
would have exalted themſeves to become as
God? if they will needs undo themſelves, what
is it to me? if they will caſt themſelves into the
flames of Hell, muſt I go thither to fetch them
out?—Thus Chriſt might have put off the
ſuffering and the ſhame, aud let it fall and lie
where it was due: but he did not; His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
would not ſuffer him to ſee us ſuffer;
Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied, the threat muſt be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled;
Chriſt ſeeth that we cannot overcome
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52141:64"/>
it, but he can, therefore hee comes down into
fleſh, he lives on earth, he faſteth, he weepeth,
he is weary, he is tempted, he hath not a place
to put his head, he is ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed, he is ſpit upon, he
is cloathed as a fool, and made a ſcorn, he ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
blood, he is Crucified with Theeves, he
bares the burden that would have ſunk all us to
Hell; and muſt he after all this, be neglected
and forgotten? and his Laws that ſhould rule
us, be laid aſide and be accounted too ſtrict and
preciſe for us to live by? O let the Heavens
bluſh; and the Earth be aſhamed at this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
ingratitude! How can ſuch a people
ſhew their faces at his comming, or look him
in the face when he ſhall judge them for this!
would you uſe a friend thus? No, nor an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Me thinks you ſhould rather wonder with
your ſelves, that ever Chriſt ſhould give you
leave to love him, and ſay Will the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
ſuch a wretch to kiſs him? will he ſuffer
himſelf to be embraced by thoſe arms which
have been defiled ſo oft by the embracements
of ſin? will he ſo highly honour me, as to be
his ſubject and his ſervant, and to be guided by
ſuch a bleſſed and perfect Law? and doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
no harder conditions then theſe for my
ſalvation? Take then my heart, Lord it is only
thine; and oh that it were better worth thy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
or take it and make it better: the Spear
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52141:65"/>
hath opened me a paſſage to thy heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let the
Spirit open thee a paſſage into mine: deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may thoſe Gates be fuel for Hell, that would
not open to let in the King of Glory.</p>
                  <p>3. To deny thine affection and ſubjection
to the Son, is the greateſt folly and madneſs in
the world. Why doth he require this ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
at thy hands? is it for thy hurt, or for
thy good? would he make a prey of thee for
his own advantage? is it for any need hat he
hath of thee, or of thy ſervice, or becauſe thou
haſt need of him for thy direction or ſalvation?
would he ſteal away thy heart as the world
doth to delude it? would he draw thee as Satan
doth to ſerve him, that he may torment thee?
if ſo, it were no wonder that thou art ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drawn to him: but thou knoweſt ſure that
Chriſt hath none of theſe ends.</p>
                  <p>The truth is this: His dying on the Croſs,
is but part of the work that is neceſſary to thy
Salvation; this was but the paying of the debt;
he muſt give thee moreover a peculiar intereſt,
and make that to be abſolutely thine, which
was thine but conditionally; he muſt take off
thy rags, and waſh thy ſores, and qualify thy
ſoul for the prepared Glory, and bring thee
out of the priſon of ſin and death, and preſent
thee to his Father blameleſs and undefiled,
and eſtate thee in greater dignity then
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52141:65"/>
thou felleſt from: and all this muſt he do
drawing thee to himſelf, and laying himſelf
upon thee as the Prophet upon the Child, and
cloſing thy heart with his heart, and thy will
with his will, and thy thoughts and waies with
the Rule of his Word; And is this againſt thee
or for thee? is there any hurt to thee in all this?
I dare challenge Earth and Hell, and all the
Enemies of Chriſt in both, to ſhew the leaſt
hurt that ever he cauſed to the ſoul of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or the leaſt wrong to the ſoul of any.</p>
                  <p>And muſt he then have ſuch a ſtir to do
thee good? muſt he ſo beſeech thee to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and follow thee with entreaties? and yet
art thou like a ſtock that neither heare's nor
fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

againſt him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if he were about to do thee
miſchief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would rather cut thy throat then
cure thee, and were going to deſtroy thee, and
not to ſave thee? I appeal to any that hath not
renounced his Reaſon, whether this be not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
bruitiſh unreaſonableneſs; and whether
thou be not liker a beaſt, that muſt be caſt or
held while you dreſs his ſores, then to a man
that ſhould help on his own recovery? Fooliſh
Sinner! It is thy ſin that hurts thee, and not
thy Saviour: why doſt thou not rather ſtrive
againſt that? It is the Devil that would deſtroy
thee, and yet thou doſt not grudge at they obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52141:66"/>
to him. Be judge thy ſelf, whether this
be wiſe or equal dealing.</p>
                  <p>Sinner, I beſeech thee in the behalf of thy
poor ſoul, if thou have ſuch a mind to renounce
thy Saviour, do it not till thou haſt found a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Maſter; ſay as <hi>Peter, Wither ſhall we go? Lord
thou haſt the words of eternal life:</hi> And when
thou knoweſt once where to be better, then go
thy way, part with Chriſt and ſpare not: If thy
merry company, or thy honour, or thy wealth,
or all thy friends and delights in the world will
do that for thee which Chriſt hath done, and
which at laſt he will do if thou ſtick to him;
then take them for thy Gods, and let Chriſt go.
In the meane time let me prevaile with thee,
as thou are a man of reaſon, ſell not thy Saviour
till thou know for what, ſell not thy ſoul till
thou know why, ſell not thy hopes of Heaven
for nothing. God forbid that thy wilfull folly
ſhould bring thee to Hell, and there thou
ſhouldſt lie roaring and crying out for ever,
This is the reward of my neglecting Chriſt, he
would have led me to Glory, and I would not
follow him, I ſold heaven for a few merry hours,
for a little honour, and eaſe, and delight to my
fleſh: here I lie in torment, becauſe I would
not be ruled by Chriſt, but choſe my luſts and
pleaſure be fore him.—Sinner, do not
think I ſpeak harſhly or uncharitably to call

this neglect of Chriſt thy folly: As true as thou
liveſt and heareſt me this day, except thy timely

may) thou wilt one of theſe dayes befool thy
ſelf a thouſand times more then I now befool
thee, and call thy ſelf mad, and a thouſand
times mad, when thou thinkeſt how fair
thou waſt for heaven, and how ready Chriſt
was to have been thy Saviour and thy Lord,
and how light thou madeſt of all his offers:
Either this will prove true to thy coſt, or elſe
am I a falſ Prophet, and a curſed deceiver. Be
wiſe therefore, be learned, and kiſs the Son.</p>
                  <p>The former Conſiderations were drawn from
Aggravations of the ſinne; the following are
drawn from the Aggravations of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that fom the words of the Text
too.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>God will be angry if you kiſs not the Son.</hi> His
wrath is as fire, and this neglect of Chriſt is the
way to kindle it. If thou art not a Believer,
thou art condemned already: but this will bring
upon thee a double condemnation. Believe it
for a truth. All thy ſinnes as they are the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works even the moſt hainous of them,
are not ſo provoking &amp; deſtroying as thy ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

groan when thou ſhouldſt groan? and bleed
when thou ſhouldſt bleed and dye when thou

have the naked title of thy Lord and Saviour,
while thy fleſhly pleaſures and profits have

hell too hot, for ſuch an ungrateful, unworthy
wretch! Muſt I prepare thee a portion of the
blood of my Son, and wilt not thou be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
now to drink it? muſt I be at ſo much coſt
to ſave thee, and wilt thou not obey that thou
maiſt be ſaved? Go ſeize upon him juſtice, let
my wrath conſume thee, let hell devour thee,
let thy own Conſcience for ever torment
thee; ſeeing thou haſt choſen death, thou ſhalt
have it; and as thou haſt rejected Heaven, thou
ſhalt never ſee it, <hi>but my wrath ſhall abide upon

                  <p>2. As this wrath is Fire, ſo is it a conſuming
fire, and cauſeth the ſinner utterly to periſh.

refined or conſumed by its fire; but there
muſt he burn, and burn for ever, and yet be
neither conſumed nor refined. The Earth will
not feel the flames that burn it, but his ſoul

then before, as if it would turn us all to

but ſeize upon thy body what cryes and groans
and lamentations doth it raiſe? If it be on one
member, yea but a tooth, how doſt thou roar
with intolerable pain, and wouldſt not take the
world to live for ever in that condition? If it
ſeize upon the Conſcience, what torments
doth it cauſe, as if the man were already in the

ſeeth is againſt him; he feareth every bit he
eateth ſhould be his bane: If he ſleep, he
dreams of death and judgement; when he awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
his Conſcience and horror awake with
him: he is weary of living, and fearful of dying;
even the thoughts of heaven are terrible to
him, becauſe he thinks it is not for him. Oh

wrath of God! And are theſe little little ſparks
ſo intolerable hot? What then do you think
are the Everlaſting flames? Beloved Hearers, if

me tell you from God, that as ſure as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is over your head, and the earth under
your feet, except the Son of God be nearer
thy heart, and dearer to thy heart then friends,
or goods, or pleaſures, or life, or any thing in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52141:70"/>
this world, this burning wrath will never be
prevented. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26.</p>
                  <p>5. When this wrath of God is throughly
kindled, the world will diſcern the bleſſed from
the wretched; <hi>Then bleſſed are they that truſt in
him.</hi> It is the property of the wicked, to be
wiſe too late: Thoſe that now they eſteem but
preciſe fools, will then be acknowledged bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
men: Bear with their ſcorns Chriſtians in
the mean time; they will very ſhortly wiſh
themſelves in your ſtead, and would give all
that ever they were maſters of, that they had
ſought and loved Chriſt as earneſtly as you,
and had a little of your oyl when they find
their lamps are out, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 8.</p>
                  <p>And now Hearers, what is your reſolution?
perhaps you have been enemies to Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of Chriſtians: Will you be ſo
ſtill? Have you not loathed this buſie diligent
ſerving of him? and hated them that moſt
carefully ſeek him, more then the vileſt drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
or blaſpemer? Have not his word and
ſervice and ſabbaths been a burthen to you?
Have not multitudes ventured their lives
againſt his Ordinances and Government? Nay
is it not almoſt the common voice of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in effect, <hi>Give us our ſports and liberty of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
give us our Readers, and ſinging-men, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52141:70"/>
drunken Preachers, give us our Holy-daies and
Ceremonies, and the Cuſtomes of our fore-fathers;
Away with theſe preciſe fellows, they are an

controll us, this preciſe Scripture ſhall be no Law
to us,</hi> and conſequently this Chriſt ſhall not
Rule over us.</p>
                  <p>How long hath <hi>England</hi> rebelled againſt his
Government! M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                     <hi>Vdal</hi> told them in the days
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that if they would not
ſet up the Diſcipline of Chriſt, in the Church,
Chriſt would ſet it up himſelf in a way that
would make their hearts to ake. I think their
hearts have aked by this time: and as they
judged him to the Gallowes for his Prediction,
ſo hath Chriſt executed them by thouſands for
their Rebellion againſt him; and yet they are
as unwilling of his Government as ever. The
Kings of the Earth are afraid leſt Chriſts Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ſhould un-king them. The Rulers
are jealous leſt it will depoſe them from their
Dignities; even the Reformers that have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
all to ſet it up, are jealous leſt it will
incroach upon their power and priviledges.
Kings are afraid of it, and think themſelves but
half kings, where Chriſt doth ſet up his Word
and Diſcipline. Parliaments are afraid of it,
leſt it ſhould uſurp their Authority. Lawyers
are afraid of it, leſt it ſhould take away their
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52141:71"/>
gains, and the Laws of Chriſt ſhould over-top
the Laws of the Land. The people are afraid of
it, leſt it will compel them to ſubjection to that
Law and way which their ſouls abhor: Indeed
if men may be their own judges, then Chriſt
hath no enemies in <hi>England</hi> at all; we are his
friends, and all good Chriſtians: It is Preciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and Rebels that men hate, and not Chriſt;
It is not the Government of Chriſt that we are
afraid of but the domineering of aſpiring am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<hi>Preſbyters. (viz.</hi> That Generation of
godly learned, humble Miniſters, who have
done more then any before them, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
uncapable of preferment or domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
and when men diſobey and diſregard our
doctrine, it is not Chriſt, but the Preacher that
they deſpiſe and diſobey. And if the Jews
might ſo have been their own Judges, it was
not the Son of God whom they crucified, but
an enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and a blaſphemer that
works by the Devil. It was not <hi>Panl</hi> a Saint
that they perſecuted, but one that they found
to be a peſtilent fellow, and a mover of ſedition
amongſt the people. But were there no ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
perſons but Apoſtles and Chriſtians? nor
no troublers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but <hi>Elias?</hi> nor no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but Chriſt and his friends? Oh.
God will ſhortly take off the vail of hypocriſy
from the actions of the world, and make them
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52141:71"/>
confeſs that it was Chriſt they reſiſted, and that
it was his holy waies and word that did kindle
their fury; elſe would they as ſoon have fallen
upon the ungodly rabble, as they did upon the
moſt zealous and conſcionable Chriſtains:
And however you mangle and deform them
with your falſe accuſations and reproach, he
will then know and own his people and his
Cauſe, and will ſay to the world, <hi>In deſpiſing
them you deſpiſed me; and in as much as you did
it to one of theſe little ones, you did it unto me.</hi>
As D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                     <hi>Stoughton</hi> ſaith, <hi>If you ſtrike a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
and God find a Saint lie a bleeding, and you
to anſwer it, I would not be in yor coat for more
then you got by it.</hi> Hath the world ever gained
by reſiſting Chriſt? Doth it make the Crown
ſit faſter on the heads of Kings? or muſt they
not rather do to Chriſt, as King <hi>John</hi> to his
ſuppoſed Vicar, reſign their Crowns to him,
and take them from him again as his Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
before they can hold them by a certain te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure?

ſecure them? or did it bring upon them the
deſtruction wich they thought to avoid?</p>
                  <p>Or have the people been greater gainers by
this, then their Kings? What hath <hi>England</hi> got

by reſiſting his Goſpel and Government, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his ſervants, &amp; by ſcorning his holy waies?
What have you got by it in this City? what ſay
you? have you yet done with your enmity and
reſiſtance? have you enough, or would you yet
have more? If you have not done with Chriſt,
he hath not done with you; you may try again,
and follow on as farre as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> if you will, but
if you be not loſers in the latter end, I have loſt
my judgement; and if you return in peace,
God hath not ſpoken by me, (1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.

                  <p>Sirs, I am loth to leave you till the bargain

that Chriſt ſhall be your ſoveraign; his

his worſhip, your recreation; his merits,

then have him ſpeake life to thy ſoul, do thou

or in Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it may be not an 100 hours til
ſome of your ſouls muſt take their leave of
your bodies; when it comes to that, then you
will cry, Away with the world, away with my

Chriſt; why then will you not be of the ſame
mind now? When the world cryes away with
this holineſs, and praying, and talking of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!

                  <p>Oh, if it might ſtand with the will of God,
that I might chuſe what effect this Sermon
ſhould have upon your hearts; verily it ſhould
be nothing that ſhould hurt you in the leaſt but
this it ſhould be, It ſhould now faſten upon your
ſouls, and pierce into your Conſciences, as an
Arrow that is drawn out of the quiver of God;
it ſhould follow thee home to thy houſe, and
bring thee down on thy knees in ſecret, and make
thee there lament thy caſe, and cry out in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
of thy ſpirit, Lord, I am the ſinner
that have neglected thee, I have taſted more
ſweetneſs in the world then in thy blood, and
taken more pleaſure in my earthly labours and

thee, or meditating on thee; I have complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with thee by a cold profeſsion; but my heart
was never ſet upon thee:—And here ſhould
it make thee lie in tears and prayers; and follow
Chriſt with cryes and complaints, till he ſhould
take thee up from the duſt, and aſſure thee of
his pardon, and change thy heart, and cloſe it
with his own. If thou wert the deareſt friend

If it were but as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yours, what ſhould become of this Sermon,
I hope it would be the beſt Sermon to thee that
ever thou heardeſt; it ſhould lay thee at the

feet of Chriſt, and leave thee in his arms; Oh
that I did but know what Arguments
would perſwade you and what words would
work thy heart hereto. If I were ſure it would
prevail, I would come down from the Pulpit,
and go from man to man upon my knees with
this requeſt and advice in my Text; <hi>O kiſs the
Son leſt he be angry and you periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if thy heardned heart make light of all, and
thou go on ſtill in thy careleſs neglect of Chriſt,
and yet wilt not believe but thou art his friend
and ſervant, I do here from the Word, and
in the name of Chriſt, paſs this ſentence upon
thy ſoul: Thou ſhalt go hence, and perhaps
linger out in thy ſecurity a few days more, and
then be called by death to judgement, where
thou ſhalt be doomed to this everlaſting fiery
wrath. Make as light of it as thou wilt, feel it
thou ſhalt, put it off and ſcape it if thou canſt:
and when thon haſt done, go boaſt that thou
haſt conquered Chriſt: In the mean time, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
this Congregation to bear witneſs, that
thou hadſt warning.</p>
                  <p>This to all in general: My Text yet direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
me to ſpeak more particularly to the Rulers
and Judges of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Honorable and Reverend Judges, worſhipful
Magiſtrates, if you were all Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
all is one to Chriſt; you were but high
and mighty duſt and aſhes: Chriſt ſendeth
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52141:74"/>
his Summons firſt to you; he knows the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Intereſt in the Vulgar; you are the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
in the Hoſt of God and muſt do him
more ſervice then the common Soldiers: If
one of you ſhould neglect him, and ſtand out
againſt him, he will begin with you in the ſight
of the reſt, and make your greatneſs a ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
ſtone to the honour of his juſtice, that
the loweſt may underſtand what they have to
doe, when they ſee the greateſt cannot ſave
themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Shall I ſay you are wiſer then the People,
and therefore that this Admonition is needleſs
to you? No, then I ſhould accuſe the Spirit
in my Text: The Cedars of the Earth have
always hardly ſtoopt to Chriſt, which hath
made ſo many of them rooted up. Your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
are an impediment to that ſelf-abaſing
which he expecteth; your Dignities will more
tend to blind you, then to illuminate; Theres
few of any ſort, but feweſt of the great &amp; wiſe,
and mighty that are called: Yet a man would
think, that among thoſe that have held out in
theſe trying times there ſhould be no need of
theſe ſuſpitions: But hath there not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a ſucceſſion of Sinners, even of thoſe that
have beheld the ruines of their Predeceſſors?
Who would have thought, that a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that had ſeen the Wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
had pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed through the Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52141:74"/>
in a Wilderneſs with conſtant Miracles,
ſhould yet be ſuch vile Idolaters, or murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unbelievers, that only two of them ſhould
enter into Reſt? The beſt of Saints have need
of ſelf-ſuſpition and vigilancy; My advice
therefore to You is this, Learn wiſdom by the
Examples that your eyes have ſeen; <hi>Them that
honor God, he will honor; and they that deſpiſe
him, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 30.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, let me adviſe you, as your
Duty to the Son, 1. That you take your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
&amp; office as from him. I think it a doctrine
more common then true, that Miniſters only
are under Chriſt the Mediatour, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
are only under God as Creator. Chriſt
is now Lord of All, and you are his Servants:
As there is no power but from God, ſo none
from God but by Chriſt. Look upon your
ſelves as his Vicegerents; therefore do not
that which beſeemeth not a Vicegerent of
Chriſt. Remember, that as you ſee to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of the Laws of the Land, ſo will Chriſt
ſee that his Laws be obeyed by you, or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on you. Remember when you ſit, and
judge offenders, that you repreſent him that
will judge you and all the world: And oh how
lively a reſemblance have you to raiſe your
apprehenſion! Think with your ſelves: Thus
ſhall men tremble before his Barr; thus ſhall
they wait to hear their doom; and be ſure that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52141:75"/>
your judgement be ſuch, as may moſt lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
the judgement of Chriſt, that the juſt
may depart from your Barr with joy, and the
unjuſt with ſadneſs, Let your juſtice be moſt
ſevere, where Chriſt is moſt ſevere; and ſo far
as you can exerciſe your clemency, let it be
about thoſe offences which our laws are more
rigorous againſt, then the laws of God. Be
ſure yet that you underſtand the extent of your
commiſſion; that you are not the ſole officers
of Jeſus Chriſt; you are under him as he, is
head over All; Miniſters are under him as he is
head to his Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1, 22. Miniſters
are as truly the Magiſtrates Teachers, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
are their Governors; yea, by as high
and undoubted authority muſt they over-ſee,
govern, and command (miniſterially as their
Lords Embaſſadors) both Kings and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to do whatſoever is written in this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as you may command them to obey the
laws of the Land; yea and as ſtrict a bond lieth
on you to obey them ſo far as they ſpeak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this word, and keep within the bounds
of their Calling, as doth on them to obey you
in yours, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 17. Deale not with them
ſo diſſemblingly, as to call them your Paſtors,
Teachers, Over-ſeers and Rulers (as Scripture
bids you) and yet to learn of them but what you
liſt or to deny them leave to teach or adviſe you
further then they receive particular warrant &amp;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52141:75"/>
direction from your ſelves: Should our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
limit all their Miniſteriall advice to the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and directions of Parliament, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it to the warrant and directions of Chriſt;
would they not become the ſervants and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
of men? If you do not your beſt to ſet up all
the Government of Chriſt, even that in and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to his Church, as well as that which is <hi>over</hi>
them and <hi>for</hi> them; men may well think, it is
your own ſeats and not Chriſts that you would
advance. I would all the Magiſtrates in <hi>England</hi>
did well conſider, that Chriſt hath beene tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
them this ſeven yeares, that their own
peace or honours ſhall not be ſet up before his
Goſpel &amp; Government; and that they do but tire
themſelves in vain in ſuch attempts; then they
would learn to read my Text with the Vulgar,
<hi>Apprehendite diſciplinam:</hi> And if the Deciſive
power of the Miniſtry be doubtfull, yet leaſt
they would ſet up their Nunciative in its vigor,
Chriſt will rule <hi>England,</hi> either as ſubjects, or as
Rebels: and all that Kings and States do gain by
oppoſing his Rule, will not add one cubit to
the ſtature of their greatneſs. Yet I do not
underſtand by [the Government of Chriſt]
a rigid conformity to the modell of this
or that party or faction, with a violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation
of every diſſenter. It is the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
part of Divines (alas! ſuch there are)
who with the ſimple fellow in <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52141:76"/>
                     <hi>Paul's Haereticum hominem devita</hi> i e. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitâ
tolle.</hi> It is the Eſſentials, &amp; not the Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of Diſcipline that I ſpeak of: And if ſo me
diſengaged ſtanders by be not miſtaken (who
have the advantage by ſtanding out of the duſt
of contention) each party hath ſome of theſe
eſsentials, and the worſt is nearer the truth then
his adverſary is aware of: And were not the
crowd and noiſe ſo great, that there is no hope
of being heard, one would think it ſhould be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to reconcile them all: However, ſhall the
work be undone, while each party ſtriveth to
have the doing of it? I was afraid when I read
the begining and end of this controverſie in
<hi>France.</hi> The learned <hi>Ramus</hi> pleadeth for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Church-Government in the Synod; they
rejected it as an unwarrantable novelty; the
contention grew ſharp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre
ſilenced the difference. And muſt our
differences have ſo ſharp a cure? will nothing
unite diſjoyned Chriſtians, but their own blood?
God forbid. But in the mean time while we
quarrell the work ſtandeth ſtill: ſome would
have all the workers of iniquity now taken out
of the Kindome of Chriſt, fotgetting that the
Angels muſt take them out at laſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.
Some Miniſters think as <hi>Myconius</hi> did when
he was called to the Miniſtry by a Viſion, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him into a cornfield and bidding him reap,
he thought he muſt put in his ſickle at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52141:76"/>
till he was told, <hi>Domino meo non opus eſt
ſtramine, modo ariſtae in horrea colligantur:</hi>
My Maſter needeth not ſtraw, gather but the
eares and it ſhall ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>Once more: I know I ſpeak not to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
that ſhould remedy it; but yet that
you may be helpful in your places to advance
this work of Chriſt, let me tell you what is the
great thing in <hi>England</hi> that cryes for Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
next our ſins, even the fewneſs of Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers
in great Congregations, which maketh
the greateſt part of Paſtoral work to lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
and none to watch over the people in
private, becauſe they are ſcarce ſufficient for
the publique work. It is pitty that <hi>Muſculus,</hi>
that may be head of a Society of Students if he
will continue a Papiſt, muſt weave and dig for
his living, if he will be a Proteſtant. It is pitty
that even <hi>Luthers</hi> wife and children muſt wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
deſtitute of maintenance when he is dead:
When <hi>Aeſop</hi> the Stage-player can leave his
Son 150000. l. and <hi>Roſcius</hi> have 30. l. a day for
the ſame Trade; and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be allowed 800.
Talents to further his ſearch into the ſecrets of
nature: But am I pleading that Miniſters may
have more maintenance? No, be it juſt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
it is none of my errand. But oh that the
Church had more Miniſters, which though at
the preſent they cannot have for want of men,
yet hereafter they might have if it were not for
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52141:77"/>
want of maintenance: Alas then, what pitty
is it that every Reformation ſhould diminiſh
the Churches Patrimony: If the men have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
or if the office of Biſhops or Deans
be unwarrantable: yet what have the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
done? Is it not pitty that one Troop of
an hundred men, ſhall have ſeven command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
officers allowed them, beſides others; and
10000 or 40000 ſhall have but one or two O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeers
allowed them for their ſouls? when
the miniſterial work is more laborious and of
greater concernment, then the work of thoſe
Commanders. I tell you again, The great thing
that cries for Reformation in <hi>England</hi> next
to ſin, is the paucity of Miniſters in great
Congregations. I tell you this, that you may
know which way to improve your ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
for the advancement of the Kingdom
of Chriſt in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To you Lawyers and Jurers, my advice is
this, <hi>Kiſs the Son.</hi> Remember the judgement
is Chriſts; every cauſe of Truth and Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
doth he own, and will call it his Cauſe. Wo
therefore to him that ſhall oppoſe it! Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
every time yon take a Fee to plead againſt
a Cauſe that you know to be juſt you take
a Fee againſt a Cauſe of Chriſt, Will you be
of counſel againſt him that is your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor
and King? dare you plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, that you expect ſhould plead for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52141:77"/>
you? or deſire judgement (as the Jews)
againſt your Lord and Judge? Hath he not
told you, that he will ſay, <hi>In as much as ye
did it to one of theſe little ones, ye did it unto
me?</hi> Remember therefore when a Fee is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
you againſt the Innocent, that it is a Fee
againſt Chriſt; and <hi>Judas</hi> gain will be loſs in
the end, and will be too hot to hold long; you
will be glad to bring it back, and glad if you
could be well ſhut of it, and cry, <hi>I have ſinned
in betraying the Cauſe of the Innocent.</hi> Say not,
It is our Calling that we muſt live upon; If any
man of you dare upon ſuch grounds plead a
Cauſe againſt his Conſcience, if his Conſcience
do not plead it again more ſharply againſt him,
ſay I am a falſe Prophet. If any therefore ſhall
ſay of you, as the Cardinals of <hi>Luther, Cur ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini
os non obſtruitis auro &amp; argento,</hi> let the
ſame anſwer ſerve turn, <hi>Hem pecuniam non cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi>
&amp;c. If any Honourable or Worſhipful
friend muſt be pleaſured, enquire firſt whether
he be a better friend then Chriſt; Tell him, the
cauſe is Chriſts, &amp; you cannot befriend him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he can procure you a diſpenſat on from
him. When <hi>Pompy</hi> ſaw his ſouldiers ready to fly,
he lay down in the paſſage, and told them, they
ſhould tread upon him then; which ſtopt their
flight; ſo ſuppoſe every time you are drawn in
to oppoſe a juſt Cauſe, that you ſaw Chriſt
ſaying, Thou muſt trample upon me if thou do
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52141:78"/>
this As <hi>Luther</hi> to <hi>Melancton Ne Cauſa fidei ſit
ſine fide:</hi> ſo ſay I to you all, <hi>Ne Cauſa juſtitiae
ſit ſine juſtitia.</hi> When you begin to be cold in
a good Cauſe, ſuppoſe you ſaw Chriſt ſhewing
you his ſcars; as the Soldier did to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when
he deſired him to plead his Cauſe; ſee here, I
have done more then plead for you. We have
had thoſe that have had a tongue for a fee or
a friend, but none for Chriſt; but God hath now
therefore ſhut their mouths; and we may ſay
of them (as <hi>Granius</hi> by his bad Lawyer, when
he heard him grown hoarſe) <hi>If they had not loſt
their voyces, we had loſt our Cauſe.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
Remember all of you, that there is an
appeal from theſe earthly judgements; theſe
Cauſes muſt all be heard again, your wittneſſes
reexamined, your oaths, pleadings, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
reviewed; and then (as <hi>Lampridius</hi> ſaith
of <hi>Alexander Severus, That he would vomit
choler if he ſaw a corrupt Judge</hi>) So will Chriſt
vomit wrath, and vomit you out in wrath from
his preſence, if corrupt; <hi>Therefore kiſs the Son
leſt he be angry and you periſh,</hi> &amp;c. I am ſenſible
how I have encroached on your great affairs;
<hi>Melancthon</hi> was wont to tell of a Prieſt that
begun his Sermon thus, <hi>Scio quod vos non liben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
auditis, &amp; ego non libenter concionor, non diu igitur
vos teneam.</hi> But I may ſay contrary: I
am perſwaded that you hear with a good will:
and I am certain that I preach willingly, and
therefore I was bold to hold you the longer.</p>

you at <hi>Pauls,</hi> I was fain
to preach a Sermon which I
had preached once before to a

in the Country, having
little leiſure for ſtudy in <hi>London.</hi> I was
glad to ſee that the more curious ſtomachs of

and entertainment. I am ſure the
ſubject is as neceſſary as common; and the
Plainneſs makes it the fitter for the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
who are the far greateſt number, and
have the greateſt need. I have added the 9,
10, 11, and 12. Heads or Common places,
which I did not deliver to you for want of
time; and becauſe the reſt are too briefly
touched (as contrived for an hours work)
I have enlarged theſe; though making
them ſomewhat unſuitable to the reſt, yet
ſuitable to the uſe of thoſe that they are now
intended for: The Directions alſo in the end
are added.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed be the Father of Lights, who
<pb facs="tcp:52141:80"/>
hath ſet up ſo many burning and ſhining
lights in your City, and hath watered you ſo
plenteouſly with the Rivers of his Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
that you have frequent opportunities for
the refreſhment of your ſouls, to the joy of
your friends, the grief of your enemies, and
the glory of that Providence which hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
maintained them, in deſpite of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
Hereſies and Hell! It was not alwaies
ſo in <hi>London:</hi> It is not ſo in all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or famous Cities in the world: Nor are
you ſure that it will be alway ſo with you. It
doth me good to remember what bleſſed
Lights have ſhined among you, that new
are more gloriouſly ſhining in a higher
ſphere: <hi>Preſton, Sibbes, Stough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Taylor, Stock, Randal, Gouge,
Gataker,</hi> with multitudes more that are
now with Chriſt! It did me good to read in
the Preface to Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
by one of your reverend and faithful
Guides, what a number of ſound and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Labourers are yet cloſe at work in
that part of Chriſts Vineyard! And it did me
good in that ſhort experience and obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:52141:81"/>
while I was there, to hear and ſee ſo
much of their Prudence, Unity and Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>Believe it, it is the Goſpel of Chriſt that is
your Glory: and if <hi>London</hi> be more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
then other great and famous Cities of
the earth, it is the light of Gods face, and
the plenty and power of his Ordinances and
Spirit that doth advance and honour it.
0 know then the day of your viſitation!</p>
                  <p>Three things I ſhall take leave to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
to your Conſideration, which I am
certain God requireth at your hands. The
firſt is, that you grow in knowledge, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
heavenlineſs and Unity, according to
the bleſſed means that you enjoy. In my
eyes it is the greateſt ſhame to a people in the
world, and a ſign of Barbarouſneſs or block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs,
when we can hear and read what a
famous, learned powerful Miniſter ſuch a
place, or ſuch a place had, and yet ſee as
much ignorance, ungodlineſs, unrulineſs and
ſenſuality as if the Goſpel had ſcarce ever
been there. I hope it is not thus with you;
but I have found it ſo in too many places of
<pb facs="tcp:52141:81"/>
                     <hi>England.</hi> We that never ſaw the faces of
their Miniſters, but have only read their
holy Labours, have been ready to think,
<hi>Sure there are few ignorant or ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ones in ſuch a Congregation! Sure
they are a people rich in Grace, and
eminently qualified above their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
who have lived under ſuch Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as this! At leaſt, ſure there can be
none left that have an enmity to the
fear of God!</hi> But when we have come to
the Towns where ſuch men ſpent their lives,
and laid out their labours, we have found ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
ſottiſh worldlings, unprofitable or
giddy unſtable Profeſſors, and ſome haters
of godlineſs among them. O what a ſhame
is this to them to the eyes of wiſe men! and
what a confounding aggravation of their ſin
before God! Thrive therefore and be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the Vineyard of the Lord, that it may
not repent him that he hath planted and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
you.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is this; Improve your intereſt
to the utmoſt, for the continuance of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Miniſtry among you: and when any pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:52141:82"/>
are void, do what you can to get a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of the moſt Able men. Your City is the
Heart of the Nation: you cannot be ſick but
we ſhall all feel it. If you be infected with
falſe Doctrines, the Countreys will ere long
receive the Contagion. You have a very
great influence on all the Land, for good or
evil! And do you think the undermining
enemies of the Church have not a ſpecial
Deſign upon you in this point? and will not
promote it as far as is in their power?
Could they but get in Popiſh or Dividing
Teachers among you, they know how many
advantages they ſhould gain at once! They
would have ſome to grieve and trouble your
faithful Guides, &amp; hinder them in the work,
and leſſen that eſtimation which by their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
they would obtain: And every Deceiver
will hope to catch ſome fiſh, that caſteth his
Net among ſuch ſtore. We beſeech you, if
there be Learned, Holy, Judicious men in
<hi>England</hi> that can be had for ſupply on ſuch
occaſions, let them be yours; that you may
be fed with the Beſt, and Guided by the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt,
and we may have all recourſe to you for
<pb facs="tcp:52141:82"/>
advice; and where there are moſt Oppoſers &amp;
Seducers, there may be the moſt Powerful,
Convincing helps, at hand; Let us in the
Country have the honeſt raw young Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and ſee that you have the chief Fathers
and Pillars in the Church. I ſpeak it not
for your ſakes alone, but becauſe we have all
Dependance on you.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which I humbly crave,
is, that you will <hi>Know them which
Labour among you, and are over you in
the Lord, and admoniſh you, and to
eſteem them very highly in love for their
work ſake; and be at peace among your
ſelves.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 12, 13. And that you will
inſtead of grieving or rejecting your Guides,
<hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you,
and ſubmit your ſelves: for they watch
for your ſouls as they that muſt give
account, that they may do it with joy,
and not with grief, for that is unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for you.</hi> Heb. 13. 17. 7. Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
your Teachers, for their work is great,
their ſpirits are weak, they are but frail men;
the enemy is more induſtrious againſt them
<pb facs="tcp:52141:83"/>
then any men; and their diſcouragements
are very many, and the difficulties which
they muſt encounter are very great. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
Obey, ſubmit and encourage them in
the work of Government and Exerciſe of
Chriſts Diſcipline, and managing the Keyes
of the Kingdom which he hath put into
their hand. Do you not perceive what a
ſtrait your Teachers are in! The Lord Ieſus
requireth them to exerciſe his Diſcipline
faithfully and impartially: He giveth them
not empty Titles of Rule, but layes upon
them the burden of Ruling: It is <hi>his work,</hi>
more then their honour that he intends:
and if they will have the <hi>Honor,</hi> it muſt be
by the <hi>work.</hi> The work is, as to Teach the
ignorant, and convince the unbelieving
and gainſaying, ſo to admoniſh the diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſcandalous, and to reject and caſt
out of the Communion of the Church the
Obſtinate and Impenitent; and to ſet by the
Leprous, that they infect not the reſt;
and to ſeperate thus the precious from the
vile by Chriſts D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſcipline, that dividing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
and ſoul deſtroying Tranſgreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:52141:83"/>
may be prevented or cured. This work
Chriſt hath charged upon them, and will
have it done who ever is againſt it. If they
obey him and do it, what a tumult, what
clamours &amp; diſcontents will they raiſe! How
many will be ready to riſe up againſt them
with hatred and ſcorn! though it be the
undoubted work of Chriſt, which even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
perſecution was performed by the
Church-Guides. When they do but keep a
ſcandalous untractable Sinner from the
Communion of the Church in the Lords
Supper, what repinings doth it raiſe! But,
alas, this is a ſmall part of the Diſcipline:
If all the apparently obſtinate and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
were caſt out, what a ſtir would they
make! And if Chriſt be not obeyed, what a
ſtir will conſcience make? And it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
between Chriſt and men, but between
men and men, that your Guides are put upon
ſtreights. The Separatiſts reproach them
for ſuffering the Impenitent to continue
members of their Churches, and make it
the pretence of their ſeparation from them;
having little to ſay of any moment againſt
<pb facs="tcp:52141:84"/>
the authorized way of Government; but
only againſt our ſlackneſs in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And if we ſhould ſet to the cloſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of it, as is meet, how would City and
Country ring of it, and what Indignation
ſhould we raiſe in the multitude againſt us!
O what need have your Guides of your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
and beſt Aſsiſtance in this
ſtreight! God hath ſet them on a work ſo
ungrateful and diſpleaſing to fleſh and
blood, that they cannot be faithful in it, but
twenty to one they will draw a world of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
upon themſelves, if not mens fiſts about
their ears. Feſtred ſores will not be lancht
and ſearcht with eaſe: Corrupted members
are unwilling to be cut off, and caſt aſide:
Eſpecially if any of the great ones fall under
the cenſure, who are big in the eyes of the
world and in their own. And yet our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Lord muſt be obeyed; and his houſe
muſt be ſwept, and the filth caſt out, by what
names or Titles ſoever it be dignified with
men. He muſt be pleaſed, if all be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
by it. Withdraw not your help then
from this needfull work. It is by the
<pb facs="tcp:52141:84"/>
                     <hi>Word, Spirit, and Miniſtery,</hi> that Chriſt
the King of his Church doth Govern it:
Not ſeparatedly, but joyntly, by all three:
To diſobey theſe, is to diſobey Chriſt:
and ſubjection to Christ is Eſſential to our
Chriſtianity. This well thought on might do
much to recover the <hi>Unruly</hi> that are Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable.
You may conjecture by the ſtrange
oppoſition that Church-Government meets
with from all ſorts of carnal and corrupted
minds, that there is ſomewhat in it that is
eminently of God. I ſhall ſay no more but
this, that <hi>It is an Able, Judicious, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Faithful Miniſtery, not barely heard
and applauded, but humbly and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſubmitted to, and obeyed in the

But I do it purpoſely upon theſe following
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52141:87"/>
Conſiderations. 1. Becauſe I well know, that
it is theſe Common Truths that are the great
and neceſſary things which mens everlaſting
happineſs or miſery doth moſt depend upon.
You may be ignorant of many Controverſies
aud Inferiour points, without the danger of
your ſouls but ſo you cannot of theſe Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals.
2. Becauſe its apparent by the lives
of men, that few know theſe Common Truths
ſavingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that think they know them. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there are ſeveral degrees of knowing the
ſame Truths, and the beſt are imperfect in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
the principal growth in Knowledge that we
ſhould look after, is not to know <hi>more</hi> matters
then we knew before, but to know <hi>that better,</hi>
and with a clearer light and firmer apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
which we darkly and ſlightly knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
You may more ſafely be without <hi>any</hi>
knowlege at all of many lower Truths, then
without <hi>ſome further degree</hi> of the knowledge
of thoſe which you already know. 4. Beſides
it is known by ſad Experience, that many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
who know the Truth, for want of the
conſideration of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and making uſe of what they
know, and ſo their knowledge doth but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
them. We have as much need therefore
to teach and help you to get theſe Truths
which you know into your hearts and lives, as
to tell you more. 5. And indeed, it is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52141:87"/>
of theſe great and maſter-Truths,
wherein the vitals and eſſentials of Gods
Image upon the ſoul of man doth conſiſt: And
it is theſe Truths that are the very Inſtruments
of the great works that are to be done upon
the heart by the ſpirit and our ſelves. In the
right uſe of theſe it is that the Principal part
of the skill and holy wiſdom of a Chriſtian
doth conſiſt; and in the diligent and conſtant
uſe of theſe lieth the life and trade of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
There is nothing amiſs in mens hearts or
lives, but it is for want of ſound knowing and
believing, or well uſing theſe Fundamentals.
6. And moreover, me thinks, in this choice of
my ſubject, I may expect this advantage with
the Hearers, that I may ſpare that labour that
elſe would be neceſſary for the proof of my
Doctrine: and that I may alſo have eaſier. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to your hearts, and have a fuller ſtroak at
them and with leſs reſiſtance. If I came to tell
you of anything not Common, I know not
how far I might expect belief from you You
might ſay, <hi>Theſe things are uncertain to us or all
men are not of this mind.</hi> But when every Hearer
confeſſeth the truth of my doctrine, and no man
can deny it, without denying Chriſtianity it ſelf,
I hope I may expect that your hearts ſhould
the ſooner receive the impreſſion of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and the ſooner yield to the duties which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52141:88"/>
it directs you to: and the eaſier let go the
ſins which from ſo certain a Truth ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                  <p>The words of my text, are the reaſon which
the Apoſtle giveth both of his perſwading other
men to the fear of God, and his care to approve
to God his own heart and life. They contain
the Aſſertion and Deſcription of the great
Judgement, and one Uſe which he makes of it.
It aſſureth us, that Judged we <hi>muſt be,</hi> and <hi>who</hi>
muſt be ſo Judged, and <hi>by whom,</hi> and <hi>about
what,</hi> and <hi>on what terms,</hi> and <hi>to what end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meaning of the words, ſo far as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
I ſhall give you briefly. <hi>We all,</hi> both we A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
that Preach the Goſpel, &amp; you that hear
it, <hi>muſt,</hi> willing or unwilling, there is no avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, <hi>Appear,</hi> ſtand forth or make our appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and there have our hearts and wayes laid
open, and appear as well as we. <hi>Before the
Judgement ſeat of Chriſt; i. e.</hi> before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
of the world, to be Judged by him as
our Rightful Lord. <hi>That every one,</hi> even of
all mankind which are were, or ſhall be, without
exception; <hi>May receive,</hi> that is, may receive
his ſentence adjudging him to his due; and then
may receive the execution of the ſentence; and
may go away from the barr with that Reward
or Puniſhment that is his due according to the
Law by which he is Judged. <hi>The things done in his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52141:88"/>
body,</hi> that is the due Reward of the works done
in his body; or as ſome copies read it, <hi>The things
proper to the body,</hi> i. e. due to the man, even bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
as well as ſoul. <hi>According to what he hath
done whether it be good or bad:</hi> i. e. This is the
cauſe to be tried and Judged, whether men have
done well or ill, whiles they were in the fleſh,
and what is due to them according to their
deeds. <hi>Knowing therefore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> Being certain
therefore that theſe things are ſo, and that ſuch
a Terrible Judgement of Chriſt will come, we
perſwade men to become Chriſtians and live as
ſuch, that they may then ſpeed well, when others
ſhall be deſtroyed; or as others, <hi>Knowing the
fear of the Lord,</hi> that is, the true Religion, <hi>we
perſwade men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There will be a Judgement. <hi>Doct</hi> 2.
Chriſt will be the Judge. <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. All men ſhall
there appear. <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Men ſhall be then
Judged according to the works that they did in
the fleſh, whether good or evil. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. The
end of Judgement is, that men may receive their
final due by Sentence and Execution. <hi>Doct.</hi> 6.
The knowledge and conſideration of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Judgement of God, ſhould move us to
perſwade, and men to be perſwaded to care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
preparation.</p>
                  <p>The ordinary method for the handling of this
ſubject of Judgement ſhould be this. 1. To

familar method ſhall handle it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I. FOR the firſt, Judgement as taken <hi>large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
comprehendeth all the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
particulars; As taken more <hi>ſtrictly</hi> for the
Act of the Iudge, it is <hi>the trial of a Controverted
caſe.</hi> In our caſe note theſe things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>1. Gods Iudgement is not intended for any
Diſcovery to himſelf of what he knows not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready:
he knows already what all men are;
and what they have done; and what is their
due: But it is to diſcover to others and to
men themſelves the ground of his ſentence, that
ſo his Iudgement may attain its end: for the
glorifying his grace on the Righteous, and for
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52141:90"/>
the convincing the wicked of their ſin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
and to ſhew to all the world the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of the Iudge, and of his Sentence, and
Execution, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4, 26. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>2. It is not a Controverſie therefore undecided
in the mind of God, that is there to be decided;
but only one that is undecided, as to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and mind of creatures.</p>
                  <p>3. Yet is not this Iudgement <hi>a bare Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
but <hi>a Deciſion,</hi> and ſo <hi>a Declaration</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon:
the cauſe will be then put out of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
and all further expectation of Deciſion
be at an end; and with the juſtified there will be
no more Accuſation, and with the condemned
no more hope for ever.</p>
                  <p>II. FOR the ſecond thing, who ſhall be
the Iudge; I anſwer, The Iudge is <hi>God
himſelf by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Principally, God as Creator.</p>
                  <p>2. As alſo, God as Redeemer; the humane
nature of Ieſus Chriſt having a derived ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
power. God loſt not his right to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
either by mans fall, or the Redemption by
Chriſt, but by the latter hath a new further
right: but it is in and by Chriſt that God Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
For as <hi>meer Creator of innocent mar,</hi> God
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52141:90"/>
judgeth none, but hath committed all judgement
to the Son, who hath procured this right by
the redeeming of fallen man, <hi>John</hi> 5. 22. But
as the Son only doth it in the neereſt ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ſo
the Father as Creator doth it remotely and
principally.</p>
                  <p>1. In that the power of the Son is derived
from the Father, and ſo ſtandeth in ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to him as Fountain or Efficient.</p>
                  <p>2. In that the Iudgement of the Son (as alſo
his whole Mediatorſhip) is to bring men to
God their maker as their ultimate end, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
them to him from whom they are faln,
and ſo as a means to that end, the Iudgement of
the Son is ſubordinate to the Father.</p>
                  <p>From hence you may ſee theſe following
Truths worthy your conſideration.</p>
                  <p>1. That all men are Gods creatures, and none
are the workmanſhip of themſelves or any
other; or elſe the Creator ſhould not Iudge
them on that right.</p>
                  <p>2. That Chriſt dyed for All, and is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
of the world, and a ſacrifice for All; or
elſe he ſhould not Iudge them on that Right.
For he will not Iudge wicked men as he will
do the Devils; as the <hi>meer enemies</hi> of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
ones, but as being themſelves his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in the world, and being bought by him,
and therefore become his own, who ought to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52141:91"/>
have glorified him that bought them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
14, 15. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19, 20. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. 7.</p>
                  <p>3. Hence it appeareth that all men were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſome Law of grace and did partake of ſome
of the Redeemers mercy. Though the Goſpell
came not to all, yet all had that <hi>mercy</hi> which
could come from no other Fountain but his
Blood, and which ſhould have brought them
neerer to Chriſt then they were, (though it
were not ſufficient to bring them to believe:)
and which ſhould have led them to Repentance.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. For the neglecting of which they
juſtly periſh; and not <hi>meerly</hi> for ſinning againſt
the Law that was given man in innocency:
Were that ſo, Chriſt would not Iudge them as
Redeemer, and that for the abuſe or not-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of his Talents, as he tels us he will do,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>per totum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. If God will be the Iudge, then none can
expect by any ſhifts or indirect means to ſcape
at that day. For how ſhould it be?</p>
                  <p>1. It is not poſsible that any ſhould keep out
of <hi>ſight,</hi> or hide their ſin and the evill of their
actions, and ſo delude the Iudge: God will not
be mocked now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor deceived then, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7.
they groſsly deceive themſelves that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
any ſuch thing: God muſt be Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and All-ſeeing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or he cannot be God. Should
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52141:91"/>
you hide your cauſe from men and from Devils,
and be ignorant of it your ſelves, yet cannot
you hide it from God. Never did there a
thought paſs thy heart, or a word paſs thy
mouth, which God was not acquainted with:
and as he knows them, ſo he doth obſerve them.
He is not as Imperfect man, taken up with other
buſineſs, ſo that he cannot mind <hi>All.</hi> As eaſie is
it with him to obſerve every Thought or Word,
or Action of thine, as if he had but <hi>that one</hi>
in the world to obſerve: and as eaſie to obſerve
each particular ſinner, as if he had not another
creature to look after in the world. He is a fool
indeed that thinks now that God takes no no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tice
of him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 12. and 9. 9. or, that
thinketh then to eſcape in the croud: He that
found out one Gueſt that had not on a wedding
Garment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 12. will then find out every
unholy ſoul, and give him ſo ſad a ſalutation
as ſhall make him ſpeechleſs. <hi>Job</hi> 11. 11. <hi>For he
knoweth vain man; he ſeeth wickedneſs alſo,</hi> and
<hi>will he not conſider it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It is not poſſible that any ſhould ſcape at
that Day by any Tricks of wit and falſe Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their own Defence. God knoweth a
ſound Anſwer from an unſound, and a Truth
from a Lye. Righteouſneſs may be perverted
here on earth, by out-witting the Judge; but
ſo will it not be then: To hope any of this is
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52141:92"/>
to hope that God will not be God. It is in
vain then for the <hi>unholy</hi> man to ſay he is <hi>holy;</hi>
or for any ſinner to deny, or excuſe, or extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
his ſin: To bring forth the counterfeit of
any Grace, and plead with God any ſhels of
hypocritical performances, and to think to prove
a Title to heaven by any thing ſhort of Gods
Condition; all theſe will be vain attempts.</p>
                  <p>3. And as impoſſible will it prove by fraud or
flattery, by perſwaſion or bribery, or by any
other means, to pervert Juſtice by turning
the mind of God who is the Judge: fraud and
flattery, bribery and importunity may do much
with weak men; but with God they will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Were he changeable and partial, he
were not God.</p>
                  <p>4. If God be Judge, you may ſee the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
of Infidels are fooliſh, when they ask, <hi>How
long will God be in Trying and Judging ſo many
perſons, and taking an Account of ſo many Words,
and Thoughts and Deeds? Sure it will be a long
time, and a difficult work.</hi> As if God were as
man, that knoweth not things till he ſeek out
their Evidence by particular ſigns. Let theſe
fools underſtand, if they have any underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the infinite God can ſhew to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man at once, all the thoughts, and words,
and actions that ever he hath been guilty of.
And in the twink of an eye, even at one view,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52141:92"/>
can make all the world to ſee their ways and
their deſervings. Cauſing their Conſciences and
Memories to preſent them all before them in
ſuch a ſort as ſhall be equivalent to a verbal
debate. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21, 22. he will ſet them in order
before them.</p>
                  <p>5. If Jeſus Chriſt be the Judge, then what a
comfort muſt it needs be to his members, that
he ſhall be Judge that loved them to the death,
and whom they loved above their lives, and
he who was their Rock of hope and ſtrength,
and the deſire and delight of their ſouls!</p>
                  <p>6. And if Jeſus Chriſt muſt be the Judge what
confuſion will it bring to the faces of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and of all that ſet light by him in the day
of their viſitation? to ſee Mercy turned againſt
them, and he that dyed for them, now ready
to condemn them: and that blood and grace
which did Aggravate their ſin, to be pleaded
againſt them, to the increaſe of their miſery:
how ſad will this be!</p>
                  <p>7. If the God of Love, and Grace and Truth
be Judge, then no man need to fear any wrong.
No ſubtilty of the Accuſer, nor darkneſs of
Evidence: no prejudice or partiality, or what
ſoever elſe may be imagined, can there appear
to the wrong of your cauſe. Get a good cauſe
and fear nothing: and if your cauſe be bad,
nothing can deliyer you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:52141:93"/>
                     <hi>III. FOR the Third Point,</hi> Who are they
that muſt be judged?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> All the rational Creatures in this
lower world. And it ſeems, Angels alſo, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>all,</hi> or, <hi>ſome:</hi> But becauſe their caſe is more
darkly made known to us, and leſs concerns us,
we will paſs it by. Every man that hath been
made or born on earth (except Chriſt;, who is
God and man, and is the Judge) muſt be
judged. If any fooliſh Infidel ſhall ſay, <hi>Where
ſhall ſo great a number ſtand?</hi> I anſwer him,
That he knoweth not the things inviſible; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the nature of Spirits and ſpiritual bodies,
nor what place containeth them, or <hi>how;</hi> but
eaſily he may know that he that gave them all
a being, can ſuſtain them all, and have room
for them all, and can at once diſcloſe the
thoughts of all, as I ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>The firſt in Order to be judged, are, the
Saints, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. and then with Chriſt they
ſhall judge the reſt of the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.
2, 3. not in an equal authority and commiſſion
with Chriſt, but as the preſent Approvers of his
Righteous Judgement. The Princes of the earth
ſhall ſtand then before Chriſt, even as the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants;
and the honorable as the baſe, the rich
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52141:93"/>
and the poor ſhall meet together, and the Lord
ſhall judge them all, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 2. No men
ſhall be excuſed from ſtanding at that Bar, and
giving up their account, and receiving their
doom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Learned and unlearned, young and old,
godly and ungodly, all muſt ſtand there. I know
ſome have vainly imagined, that the righteouſ
ſhall not have any of their ſins mentioned, but
their graces and duties only; but they conſider
not, that things will not then be tranſacted by
words as we do now, but by cleer di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>coveries
by the infinite Light; and that if God ſhould
hot diſcover to them their ſins, he would not
diſcover the Riches of his Grace in the pardon
of all theſe ſins: Even then they muſt be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in themſelves, that they may be glorified,
and for ever cry, Not unto us Lord, but unto
thy name be the glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IV. FOR the Fourth Particular,</hi> who
will be the Accuſer?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Satan is called in Scripture the
Accuſer of the Brethren, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 10. and
we find in <hi>Job</hi> 1: and other places, that now
he doth Practiſe it even before God: and
therefore we judge it probable that he will
do ſo then. But we would determine of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52141:94"/>
that Scripture hath not clearly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
                  <p>2. Conſcience will be an Accuſer, though,
eſpecially of the wicked, yet in ſome ſenſe of
the righteous: for it will tell the truth to all:
and therefore ſo far as men are faulty, it will
tell them of their faults. The, wicked it will
accuſe of unpardoned ſin, and of ſin unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of; the godly only of ſin repented of and
pardoned. It will be a Glaſs wherein every
man may ſee the face of his heart and former
Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
                  <p>3. The Judge himſelf will be the Principal
Accuſer; for it is he that is wronged, and he
that proſecutes the cauſe and will do juſtice on
the wicked: God judgeth even the righteous
themſelves to be ſinners, or elſe they could not
be pardoned ſinners. But he judgeth the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be impenitent, unbelieving, unconverted
ſinners. Remember what I ſaid before, that it
is not a verbal accuſation, but an opening of
the truth of the cauſe to the view of our ſelves
and others, that God will then perform.</p>
                  <p>Nor can any think it unworthy of God to be
mens Accuſer by ſuch a diſcloſure, it being no
diſhonour to the pureſt light to reveal a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,
or to the greateſt Prince to accuſe a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
Nor is it unmeet that God ſhould be both
Accuſer and Judge; ſeeing he is both abſolute
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52141:94"/>
Lord, and perfectly juſt, and ſo far beyond all
ſuſpition of Injuſtice. His Law alſo doth virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
accuſe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 45. But of this by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V. FOR the Fifth Particular,</hi> How will the
ſinners be called to the Bar?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> God will not ſtand to ſend them a
Citation, nor require him to make his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Appearance: but willing or unwilling, he
will bring them in.</p>
                  <p>1. Before each mans particular Judgement,
he ſendeth Death to call away his ſoul; a ſurly
Serjeant, that will have no Nay: How dear ſo
ever this World may be to men, and how loth
ſo ever they are to depart, away they muſt,
and come before the Lord that made them;
Death will not be bribed. Every man that was
ſet in the vinyard in the morning of their lives,
muſt be called out at evening to Receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what he hath done: then muſt the
naked ſoul alone appear before its Judge, and
be accomptible for all that was done in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
and be ſent before till the final judgement,
to remain in happineſs or miſery, till the body
be raiſed again, and joyned to it.</p>
                  <p>In this appearance of the ſoul before God it
ſeemeth by Scripture, that there is ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52141:95"/>
of Angels; for <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 22. it is ſaid that
the Angels carried <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that is, his ſoul,
into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom. What local motion
there is, or ſituation of ſouls, is no fit matter
for the enquiry of Mortals: and what it is in
this that the Angels will do, we cannot clearly
underſtand as yet; But moſt certain it is, that
as ſoon as ever the ſoul is out of the Body, it
comes to its account before the God of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                  <p>2. At the end of the world the bodies of all
men ſhall be raiſed from the earth, and joyned
again to their ſouls; and the ſoul and body
ſhall be judged to their endleſs ſtate; and this
is the great and generall Iudgement, where all
men ſhal at once appear. The ſame power of
God that made men of nothing, will as eaſily
then New make them by a Reſurrection;
by which he will add much more perfection,
even to the wicked in their Naturals, which will
make them capable of the greater miſery; even
they ſhall have immortal and incorruptible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which may be the ſubjects of immortal
woe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 53. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>Of this Reſurrection, and our Appearance at
Iudgement, the Angels will be ſome way the
Miniſters: As they ſhall come with Chriſt to
Iudgement ſo they ſhall ſound his Trumpet, 1
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. and they ſhall gather the wicked
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52141:95"/>
out of Gods Kingdom; and they ſhall gather
the Tares to burn them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 39, 40, 41.
in the end of the world the Angels ſhall come
forth and ſever the wicked from among the
juſt, and ſhall caſt them into the Furnace of
fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 49, 50.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FOR the ſixth particular,</hi> What Law is it
that men ſhall be Judged by?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which was given them to live
by: Gods Law is but <hi>the ſign of his will, to teach
us what ſhall be due from us and to us;</hi> before
we fell he gave us ſuch a Law as was ſuitable
to our perfection; when we had ſinned and
turned from him, as we ceaſed not to be his
creatures, nor he to be our Lord, ſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
not his Law, nor diſcharged or abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us from the duty of our obedience. But
becauſe we flood condemned by that Law,
and could not be Iuſtified by it, having once
Tranſgreſſed it, he was pleaſed to make a <hi>Law
of Grace,</hi> even <hi>a new a remedying Law,</hi> by which
we might be ſaved from the deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Old. So we ſhall be tryed at
Judgement upon both theſe Laws. but ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
upon the Laſt. The firſt Law
commanded perfect Obedience, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52141:96"/>
Death to us if ever we diſobeyed; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Law finding us under the Guilt of ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the firſt, doth command us to Repent and
Believe in Chriſt, and ſo to return to God by
him; and promiſeth us pardon of all our ſins
upon that Condition, and alſo if we perſevere,
everlaſting Glory. So that in Judgement
though it muſt firſt be evinced that we are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and have deſerved Death according to the
Law of pure nature; yet that is not the upſhot
of the Judgement. For the enquiry will be
next, whether we have accepted the remedy,
and ſo obeyed the Law of grace, and performed
its Condition for pardon and ſalvation; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this our Life or Death will depend. It is
both theſe Laws that condemn the wicked; but
it is only the Law of grace that juſtifieth the
righteous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But how ſhall Heathens bejudged by the
Law of grace, that never did Receive it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The expreſs Goſpel ſome of them
had not, and therefore ſhall not directly be
judged by it; but much of the Redeemers mercy
they did enjoy, which ſhould have led them to
repent and ſeek out after Recovery from their
miſery, and to come neerer Chriſt and for the
neglect and abuſe of this, they ſhall be judged;
and not meerly for ſinning againſt the Law
that was given us in pure innocency: So that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52141:96"/>
Chriſt as Redeemer ſhall judge them as well as
others: though they had but one Talent, yet
muſt they give an account of that to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
from whom they received it. But if any
be unſatisfied in this, let them remember, that
as God hath left the ſtate of ſuch more dark to
us, and the terms on which he will Iudge them;
ſo doth it much more concern us to look to the
terms of our own Iudgement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But how ſhall infants be judged by the
Goſpel, that were uncapable of it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> For ought I find in Scripture, they
ſtand or fall with their parents, and on the ſame
terms; but I leave each to their own
thoughts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>VII. FOR the ſeventh head,</hi> What will be
the cauſe of the day to be enquired after?
what the Accuſation, and what the Defence?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This may be gathered from what was
laſt ſaid. The great Cauſe of the day will be
to enquire and determine who ſhall dye, and
who ſhall live; who ought to go to heaven,
and who to hell for ever, according to the
Law by which they muſt then be Judged.</p>
                  <p>1. As there is a twofold Law by which they
muſt be Judged, ſo will there then be a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52141:97"/>
Accuſation. The firſt will be, that they
were <hi>ſinners,</hi> and ſo having violated the Law of
God, they Deſerve Everlaſting Death accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that Law; If no defence could be
made, this one Accuſation would condemn all
the world; for it is moſt certain that all are
ſinners, and as certain that all ſin deſerveth
Death. The only defence againſt this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
lyeth in this Plea; Confeſſing the charge,
we muſt plead that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for ſins,
and upon that conſideration God hath forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us; and therefore being forgiven, we ought
not to be puniſhed; To prove this we muſt
ſhew the pardon under Gods hand in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
But becauſe this pardoning Act of the
Goſpel doth forgive none but thoſe that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and Believe, and ſo return to God, and to
ſincere Obedience for the time to come; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the next Accuſation will be, that <hi>we did
not perform theſe Conditions of forgiveneſs; and
therefore being Vnbelievers, Impenitent and
Rebels againſt the Redeemer, we have no right to
pardon, but by the ſentence of the Goſpel, are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to a greater puniſhment for this contempt of
Chriſt and Grace</hi> This Accuſation is either
<hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe</hi> where it is <hi>true,</hi> God and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
who ſpeak the truth, may well be ſaid to
be the Accuſers: Where it is <hi>falſe,</hi> it can be
only the work of Satan the malitious adverſary;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52141:97"/>
who, as we may ſee in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, will not ſtick to
bring a falſe Accuſation.</p>
                  <p>If any think that the Accuſer will not do ſo
vain a work, at leaſt they may ſee that <hi>potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
this is the Accuſation that lyeth againſt us,
and which we muſt be juſtified againſt. For all
<hi>Juſtification</hi> implyeth an <hi>Actual</hi> or <hi>Potential
Accuſation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that is truly accuſed of final Impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or Unbelief, or Rebellion, hath no other
Defence to make; but muſt needs be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>He that is falſly accuſed of ſuch non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the condition of Grace, muſt deny
the Accuſation, and plead his own perſonal
Righteouſneſs as againſt that Accuſation;
and produce that Faith, Repentance and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Obedience and Perſeverance by which
he fulfilled that Condition, and ſo is <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically
Righteous</hi> in himſelf, and therefore hath
part in the blood of Chriſt, which is inſtead of
a <hi>Legal righteouſnſes</hi> to him, in all things elſe,
as having procured him a pardon of all his ſin,
and a right to everlaſting glory.</p>
                  <p>And thus we muſt then be Juſtified by
Chriſts ſatisfaction only, againſt the accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of being <hi>ſinners in general,</hi> and of deſerving
Gods wrath for the Breach of the Law of
works: But we muſt be juſtified by our faith,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52141:98"/>
repentance and ſincere Obedience itſelf,
againſt the Accuſation of being <hi>Impenitent,
unbelievers, and Rebels againſt Chriſt,</hi> and
having not performed the Condition of the
promiſe, and ſo having no part in Chriſt and
his Benefits.</p>
                  <p>So that in Summ you ſee, that the cauſe of
the day will be to enquire, Whether, being all
known ſinners, we have accepted of Chriſt upon
his terms, and ſo have right in him and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
or not? Whether they have forſaken
this vain world for him, and loved him ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
that they have manifeſted it, in parting
with theſe things at his Command? And this
is the meaning of <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Where the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is made to be, whether they have fed and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
him in his members, or not? That is,
whether they have ſo far loved him as their
Redeemer, and God by him, as that they have
manifeſted this to his members according to
Opportunity, though it coſt them the hazard
or loſs of all: Seeing danger, and labour,
and coſt, are fitter to expreſs love by,
then Empty Complements and bare Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Whether it be particularly enquired after,
or only taken for granted that men are <hi>ſinners,</hi>
and have deſerved Death according to the
<hi>Law of works,</hi> and that Chriſt hath ſatisfied
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52141:98"/>
by his death, is all one as to the matter in
hand, ſeeing Gods enquiry is but the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and Conviction of us. But the laſt Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which muſt decide the Controverſie, will be,
whether we have performed the condition of
the Goſpel?</p>
                  <p>I have the rather alſo ſaid all this, to ſhew
you in what ſenſe theſe words are taken in the
text, that <hi>Every man ſhall be Judged according
to what he hath done in the fleſh, whether it be
good or bad.</hi> Though every man be Judged
<hi>worthy</hi> of Death for ſinning, yet every man
ſhail not be Judged <hi>to dye</hi> for it; and no man
ſhall be Judged <hi>morthy</hi> of Life <hi>for</hi> his good
works: It is therefore according to the Goſpel,
as the rule of judgement, that this is meant.
They that have Repented and believed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>true,</hi> though <hi>imperfect</hi> Obedience,
ſhall be Judged to everlaſting Life, <hi>according</hi>
to theſe works; not becauſe theſe works <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi>
it, but becauſe the <hi>free Gift in the Goſpel,</hi>
through the blood of Chriſt, doth make theſe
things the <hi>condition</hi> of our poſſeſsing it. They
that have lived and dyed Impenitent, Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and Rebels againſt Chriſt; ſhall be judged
to everlaſting puniſhment, <hi>becauſe</hi> they have
<hi>deſerved</hi> it, both by their ſin in <hi>general</hi> againſt
the Law, and by theſe ſins in <hi>ſpecial</hi> againſt
the Goſpel. This is called <hi>the Merit of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52141:99"/>
Cauſe,</hi> that is, what is a mans <hi>due</hi> according to
the true meaning of the Law; Though the due
may be by free gift. And thus you ſee what
will be the cauſe of the Day, and the matter to
be enquired after and decided, as to our Life
or Death.</p>
                  <p>VIII. THE next point in our method, is,
to ſhew you, <hi>What will be the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Cauſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a fivefold Evidence among
men. 1. When the fact is notorious. 2. The
knowledge of an unſuſpected Competent Iudge.
3. The parties Confeſsion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. Witneſs. 5. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
and viſible effects of the action. All
theſe Evidences will be at hand, and any one of
them ſufficient for the conviction of the guilty
perſon at that day.</p>
                  <p>1. As the ſins of <hi>all men;</hi> ſo the <hi>Impenitency</hi>
and <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>wicked</hi> was notorious, or at
leaſt will be then. For though ſome play the
hypocrites, and hide the matter from the world
and themſelves, yet God ſhall open their hearts
and former lives to themſelves, and to the view
of all the world. He ſhal ſet their ſins in order
before them ſo, that it ſhall be utterly in vain
to deny or excuſe them. If any menwill then
think to make their cauſe as good to God as
they cannow do to us, that are not able to ſee
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52141:99"/>
their hearts, they will be fouly miſtaken. Now
they can ſay they have as good hearts as the beſt:
then God will bring them out in the light; and
ſhew them to themſelves and all the world,
whether they were good or bad. Now they will
face us down that they do truly Repent, and
they obey God as well as they can; but God
that knoweth the Deceivers, will then undecieve
them. We cannot now make men acquainted
with their own unſanctified hearts, nor convince
them that have not true Faith, Repentance or
Obedience; but God will convince them of it;
They can find ſhifts and falſe anſwers to put off
a <hi>Miniſter</hi> with; but <hi>God</hi> will not ſo be ſhifted
off. Let <hi>us</hi> preach as plainly to them as we can,
and do all that ever we are able to acquaint
them with the impenitency and unholineſs of
their own heart, and the neceſſity of a new heart
and life, yet we cannot do it; but they will Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
whether we will or not, that the old heart
will ſerve the turn; But how eaſily will <hi>God</hi>
make them know the contrary? <hi>We</hi> plead with
them in the dark; for though we have the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Goſpel in our hands when we come to
ſhew them their corruption, yet they ſhut their
eyes, and are wilfully blind; But <hi>God</hi> will open
their eyes whether they will or not, not by <hi>holy
Illumination,</hi> but by <hi>forced conviction;</hi> and then
he will plead with them as in the open light. <hi>See
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52141:100"/>
here thy own unholy ſoul; canſt thou now ſay thou
didſt love me above all? canſt thou deny but thou
didſt love this world before me? and ſerve thy fleſh
and luſts, though I told thee if thou didſt ſo thou
ſhouldſt dye? Look upon thy own heart now, and ſee
whether it be a holy or an unholy heart, a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
or a fleſhly heart; a heavenly or au earthly
heart? Look now upon all the courſe of thy life,
and ſee whether thou didſt live to me, or to the
world and thy fleſh?</hi> Oh how eaſily will God
convince men then of the very ſins of
their thoughts, and in their ſecret Cloſets,
when they thought that no witneſs could have
diſcloſed them! Therefore its ſaid that the
Books ſhall be opened, and the dead Judged
out of the books, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 10.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Evidence will be <hi>the knowledge of
the Judge.</hi> If the <hi>ſinner</hi> would not be <hi>convinced;</hi>
yet it is ſufficient that the <hi>Judge</hi> knoweth the
Cauſe; God needeth no further witneſs; he
ſaw thee committing adultery in ſecret, lying,
ſtealing, forſwearing in ſecret. If thou do not
know thy own heart to be unholy, it is enough
that God knoweth it. If you have the face to
ſay, <hi>Lord, when did we ſee thee hungry?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi>
25. 44. yet God will make good the charge
againſt thee, and there needeth no more Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
then his own. Can fooliſh ſinners think
to lie hid or eſcape at that day, that will now ſin
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52141:100"/>
                     <hi>wilfully before their Judge?</hi> that know every
day that their <hi>Judge</hi> is <hi>looking</hi> on them while
they forget him, and give up themſelves to the
world, and yet go on even under his eye, as if
to his face they dared him to puniſh them?</p>
                  <p>3. The third Evidence will be, <hi>the ſinners
Confeſsion.</hi> God will force their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
to witneſs againſt them, add their own
tongues to confeſs the Accuſation. If they
do at firſt excuſe it, he will leave them ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
yea and condemning themſelves before
they have done.</p>
                  <p>Oh what a difference between their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
now and then! <hi>Now</hi> we cannot tell
them of their ſin and miſery, but they either tell
us of our own faults, or bid us look to our
ſelves, or deny or excuſe their fault, or make
light of it: but <hi>then</hi> their own tongues ſhall
confeſs them, and cry out of the wilful folly
that they committed, and lay a heavier charge
upon them then we can now do. <hi>Now</hi> if we
tell them that we are afraid they are unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
and leaſt their hearts are not truly
ſet upon God; they will tell us they hope: to
be ſaved with ſuch hearts as they have: But
<hi>then,</hi> Oh how they will confeſs the folly and
falſeneſs of their own hearts! You may ſee a
little of their caſe even in deſpairing ſinners on
earth, how far they are from denying or excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52141:101"/>
their ſins. <hi>Judas</hi> cryes out, <hi>I have ſinned in
bttraying Innocent blood, Mat.</hi> 27. 4. out of
their own mouth ſhall they be Judged. That
very tongue that now excuſeth their ſin, will in
their torments be their great Accuſer. For
God will have it ſo to be.</p>
                  <p>4. The fourth Evidence will be the <hi>witneſs
of others.</hi> Oh how many thouſand witneſſes
might there be produced, were there need to
convince the guilty ſoul at that day!</p>
                  <p>1. All the Miniſters of Chriſt that ever
preached to them, or warned them, will be
ſufficient witneſſes againſt them: <hi>we muſt needs</hi>
teſtifie that we preached to them the truth of
the Goſpel, and they would not believe it.
We preached to them the goodneſs of God,
yet they ſet not their hearts upon him: we
ſhewed them their ſin and they were not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
We told them of the danger of an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
ſtate, and they did not regard us: we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
them with the Abſolute Neceſsity of
holineſs, but they made light of all: We let
them know the deceitfulneſs of their hearts,
and the need of a cloſe and faithful examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but they would not beſtow an hour in ſuch
a work; nor ſcarce once be afraid of being
miſtaken and miſcarrying. We let them know
the vanity of this world, and yet they would
not forſake it, no not for Chriſt and the hopes
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52141:101"/>
of glory; We told them of the everlaſting fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
they might attain, but they would not ſet
themſelves to ſeek it.</p>
                  <p>What we ſhal think of it <hi>then,</hi> the Lord knows;
but ſurely it ſeemeth <hi>now</hi> to us a matter of very
ſad conſideration, that we muſt be brought in
as witneſſes againſt the ſouls of our neighbors
and friends in the fleſh. Thoſe whom we now
unfeignedly love, and would do any thing that
we were able to do for their good, whoſe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
is dearer to us then all worldly enjoyments;
Alas, that we muſt be forced to teſtifie to
their faces for their condemnation! Ah Lord,
with What a heart muſt a poor Miniſter ſtudy,
when he conſidereth this, that all the words
that he is ſtudying muſt be brought in for a
witneſs againſt many of his hearers! with What
a heart muſt a Miniſter Preach, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth
that all the words that he is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
muſt condemn many, if not moſt of his
hearers! Do we deſire this ſad fruit of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours?
No: we may ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi>
17. 16. <hi>I have not deſired the woful day, thou
knoweſt:</hi> No, if we deſired it, we would not do
ſo much to prevent it: we would not ſtudy,
and preach, and pray, and intreat men that if
it were poſſible we might not be put on ſuch a
task. And doubtleſs it ſhould make every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Miniſter ſtudy hard, and pray hard, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52141:102"/>
intreat hard, and ſtoop low to men, and be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
with men in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, that
if it may be, they may not be the condemners
of their peoples ſouls. But if men will not
hear, and there be no remedy, who can help it?
Chriſt himſelf came not into the world to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
men, but to ſave them, and yet he will
condemn thoſe that will not yield to his ſaving
work: God takes no pleaſure in the death of a
ſinner, but rather that he repent, and return, and
live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 23, 32. and yet he will rejoyce
over thoſe to do them hurt, and deſtroy them
that will not return, <hi>Deut</hi> 28. 63. And if we
muſt be put on ſuch a work, he will make us
like-minded. The Holy Goſt tels us, that the
Saints ſhall Judge the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2, 3.
and if they muſt Judge, they will Judge as God
Judgeth; you cannot blame us for it ſinners:
we now warn you of it before hand, and if
you will not prevent it, blame not us, but your
ſelves. Alas! we are not our own Matters.
As we now ſpeak not to you in our own names,
ſo then we may not do what we liſt our ſelves,
or if we might, our wills will be as Gods will.
God will make us Judge you, and witneſs
againſt you; Can we abſolve you, when the
righteous God will condemn you? when God
is againſt you, whoſe ſide would you have us
be of? We muſt be either againſt <hi>God</hi> or <hi>you.</hi>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:52141:102"/>
And can you think that we ſhould be for any
one againſt our Maker and Redeemer? We
muſt either condemn the Sentence of Jeſus
Chriſt, or condemn you: and is not there
more reaſon to condemn you then him? can we
have any mercy on you, when he that made
you will not ſave you, and he that formed you,
will ſhew you no mercy? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 11. Yea when
he that dyed for you, will condemn you, ſhall
we be more merciful then God? But alas! If
we ſhould be ſo fooliſh and unjuſt, what good
would it do you? If we would be falſe witneſſes
and partial Judges, it would not ſave you; we
are not Juſtified if we abſolve our ſelves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4. 4. how unable then ſhall we be againſt Gods
Sentence to Juſtifie you? If all the world
ſhould ſay, you were holy and penitent, when
God knows you were unholy and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
it will do you no good. You pray
every day that <hi>his will</hi> may be done, and it will
be done: It will be done <hi>upon</hi> you becauſe it
was not done <hi>by</hi> you. What would you have
<hi>us</hi> ſay, if God ask us, <hi>Did you tell this ſinner of
the need of Chriſt, of the glory of the world to
come, and the vanity of this?</hi> Should we lye, and
ſay we did not? what ſhould we ſay if he ask
us, <hi>Did not you tell them the miſery of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſtate; and what would become of them if they
were not made new?</hi> Would you have us lye
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52141:103"/>
to God, and ſay we did not? Why, if we <hi>did not,</hi>
your blood will be required at our hands,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 6. and 3. 18. and would you have
us bring your blood upon our own heads by
a lye? Yea, and to do you no good, when we
know that lyes will not prevail with God? No,
no, ſinners; We muſt unavoidably teſtifie to
the confuſion of your faces. If God ask us, we
muſt bear witneſs againſt you and ſay? <hi>Lord,
we did what we could according to our weak abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
to reclaim them: Indeed our own thoughts
of everlaſting things were ſo low, and our
hearts ſo dull, that we muſt confeſs we did
not follow them ſo cloſe, nor ſpeak ſo earneſtly
as we ſhould have done: we did not cry ſo
loud, or lift up our voice as a Trumpet to
awaken them,</hi> (Iſa. 58. 1.) <hi>we confeſs we did
not ſpeak to them with ſuch melting compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and with ſuch ſtreams of tears beſeech
them to regard, as a mutter of ſuch great
concernment ſhould have been spoken with;
We did not fall on our knees to them, and ſo
earneſtly begg of them for the Lords ſake, to have
mercy upon their own ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uls, as we ſhould have
done. But yet we told them the Meſſage of God:
and we ſtudyed to ſpeak it to them as plainly and
as piercingly as we could Fain we would have
convinced them of their ſin and miſery, but we
could not: Fain we would have drawn them to the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52141:103"/>
admiration of Chriſt, but they made light of it,</hi>
Mat. 22. 5. <hi>we would fain have brought them
to the contempt of this vain world, and to ſet their
mind on the world to come, but we could not;
Some compaſsion thou knoweſt Lord we had to
their ſouls; many a weeping or groaning hour we
have had in ſecret, becauſe they would not hear
and obey; and ſome ſad complaints we have made
over them in publike; We told them that they
muſt ſhortly dye and come to Judgement, and
that this world would deceive them, and leave
them in the duſt; we told them that the time was
at hand when nothing but Chriſt Would do them
good, and nothing but the favour of God would be
ſufficient for their happineſs; but we could never
get them to lay it to heart. Many a time did we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
them to think ſoberly of this life, and the life
to come, and to compare them together with the
Faith of Chriſtians, and the reaſon of men; but
they would not do it; many a time did we intreat
them but to take now and then an hour in ſecret to
conſider</hi> who <hi>made them, and</hi> for what <hi>he had
made them, and why they were ſent into this world;
and what their buſineſs here is; and</hi> whether <hi>they
are going, and how it will go with them at their
latter end; But we could never get moſt of them to
ſpend one hour in ſerious thoughts of theſe
weighty matters. Many a time did we intreat
them to try whether they were Regenerate or not?
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52141:104"/>
whether Chriſt and his Spirit were in them, or
not? Whether their ſouls were brought back to
God by Sanctification? but they would not try;
We did beſeech them to make ſure work and not
leave ſuch a matter as everlaſting Joy or Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to a bold and mad adventure; but we could
not prevail. We intreated them to lay all other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes
aſide a little while in the world, and to
enquire by the direction of the word of God, what
would become of them in the world to come; and
to Judge themſelves before God came to Judge
them, ſeeing they had the Law and rule of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before them; but their minds were blinded,
and their hearts were hardned; and the profit, and
pleaſure, and honour of this world did either ſtop
their ears, or quickly ſteal away their heartt, ſo
that we could never get them to a ſober conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
nor ever win their hearts to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This will be the witneſs that many a hundred
Miniſters of the Goſpel muſt give in againſt
the ſouls of their people at that day. Alas,
that ever you ſhould caſt this upon us! For
the Lords ſake, Sirs, pitty your poor Teachers,
if you pitty not your ſelves. We had rather
go a 1000. miles for you; we had rather be
ſcorned and abuſed for your ſakes: we had
rather lay our hands under your feet, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you on our knees with tears, were we
able, then be put on ſuch a work as this. It
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52141:104"/>
is <hi>you</hi> that will do it if it be done. We had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
follow you from houſe to houſe, and
teach and exhort you, if you will but hear us,
and accept of our exhortation. Your ſouls are
pretious in our eyes, for we know they were ſo
in the eyes of Chriſt, and therefore we are loth
to ſee this day; we were once in your caſe, and
therefore know what it is to be blind, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
and carnal as you are, and therefore would
fain obtain your Deliverance. But if you <hi>will</hi>
not hear, but we <hi>muſt</hi> accuſe you, and we <hi>muſt</hi>
condemn you; The Lord Judge between you &amp;
us For we can witneſs that it was full ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our wills. We have been faulty indeed in
doing no more for you, and not following you
with reſtleſs Importunity; (the Good Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
us;) but yet we have not betrayed you by
ſilence.</p>
                  <p>2. All thoſe that fear God, that have lived
among ungodly men, will alſo be ſufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
againſt them. Alas! they muſt be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſame work, which is very unpleaſant to

they were readier to mark every ſlip of our lives,
and to obſerve all our Infirmities, and catch at
any Accuſation that was againſt us, then to
follow us in any work of holy obedience, or care
for our everlaſting peace;] The Lord knows
it is a moſt heavy thing to conſider now, that

                     </gap>ſe everlaſting things, and of this dreadfull
day which they now ſee. But youthful luſts,
and the temprations of the flaſh and the Devil
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52141:105"/>
led them away and I could never get them
throughly and ſoundly to lay it to their

Can you but now prevail with them, all will be
well, and you may meet them Joyfully before
the Lord.</p>
                  <p>3. Another wittneſs that will teſtifie againſt
the ungodly at that day, will be their ſinful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
thoſe that drew them into ſin, or were
drawn by them, or joyned with them in it. Oh
little do poor drunkards think, when they ſit
merrily in an Ale houſe, that one of them muſt
bear witneſs againſt another and condemn
one another: If they thought of this, me
thinks it ſhould make them have leſs delight
in that company: Thoſe that now joyn
with you in wicked neſs ſhall then be forced to

your companions in the face the next time you
are with them, and remember this that I now
ſay; that thoſe men ſhall give in Evidence
againſt you that now are your aſſociates in all
your mirth; Little thinketh the fornicator and
luſtful wanton that their ſinful mates muſt
then bear witneſs of that which they thought
the dark had concealed and tell their ſhame

fruit of ſin. Its meet that they who encouraged
one another ſin, ſhould condemn one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

or a worlding, or a merry voluptuous
man is grown old, and cannot act all his ſin
again, he takes pleaſure in remembring and
telling others of his former folly; what he
once was; and what he did; and the merry
hours that he had; but <hi>then</hi> when ſinners are
come to themſelves a little more, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
and tell one another of theſe things
with another heart. Oh that they did but
know now how theſe things will then affect
them.</p>
                  <p>4. Another witneſs that will then riſe up
againſt them, will be the very Devils that
tempted them: They that did purpoſely draw
them to ſin, that they might draw them to
Torment for ſin: They can witneſs that you
harkned to their Temptations, when you
would not harken to Gods Exhortations;
They can witneſs that you obeyed them in
working Iniquity. But becauſe you may
think the Accuſers Teſtimony is not to be
taken, I will not ſtand on this. Though it
is not nothing where God knoweth it to be
true.</p>
                  <p>5 The very Angels of God alſo may be

can teſtifie that they would have been mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
Spirits for their good, when the wicked
rather choſe to be ſlaves to the Spirit of
malitiouſneſs. The holy Angels of God
do many a time ſtand by you when you are
ſinning. They ſee you when you ſee not them;
they are imployed by God in ſome ſort
for your good, as well as we: And as it is the

                  <p>6 Conſcience it ſelf will be moſt effectual
witneſs againſt the wicked at that day. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>7. The ſpirit of Chriſt can witneſs againſt
the ungodly, that he oft moved them to
Repent and Return, and they rejected his
motions: that the ſpoke to their hearts in ſecret,
and oft ſet in with the Miniſter, and often
minded them of their caſe, and perſwaded them
to God; but they reſiſted, quenched and
grieved the Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51. As the Spirit

that they are the children of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16.
ſo doth he witneſs with the Conſcience of the
wicked, that they were children of Rebellion,
and therefore are juſtly children of wrath.
This Spirit will not alway ſtrive with men; at

If you will needs <hi>Grieve</hi> it now, it will <hi>Grieve

were it not free mercy that it came to offer
you, the Repulſe would not have been ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning,
nor the witneſs of this Spirit ſo heavy

came with recovering Grace, which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted:
And though the wages of every ſin is

                  <p>Many a good motion is now made by the

doth not now Remember them. But <hi>then</hi> they

that I uſed: Though I ſhewed Reaſous,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52141:108"/>
undenyable Reaſons, from thy Creator, from

fleſh, and now let it pay thee the wages of thy
folly: Thou <hi>wouldeſt</hi> be thy own guide, and
take thine own Courſe, and now take what thou
getteſt by it]</p>
                  <p>Poor ſinners, I beſeech you in the fear of
God, the next time you have any ſuch moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the Spirit of God, to Repent, and
Believe and Break off your ſins, and the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of them, conſider then what a mercy is
ſet before you: and how it will confound you at
the day of Judgement, to have all theſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
brought in againſt you, and that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Grace it ſelf ſhould be your Condemner!
Alas, that men ſhould chooſe their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſructon.
and wilfully chooſe it! and that the
foreknowledge of theſe things ſhould not move
them to relent.</p>
                  <p>So much concerning the witneſs that will
be brought in againſt the ſinner.</p>
                  <p>5. The fifth Evidence that will be given
againſt the ſinner, will be, <hi>The Inſtruments
and Effects.</hi> You know among men, if a man
be found murthered by the high-way, and you
are found ſtanding by with a bloody ſword in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52141:109"/>
your hand; eſpecially if there were a former
diſſention between you, it will be an Evidence
that will prove a <hi>ſtrong preſumption,</hi> that you
were the Murderer: But if the fact be certain
by other Evidence, then many ſuch things may
be brought for aggravation of the fault.</p>
                  <p>So a twofold Evidence will be brought
againſt the ſinner from theſe things. One
to prove him guilty of the fact: the other to
Aggravate the fault, and prove that his ſin was
very great.</p>
                  <p>For the former. 1. The very creatures which
ſinners abuſed to ſin, may be brought in againſt
them to their Conviction and Condemnation.
For though theſe creatures ſhall be conſumed
with the laſt deſtroying Fire, which ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
all the world, yet they ſhall have a Being
in the memory of the ſinner (an <hi>eſſe Cognitum.)</hi>
The very Wine or Ale, or other liquor which
was abuſed to drunkenneſs may witneſs againſt
the Drunkard. The ſweet morſels by which
the Glutton did pleaſe his Appetite, and all
the good creatures of God which he luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
devoured, may witneſs againſt him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 19. 25. He that fared deliciouſly
every day in this life, was told by <hi>Abraham</hi>
when he was dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his ſoul in Hell, [Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that thou in thy life time receivedſt
thy good things, and likewiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> evil
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52141:109"/>
things: but now he is comfored, and thou art
tormented,] Though their ſweet morſels and
cups are paſt, and gone, yet muſt they be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
at Judgement and in Hell. [Remember
Son] ſaith <hi>Abraham;</hi> Yea, and <hi>Remember</hi> he
muſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether he will or no; Long was the
Glutton in ſinning, and many a pleaſant bit
did he taſte: and ſo many Evidences of his ſin
will lie againſt him, and the ſweetneſs will then
be turned into gall.</p>
                  <p>The very cloathing and ornaments by which
Proud perſon did manifeſt their Pride, will be
ſufficient Evidence againſt them: as his being
clothed with Purple and fine Linnen, is mento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16. 19.</p>
                  <p>The very Lands, and goods, and houſes of
worldlings will be an Evidence againſt them:
Their Gold and Silver, which the covetous do
now prefer before the everlaſting Riches with
Chriſt, will be an Evidence againſt them. <hi>James
5. 1, 2, 3, 4. Go to now, ye Rich men, weep and
howl for your miſeries that ſhall come upon you.
Your Riches are corrupted, and your Garments,
moath-eaten; Your Gold and Silver is cankered,
and the Ruſt of them ſhall be a</hi> Witenſs <hi>againſt
you, and ſhall eat your fleſh, as it were fire; Ye
have heaped Treaſure together for the Laſt daies.
Behold the hire of the Laborers, which have reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down you fields, which is of you kept back by
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52141:110"/>
fraud, cryety; and the cryes of them which have
reaped, are entred into the ears of the Lord of
Sabboth. Ye have lived in pleaſure on the Earth,
and been wanton; Ye have nouriſhed your hearts
as in a day of ſlaughter.</hi> Oh that worldlings
would well conſider this one Text; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
obſerve whether a life of earthly pleaſure and
fulneſs of worldly Glory and Gallantry, be as
deſirable as they imagine, and to what Time
and Purpoſe they now lay up their Treaſures;
and how they muſt hear of theſe Things here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
and what effect the review of their Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
daies will have upon their miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
ſouls.</p>
                  <p>2. The very circumſtances of Time, Place,
and the like, may Evidence againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.
The drunkard ſhall Remember,
In Such an Ale houſe. I was ſo oft drunk, and
in ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avern I waſted my time. The Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer
and Fornicator ſhall Remember the very
Time the Place, the Room, the Bed, where
they committed wickedneſs. The Thief and
Deceiver will Remember the Time, Place, &amp; the
perſons they wronged and the Thing which
they robbed or deceived them of. The world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
will Remember the buſineſs which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before the ſervice of God; the worldly
matters which had more of his heart then his
Maker and Redeemer had; the work which he
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52141:110"/>
was doing when he ſhould have been Praying
or Reading, or Catechiſing his Family, or
thinking ſoberly of his latter end. A thouſand
of theſe will then come into his mind, and be
as ſo many Evidences againſt him to his
Condemnation.</p>
                  <p>3. The very effects alſo of mens ſins will be
an Evidence againſt them. The wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of a Drunkard are Impoveriſhed by his
ſin; His family and the neighbourhood is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
by him. Theſe will be ſo many Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
againſt him. So will the abuſe of his
own Reaſon; The enticing of others to the
ſame ſin, and hardning them by his example.</p>
                  <p>One covetons unmerciful Landlord doth
keep a hundred, or many hundred perſons or
families in ſo great neceſſities, and care and
labour, that they are tempted by it to overpaſs
the ſervice of God, as having ſcarce time for it,
or any room for it in their troubled thoughts;
All theſe miſerable families and perſons, and all
the ſouls that are undone by this Temptation,
will be ſo many Evidences againſt ſuch Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors.</p>
                  <p>Yea, the poor whom they have neglected
to relieve when they might: the ſick whom
they have neglected to viſit, when they might,
will all witneſs then againſt the unmerciful,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:52141:111"/>
The many ignorant, worldly, careleſs ſinners,
that have periſhed under an idle, and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Miniſter, will be ſo many witneſſes againſt
him to his Condemnation! They may then
cry out againſt him to his face [I was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Lord, and he never did ſo much as teach
me, catechize me, nor tell me of theſe Things;
I was careleſs, and minded the world, and
he let me go on quietly and was as careleſs as I,
had never plainly and faithfully warned me,
to waken me from my ſecurity.] And ſo
their blood will be required at his hands,
though themſelves alſo ſhall periſh in their
ſins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33, 7. 8.</p>
                  <p>2. And as theſe Evidences will convince
men of ſin, ſo there are many more which will
convince them of the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of their ſin.
And theſe are ſo many that it would too much
lengthen my diſcourſe to ſtand on them. A
few I ſhall briefly touch.</p>
                  <p>1. The very mercy of God in <hi>Creating</hi> men,
in giving and continuing their <hi>Being</hi> to them,
will be an Evidence for the Aggravation of
their ſin againſt him. What? will you abuſe
him, by whom it is that you are men? will you
ſpeak to his diſhonor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that giveth you your
ſpeech? will you live to his diſhonor who
giveth you your Lives? will you wrong him by
his own creatures? and neglect him without
whom you cannot ſubſiſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:52141:111"/>
2. The Redemption of men by the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, will be an evidence to the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Aggravation of their ſins. You ſinned
againſt the Lord that bought you, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1.
When the Feaſt was prepared, and all things
were Ready, you made light of it, and found
excuſes, and would not come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 4, 5, 6.
<hi>Luke</hi> 14. 17, 18. Muſt Chriſt Redeem you
by ſo dear a price from ſin and miſery, and yet
will you continue the ſervants of ſin, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
your ſlavery before your freedom, and
chooſe to be Satans drudges, rather then to
be the ſervants of God? The ſorrows and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
that Chriſt underwent for you, will
then prove the increaſe of your own ſorrows.
As a neglected Redeemer, it is that he will
condemn you. And then you would be glad
that it were but true Doctrine, that Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dyed for you, that you might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for refuſing a Redeemer, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
againſt him that ſhed his blood for you.
How deeply will his wounds then wound your
conſciences! You will then Remember, that
to this end he both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yed, roſe, and revived,
that he might be Lord both of the Dead and
the Living? And that he therefore dyed for all,
that they which live, ſhould not henceforth
live to themſelves, but to him that dyed for
them, and roſe again; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52141:112"/>
14, 15. <hi>Mat</hi> 28. 18. 19. 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17, 18.
You will then underſtand that you were not
your own, but were bought with a price, and
therefore ſhould have glorified him that
Bought you, with your Bodies and Spirits,
becauſe they were His, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19, 20. This
one Aggravation of your ſin will make you
doubly and remedileſly miſerable; that you
Trod under foot the Son of God and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the blood of the Covenant, wherewith you
were ſanctified, an unholy thing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26,
27, 28, 29. and crucified to your ſelves the Son
of God afreſh, and put him to open ſhame,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 5 6.</p>
                  <p>3. Moreover; All the perſonal mercies
which they received, will be ſo many Evidences
for the condemnation of the ungodly. The
very earth that bore them, and yielded them
its fruits, while they themſelves are unfruitful to
God The Air which they breathed in: the food
which nouriſh'd them: the cloaths which cover'd
them, the houſes which they dwelt in, the beaſts
that laboured for them, and all the creatures
that dyed for their uſe: All theſe may riſe up
againſt them to their condemnation. And the
Judge may thus expoſtulate with them, [Did
all theſe mercies deſerve no more Thanks?
ſhould you not have ſerved him that ſo liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maintained you? God thought not all theſe
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52141:112"/>
too good for you, and did you think your
hearts and ſervices too good for him? He ſerved
yous w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the weary labours of your fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and ſhould you have grudged to bear his
eaſie Yoak? They were your ſlaves and drudges,
and you refuſed to be his free ſervants and his
Sons? They ſuffered Death to feed your bodies,
and you would not ſuffer the ſhort forbearance
of a little forbidden fleſhly pleaſure for the
ſake of him that made you and redeemed
you.]</p>
                  <p>Oh how many thouſand mercies of God will
then be reviewed by thoſe that neglected them
to the horrour of their ſouls, when they ſhall be
upbraided by the Judge with their baſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal!
All the deliverances from ſickneſs and from
danger; all the honours, and priviledges, and
other commodities, which ſo much contented
them, will then be Gods Evidence to ſhame
them and confound them. On this ſuppoſition
doth the Apoſtle reprove ſuch, <hi>Rom. 2. 4, 5, 6.
Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,
and long ſuffering, not knowing that the
goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance? But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, treaſureſt
up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath, &amp;
revelation of the righteous Judgement of God, who
will render to every man, according to his Deeds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Moreover. All the means which God uſed
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52141:113"/>
for the Recovery of ſinners in the day of their
viſitation, will riſe up againſt Impenitent ſouls,
in Judgement to their condemnation. You can
hear Sermons careleſsly and ſleepily now; but
O that you would conſider, how the review of
them will then awake you! You now make
light of the warnings of God and man, and of all
the wholeſome advice that is given you, but God
will not then make light of your contempt.
Oh what cutting Queſtions will they be to the
hearts of the ungodly, when all the means that
were uſed for their good, are brought to their
remembrance on one ſide, and the temptations
that drew them to ſin on the other ſide, and
the Lord ſhall plead his cauſe with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
and ſay [Was I ſo hard a Maſter, or
was my work ſo unreaſonable, or was my wages
ſo contemptible, that no perſwaſions could
draw you into my ſervice? was Satah ſo good
a Maſter, or was his work ſo honeſt and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
or was his wages 'ſo deſirable, that you
would be ſo eaſily perſwaded to do as he would
have you? Was there more perſwading Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in his allurements and deceits, then in all
my holy words, and all the powerfull Sermons
that you heard, or all the faithfull admonitions
you received; or all the good examples of the
righteous, or in all the works of God which
you beheld? Was not a reaſon fecht from the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52141:113"/>
love of God, from the evill of ſin, the blood of
Chriſt, the Judgement to come? the glory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
the torments threatned, as forcible with
you, and as good in your eyes, to draw you to
holineſs, as a Reaſon from a little fleſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
or worldly gain, to draw you to be unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?]</p>
                  <p>In the name of God, ſinners, I intreat you
to bethink your ſelves in time, how you will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
anſwer ſuch Queſtions as theſe. You
ſhould have ſeen God in every creature that
you beheld, and have read your duty in all his
works; what can you look upon above you, or
below you, or round about you, which might
not have ſhewed you ſo much of the wiſdom,
and goodneſs, and greatneſs of your maker, as
ſhould have convinced you that it was your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be devoted to his wil? And yet you have his
written word that ſpeaks plainer then all theſe;
And will you deſpiſe them all? will you not ſee
ſo great a Light? will you not hear ſo loud and
conſtant calls? ſhall God, and his Miniſters
ſpeak in vain? And can you think that you ſhall
not hear of this again, and pay for it one day?
you have the Bible, &amp; other good books by you;
why do you out read them? You have Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
at hand: why do you not go to them, and
earneſtly ask them, <hi>Sir, What muſt I do to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi>
&amp; intreat them to teach you the way to life;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52141:114"/>
you have ſome neighbors that fear God; why
do you not go to them, and take their good
advice, and imitate them in the fear of God,
and in a holy diligence for your ſouls? Now is
the time for you to beſtir your Selves; Life and
Death are before you. You have gales of grace
to further your voyage: There are more for
you then againſt you. God will help you: his
Spirit will help you: his Miniſters will help
you: every good Chriſtian will help you; the
Angels themſelves will help you, if you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedly
ſet your ſelves to the work; And yet
will you not ſtir? Patience is waiting on you;
Mercies are enticing you; Scourges are driving
you; Judgement ſtayeth for you; The Lights
of God ſtand burning by you to direct you;
And yet will you not ſtir, but lie in darkneſs?
And do you think you ſhall not hear of this?
Do you think this will not one day coſt you
dear?</p>
                  <p>IX THE ninth part of our work, is to ſhew
you, <hi>What are thoſe frivolous excuſes
by which the unrighteous may then indeavour
their defence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having already ſhewed you what the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

Before God hath done with him, he will be ſo;
But it ſeems at firſt his dark underſtanding, and
partial corrupted conſerence will ſet him upon a

telleth us that [Many will ſay to me in that
day, Lord, Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have we not propheſied in thy

in thy name have done many wonderful works?

                     </gap> ye workers of iniquity.
And in <hi>Mat</hi> 25. 11. The fooliſh Virgins
cry, [Lord, Lord, open to us.] And verſ.
44. [Then ſhall they alſo anſwer him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying,

They fear not to caſt ſome of the cauſe of their
neglect on God himſelf, [Then he which had
received the one Talent came and ſaid, Lord, I
knew that thou art an hard man, reaping where
thou haſt not ſown, and gathering where thou
haſt not ſtrawed; and I was afraid, and went
and hid thy talent in the earth; lo, there thou
haſt that is thine.]</p>
                  <p>It is cleer then, that Excuſes they will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52141:115"/>
to make, and their full conviction will be in
order after theſe Excuſes (at leaſt as in their
minds, if not in words) But what the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Excuſes will be, we may partly know by
theſe Scriptures which recite them, and partly
by hearing what the ungodly do now ſay for
themſelves. And becauſe it is for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
benefit that I now make mention of them,
that they may ſee the vanity of all ſuch Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
I will mention them as I now meet with
them in the mouthes of Sinners in our ordinary
diſcourſe; and theſe Excuſes are of ſeveral
ſorts; ſome by which they would juſtify their
eſtate; ſome Excuſes of particular actions;
and that either in whole, or in part, ſome by
which they would put by the penalty, though
they confeſs the ſin; ſome by which they lay
the blame on other men: and in ſome they
would caſt it upon God himſelf. I muſt touch
but ſome of them very briefly.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Excuſe. <hi>I am not guilty of theſe
things which I am accuſed of. I did love God
above All, and my Neighbor as my ſelf. I did
uſe the World but for Neceſſity, but God had my
heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The all-ſeeing Judge doth know
the contrary; and he will make thy Conſcience
know it. Look back man, upon thy heart and
life. How ſeldom and how neglectfully didſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52141:115"/>
thou think of God? how coldly didſt thou
worſhip him, or make any mention of him?
how careleſly didſt thou ſerve him? and think
much of all that thou didſt therein? Thou ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thoughteſt that his Service was making
more adoe then needs, and didſt grudge at
thoſe that were more diligent then thy ſelf;
but for the World, how heartily and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
didſt thou ſeek and ſerve it? and yet
wouldſt thou now perſwade the Judge that
thou didſt love God above all? He will ſhew
thee thy naked heat, and the courſe of thy
former life, which ſhail convince thee of the
contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Second Excuſe.</hi> I lived not in any groſs
ſin, but only in ſmall Infirmities; I was no
Murderer, or Adulterer, or Fornicator, or Thief,
nor did I deceive or wrong any, or take any thing
by violence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Was it not a groſs ſin to love the
world above God, and to neglect Chriſt that
dyed for thee, and never to do him one hours
hearty ſervice, but meerly to ſeek thy carnal
ſelf, and to live to thy fleſh? God will open
thine eyes then, and ſhew thee a thouſand groſs
ſins, which thou now forgetteſt or makeſt light
of; and it is not only Groſs ſins, but All ſin,
great or ſmall, that deſerveth the wrath of
God, and will certainly bring thee under it for
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52141:116"/>
ever, if thou have not part in Chriſt to relieve
thee Wo to the man that ever he was born
that muſt anſwer in his own name for his ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt offences</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Third Excuſe.</hi> I did it ignorantly; I
knew not that there was ſo much required to my

life that ſhall have no end?</p>
                  <p>3. And whereas you talk of <hi>truſting God with

No; he hath told yon enough to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
And could you think that it was the
will of God, that you ſhould mind your bodies
more then your ſouls, and this life more then
that to come? Why, he hath bid you ſtrive, and
run, and ſight, and labour, and care, and ſeek,
and uſe violence, and all diligence for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of your ſouls, and for the life to come: But
where hath he bid you do ſo for your bodies?
No, he knew that you were prone to do too
much for them; and therefore he hath bid you
[Care not, and Labour not] that is, Do it as
if you did it not; and let your care and Labour
for earthly things be none in compariſion of
that for heavenly things. You know God can
as well maintain your lives without your care
and labour, as ſave your ſouls without it: And
yet you ſee he will not, he doth not: You muſt

Gods Love and Care of you, and not ſay, I

                  <p>
                     <hi>The fourth Excuſe.</hi> I was never brought up
to learning, I cannot ſo much as read: Nor did
my Parents ever teach me any of theſe things, but
only ſet me about my worldly buſineſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
food and rayment for me: but never once
told me that I had a ſoul to ſave or loſe, and
and an everlaſting life to provide and prepare for.
And therefore I could not come to the knowledge
of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The greater is their ſin, who thus
neglected you. But this is no ſufficient Excuſe
for you. Heaven is not prepared for the
Learned only: nor will Chriſt ask you at
Judgement, whether you are good Scholars or
not, no nor ſo much as whether you could
write or read. But conſider well! was not
Gods word ſo plainly written, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
might underſtand it? Did he not put it
into the moſt familiar ſtile, though he knew it
would be offenſive to the proud Scholars of
the world, of purpoſe that he might fit it to the
capacities of the ignorant? And if you could
not read, yet tell me, Could not you have
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52141:118"/>
learned to read at 20, or 30 years of age, if you
had been but willing to beſtow now and then
an hour to that end? Or at leaſt, did you not
live near ſome that could Read? and could
you not have procured them to read to you, or
to help you? And did you not hear theſe things
read to you in the Congregation by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter?
or might have done if you would? And
if your Parents did neglect you in your youth,
yet when you came to a fuller uſe of Reaſon,
and heard of the matters of ſalvation from
Gods Word, did it not concern you to have
looked to your ſelves; and to have redeemed
that time which you loſt in your youth, by
doubling your diligence when you came to
riper years? The Apoſtles gathered Churches
among Heathens that never heard of Chriſt
before; and converted many thouſand ſouls
that were never once told of a Saviour, or the
way to ſalvation, till they had paſt a great part
of their? lives. If you loitered till the latter part
of the day, it behoved you then to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred
your ſelves the more: and not to ſay,
Through the fault of my Parents. I loſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of my life, and therefore I will loſe all;
they taught me not then, &amp; therefore I will not
learn now; hav you not ſeen ſom of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
who were as ill educated as your ſelves,
attain to much knowledge afterwards by their
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52141:118"/>
Induſtry? And why might not you have done
ſo, if you had been as Induſtrious as they? May
not God and Conſcience witneſs, that it was
becauſe you cared not for knowledge, and
would not be at pains to get it, that you knew
no more? Speak truth, man in the preſence of
thy Judge; was thy heart and mind ſet upon it?
Didſt thou pray daily for it to God? Didſt thou
uſe all the means thou couldſt to get it? Didſt
thou attend diligently on the word in publike,
and think of what thou heardeſt when thou
cameſt home? Didſt thou go to the Miniſter, or
to others that could teach thee, and intreat
them to tell thee the way to ſalvation? Or
didſt thou not rather careleſly neglect theſe
matters; and hear a Sermon as a common tale,
even when the miniſter was ſpeaking of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or of Hell? It was not then thine unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Ignorance, but thy negligence.</p>
                  <p>Yea further, anſwer as in the preſence of
God: Didſt thou obey ſo far as thou <hi>didſt
know?</hi> Or didſt thou not rather ſin againſt
that knowledge which thou hadſt? Thou
kneweſt that the ſoul was better then the body,
and everlaſting life more to be regarded then
this tranſitory life; But didſt thou regard it
accordingly? Thou ſure kneweſt that God
was better then the world, and Heaven then
earth: at leaſt, thou was told of it; But didſt thou
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52141:119"/>
accordingly value him, and love him more?
Thou kneweſt ſure that there was no ſalvation
without Faith, and Repentance, and newneſs
of life, and yet they were neglected. In a
word, many a thouſand ſins which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and duties that were omitted, againſt
thy own Knowledge and Conſcience, will marr
this Excuſe</p>
                  <p>The fifth Excuſe. <hi>I lived not under a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

where a powerfull Miniſter was, with a little
pains? Yea, did not the very plain Word that

might you not have had a Bible your ſelves,

                  <p>The Sixth Excuſe. <hi>I was a Servant, and had
no time from my labour to mind theſe matters;
I lived with a hard maſter that required all his

Idleneſs, nor vain talking? why might not that

own Day in hearing, reading, and pondering
of theſe matters, when you were forced to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
your worldly labours, even by the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
Law of the Land. Theſe therefore are all

had been but to keep men in awe: and I ſuſpected
either that the Scripture was not his word, or
elſe I thought he would be better then his word.
I thought all that I heard of another life had been
uncertain; and therefore was loth to let go a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty

which I never did ſee.</p>

what your unbelief would bring you to. Did
Gods Word make Heaven and Earth? doth it
ſupport them, and ſecure them and is not his
Word ſufficient ſecurity for you to have truſted
your ſouls upon? did you know where was any
better ſecurity to be had? and where was any
ſurer ground for your confidence? And did
you think ſo baſely and blaſphemouſly of God,
that he would falſifie his Word, leſt ſuch as
you ſhould ſuffer? and that he was fain to rule
the world by a Lye? Did God make the world
ſo eaſily? and can he not govern it by true
and righteous means? what need God to ſay
that which he will not do, to awe ſinners? can
he not awe them by Truth? is it not juſt that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52141:120"/>
thoſe ſhould eternally periſh, that will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

                  <p>And for the Truth of Scripture, God did not
bid you believe it without Evidence. He ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of Miracles; He delivered it down to

left you no room for rational Doubting.</p>
                  <p>And you knew that the matters of this world
were not only uncertain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but certainly vain

                  <p>The Eighth Excuſe. <hi>I was ſo enticed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded

and yet that would not prevail with you? You
could not deny the Devils and fools, but you
could deny God and all his Meſſengers. Were
not Miniſters as earneſt with you every week to
repent and amend? What did men entice you
with? with a little deluding fleſhly pleaſure for
a few daies? And what did God entice you
with? with the Promiſe of endleſs unconcieva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

in your eyes, then the other, then you have had
your choice be content with it, and thank your

Chriſt tell you, that if you were aſhamed of

<hi>Mark</hi> 8. 38. He ſufferered more then

                  <p>4. And from their diverſe opinions, you
ſhould have taken counſel at Gods word, which
was right: Did you firſt ſearch the Scripture
impartially, as willing to know the Truth, that
you might obey it? and did you pray daily
that God would lead you into the truth? and did
you obey as much as you knew? Did you joyn
with the godly ſo far as they are all agreed? they
are all agreed in the Fundamental Articles of
Chriſtianity, and in all things abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to a holy Life, and to ſalvation: that all
known ſin is to be forſaken, and all known duty
to be done. Why did you not ſo far then agree
with them? Alas, the imperfections of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the falſe Accuſations of the malicious
world, will prove but a poor cover for your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ungodlineſs, and Chriſt will convince you of
the vanity of theſe Excuſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The thirteenth Excuſe.</hi> The Scriptures were
ſo dark, that I could not underſtand them. And
I ſaw the wiſeſt men differ ſo much in the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, that I thought it was in vain for me
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52141:123"/>
to trouble my ſelf about them. If God would have
had us live according to the Sriptures, he would
ſure have written them plainly, that men might
underſtand them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is all plainly written according
to the nature of the ſubject: But a prejudiced,
diſaffected, yea or but untaught, diſuſed ſoul
cannot at firſt underſtand the plaineſt Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.
The plaineſt Greek or Hebrew Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
that can be written, will be utterly obſcure
to him that is but newly entred the Engliſh
School: yea after many years time that he
ſpends in learning. Did you ſtudy hard, and
pray for Gods teaching, and enquire of others,
and wait patiently in Chriſts School, that you
might come to further knowledge by Degrees?
and were you <hi>willing</hi> to know even thoſe Truths
that called you out to ſelf-denyal, and that did
put you on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Had you done thus, you would have admired
the Light of the Holy Scripture, and now have
rejoyced that ever you ſaw them, and not have
quarrelled at its ſeeming Darkneſs. This word
might have made you <hi>wiſe</hi> to ſalvation, as it hath
done others, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16,

                  <p>2. So much as is of Neceſſity to ſalvation,
is as plain as you could deſire. Yet if you be
Judged by theſe, you will be condemned: For
you did not obey that which was moſt plain.
What darkneſs is in ſuch words as theſe, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

                  <p>3. If there had been nothing that ſeemed
difficult to you, would you not have deſpiſed
its ſimplicity, and have thought your ſelves
wiſe enough at the firſt Reading, and needed
no more?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fourteenth Excuſe.</hi> There were ſo many
ſeeming Contradictions in the Scripture, and
ſo many ſtrange improbable things, that I could
not believe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The contradictions were in your
fancy, that did not underſtand the word which
you read. Muſt the raw unexperienced Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
deſpiſe his book or Teacher, a oft as in his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
he thinks he meets with contradictions?
Did you think God was no wiſer then you, and
underſtood not himſelf, becauſe you underſtood
him not? Nor could reconcile his own words,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52141:124"/>
becauſe you could not reconcile them? You
would needs be a Judge of the Law, inſtead of
obeying it, and ſpeak evil of it rather then do it,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
                  <p>2. And thoſe things which you called im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable

God, of purpoſe to confirm it. If it had not

you will not believe the Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the witneſs ſeems incredible. And that is,
becauſe they are matters above the power of

                  <p>
                     <hi>The fifteenth Excuſe.</hi> It ſeemed ſo unlikely
a thing to me, that the merciful God ſhould damn

that the Governor of the world ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,

                  <p>3. Did you not feel pain and miſery begin in
this life?</p>
                  <p>4. You ſaw Toads and Serpents which had
never ſinned: And you would rather live in any
tolerable ſuffering, then to be a Toad. And is
it not Reaſon, that it ſhould go worſe with
contemptuous ſinners, then with thoſe creatures
that never ſinned?</p>
                  <p>5. Could you expect that thoſe ſhould come
to heaven, that would not believe there was
ſuch a ſtate, but refuſed it, and preferred the
world before it? And to be out of heaven is to
be out of all Happineſs: and he that is ſo out
of all happineſs, and knows that he loſt it by his
own folly, muſt needs Torment himſelf with
ſuch conſiderations, were there no other Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And as man is capable of greater felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

more miſery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſixteenth Excuſe.</hi> The things which
God promiſed in heaven, and threatned in Hell,
were all out of my ſight: and therefore I could not
heartily believe them. Had I but once ſeen them,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52141:125"/>
or ſpoke with one that had ſeen them, I ſhould
have been ſatisfied, and have contemned the things
of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Will you not believe till you ſee or
feel? was not Gods word ſufficient Evidence?
would you have beleived one from the dead
that had told you he had ſeen ſuch things? and
would you not believe <hi>Stephen</hi> that ſaw them?
<hi>Act.</hi> 7. 56. <hi>Or Paul</hi> that heard and ſaw them?
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3, 4. Nor Chriſt that came pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
from heaven to reveal them? why fleſh
and blood cannot ſee them. You ſee not God:
will you not therefore Believe that there is a
God? indeed, whatever you imagine, if you
would not Believe <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets,
Chriſt and his Apoſtles, neither would you have
believed though one had riſen from the dead.
For Gods word is more credible then a dead
mans: and Chriſt did riſe from the dead, to
atteſt it. Bleſſed are they that have not ſeen,
and yet believed. <hi>Noah ſaw</hi> no rain when he
was preparing the Ark: but becauſe he <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
he made ready and eſcaped, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52141:126"/>
that God would have Ruled me by, and the way to
Heaven was ſo ſtrait and difficult, that I could
not endure it. I was not able to deny my fleſh, and
live ſuch a life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You were not <hi>Able,</hi> becauſe you

wicked hearts that ſhould make ſuch a life ſeem

to him who loaths it, and whoſe heart is

                     </gap>o, was to <hi>love</hi> him, and make him your <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi>
And are Love and Delight ſuch grievous
things? It was not grievous to you to love your
meat, or drink, or money: It was no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to you to love a friend that loved you: no
nor to love your ſin, which was your enemy:
And what ſhould make it ſeem hard to love
God, but a wicked heart? Is not he better and
more Lovely then all theſe? And had you but
Loved him, all the reſt of his ſervice would have
ſeemed eaſie to you. To think of him, to ſpeak
of him, to pray to him, to praiſe him, yea to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
all and ſuffer for him, would have been ſweet
and pleaſant to you, ſo far as you had Loved
him. It was not God therefore, but your own
naughty hearts that made his work ſeem grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to you, and the way to heaven ſeem hard.
He told you truly, that his yoak was eaſie,
and his burden light, and his Commandments
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52141:126"/>
were not grievous, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>1. Joh.</hi> 5 3.
They that tryed them found them the very Joy
and Delight of their ſouls; and why could not
you do ſo?</p>
                  <p>2. But what if the way to heaven had been
harder then it was? was not heaven worth your
labour? were you afraid of being a loſer by it?
Could not God requite your labour or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings?
Doth any Repent when they come to
Heaven, that it coſt them ſo dear to come
thither? And is not hell worſe then the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
way to heaven? ſeeing you have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
hell to ſave you a labour and ſuffering in
in this life, you muſt have your choice. And
ſeeing you thought not everlaſting life to be
worth ſo much as God required, that is, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
thankfully, and minding, and ſeeking,
and preferring it before this life, you have none
to blame for the loſs of it but your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The eighteenth Excuſe.</hi> It was God that made
me of a ſenſual nature: He gave me an Appetite
to Meat, and Drink, and Eaſe, and luſt; He gave
me that fleſh which ruled me; how then can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
me, for living according to the nature which
he gave me?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> He gave that Appetite to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
moderately under the rule of reaſon, for the
preſervation and propagation of mankind. But
did he not alſo give you Reaſon to govern that
Appetite? and the Revelation of his will to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52141:127"/>
guide that Reaſon? He gave you your fleſh,
to be a ſervant, and not a maſter. Your beaſt
hath fleſhly Appetite without reaſon; and
therefore God hath put him under you who
have Reaſon that you ſhould Rule him. Will
you let your beaſt do what he liſt, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
run upon whom he liſt, and ſay, you do but
let him live according to his nature, which God
hath given him? Why God that gave him ſuch
a nature, did intend him to be Ruled by a higher
nature, even by the Reaſon which he gave to
you: And ſo he did alſo by your fleſh and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Appetite.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ninteenth Excuſe.</hi> But I lived among
ſo many baits, which enticed this fleſh, that I could
not reſiſt them. My meat was a ſnare to me, my
drink a ſnare, my cloaths, my houſe, my land a
ſnare, every beauty that I ſaw was a ſnare: and
the better all theſe were, the ſtronger was my
ſnare. If God would not have had my heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared
and drawn from him, he ſhould not have
put ſo many baits in my way. Yea and they were
ſo <hi>Neer</hi> to me, and <hi>Daily</hi> with me, that though I
was reſolved to forbear them before, yet when they
were brought to my hand, I could not forbear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is this the thanks that God hath for
his mercies? He ſent you all theſe as favours
from his own hand: He wrote his own name
upon them, that in them you might ſee his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52141:127"/>
and wiſdom, and goodneſs, and ſo be led up
to the Conſideration of him, that you might
fall in love with himſelf, who was the fountain,
the life, the end of all. And do you overlook
God in the creature, and live as without him in
the world, and dote upon that which ſhould
have drawn you to himſelf, and then lay the
blame on God? If he ſend a Suitor to ſpeak to
you in his name, and write you a love Letter
with his own hand, will you fall in Love with
the Meſſengers or the Letter, and neglect the
Sender, and then blame him that wrote his letter
on ſo fair a paper, or in ſo neat a hand, or that
ſent it by ſuch a comely Meſſenger? Certainly,
theſe Excuſes are too groſs, to take with the wiſe
and righteous God, or to ſeem ſufficient to a
well informed Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>2. And whereas you ſpeak of the power of
theſe objects, was there not much more in
God, in Chriſt, in the promiſed glory, to have
drawn your heart another way? why then did
not theſe take as much with you as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
You could not chooſe, forſooth, but be
enticed with ſuch baits as were fitted to your
ſenſual Appetite, and ſuch things as a dog, or a
ſwine may enjoy as well as a man: But you
could <hi>choſſe,</hi> when Chriſt and glory were offered
you: yea you did <hi>chooſe</hi> to refuſe the offer, and
tread them under feet by your neglect! When
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52141:128"/>
Satan ſet your Cups, and your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

profits before you, on one ſide; did not God
ſet his favour and everlaſting hapineſs on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide? And was it wiſe or equal dealing, to
preferr your luſts before that glory?</p>
                  <p>3. Moreover it was not in the power of any
of thoſe baits to force your will, or to neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
you to chooſe them. They could be but
<hi>Baits</hi> to entice you, and it was ſtill in your own
choice, wheth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r you would yield to the encice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and chooſe them or not. Shall every man
be falſe to God that hath any bait to entice him
from him? will you excuſe your child or friend,
if he would be falſe to you, upon as great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements
as theſe? If a cup-of drink, or a
whore, or a little gain, could draw him more
then all you love and intereſt, I do not think
you would hold him excuſed.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you ſpeak of the <hi>Neerneſs</hi> and
<hi>Continuance</hi> of theſe allurements, I would fain
know, was not God as <hi>Neer</hi> you, and <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually</hi>

cannot. Did he not ſtand by you when you
were in your cups and luſtfull Pleaſure? Did
he not tell you of the danger, and offer you far
better things, if you would obey him and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
thoſe baits? But you would hearken to
none of this; You ſhould have remembred that
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52141:128"/>
he ſtood over you, and was looking on you; and
you ſhould have ſaid as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39. 9.
<hi>How can I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God?</hi> You had alſo Scripture neer you,
and Reaſon neer you, and Conſcience neer you,
as well as the bait was neer you. And therefore
this is a vain Excuſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The twentieth Excuſe.</hi> It was God that
let looſe the Devil to tempt me; and he was to

wonder if I ſinned and were overcome?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He did not let looſe the Devil to

The Devil could nether make you ſin againſt
your will, nor yet Neceſſitate you to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                  <p>2. You were a ſure friend to Chriſt that
while, that would forſake him as oft as you
were tempted by the Devil. Is that a friend
or a ſervant worthy to be regarded, that will
diſobey you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or betray you as oft as he is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to it?</p>
                  <p>2. Will you excuſe your ſervant, if he leave
your work undone, and follow cards, or dice,
or the Ale-houſe, and ſay, I was tempted to it
by one that was cuninger then I? ſhall every
Murderer or Theif eſcape hanging, becauſe the
Devil was too cunning for him in his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52141:129"/>
would you have the Jury or the Judge
to take this for a good excuſe?</p>
                  <p>4. And why did you not hearken to God
that enticed you the other way? You forget
what helps he afforded you to diſcover the
wiles of Satan, and to vanquiſh the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
He <hi>told</hi> you it was an enemy that tempted
you: and would you hearken to an enemy?
He <hi>told</hi> you it was a dream, a ſhadow, a painted
pleaſure, a guilded carkaſs, a lying promiſe, and
deceitful vanity by which you were tempted;
And yet would you regard it before your
God? He told you that it was your God, your
Saviour, your hopes, your everlaſting happineſs
that the Tempter would beguile you of: And
yet would you be beguiled? He told you, and
plainly, and often told you that the Tempter
would lead you to eternal fire, and undo you
everlaſtingly before you were aware: and that a
fatal hook was covered with that bait: And yet
would you ſwallow it?</p>
                  <p>5. It is plain by all this, that it was not your
natural weakneſs of faculties that cauſed you to
be overcome by the ſubtilties of the Devil, as a
ſilly child is deceived by the crafty fellow that
overwits him: But it was your careleſneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſs,

vitious Inclination. 5. Nor freed
from the Temptations of the fleſh, the world

                  <p>But it was 1. Free from any natural Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination

doubtful. 2. And free from the Coaction or
Violence of any. 3. And free from an irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible
Determination of any exterior cauſe, at

have the power or faculty of determining your

Faculties in a great meaſure; yea of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

And if your wils which are naturally free, are
yet ſo habitually vitious, that they encline you
to do evil, that is not an excuſe, but an Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

folly, which God wil eaſily anſwer in a word.
The word [Power] is taken in ſeveral ſenſes.
Sometime, and moſt commonly and fitly, for a
faculty or a ſtrength by which a man <hi>Can</hi> do
his duty, if he <hi>Will.</hi> This Phyſickal Power you
have, and the worſt of ſinners have while they
are men on earth. Were they Actually willing,
they might acceptably perform ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
And were they Diſpoſitively willing,
they might Actually Believe and will. And
thus the ungodly have Power to Believe.</p>
                  <p>Sometime the word [Power] is taken for
Authority or Leave; for legal or civil Power.
And thus you have all not only Power or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to Believe but alſo a Command which
makes it your Duty, and a Threatning adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which will condemn you if you do not.</p>
                  <p>Sometime the word [Power] is taken

Ethically and leſs properly, for a diſpoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
Habit or Freedom from the contrary
habit or diſpoſition. And in this ſenſe its true,
that none but the effectually called have a
Power to Believe. But then obſerve, 1. That
this is but a moral leſs proper, and not a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
proper Impotency: And therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi>

becauſe we uſe to difference <hi>Power</hi> from <hi>willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
and <hi>willingneſs</hi> actuateth the <hi>Power</hi> which
we had before. And therefore our Divines
chooſe rather to call Grace a Habit when they

the Arminians for talking of a <hi>Power</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
in a <hi>Power</hi> 2. Note that this Impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is but the ſame thing with you unwillingneſs
and wilful blindneſs, in another word. 3. Note
that this Impotency is long of your ſelves as to
the Original, and much more as to the not-cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and removing of it, Hath God given you
no means towards the cure of this diſability,
which you have neglected? 4. Note that this
Impotency is nnjuſt excuſe but an Aggravation
of your ſin. If you were <hi>willing</hi> to be the ſervant
of Chriſt, and yet were not Able, either becauſe
he would not accept you or becauſe of a want
of natural faculties, or becauſe of ſome other
naural difficulty which the <hi>willingeſt</hi> mind could
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52141:131"/>
not overcome, this were ſome Excuſe: But to
be Habitually wilful in refuſing Grace, is
worſe then to be meerly Actually unwilling.
If a man have ſo accuſtomed himſelf to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
drunkeneſs, ſtealing, or the like wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo far that he cannot leave it, will you
therefore forgive him, or will any Judge or
Jury hold him excuſed? Or rather think him
the more unfit for mercy? 5. Note alſo that
the want of a ſupernatural Habit, no nor the
preſence of the contrary Habit, do not Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
determine the will to particular acts:
much leſs take away its natural Fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>om.
6. And that till Habits attain an utter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy,
(at leaſt) there is a Power remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the will to reſiſt them, and uſe means
againſt them. Though Eventually the perverſe
Inclination may hinder the uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The three and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> I have heard
from learned men, that God doth determine all
Actions, Natural and Free, as the firſt Efficient
Phyſical immediate Cauſe: or elſe nothing could
Act. And then it was not long of me that I choſe
forbidden Objects, but of him that irreſiſtly moved
me therto, and whoſe Inſtrument I was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a trick of that wiſdom which
is fooliſhneſs with God, and to be deceived by

                  <p>1. The very principle it ſelf is moſt likely to

be falſe, and thoſe that tell you this, to err.
Much more, I think, may be ſaid againſt it then
for it.</p>
                  <p>2. I am ſure it is either falſe or reconcileable
with Gods Holineſs, and mans liberty and

when the Truth which you oppoſe by it is
infallibly certain. That God is not the Author
of ſin, but man himſelf, who is juſtly condemned
for it, is undoubtedly true: and would you
obſcure ſo clear a Truth, by ſearching into
points beyond homane reach if not unſound, as
you conclude them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The four and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> But at
leaſt, thoſe learned Divines among us that doubt
of this, do yet ſay that the will is neceſſarily and
infallbly Determined by the Practical Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that is as much unreſiſtibly neceſſitated
by Objects: and therefore whatever act was done
by my underſtanding or will, was thus neceſſitated,
and I could not help it. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Acting of the faculty aggreeably to its nature:
And it was God as Creator that gave <hi>Adam</hi> his
faculties: and God by providential dtſpoſe, that
preſented all Objects to him, by Which hi under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,

                  <p>

former: uncertain, if no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> certainly falſe. Were
this true, for ought we can ſee, it would lay all
the ſin and miſery of this world on God, as the
unreſiſtible neceſſitating Cauſe; which becauſe
we know infallibly to be falſe, we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to take ſuch principles to be true which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it. The underſtanding doth not by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
efficiency Determine the will but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally;
or rather, is regularly a Condition or
neceſſary Antecedent, without which it may
not Determine itſelf. Yea the Will by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the ſenſe and phantaſie, doth much to
determine the Underſtanding. As the eye is not
neceſſary to my <hi>going,</hi> but to my <hi>going right,</hi> ſo
is not the Underſtandings Guidance neceſſary
to my <hi>willing</hi> (there the ſimple Apprehenſion
may ſuffice but to my <hi>Right willing.</hi> There
are other wayes of Determining the Will Or
if the Underſtanding did Determine the Will
Efficiently and Neceſſarily, it is not every act
of the Underſtanding that muſt do it. If it be
ſo, when it ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This may be done, or you may venture on it;
which is the common part which it hath in

                  <p>I am not pleaſed that theſe curious Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
fall in the way, nor do I delight to put
them into vulgar heads; but finding many
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:52141:132"/>
young Schollars and others that have conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with them, aſſaulted with theſe Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I thought meet to give a touch, and but
a touch, to take them out of their way: As
<hi>Mr. Fenner</hi> hath done more fully in the Preface
to his <hi>Hidden Manna,</hi> on this laſt point, to
which I refer you. I only add this;</p>
                  <p>The will of man in its very Dominion doth
bear Gods Image. It is a ſelf Determining Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
though it <hi>byaſſed</hi> by <hi>Habits</hi> and <hi>needs</hi> a
<hi>Guide.</hi> As the Heart &amp; Vital Spirits by which it
acteth, are to the reſt of the Body, ſo is <hi>It</hi> to
the ſoul. The Light of Nature hath taught all
the world to carry the Guilt of every crime to
the <hi>will</hi> of man, and there to leave it; Upon this
all Laws and Judgements are grounded. From
Ignorance and Intellectual weakneſs, men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
fetch Excuſes for their faults; but from
the <hi>Will</hi> they are Aggravated. If we think it
ſtrange that mans will ſhould be the firſt cauſe,
ſo much as of a ſinful <hi>mode,</hi> and anſwer all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
Objections: it may ſuffice that we are
certain the Holy Majeſty is not the Author of
ſin; and he is able to make all this as plain as
the Sun, and eaſily anſwer all theſe vain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
though we ſhould be unable. And if we
be much ignorant of the frame and motions of
our own ſouls, and eſpecially of that high ſelf
determining principle, Free-Will, the great
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52141:133"/>
ſpring of our actions, and the curious Engine
by which God doth <hi>Sapientially</hi> Govern the
world, it is no wonder; Conſidering that the
ſoul can know it ſelf but by Reflection, and
God gave us a ſoul to <hi>uſe,</hi> rather then to know
itſelf; and to know its qualities and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
rather then its Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The five and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> No man
can be ſaved, nor avoid any ſin, nor believe in
Chriſt, but thoſe whom God hath predeſtinated
thereto. I was under an irreverſible Sentence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was born: and therefore I do nothing but
what I was predeſtinated to do; and if God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
not to ſave me, how could I help it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Gods Judgements are more plain,
but his Decrees or ſecret purpoſes are myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
And to darken certainties, by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to points obſcure, is no part of Chriſtian
Wiſdom. God told you your Duty in his
word, and on what terms vou muſt be Judged
to Life or Death; Hither ſhould you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
for Direction, and not to the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
myſteries of his <hi>mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. God decreeth not to Condemn any but
for ſin. Sin, I ſay, as the Cauſe of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
though not of his Decree.</p>
                  <p>3. Gods Decrees are acts Immanent in
himſelf, and make no change on you, and
therefore do not neceſſitate you to ſin, any
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52141:133"/>
more then his fore-knowledge doth. For both
cauſe only a neceſſity of Confequence, which
is Logical, as the Divines on both ſides do
Conſeſs. And therefore this no more cauſed
you to ſin, then if there had been no ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.
And its a doubt whether that Decree be
not negative; A willing ſuſpending of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
will, as to evil; or at moſt A purpoſe to
permit it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſix and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> If it be no
more, yet doth it make my perdition unavoidable;
For even Gods foreknowledge doth ſo; For if he
foreknow it, all the World cannot hinder it from
coming to paſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Muſt God either be Ignorant of
what you will do, or elſe be the cauſe of it? If
you foreknow that the Sun will riſe to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
that doth not cauſe it to riſe. If you fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know
that one man will murder another, you
are not the cauſe of it by foreknowing it. So is
it here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſeven and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> God might
have hindred my Sin and Damnation if he
would.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> And will you wilfully ſin, and think
to ſcape becauſe God doth not hinder you?
The Prince that makes a Law againſt murder,
could lock you up, and keep you from being a
Murderer! But are you excuſable if he do not?
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52141:134"/>

puniſh one ſin twice?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ</hi> 1. Chriſt ſuffered for man in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man; but not in your perſon, nor you in
him. It was not you that provided the price, but
God himſelf. Chriſt was not mans Deligate in
ſatisfying, and therefore received not his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
from us, nor did it on our terms, but his
own. It was not the <hi>ſame thing</hi> which the Law
threatned, that Chriſt underwent: for that was
the Damnation of the ſinner himſelf, and not
the ſuffering of another for him; it cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52141:137"/>
be yours, but on Chriſts own terms. He
dyed for thy ſin, but with this intent, that for
all that, if thou Refuſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>m<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou ſhalt dye thy
ſelf. It is therefore no wrong to thee to dye, for
it was not thou that dyedſt before: And Chriſt
will take it for no wrong to him; For <hi>he</hi> will
Judge thee to that Death. It is for refuſing a
Chriſt that dyed for thee that thou muſt periſh
for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The eight and thirtieth Excuſe.</hi> But I did not
Refuſe Chriſt. I believed and truſted in him to
the laſt; and Repented of my ſins, though I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
wasovertaken with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Had this been true, thy ſin would
not have condemned thee. But there is no

they Believed and Repented that indeed they
did not. By thy works alſo will this be diſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that is, by the main bent and ſcope of thy
life, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. throughout and <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.</p>

                     <hi>The nine and thirtieth Excuſe.</hi> I did many
Good Works; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thy good works were thy ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
indeed they were not good, being not
done in ſincerity of heart for God. The beſt
mans works have ſome infirmity, which nothing
can clenſe but the blood of Chriſt, which thou
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52141:137"/>
haſt made light of, and therefore haſt no part
in. If all thy liſe had been ſpent in perfect
works except one day, they would not make
ſatisfaction for the ſins of that day. For they
are but part of thy Dut. Wo to him that hath
no better a Saviour at Judegment, then his own
good works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Fortieth Excuſe.</hi> I lived in poverty and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſery
on earth, and therefore I hope I have had
my ſuffering here and ſhall not ſuffer in this world
and another too.</p>
                  <p>1. By that Rule all poor men, and murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and thieves that are tormented and hanged,
ſhould be ſaved, but as Goolineſs hath the

and Wickedneſs hath the Threatning
of this life and that to come.</p>
                  <p>2. The Devils and the damned have ſuffered
much more then you already; and yet they are
never the nearer a Deliverance. When thou
haſt ſuffered ten thouſand years, thy pain will
be never the neerer an end. How then can a
little miſery on earth prevent it? Alas poor
ſoul, theſe are but the foretaſts and beginnings
of thy ſorrow. Nothing but pardon through
the blood of Chriſt could have prevented thy
Condemnation; and that thou rejectedſt by
Infidelity and Impenitency. <hi>His</hi> Sufferings
would have ſaved thee, if thou hadſt not Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52141:138"/>
him; but all thy own Sufferings will yeild
thee no Relief.</p>
                  <p>So much for the anſwering of the <hi>Vain Excuſes</hi>
which poor Sinners are ready to make for them
ſelves; Wherein I have been ſo large, as that
this part I confeſs is diſproportionable to the
reſt: but it was for theſe two Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>1. That poor careleſs ſouls might ſee the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ſuch Defences; and conſider, if ſuch a
worm as I can eaſily confute them, how eaſily
and how terribly will they be all anſwered by
their Judge?</p>
                  <p>2. I did it the rather, that godly Chriſtians
might the better underſtand how to deal with
theſe vain Excuſes when they meet with them:
which will be daily, if they deal with men in this
ſad Condition.</p>
                  <p>X. WE have done with that part of the
Judgement which conſiſteth in the
exploration or tryal of the cauſe; we now
come to that which is the Concluſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation
of all; and that is, to ſhew you <hi>what
the Sentence will be, and on whom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for this, we muſt go ſtrait to the word
of God for our light, it being impoſſible for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man to have any particular knowledge of it,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52141:138"/>
if Chriſt had not there revealed it unto us. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
almoſt all the world do acknowledge a life
after this, where it ſhall go well with the good,
and ill with the bad. But who ſhall be then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<hi>Righteous,</hi> and who <hi>Vnrighteous,</hi> and
on what terms and grounds, by whom they
ſhall be judged, and to what condition, they
know not.</p>
                  <p>The Sentence in Judgement will be, 1. Either
on thoſe that never had means to know Chriſt.
2 Or on thoſe that had.</p>
                  <p>1. For the former, as it leſs concerneth us to
enquire of their caſe, ſo it is more obſcurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to us in the Scripture. It is certain that
they ſhal1 be judged according to their Uſe of
the means which they had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16. and the Talents which they received,
<hi>Mat. 25.</hi> But that it ever falleth out that he
that hath but the One Talent of natural helps
doth improve it to ſalvation, or that ever they
who knew not Chriſt, are Juſtified and ſaved
without that knowledge (being at age and uſe
of reaſon) I find not in the Scriptures. I find
indeed, that [As many as have ſinned without
Law, ſhall alſo periſh without Law: and as
many as have ſinned <hi>in</hi> the Law, ſhall be Judged
<hi>by</hi> the <hi>Law. Rom.</hi> 2. 12. But not that any are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
by the works of nature, ſuch as are here
ſaid to be <hi>without Law.</hi> I find alſo, that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52141:139"/>
[They have the work of the Law written in

I believe it is a <hi>Juſt Excuſe,</hi> and not an <hi>unjuſt</hi>
which is here meant But it will be but an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi>
ſo far as they were guiltleſs and that will

may excuſe him from thoſe ſins which he
was never guilty of; but not from all. But no
more of them.</p>
                  <p>2. The caſe of thoſe that have had the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
is more plainly opened to us in Gods Word,
Their <hi>Sentence,</hi> is opened in many places of
Scripture, but moſt fully in <hi>Matth</hi> 25. whence
we will now collect it.</p>
                  <p>There we find that Jeſus Chriſt the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
as King of the world, ſhall ſit in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on all men at the laſt; and ſhall ſeperate
them one from another, as a Shepherd divideth
the Sheep from the Goats, and ſo ſhall paſs the
final Sentence. This Sentence is twofold, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the different Condition of them that
are judged. To them on the right hand, there
is a Sentence of juſtification, and Adjudication
to everlaſting glory; To them on the left hand,
there is a Sentence of Condemnation to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:52141:139"/>
The Sentence on each of theſe containeth,
both the ſtate which they are Judged to, and
the reaſon or cauſe of the Judgement to that
ſtate. For as God will not Iudge any to Life or
Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without juſt cauſe, ſo he will publiſh
this cauſe in his ſentence, as it is the manner of
Judges to do; If you ſay, <hi>Chriſt will not uſe a
voice;</hi> Let it ſatisfie, that though we know not
the manner, yet if he do it but by mental diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery;
as he ſhews men <hi>what</hi> ſhall everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
befall them, ſo he will ſhew them <hi>why</hi> it ſhall
ſo befall them.</p>
                  <p>1. The <hi>Sentence</hi> on them on the <hi>Right</hi> hand,
will contain, 1. their Juſtification and Adjudicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> &amp; that both as generally deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,
and as particularly determined, and
deſcribed, 2. And the cauſe of this Iudgement.</p>
                  <p>1. In general they ſhall be pronounced <hi>Bleſſed.</hi>
Satan would have had them curſed and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
the Law did curſe them to miſery; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a fearful thought hath poſſeſſed their own
breſts, leaſt they ſhould prove at laſt accurſed
and miſerable; But now they hear the contrary
from their Iudge. All the Promiſes in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
could not perfectly overcome thoſe their
fears; all the comfortable words of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Goſpel conld not perfectly ſubdue
them; all the tend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52141:140"/>
are vanquiſhed all for ever. He that once had

<hi>Bleſſed,</hi> will never fear being <hi>Curſed</hi> more. For

and will proclaim him the Principal Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Ultimate end of his work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
and the bleſſedneſs of his Saints; and
that himſelf is (as Mediator) but the <hi>way</hi> to
the Father. It is the Father that <hi>prepared</hi> the
Kingdom for them, and <hi>from the foundation of

<hi>choſen ones,</hi> and for them as <hi>future believers and
Righteous ones.</hi> It is called a Kingdom partly
in reſpect to God the King, in whoſe glory we
ſhall partake in our places: and partly Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically
from the Dignity of our Condition.
For ſo it is that our ſelves are ſaid to be made

Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. and 5. 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. and not
that we are properly Kings; for then we muſt

                  <p>Thus we ſee their Bleſſedneſs in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
end and ſtate of Dignity: As to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive
Act on their part, it is expreſſed by two
words; one ſignifying their firſt entrance on it,

for ever.</p>
                  <p>The true Believer was convinced in this life,
that indeed there was no true bleſſedneſs, but
this enjoyment of God in the Kingdom of
heaven. The Lord revealed this to his heart
by his Word and Spirit: And therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
the ſeeming happineſs on earth and laid
up for himſelf a Treaſure in heaven, and made
him friends with the Mammon of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
and ventured all his hope in this Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.
And <hi>now</hi> he findeth the wiſdom of that
choice in a rich return. God made him ſo
<hi>Wiſe</hi> a Merchant as to ſell All for this Pearl of
greateſt price: and therefore now he ſhall find
the gain. As there <hi>Is</hi> no other true Happineſs,
but God in glory; ſo is there nothing more
<hi>ſuitable</hi> and <hi>welcom</hi> to the true Believer. O
how welcome will the face of that God be,
whom he <hi>loved,</hi> whom he <hi>ſought,</hi> whom he

                     <hi>longed</hi> and <hi>waited</hi> for. How welcome will that
Kingdom be which he lived in <hi>Hope</hi> of! which he
parted with All for! and ſuffered for in the
fleſh! How glad will he be to ſee the Bleſſed face
of his Redeemer, who by his manifold Grace
hath brought him unto this! I leave the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſoul to think of it, and to make it the daily
matter of his Delightful Meditation; What an
unconceivable Ioy in one moment, his Sentence
of Chriſt will fill his ſoul with. Undoubtedly
it is now quite paſt our comprehenſion: though
our imperfect forethoughts of it may well make
our lives a continual Feaſt.</p>
                  <p>Were it but our Iuſtification from the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations

                  <p>Indeed he will Juſtifie them that are ſinners,

guilty of puniſhment for ſin:</hi> but that is, becauſe

them before he juſtifie them againſt the charge
of being ſinners in general; and he will firſt

before he will juſtifie them againſt the

charge of being Impenitent, Infidels or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
and conſequently unpardoned, and

conſtitute them Juſt, before he will <hi>Declare</hi> it,
and <hi>Sentence</hi> them juſt.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The Reaſon of the ſentence, particularly
Deſcribed, is from their Faith and Love to
Chriſt, expreſſed in their Obedience, ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal
and forſaking all for him.</hi> For I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
and ye fed me; I Was thirſty and ye gave me

and ye cloathed me: I was ſick and ye viſited

ſay unto you, in aſ much as ye have done it to one
of the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye have done it
unto me <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 35. to 41. Here is 1. The
cauſal conjunction <hi>for,</hi> 2. And the Cauſe or
Reaſon it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Concerning both which, Obſerve, 1. How
it is that mans Obedience and ſelf-denyal is
the Reaſon and Cauſe of his Juſtification.
2. Why it is that God will have the Reaſon
or Cauſe thus declared in the Sentence.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt; obſerve that its one thing to
give a Reaſon of the Sentence, and another
thing to expreſs the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Benefit, Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
us by the promiſe, and <hi>Judged</hi> to us by the
<hi>Sentence.</hi> Mans Obedience was no proper
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52141:142"/>
Cauſe why God did in this life <hi>Give</hi> pardon of
ſin to us, or a Right to glory: much leſs of his
Giving Chriſt to dye for us. And therefore as
to our Conſtitutive Juſtification at our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
we muſt not <hi>ſay</hi> or <hi>think</hi> that God
doth Juſtifie us, For, or <hi>Becauſe</hi> of any works
of our Obedience, Legal or Evangelical. But
when God hath ſo Juſtified us, when he comes
to give a Reaſon of his Sentence in Judgement,
he may and will fetch that Reaſon, partly from
our Obedience, or our performance of the
Conditions of the New Covenant. For as in
this life, we had a Righteouſneſs conſiſting in
free pardon of all ſin through the blood of
Chriſt, and a Righteouſneſs conſiſting in our
perſonal perormance of the Conditions of the
promiſe which giveth that pardon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
it to us: ſo at Judgement we ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
be juſtified. And as our Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
perſonal Righteouſneſs, commonly called
<hi>Inherent,</hi> was at firſt only in our Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and Diſpoſition to obey: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in our Actual ſincere Obedience, in which
ſenſe we are Conſtitutively Juſtified or made
Righteous here by our works, in <hi>James</hi> his
ſenſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 24. ſo accordingly a double
Reaſon will be aſſigned of our ſentential Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
One from our pardon by Chriſts blood
and merits; which will prove our Right to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:52141:143"/>
and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lory. The other from our
own Faith and holy Obedience, which will
prove our Right to that pardon through Chriſt,
and to the free Gift of a Right to glory: and
ſo this laſt is to be pleaded in ſubordination to
the former. For Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s beeome the the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of Eternal ſalvation to all them that Obey
him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. He therefore that will be ſaved,
muſt have a <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſave him as the Author,
and an <hi>Obedience</hi> to that Chriſt as the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on of that ſalvation; and conſequently both
muſt be declared in the Iudgement</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon why the ludge doth mention
our Good works, rather then our Believing,
may be becauſe thoſe holy ſelf-denying expeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Faith and Love to Chriſt do contain
or certainly imply Faith in them, as the life of
the tree in the fruit: but faith doth contain
our works of Obedience but only as their cauſe.
Theſe works alſo are a part of the perſonal
Righteouſneſs which is to be enquired after,
that is, we ſhall not be Iudged righteous, meerly
becauſe we have Believed, but alſo becauſe we
have added to our Faith vertue: and have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

which we muſt part with or hazard by the works
that are here mentioned.</p>
                  <p>2. The Reaſons why Chriſt will ſo publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Declare the perſonal righteouſneſs of men, to
be the Reaſon or Cauſe of his Iuſtifying ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
it is becauſe It is the buſineſs of that day,
not only to glorifie Gods meer Love &amp; Mercy,
but eminently to glorifie his Remunerative Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice;
and not only to expreſs his love to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
as ſuch, but to expeſs his love to them
as <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>Obedient,</hi> and ſuch as have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed

And to ſhew his juſtice to the men, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in fulfilling all his promiſes, and alſo his
holineſs in the high eſtimation of the holineſs of
his people. I ſhall expreſs this in the words of a
Learned Divine (Dr <hi>Twiſs</hi> againſt M. <hi>Cotton,</hi>
pag 40.) <hi>Was there no more in Gods intention
when he elected ſome, then the manifeſtation of
the riches of his glorious grace? Did not God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
alſo to manifeſt the glory of his Remunerative
Juſtice? It is not undenyable that God will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
ſalvation on all his Elect (of ripe years)

                  <p>This Sentence containeth, 1. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation

of it.</p>
                  <p>The Condemnation expreſſeth the miſery
which they are judged to. 1 Generally in the

Deſcription of their Curſed ſtate.</p>

Accept his offer, that their ſouls might live.
From the Holy Ghoſt the Sanctifier and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
of the faithful, who ſtrove with their
hearts, till they quenched and expelled him. O
ſad <hi>Departing!</hi> who would not then chooſe
rather to <hi>Depart</hi> from all the friends he had in
the world, and from any thing Imaginable;
from his life, from himſelf, if it were poſſible,
then from Chriſt? <hi>Depart!</hi> from what? why
from the preſence of the Judge; from all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hopes of ſalvation for ever: from all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of ever being ſaved, and living in the
joyful inheritance of the Righteous. <hi>Depart!</hi>
Not from Gods Eſſential preſence, for that will
be with them to their evelaſting miſery, but
from the preſence of his Grace, in that meaſure
as they enjoyed it. <hi>Depart!</hi> Not from your
fleſhly, pleaſures, and honours, and profits of
the world; Theſe were all gone and paſt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and there was no further need to bid them
<hi>Depart</hi> from theſe; Houſes and Lands were
gone. Mirth and Recreations were gone.
Their ſweet morſels and cups were gone. All
the Honour that men could give them was
gone, before they were ſet at Chriſts barr to be
Iudged. But from all expectations of ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
theſe again, or ever <hi>taſting</hi> their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:52141:145"/>
delights; from theſe they muſt Depart: No
from their <hi>ſin,</hi> for that will go with them. But
the Liberty of commiting that part of it which
was ſweet to them, as Gluttony, Drunkenneſs,
Whoredom, Idleneſs, and all Voluptuouſneſs;
from theſe they muſt <hi>Depart.</hi> But this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential;
It is Chriſt and the Poſſibility
of ſalivation, that they are Sentenced to <hi>Depart</hi>
from.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Whither</hi> muſt they <hi>Depart?</hi> 1. Into
fire. 2. Into <hi>that</hi> fire which was prepared for
the Devil and his Angels. 3. Into everlaſting
fire.</p>
                  <p>1. Not into a <hi>Purifying,</hi> but a <hi>Tormenting</hi>
fire. Whether Elementary or not; Whether
properly or Metaphorically called <hi>fire,</hi> let us
not vainly trouble or ſelves to enquire. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to know, that as fire is one of the moſt
grievous Tormentors of the fleſh, ſo grievous
will be thoſe infernal Torments to the whole
man, ſoul and body; Such as is moſt fitly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to us under the notion of <hi>fire,</hi> and of
<hi>burning.</hi> Its eaſie for a ſecure unbelieving ſoul
to read and hear of it! but woe, and ten
thouſand woes to them that muſt endure it. In
this life they had their good things, when it
went harder as to the fleſh with better men;
but now they are tormented, when the godly
are comforted, as <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:52141:145"/>
2. But why is it called <hi>a fire prerared for the
Devil and his Angels?</hi> 1. What is this Divel
That hath Angels? 2. Who are his Angels?
3. When was it prepared for them? 4. Was it
not alſo prepared for wicked men? To theſe
in order.</p>
                  <p>1. It ſeems by many paſſages in Scripture,
that there is an Order among Spirits, both
Good and Bad; and that there is one Devil
that is the Prince over the reſt.</p>
                  <p>2. It ſeem therefore that it's the reſt of the
evil ſpirits, that are called <hi>his Angels.</hi> And
ſome think that the wicked who ſerved him in
this life, ſhall be numbered with his Angels in
the life to come. Indeed the Apoſtle calls him
<hi>The God of this world, 2 Cor 4. 4. as is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
Iudged by Expoſitors; and the Prince of the
power of the Aire, the Spirit that now worketh in
the children of diſobedience, Eph.</hi> 2. 2. And he
Calleth falſe ſeducing Teachers <hi>the Miniſters of
Satan.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>1. 15 But that wicked men are
Here meant as part of his Angels, is not clear.</p>
                  <p>3. If it be the preparation of Gods purpoſe
that is here meant, then it was from Eternity;
but if it be any Commination of God as Ruler
of the Angels, then was this fire prepared for
them Conditionally, from the beginning of that
Commination, and was <hi>Due</hi> to them at their
fall</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:52141:146"/>
4. It ſeems that the Reaſon why here is no
mention of preparing Hell-fire for the wicked,
but only for the Devils, is not be cauſe indeed it
<hi>was not</hi> prepared alſo for the wicked; but to
note, that it is the Torment which was <hi>firſt</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for, or aſſigned to the Devils, thereby
ſhewing the greatneſs of the miſery of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
that the Devil and his Angels muſt be their
Companions. Though ſome think, as is ſaid
before, that the reaſon why wicked men are not
Mentioned here, is becauſe they are part of the
Angels of the Devil, and ſo included. And
ſome think it is purpoſely to manifeſt Gods Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Love to mankind, that prepared not Hell
<hi>for them,</hi> but they caſt themſelves into the Hell
prepared for the Devils. But the firſt ſeems to
be the true ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>And how apparently Righteous are the
Judgements of the Lord! that thoſe men who
would here entertain the Devil into their hearts
and daily familiarity, ſhould be then entertained
by him into <hi>his</hi> place of Torments, and there
remain for ever in his ſociety! Though few en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
him into Viſible familiarity with their
bodies as Witches do, who ſo make him their
<hi>Familiar;</hi> yet all wicked men do entettain him
into more full &amp;c <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nſtant familiarity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with their
ſo uls then theſe withces do with their bodies.
how <hi>famliariar</hi> is he in their thoughts, to fill
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52141:146"/>
them with vanity, luſt, or revenge! How <hi>fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi>
is he in their hearts to fill them with cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,
malice, pride, or the like evils? and to
baniſh all thoughts of returning to God, and to
quench every motion that tendeth to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery?
How <hi>familiar</hi> is he with them, even
when they ſeem to be worſhipping God in
the publike Aſſembles; ſtealing the word out of
their hearts, filling them with vain and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
thoughts, blinding their minds that they
cannot underſtand the plaineſt words that we
are able to ſpeak to them, and filling them with
a proud rebellion againſt the Direction of their
Teachers, and an obſtinate refuſal to be ruled
by them, be the matter never ſo neceſſary to
their own ſalvation? How <hi>familiar</hi> are theſe
evil Spirits in their houſes, filling them with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
worldlineſs, and ungodlineſs, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
out Gods ſervice, ſo that they do not pray
together once in a day, or perhaps at all?
How <hi>familiarly</hi> doth Satan uſe their tongues,
in curſing, ſwearing, lying ribaldry, backbiting,
or ſlandring? and is it not juſt with God to make
theſe fiends their <hi>familiars</hi> in Torment, with
whom they entertained ſuch <hi>familiarity</hi> in ſin?
As Chriſt with all the Bleſſed Angels and Saints
will make but one Kingdom or family, and ſhall
live altogether in perpetual Delights; ſo the
Devil and all his Helliſh Angels and wicked
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:52141:147"/>
men ſhall make but one houſe-hold, and ſhall
live altogether in perpetual miſery. O poor
ſinners I you are not troubled now at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,

heard, but his company will be terrible to the
ſtouteſt heart alive. He ſheweth you a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
face when he tempteth you, but he hath a
grimmer face to ſhew you, when temptations
have conquered you and torments muſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed!
As thoſe that write of Witches, ſay,
he appeareth at firſt to them in ſome comely
tempting ſhape, till he have them faſt tyed to
him; and then he beats them, and affrights
them, and ſeldom appears to them but in ſome
ugly hew. Believe it, poor ſinners, you do
not hear or ſee the worſt of him, when you are
merry about your ſinful Pleaſuers, and Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in your Hopes of the Commodities or
Preferments of the world; he hath another
kind of Voice which you muſt hear, &amp; another
face to ſhew you, that will make you know a
a little better, whom you had to do with! You
would be afraid now to meet him in the dark;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52141:147"/>
what will you be to live with him in everlaſting
darkneſs? Then you will know who it was that
you entertained and obeyed, and plaid with in
your ſins.</p>
                  <p>3. And as the Text tells us, that it is <hi>a fire
prepared for the Devil and his Angles:</hi> So it
telleth us, that it is <hi>An everlaſting fire.</hi> It had
a beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it ſhall have no end. If theſe
wretches would have choſen the ſervice of God,
they would have met with no difficulty or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but what would have had a ſpeedy end.
Poverty and Injuries would have had an end:
ſcorns and abuſes would have had an end: faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
humiliation ſorrow for ſin, watching, and
fighting againſt our ſpiritual enemies, would all
have had an end. But to avoid theſe, they choſe
that eaſe, that pleaſure, which hath brought
them to that torment which <hi>never</hi> will have
end. I have ſaid ſo much of theſe thing already
in my Book called the Saints Reſt, that I will
now ſay but this much. It is one of the wonders
of the world, how men that do believe,
or think they do believe this word of Chriſt to
be true, that <hi>the wicked ſhall go into Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
fire,</hi> can yet venture on ſin ſo boldly, and live
in it ſo fearleſly, or ſleep quietly till they are
out of this unſpeakable Danger! Only the
Commonneſs of it, and the known wickedneſs
of mans heart, doth make this leſs wonderful.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52141:148"/>
And were there nothing elſe to convince us
that ſinners are Mad and Dead as to ſpiritual
things, this were enough; That ever the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
pleaſures or profits of the World, or the moſt
enticing baits that the Devil can offer them,
ſhould once prevail with them to forget theſe
endleſs things, and draw them to reject an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
Glory, and caſt themſelves deſperately
into <hi>Everlaſting fire;</hi> Yea and all this under dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
warnings and inſtructions; and when its told
them before hand by the God of Truth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!
For the Lords ſake, Sirs, and for your
ſouls ſakes if you care not what Miniſters ſay or
what ſuch as I ſay, yet will you ſoberly read now
and then this 25. Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and
Regard what is told you by him that muſt be

ſelves ſoberly, whether theſe are matters for
wiſe men to make light of? and what it is
to be <hi>Everlaſtingly in Heaven or in Hell
fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. We have ſeen what is the Penalty contained
in the ſentence againſt the ungodly; The next
thing that the Text directs us to, is the Cauſe or
Reaſon of the Sentence, verſ. 42. <hi>For I was
hungry, and ye gave me no meat,</hi> &amp;c. Then Reaſon
is not given expreſly either of their ſin againſt
the Law of works, that is, Becauſe they were
ſinners, and not perfectly <hi>Innocent;</hi> Nor yet
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52141:148"/>
from their unbelief, which is the great ſin againſt
the Law of Grace: But it is given from their
not expreſſing their Faith and Love to Chriſt
is works of mercy and ſelf-denyal. And why is
this ſo?</p>
                  <p>1. We muſt not ſuppoſe that theſe words of
Chriſt do expreſs the <hi>whole</hi> Judicial proceſs in
every point; but the cheif parts. It is ſuppoſed
that all men are convicted of being ſinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the perfect Law of the Creator, and that
they are guilty of Death for that ſin: and that
there is no way but by Chriſt to obtain delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
But becauſe all this muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the righteous themſelves, as well as by
the wicked, therefore Chriſt doth not mention
this, but that only wchich is the turning point or
cuaſe in the Judgement. For it is not all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
that ſhall be finally Condemned but all
Impenitent, Unbeleiving ſinners, who have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
finally againſt their Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>2. And the reaſon why Faith it ſelf is not
expreſſed is, 1. Becauſe it is clearly implyed,
and ſo is love to Chriſt as Redeemer: in that
they ſhould have Relieved <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf in
his members: that is, as its expreſſed, <hi>Matth.</hi>
10. 42. they ſhould have received a Prophet
in the name of Prophet; and a Diſciple in
the name of a Diſciple; All ſhould be done
for Chriſts ſake; which could not be, unleſs
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:52141:149"/>
they Believed in him, and Loved him. 2. Alſo
becauſe that the bare Act of Believing is not all
that Chriſt requireth to a mans final Juitifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Salvation; But holy ſelf denying O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
muſt be added. And therefore this
is given as the Reaſon of their Condemnation
that they did not ſo obey.</p>
                  <p>We muſt obſerve alſo, that Chriſt here put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the ſpecial for the general; that is, one
way of ſelf-denying Obedience, and expreſſion
of Love, inſtead of ſuch Obedience in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral!
For al men have not ability to relieve
thoſe in miſery, being perhaps ſome of them
poor themſelves. But all have that Love and
ſelf-denyal, which will ſome way expreſs it
ſelf. And all have hearts and a Diſpoſition to
do thus, if they had ability; without ſuch a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
none can be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>It is the fond conceit of ſome, that if they
have any love to the godly, or wiſh them well, it
is enough to prove them happy. But Chriſt here
purpoſely lets us know, that whoever doth not
Love him at ſo high a rate, as that he can part
with his ſubſtance or any thing in the world, to
thoſe uſes which he ſhall require them, even to
relieve his ſervants in want and ſufferings for
the maſters ſake, that man is none of Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
nor will be owned by him at the laſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:52141:149"/>
XI. THE next point that we come to,
is to ſhew you the <hi>Properties</hi> of this
Sentence at Judgement.</p>
                  <p>When man had broken the Law of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
at the firſt, he was lyable to the Sentence
of Death, and God preſently ſate in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on him, and ſentenced him to ſome part
of the Puniſhment which he had deſerved; But
upon the Interpoſition of the Son, he before
the reſt, reſolving on a way that might tend to
his Recovery; And Death is due yet to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſinner for every ſin which he commits, till
a pardon do acquit him. But this Sentence
which will paſs on ſinners at the laſt Judgement
doth much differ from that which was paſſed
on the firſt ſin, or which is Due according to
the Law of works alone; for,</p>
                  <p>1. As to the Penalty, called the Pain of Loſs,
the firſt Judgement did deprive man of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of his Creator; but the ſecond will deprive
him of the favour both of the Creator and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;
The firſt Iudgement deprived him of the
Benefits of Innocency: the ſecond deprives him
of the Benefits of Redemption; The Loſs of his
hopes &amp; poſſibility of a pardon, of the Spirit, of
Inſtification &amp; Adoption, and of the benefits w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:52141:150"/>
Conditionally were promiſed and offered him;
theſe are the Puniſhments of the laſt Iudgement,
which the Law of works did never threaten to
the firſt man, or to any, as it ſtood alone.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the loſs of Glory as Recovered, is the
proper penalty of the violated Law of Grace:
which is more then the firſt loſs. As if a man
ſhould loſe his Purſe the ſecond time, when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath once found it for him; Or rather as if a
Traytor Redeemed by another, and having his
life and honours offered him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he will Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Accept it and come in, ſhould by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal
and Obſtinacy, loſe this Recovered Life,
which is offered him; which is an addition to his
former penalty.</p>
                  <p>Beſides that the Higher degree of Glory will
be loſt, which Chriſt would beſtow on him,
more then was loſt at firſt. The very work of
the Saints in heaven, will be to Praiſe and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
him that Redeemed them; and the Father
in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which would not have been the work of
man, if he had been innocent.</p>
                  <p>2. As to the Pain of ſence, the laſt ludgement
by the Redeemer will Sentence them to a far
ſorer Puniſhment then would have befaln them,
if no Saviour had been offered them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29.
The conſcience of <hi>Adam</hi> if he had not
been Redeemed, would never have tormented
him for Rejecting a Redeemer, nor for refuſing
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52141:150"/>
or abuſing his gracious offers, and his mercies;
nor for the forfeiting of a Recovered Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
nor for refuſing the eaſie terms of the
Goſpel, which would have Given him Chriſt
and Salvation for the Accepting; nor for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting,
any means that tended to Recovery: NO
nor for refuſing Repentance unto Life, nor for
diſobeying a Redeemer that bought him by his
blood. As all theſe are the Penalties of the
Redeemers Law and Judgement, ſo is it a ſorer
penalty then Conſcience would have inflicted
meerly for not being perfectly Innocent; and
they will be far ſoarer gripings &amp; gnawings of
the never-dying worm for the abuſe of theſe
Talents, than if we had been never truſted
with any after our firſt forfeiture. Yea and God
himſelf will accordingly proportion his Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
So that you ſee that Privatively and
Poſitively, or as to their Loſs and their Feeling,
the Redemer will paſs on them a heavyer doom
then the Creator did, or would have done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the firſt Law to perfect man.</p>
                  <p>3. Another Property of the Judgement
of Chriſt, is, that <hi>It will be final, Peremptory,
and Excluding all further hopes or Poſſibilities of
a Remedy.</hi> So was not the firſt Judgement of
the Creator upon faln man. Though the Law
of pure Nature knew no Remedy, nor gave
man any hope of a Redeemer; yet did it no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:52141:151"/>
                     <hi>exclude</hi> a Remedy, nor put in any barr againſt
one; but God was free to Recover his Creature
if he pleaſed. But in the Law of Grace he
hath Reſolved, that there ſhall be no more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for ſin, but a fearful looking for of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and fire which ſhall devour the adverſarie,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. 27. and that the fire ſhall be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting,
the worm ſhall not dye, and the fire
ſhall not be quenched, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25 <hi>ult. Mat.</hi> 13.
42, 50. <hi>John</hi> 5. 27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 12. and
<hi>Luke</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 43, 44, 45, 46, 48. He
that now breaketh that pure Law that requireth
perfect innocency (as we have all done) may
fly to the Promiſe of Grace in Chriſt, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to the Law of Liberty, or deliverance, to
be Judged by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>that. But he that falls under
penal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ungodly perſons do, hath no other to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to. Chriſt would have been a Sanctuary
and Refuge to thee from the Law of works,
hadſt thou but Come in to him: But who ſhall
be a Refuge to thee from the wrath of Chriſt?
The Goſpel would have freed thee from the
Curſe of the Law of works, if thou hadſt but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and obeyed it: But what ſhall free thee
from the Condemnation of the Goſpel? Had
there no Accuſation lain againſt thee, but that
thou waſt in general a ſinner, that is, that thou
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:52141:151"/>
waſt not perfectly Innocen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, Chriſt would have
anſwered that charge by his blood. But ſeeing
thou art alſo guilty of thoſe ſpecial ſins which
he never ſhed his blood for, who ſhall deliver
thee from that Accuſation? When Chriſt gave
himſelf a ranſom for ſinners, it was with this
Reſolution both in the Father and himſelf, that
none ſhould ever be Pardoned, Juſtified or Saved
by that Ranſom, that did not in the time of
this life, ſincerely return to God by Faith in
the Redeemer, and live in ſincere obedience to
him, and perſevering herein. So that he plainly
<hi>excepted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> final Infidelity, Impenitency and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
from pardon: He never dyed for the final
nonperformance of the Conditions of the New
Covenant. So that his Judgement for theſe will
be peremptory and remedileſs. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> you ſay, Why

he hath ſaid and reſolved, that there ſhall be no
more remedy.</p>
                  <p>Many other Properties of Gods Iudgement
general there are, as that Righteeouſneſs, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality,
Inflexibility, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mention of theſe which are Proper to the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Redeemer, according to his own
Laws in ſpecial.</p>
                  <p>XII. THE twelfth and laſt thing which I
promiſed to unfold, is, <hi>The Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Judgement.</hi> Here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

both the Certainty of the Execution, and by
whom it will be, and how; but having done all
this already in the third Part of the foreſaid
<hi>Book of reſt,</hi> I ſhall now only give this brief
touch of it.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner is the dreadful Sentence paſt,
<hi>Go ye curſed into Everlaſting fire,</hi> but away they
muſt be gone: There is no delay; much leſs
any Reprieve to be expected: and yet much leſs
is there any hope of an Eſcape. If the Judge
once ſay, <hi>Take him Jaylor;</hi> and if Chriſt ſay, <hi>Take
him Devils, you that Ruled and Deceived him,
now Torment him,</hi> all the world cannot reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue
one ſuch ſoul. It will be in vain to look
about for help! Alas, there is none but
Chriſt can help you; and he will not, becauſe
you refuſed his help: Nay, we may ſay, <hi>He
cannot;</hi> not for want of Power; but becauſe he
is True and Juſt, and therefore will make good
that word which you believed not. It is in vain
then to cry to hils to fall on you, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52141:152"/>
to cover you from the preſence of him
that ſitteth on the Throne. It will be in vain
now to Repent, and wiſh you had not ſleighted
your ſalvation, nor ſold it for a little pleaſure
to your fleſh It will be then in vain to cry <hi>Lord,
Lord, open to us; O ſpare us; O pitty us; O do
not caſt us into theſe hideous flames! Do not turn
us among Devils! do not Torment thy Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>Poor ſinner, whoever thou art that readeſt or
heareſt theſe lines, I beſeech thee in Compaſſion
to thy ſoul, Conſider, How fearful the caſe of
that man will be, that is newly doomed to the
<hi>Everlaſting fire,</hi> and is haled to the Execution
without Remedy! And what mad men are
thoſe that now do no more to prevent ſuch a
miſery, when they might do it on ſuch eaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

24. beg of <hi>Abraham</hi> for one drop of water
from the tip of <hi>Lazarus's</hi> finger to cool his
tongue, becauſe he was tormented in the flame!
And what the better was he? He was ſent to
Remember, that he had his Good things in this
life; and that <hi>Remembrance</hi> would torment
him more. And do not wonder or think much
at this, that Chriſt will not then be intreated by
the ungodly. You ſhall then have a <hi>Remember</hi>

thou worker of iniquity, Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Ah Sirs, what a caſe then is the poor deſperate
ſinner left in! How can I write this, or how
can you that read or hear it, without trembling
once think of the Condition that ſuch forlorn
wretches will be in! When they look above
them, and ſee the God that hath forſaken them,
becauſe they forlook him firſt, when they look
about them, and ſee the Saints on one hand
whom they deſpiſed, now ſentenced unto Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and the wicked on the other hand
whom they accompanied and imitated, now
Judged with them to everlaſting miſery; when
they look below them, and ſee the flames that
they muſt abide in, even for evermore; and when
the Devils begin to hale them to the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Oh poor ſouls! Now what would they give
for a Chriſt, for a promiſe, for a time of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
for a Sermon of mercy, which once they
ſlept under, or made no account of! How is the

eaſe altered now with them! Who would think
that theſe are the ſame men, that made light of
all this on earth, that ſo ſtoutly ſcorned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Proofs
of the word, that would be wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fleſhly, and drunk, and proud, let Preachers
iay what they would; and perhaps hated thoſe
that did give them warning. Now they are of
another minde; but all too late. Oh were there
any place for Reſiſtance, how would they
draw back, and lay hold of any thing, before
they would be dragged away ínto thoſe flames!
But there is no reſiſting; Satans Temptations

                        <hi>Qu. 1. Do you ſoundly Believe this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which I have preached to
you?</hi> What ſay you Sirs? do you verily <hi>Believe</hi>
it as a moſt certain Truth, that you and I, and
all the world muſt ſtand at Gods barr and be
Judged to Everlaſting Joy or Torment? I
hope you do all <hi>in ſome ſort</hi> Believe this: but
blame me not if I be jealous whether you <hi>ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
believe it, while, we ſee in the world ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the effect of ſuch a Belief. I confeſs I am
forced to think that there is more infidelity

hardly believe <hi>that</hi> man that will ſay or ſwear
that he believeth theſe things, and yet liveth as
careleſly and carnally as an Infidel. I know
that no man can love to be damned; yea I
know that every man that hath a reaſonable
ſoul, hath naturally ſome love to him ſelf, and a
fear of a danger which he verily apprehendeth;
he therefore that liveth without all fear, I muſt
think liveth without all apprehenſion of his
danger. Cuſtom hath taught men to hold theſe
things as the Opinion of the Country; but if
men ſoundly believed them, ſurely we ſhould

going to this Judgement? Well, Sirs, whether
you beleve it or not, you will find it true; and
believe it you muſt before you can be ſafe. For
if you do not Believe it, you will never make
ready. Let me therefore perſwade you in the
fear of God to conſider, that it is a matter of
undoubted Truth.</p>
                     <p>1. Conſider that it is the expreſs word of
the God of Truth; revealed in Srip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that men ſhall ſpeak they ſhall give account thereof
at the day of Judgement: For by thy words thou

Scripture do put the Truth of this Iudgement
out of all queſtion to all that believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and will underſtand it. There is no place
left for a Controverſie in the point: It is made
as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ure to us as the Word of the living God can
make it; And he that will queſtion that, what
will he Believe? What ſay you Sirs! Dare
you doubt of this which the God of Heaven
hath ſo poſitively affirmed? I hope you dare not.</p>
                     <p>2. Conſider, it is a maſter part of your
faith, if you are Chriſtians, and a fundamental
Article of your Creed, that Chriſt ſhall come
again to Iudge the quick and the dead. So that
you muſt Believe it, or renounce your Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and then you renounce Chriſt and all the
hopes of mercy that you have in him. Its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that you ſhould ſoundly Believe in
Chriſt, and not believe his Iudgement and
Life Everlaſting; becauſe as he came to bring
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:52141:157"/>
Life and immortality to light in the Goſpel,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. ſo it was the end of his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Death and Reſurrection, to bring you thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and its part of his honour and office
which he purchaſed with his blood, to be the
Lord and Iudge of all the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22. If therefore you believe not heartily
this Iudgement; deal plainly and openly, and
ſay you are Infidels, and caſt away the hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
vizor of Chriſtianity, and let us know you,
and take you as you are.</p>
                     <p>3. Conſider that it is a Truth that is known
by the very light of nature, that there ſhall be
a happineſs for the Righteous, and a miſery for
the wicked after this life: which is evident.</p>
                     <p>1. In that we have undenyable natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for it. 1. God is the Righteous governor
of the world, and therefore muſt make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
among his Subjects, according to the
nature of their wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es; which we ſee is not
done here, where the wicked Proſper, and the
good are afflicted; therefore it muſt be heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p>2. We ſee there is a neceſſity that God
ſhould make promiſes and threatnings of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
hapineſs or miſery, for the right gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
hf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the world; for we certainly perceive
that no lower things will keep men from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
all humane ſociety, and living worſe
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:52141:157"/>
then bruit beaſts; and if there be a neceſſity of
king ſuch threats and promiſes, then there is
certainly a neceſsity of fullfilling them. For
God needeth no lye or means of deceiving, to
rule the world.</p>
                     <p>2. And as we ſee it by Reaſon, ſo by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
experience, that this is deſcernable by the
light of nature, for all the world, or almoſt
all, do believe it. Even thoſe nations where the
Goſpel never came, and have nothing but what
they have by nature: even the moſt barbarous

and a difference of men according as they are

as well as your Chriſtianity. Let me therefore
perſwade you all in the fear of God to confirm
your ſouls in the belief of this, as if you had

ſo, or not?</p>
                     <p>Alas Sirs! Is this a matter to be forgotten?
Is not that man even worſe then mad, that is
going to Gods Iudgement and never thinks of
it? when if they were to be tryed for their lives
at the next Aſſize, they would think of it, and
think again, and caſt 100 times which way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape.
Methinks you Should rather forget to go
to bed at night, or to eat your meat, or do your
work, then forget ſo great a matter as this.</p>
                     <p>Truly, I have often in my ſerious thoughts
been ready to wonder that men can think of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
any thing elſe, when they have ſo great a
thing to think of. What! forget that
which you muſt remember for ever! forget
that which ſhould force remembrance, yea and
doth force it with ſome, whether they will or

He thinks which way ever he goes he is ready
to be Judged. Oh therefore Beloved, Fix
theſe thoughts as deep in your hearts as
thoughts can go. Oh be like that holy man,
that thought which way ever he went, he heard
the Trumpet ſound, and the voice of the Angel
calling to the world, <hi>Ariſe ye dead, and come to
Judgement.</hi> You have warning of it from God

not then forget it. It will be a cold excuſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

are you affected with the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of this day?</hi> Barely to <hi>think</hi> of it will

                     <p>When I began to preach of theſe things long

that I was afraid that people would have

ſhewed me, that many are like a dog

uſed to it, can ſleep though the hammers are bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and the fire and hot iron flaming about
him, when another that had never ſeen it, would
be amazed at the ſight. When men have heard
us 7 years together; yea 20 years, to talk of a
day of Judgement, and they <hi>ſee</hi> it not, nor <hi>feel</hi>
any hurt, they think it is but talk, and begin
to make nothing of it. This is their thanks to
God for his patience: Becauſe his Sentence is
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:52141:159"/>
not executed ſpeedily, therefore their hearts are
ſet in them to do evil, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8. 11. As if God
were ſlack of his Promiſe, as ſome men Account

4. If neer.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things are here to be found, and
therefore how ſhould your hearts be moved at
the Conſideration of this great day!</p>
                     <p>1. What matter can be mentioned with the
Tongue of man of greater moment? For
the poor creature to ſtand before his Maker and
Redeemer, to be Judged to everlaſting Joy or
Torment? Alas! all the matters of this world
are playes, and toyes, and dreams to this;
Matters of profit or diſprofit are nothing to it;
Matters of credit or diſcredit are unworthy to
be named with it; Matters of temporal life or
death are nothing to it. We ſee the poor

I confeſs, if it were never ſo far off, yet ſeeing
it will come at laſt, It ſhould be carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded:
But when the Judge is at the door,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 9. and we are almoſt at the barr, and
it is ſo ſhort a time to this aſſize, what ſoul
that is not dead will be ſecure?</p>
                     <p>Alas. Sirs! what is a little time when it is
gone? how quickly ſhall you and I be all in
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:52141:161"/>
another world, and our ſouls recieve their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Judgement, and ſo wait till the body be
raiſed and judged to ſame Condition? It is
not a 100. years in all likelyhood, till every ſoul
of us ſhall be in heaven or hell: and its like,
not half or a quarter of that time, but it will be
ſo with the greater part of us: and what is a
year or two, or a 100? how ſpeedily is it come?
how many a ſoul that is now in heaven or hell,
within a 1000 years dwelt in the places that you
now dwel in, and ſate in the ſeats you now ſit
in? And now their time is paſt, what is it?
Alas; how quickly will it be ſo with us? You
know not when you go to bed, but you may be
Judged by the next morning: or when you riſe,
but you may be Judged before night: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
you know that ſhortly it will be; and
ſhould not this then be laid to heart? Yea the
General Judgement wil lt no be long: For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
we live in the end of world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:52141:161"/>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. MY next Queſtion is, <hi>Whether are
you ready for this dreadful Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
when it comes, or not?</hi> Seeing it is <hi>your
ſelves</hi> then muſt be tried, I think it concerns
you to ſee that you be prepared. How often
hath Chriſt warned us in the Goſpel, that we
be <hi>alwaies ready;</hi> becauſe we know not the
day or hour of his coming? <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 44. 42.
and 25. 13. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 6. and told us how
ſad a time it will be to thoſe that are unready?
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 11, 12. Did men but well know what
a meeting and greeting there will be between
Chriſt and an unready ſoul, it would ſure ſtartle
them, and make them look about them. What
ſay you Beloved Hearers, are you <hi>ready</hi> for
Judgement, or are you not! Me thinks a man
that knoweth he ſhall be Judged, ſhould ask
himſelf the Queſtion every day of his life; Am
I ready to give up my Account to God! Do
not you uſe to ask this of your own hearts? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
you be careleſs whether you be ſaved
or damned, me thinks you ſhould, and ask it
<hi>ſeriouſly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> But who be they that are ready? how
ſhall I know whether I be ready or not?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a twofold readineſs. 1. When
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:52141:162"/>
you are in a <hi>ſafe</hi> caſe. 2. When you are in a
<hi>comfortable</hi> caſe, in regard of that day. The
latter is very <hi>deſirable,</hi> but the firſt is of <hi>abſolute
neceſſity:</hi> this therefore is it that you muſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
enquire after.</p>
                     <p>In General, all thoſe, and only thoſe are
ready for Judgement, who ſhall be juſtified and
ſaved, and not condemned when Judgement
comes; They that have a good cauſe in a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
ſenſe. It may be known before hand who
theſe are; for Chriſt Judgeth, as I told you,
by his Law. And therefore find out whom it
is that the Law of grace doth juſtifie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
and you may certainly know whom the
Judge will Juſtifie or condemn; for he Judgeth
righteouſly.</p>
                     <p>If you further ask me who theſe are; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that I told you before that every man that is
perſonally righteous by fulfilling the Conditions
of Salvation in the Goſpel, ſhall be ſaved; and he
that is found unrighteous, as having not fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them, ſhall periſh at that day,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> Who are thoſe?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will tell you them in a few words,
leſt you ſhould forget, becauſe it it a matter
that your Salvation or Damnation dependeth
upon.</p>
                     <p>1. The ſoul that unfeignedly repenteth of
his former ſinful courſe, and turneth from it in
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:52141:162"/>
heart and life, and loveth the way of godlineſs
which he hate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and hateth the way of ſin which
he loved, and is become thoroughly a New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
being born again and ſanctified by the
Spirit of Chriſt, ſhall be Juſtified: but all others
ſhall certainly be condemned.</p>
                     <p>Good news to repenting converted ſinners:
but ſad to Impenitent, and him that knows not
what this means.</p>
                     <p>2. That ſoul that feeling his miſery under
ſin and the power of Satan, and the wrath of
God, doth believe what Chriſt hath done and
ſuffered for mans reſtauration &amp; Salvation, and
thankfully accepteth him as his only Saviour
and Lord, on the terms that he is offered in the
Goſpel, and to thoſe ends, even to Juſtifie him,
and ſanctifie and guide him, and bring him at
laſt to everlaſting glory; that ſoul ſhall be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
at Judgement: and he that doth not, ſhall
be condemned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Or in ſhort, in Scripture phraſe,</hi> He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not
ſhall be condemned, Mar. 16. 16.</p>
                     <p>3. The ſoul that hath had ſo much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the goodneſs of God, and his love to
man in Creation, Redemption, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mercies, and hath had ſo much conviction of
the vanity of all creatures, as thereupon to
Love God more then <hi>all</hi> things below, ſo that
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:52141:163"/>
                        <hi>he</hi> hath the cheifeſt room in the heart, and is
preferred before all creatures ordinarily in a
time of tryal: that ſoul ſhall be Juſtified at
Judgement and all others ſhall be condemned.</p>
                     <p>4. That ſoul that is ſo apprehenſive of the
abſolute Soveraignty of God as Creator and
Redeemer, and of the Righteouſneſs of his
Law, and the Goodneſs of his holy way, as
that he is firmly Reſolved to obey him before
all others, and doth accordingly give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to ſtudy his will, of purpoſe that he may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
it, and doth walk in theſe holy waies, and
hath ſo far mortified the fleſh, and ſubdued
the world and the Devil, that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Word of God can do more with
him, then any other; and doth ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prevail againſt all the perſwaſion and intereſt
of the fleſh, ſo that the main ſcope and bent of
the heart and life is ſtill for God; and when
he ſinneth, he riſeth again by true Repentance;
I ſay that ſoul, and that only, ſhall be Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Judgement, and be ſaved.</p>
                     <p>5. That ſoul that hath ſuch Believing
thoughts of the life to come, that he taketh the
promiſed bleſſedneſs for his portion, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to venture all elſe upon it, and in hope
of his glory, doth ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> light comparatively by
all things in this world, and waiteth for it as
the end of this life, chooſing any ſuffering that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:52141:163"/>
God ſhall call him to, rather then to loſe his
hopes of that felicity, and thus perſevereth
to the end: I ſay that ſoul, and none but
that,ſhall be juſtified in Judgement, and eſcape
Damnation.</p>
                     <p>In theſe five marks I have told you truly and
briefly, who ſhall be Juſtified and ſaved, and
who ſhall be condemned at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And if you would have them all in five
words, they are but the Description of theſe
five Graces, Repentance, Faith, Love, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Hope.</p>
                     <p>But though I have laid theſe cloſe together
for your uſe, yet leſt you ſhould think that in ſo
weighty a caſe I am too ſhort in the proof of
what I ſo determine of; I will tell you in the
expreſs words of many Scripture Texts,
who ſhall be Juſtified, and who ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                     <p>[<hi>John.</hi> 3. 3. Except a man be born again,
he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Without holineſs none ſhall ſee
God. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 3, 5. Except ye repent, ye
ſhall all likewiſe periſh. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. I ſend

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:52141:164"/>
17, 18, 19. Whoever believeth in him ſhall
not periſh, but have everlaſting life: he that
believeth on him, is not condemned; he that
believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he
hath not Believed in the name of the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Son of God: and this is the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that light is come in to the world, and
men loved darkneſs rather then light, becauſe
their deeds were evil, <hi>John.</hi> 5. 28, 29. The hour
is coming, in which all that are in the graves

me, <hi>Mat</hi> 22. 12. 13. Friend, how cameſt
thou in hither, not having on a wedding gat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
And he was ſpeechleſs. Then ſaid the
King to the ſervants: Bind him hand and foot,
and take him away, and caſt him into outer
darkneſs, <hi>&amp;c. Mat.</hi> 5. 20. For I ſay unto
you, that except your Righteouſneſs exceed the
Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye
ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of

ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:52141:164"/>
of Heaven; but he that doth the will of
my Father which is in Heaven. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 6. He
is become the Author of eternall ſalvation to

are they that do his Commandments, that they
may have right to the tree of life, and may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

There is then no condemnation to them that
are in Chriſt Jeſus, that walk not after the fleſh,
but after the Spirit. For if ye live after the fleſh,
ye ſhall dye: but if ye through the Spirit do
mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live,

                     <p>And thus I have told you from Gods
Word, how you may know whether you
are ready for Judgement; which is the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:52141:165"/>
fourth thing that I would adviſe you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after.</p>
                     <p>O Sirs, what ſhift do you make to keep your
ſouls from Continual Terrours, as you as long
remain unready for Judgement? How do
you keep the Thoughts of it out of your mind,
that they do not break your ſleep and meet you
in your buſineſs, and haunt you every way you
go, while Judgement is ſo neer, and you are ſo
unready? But I ſhall proceed to <hi>say</hi> next Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:52141:165"/>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 5 AND in the laſt place, to thoſe
of you that are not yet Ready,
nor in a Condition wherein you may ſafe at
that day ' my Queſtion is, <hi>How are you
reſolved to prepare for Judgement for the time to
come?</hi> Will you do no more than you have
done hitherto? Or will you now ſet your
ſelves with all your might, to make preparation
for ſo great a day? me thinks you ſhould be
now paſt all demurs, delays, or further doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
about ſuch a buſineſs; and by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of what I have ſaid already, you
ſhould be fully Reſolved to loſe no more time,
but preſently to awake, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> upon the work.
Me thinks you ſhould all ſay, We will do any
thing that the Lord ſhall Direct us to do,
rather then we will be unready for this final
doom! O that there were but ſuch hearts in you,
that you were truly <hi>willing</hi> to follow the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Guidance of the Lord, and to uſe but thoſe
ſweet and reaſonable means which he hath
preſcribed you in his Word, that you may be
ready for that day! Alas, it is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for me to tell you, or my ſelf, what it is
that we muſt do, if we will be happy; and it is
no very hard matter to <hi>Do</hi> it, ſo far ar we are
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:52141:166"/>
truly <hi>willing;</hi> but the difficulty is to be <hi>truly</hi>
and <hi>throughly willing</hi> to this work. If I ſhall
tell you what you muſt do for preparation, ſhall
I not loſe my labour? Will you resolve
and promiſe in the ſtrength of Grace, that you
will faithfully and ſpeedily endeavour to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
it, whoever ſhall gainſay it? Upon hope of
this, I will ſet you down ſome brief Directions,
which you muſt follow, if ever you will with
comfort look the Lord Jeſus in the face at the
hour of Death, or in the Day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="311" facs="tcp:52141:166"/>
THE firſt Direction is this, <hi>See that your
ſouls be ſincerely eſtabliſhed in the Belief of
this Judgement and everlaſting life:</hi> For if you
do not ſoundly believe it, you will not ſeriouſly
prepare for it. If you have the Judgement and
belief of an Infidel, you cannot have the Heart
or the Life of a Chriſtian. Unbelief ſhuts out
the moſt of the world from heaven; ſee that it
do not ſo by you! If you ſay, You cannot Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what you would: I anſwer, Feed not yor
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>belie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> by wilfulneſs, or unreaſonableneſs; Uſe
Gods means to overcome it, and ſhut not your
eyes againſt he light, and then try the iſſues;
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
                     <p>THE ſecond Direction. <hi>Labour diligently
to have a ſound underſtanding of the nature
of the Laws and Judgement of God.</hi> On what
terms it is that he dealeth with mankinde: and
on what terms he will Judge them to Life or
Death: and what the Reward and puniſhment
is. For if you know not the Law by which you
muſt be Judged, you cannot know how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for the Judgement. Study the Scripture
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:52141:167"/>
therefore, and mark who they be that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
to ſave, and who they be that he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to Condemn. For according to that
Word will the Judgement paſs.</p>
                     <p>THE third Direction. <hi>See that you take it as
the very buſineſs of your Lives, to make
ready for that day.</hi> Underſtand that you have no
other buſineſs in this world, but what doth
neceſſarily depend on this. What elſe have you
to do, but to provide for everlaſting? and to
uſe means to ſuſtain your own bodies and
others of purpoſe for his work, till it be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Live therefore as men that make
this the main ſcope and care of their Lives; and
let all things elſe come in but on the by. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
every morning when you awake, that
you muſt ſpend that day in preparation for
your Account, and that God doth give it
you for that end. When you go to bed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
your hearts, what you have done that
day in preparation for your laſt Day: And
take that time as loſt which doth nothing to
this end.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="313" facs="tcp:52141:167"/>
THe fourth Direction. <hi>Vſe frequently
to think of the Certainty, neerneſs and
dreadfulneſs of that day, to keep Life in your
Affections and Endeavours; leſt by Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs
your ſouls grow ſtupid and negligent.</hi>
Otherwiſe, becauſe it is out of ſight, the
heart will be apt to grow hardened and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.
And do not think of it ſleightly as a
common thing, but purpoſely ſet your
ſelves to think of it, that it may rouze
you up to ſuch Affections and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
as in ſome meaſure are anſwerable to
the nature of the thing.</p>
                     <p>THE fifth Direction. <hi>Labour to have
a lively feeling on thy heart, of the evil
and weight of that ſin which thou art guilty of,
and of the miſery into which it hath brought
thee, and would further bring thee if thou
be not delivered, and ſo to feel the need of a
Deliverer.</hi> This muſt prepare thee to partake
of Chriſt now; and if thou partake not of
him now, thou canſt not be ſaved by him
Then. It is theſe ſouls that now make <hi>light</hi>
                        <pb n="314" facs="tcp:52141:168"/>
of their ſin and miſery, that muſt then
feel them ſo <hi>heavy,</hi> as to be preſſed by them
into the infernal flames. And thoſe that <hi>now</hi>
feel little need of a Saviour, they ſhall <hi>then</hi>
have none to ſave them, when they feel their
need.</p>
                     <p>THE ſixth Direction. <hi>Vnderſtand and
Believe the ſufficiency of that Ranſom
and Satisfaction to Juſtice, which Chriſt hath
made for thy ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for the world, and how
freely and univerſally it is offered in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi>
Thy ſin is not uncurable or unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable,
nor thy miſery remedileſs; God
hath provided a remedy in his Son Chriſt,
and brought it ſo neer thy hands, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but thy neglecting, or wilful refuſing
it, can deprive thee of the Benefit. Settle
thy ſoul in this belief.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:52141:168"/>
THE ſeventh Direction. <hi>Vnderſtand and
Believe, that for all Chriſts ſatisfaction,
there is an Abſolute Neceſſity of ſound Faith
and Repentancte to be in thy own ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou canſt be a Member of him, or be
Pardoned, Adopted, or Juſtified by his blood.</hi>
He dyed not for final Infidel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ty and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency,
as predominant in any ſoul. As the
Law of his Father which occaſioned his
ſuffering: required perfect Obedience, or
ſuffering: So his own Law, which he hath
made for the conveyance of his Benefits,
doth require yet true Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of men themſelves, before they ſhall
be pardoned by him; and ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

THE eighth Direction. <hi>Reſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in an unrenewed, unſanctified ſtate;
that is, till this Faith and Repentance be
wrought on thy own ſoul, and thou be truly
broken of from thy former ſinful courſe, and
from all things in this world; and art Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
Devoted and Reſigned unto God.</hi> Seeing
this change <hi>muſt</hi> be made, and theſe graces
<hi>muſt</hi> be had, or thou muſt certainly periſh:
in the fear of God, ſee that thou give no
eaſe to thy mind till thou art thus changed.
Be content with nothing till this be done.
Delay not another day. How canſt thou
live merrily, or ſleep quietly in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as if thou ſhouldſt dye in it, thou
ſhouldſt periſh for ever? Eſpecially when
thou art every hour uncertain whether thou
ſhalt ſee another hour, and not be preſently
ſnatch away by death? Methinks while thou
art in ſo ſad a caſe, which way ever thou art
going, or what ever thou art doing, it ſhould
ſtill come into thy thoughts, <hi>Oh what if I
ſhould Dye before I be Regenerate, and have
part in Chriſt!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="317" facs="tcp:52141:169"/>
THE ninth Direction. <hi>Let it be the daily
care of thy ſoul, to mortifie thy fleſhly
deſires, and overcome this world; and live as
in a continual Conflict With Satan, which Will
not be ended till thy life do end.</hi> If any thing
deſtroy thee by drawing away thy heart from
God, it will be thy carnal ſelf, thy fleſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
and the allurements of this world,
which is the matter that they feed upon. This
therefore muſt be the earneſt work of thy
life, to ſubdue this fleſh, and ſet light by
this world, and reſiſt the Devil, that by
theſe would deſtroy thee. It is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
caſe of miſerable hypocrites, that at
firſt they liſt themſelves under Chriſt as for
a fight, but they preſently forget their ſtate
and work; and when they are once in their
own conceit Regenerate, they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo ſafe, that there is no further dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and thereupon they do lay down their
Arms and take that which they miſcall, their
Chriſtian Liberty, and indulge and pleaſe
that fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſh which they promiſed to mortifie,
and cloſe with the world which they
promiſed to contemn, and ſo give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Devil, whom they promiſed
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:52141:170"/>
to fight againſt. If once you apprehend
all your Religion lieth in meer Believing,
that all ſhall go well with you, and that
the bitterneſſ of death is paſt, and in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
of ſome diſgraceful ſins, and being
much in the Exerciſe of your Gifts, and in
external wayes of Duty, and giving God a
Cheap and plauſible obedience in thoſe
things only which the Fleſh can ſpare; you
are then faln into that deceitful hypocriſie,
which will as ſurely condemn you, as
open prophaneſs, if you get not out of it.
You muſt live as in a fight, or you cannot
overcome. You <hi>muſt</hi> live looſe from all
things in <hi>this world,</hi> if you will be ready
for <hi>another.</hi> You <hi>muſt</hi> not live after the fleſh,
but mortifie it by the Spirit, if you would
not dye, but live for ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. Theſe
things are not indifferent, but of flat ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
                     <p>THE tenth Direction. <hi>Do all your
works as men that muſt be judged for
them.</hi> It is not enough (at leaſt in point of
Duty and Comfort) that you Judge this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
in General to be the main buſineſs
of your live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, but you ſhould alſo order
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:52141:170"/>
your <hi>particular Actions</hi> by theſe Thoughts,
and meaſure them by their <hi>Reſpects</hi> to this
approaching Day. Before you venture on
them, enquire whether they will bear
weight in Judgement, and be ſweet or
bitter when they are brought to tryal?
Both for matter and manner, this muſt be
obſerved. Oh that you would Remember
this when Temptations are upon you.
When you are Tempted to give up your
minds to the world, and drown your ſelves
in earthly cares, will you bethink you ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whether you would hear of this at Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
and whether the world will be then
as ſweet as now? and whether this be the
beſt preparation for your Tryal: When you
are Tempted to be Drunk, or to ſpend your
precious time in Alehouſes, or vain unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
company, or at Cards or Dice, or
any ſinful or needleſs ſports; bethink you
then, Whether this will be comfortable at
the Reckoning? and whether time be no
more worth to one that is ſo neer eternity,
and muſt make ſo ſtrict an account of his
Hours? and whether there be not many
better works before you, in which you
might ſpend your time to your greater
advantage, and to your greater comfort
when it comes to a Review? When you
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:52141:171"/>
are tempted to wantonneſe, fornication, or
any other fleſhly intemperance, bethink you
ſoberly, with what face theſe Actions will
appear at Judgement, and whether they
will be <hi>then</hi> pleaſant or diſpleaſant to you?
So when you are tempted to neglect the
daily worshipping of God in your families,
and the Catechizing and Teaching of your
children or ſervants, eſpecially on the Lords
Day, bethink your ſelves then, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
you will give of this to Chriſt,
when he that entruſted you with the care of
your children and ſervants, ſhall call you to
a reckoning for the performance of that
truſt?</p>
                     <p>The like muſt be Remembred in the very
manner of our Duties. How diligently
ſhould a Miniſter ſtudy? how earneſtly
ſhould he perſwade? how unwearyedly
ſhould he bear all oppoſitions and ungrateful
returns? and how carefully ſhould he
watch over each particular ſoul of his charge
(as far as is poſſible) when he Remembers
that he muſt ſhortly be Accountable for all
in Judgement? And how importunate
ſhould we all be with ſinners for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
when we conſider that themſelves
alſo muſt ſhortly be Judg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d? Can a man
be cold and dead in prayer, that hath any
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:52141:171"/>
true apprehenſion of that Judgement upon
his mind, where he muſt be accountable for
all his prayers and performances? O Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
and ſeriouſly Remember, when
you ſtand before the Miniſter to hear the
word, and when you are on your knees to
God in prayer, in what a manner that ſame
perſon, even your ſelves muſt ſhortly ſtand
at the Barr of the dreadful God! Did
theſe thoughts get throughly to mens
hearts, they would waken them out of their
ſleepy Devotions, and acquaint them that it
is a ſerious buſineſs to be a Chriſtian. How
careful ſhould we be of our thoughts and
words, if we believingly remembred that
we muſt be accountable for them all! How
carefully ſhould we conſider what we do
with our Riches, and with all that God
giveth us, and how much more largely
ſhould we expend it for his ſervice in works
of Piety and Charity, if we believingly
remembred that we muſt be Judged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to what we have done, and give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of every Talent that we receive?
Certainly the believing conſideration of
Iudgement, might make us all better
Chriſtians then we are, and keep our lives in
a more innocent and profitable frame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="322" facs="tcp:52141:172"/>
THE eleventh Direction. <hi>As you will
certainly renew your failings in this life,
ſo be ſure that you daily renew your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and fly daily to Chriſt for a renewed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
that no ſin may leave its ſting in your
ſouls.</hi> It is not your <hi>firſt</hi> pardon that will
ſerve the turn for your <hi>latter</hi> ſins. Not
that you muſt <hi>Purpoſe</hi> to <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>Purpoſe</hi> to
<hi>repent</hi> when you have done, as a Remedy:
for that is an hypocritical and wicked <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi>
of repenting, which is made a means
to maintain us in our ſins; But ſin muſt be
avoided as far as we can; and Repentance
and Faith in the blood of Chriſt muſt remedy
that which we could not avoid. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of pardon in Chriſts blood is uſeful
to us only ſo far as we are ſinners; and
cometh in where our Imperfect Inherent
Righteouſneſs doth come ſhort; but muſt
not be purpoſely choſen before innocency:
I mean, we muſt rather chooſe, as far as we
can, to obey and be innocent, than to ſin and
be pardoned, if we were ſure of pardon.</p>

THE twelfth Direction. In this vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
obedient, penitent courſe, with
confidence upon God as a Father, Reſt
upon the Promiſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

through the Merits and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of him that Redeemed you; Look up
in hope to the Glory that is before you,
and believe that God will make good his
Word, and the patient expectation of the
righteous ſhall not be in vain. Cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold on in the work that you have
begun: and as you ſerve a better matter than
you did before your change, ſo ſerve him
with more willingneſs, gladneſs and delight.
Do not entertain hard Thoughts of him, or
of his ſervice, but rejoyce in your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
happineſs of being admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his family and favour through Chriſt.
Do not ſerve him in drooping dejection
and diſcouragement, but with Love, and
Ioy, and filial fear. Keep in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his Saints, where he is cheerfully and
faithfully praiſed and honoured, and where
is the greateſt viſible ſimilitude of heaven
upon earth; eſpecially in the celebration of
the Sacrament of Chriſts Supper, where he
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:52141:173"/>
ſeals up a Renewed pardon in his blood,
and where unanimouſly we keep the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his Death until he come. Do
not caſt your ſelves out of the Communion of
the Saints, from whom to be caſt out by juſt
Cenſure and Excluſion, is a dreadful emblem
and fore-runner of the Iudgement to come,
where the ungodly ſhall be caſt out of the
preſence of Chriſt and his Saints for ever.</p>
                     <p>I have now finiſhed the Directions, which
I tender to you for your preparation for the
Day of the Lord; and withall my whole
Diſcourſe on this weighty point. What
effect all this ſhall have upon your hearts, the
Lord knows; it is not in my power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.
If you are ſo far blinded and
hardened by ſin and Satan, as to make light
of all this, or coldly to commend the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
while you go on to the end in your
carnal worldly condition as before; I can
ſay no more, but tell thee again, that Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is neer, when thou wilt bitterly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
all this too late. And among all the reſt
of the Evidence that comes in againſt thee,
this book wil be one, which ſhall teſtifie to thy
face before Angels, and men, that thou waſt
told of that Day, and intreated to prepare.</p>
                     <p>But if the Lord ſhall ſhew thee ſo much
mercy as to open thy eyes, and break in
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:52141:173"/>
upon thy heart, and by ſober Conſideration
turn it to himſelf, and cauſe thee faithfully
to take the warning that hath here been
given thee, and to obey theſe Directions, I
dare aſſure thee from the word of the Lord,
that this Iudgement which will be ſo dreadful
to the ungodly, and the beginning of their
endleſs terror and miſery, will be as joyful,
to thee, and the beginning of thy glory: The
Saviour that thou haſt believed in, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
obeyed, will not condemn thee. <hi>Pſal.</hi>
1. 5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. It is part of his
buſineſs to Iuſtifie thee before the world, and
to glorifie his merits, his Kingly power, his
holyneſs, and his rewarding Iuſtice in thy Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
and Salvation. He will account it a
righteous thing to recompence Tribulation
to thy Troublers, and Reſt to thy ſelf; when
the Lord Ieſus ſhall be revealed from heaven
with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire,
taking vengeance on them that know not
God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt; who ſhall be puniſhed with
everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of
the Lord, and from the glory of his power:
Even then ſhall he come to be glorified in
his Saints, and to be admired in all them that
