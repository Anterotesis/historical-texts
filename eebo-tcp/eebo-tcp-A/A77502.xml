            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

1. For the former. There was as yet a ſtrong partie in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which after the death of <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi>

The chiefe and principall places, wher this ſeditious party had their reſidence, and abode, were thoſe which the Pſalmiſt mentioneth in the ſixth and ſeventh verſes of the <hi>Pſalme.</hi> viz. <hi>Shechem, Succoth, Gilead, Manaſſeh.

To let paſſe here that late <hi>Breach,</hi> ſo happily <hi>healed,</hi> and made up, betwixt the two Nations, (at leaſt ſo ſome would have had it) which threatned us with the dreadfull judgement of a civill war (of wars the worſt.) To let that paſſe, (which yet we
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:112284:14"/>
muſt not let paſſe without a thankfull acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the <hi>power, wiſdome, goodneſſe</hi> of God manifeſted in making up of that <hi>Breach;</hi> not onely healing it without a <hi>skar,</hi> but bringing a more firme <hi>union</hi> out of it.) As alſo to forbear the mention of thoſe late <hi>Breaches</hi> made both upon <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>ſtate</hi> among our ſelves. Breaches made upon the <hi>eſtates</hi> of men, upon the <hi>liberties</hi> of <hi>ſubjects,</hi> the <hi>bodies,</hi> nay the <hi>ſouls</hi> and <hi>conſciences</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which through the goodneſſe of God inclining the heart of his <hi>Anointed</hi> to hearken to his great <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of ſtate</hi> are in part already repaired and made up. Beſides theſe, other <hi>Breaches</hi> there are which yet lye upon us. Breaches in the <hi>Church</hi> &amp; Breaches in the <hi>ſtate;</hi> both in meaſure ſtill rent and torne, diſtracted, and divided. I ſhall not need to name particulars, which are too obvious to every vulgar eye. But in all theſe what is here more then was to be found in Iſrael at that time when the whole <hi>land</hi> was <hi>ſhaken,</hi> that Kingdome divided betwixt the two Houſes of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> ſome ſiding with the one, others with the other; taking of parts to the great indangering of the ſtate, of the Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? True it is, the enemies of our peace are many. Beſides a dangerous party at home of ſuch as do (in their hearts and affections at leaſt) cleave to the <hi>Houſe of Saul,</hi> the <hi>old Houſe</hi> as they falſly call it) <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and others popiſhly affected, together with a <hi>Malignant party</hi> of <hi>malecontents,</hi> perſons ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to Church and ſtate; beſides theſe, it cannot be thought but that we have enemies abroad; ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to our Religion we are ſure, many of them
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:112284:15"/>
vaſſals to that <hi>Man of ſinne,</hi> that <hi>Antichriſt of Rome,</hi> who (as they at the preſent inſult over our <hi>breaches,</hi> ſo) if occaſion were offered, we cannot thinke but that they would be ready to breake in at them. But herein againe, what is our condition other then <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> was at this time when <hi>David</hi> penned this Pſalme, when beſides that <hi>ſeditious</hi> party amongſt themſelves they had alſo many foraigne enemies; enemies both to their Kingdome and Religion, and that almoſt on every ſide: <hi>Moabites, Edomites, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines; Moabites</hi> and <hi>Edomites</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt; Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines</hi> on the <hi>Weſt.</hi> Thus paralelling our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Iſraels, we finde no great oddes of <hi>breaches</hi> betwixt them; not more in the one then was in the other.</p>
            <p>And therefore (to draw towards a concluſion of this point and exerciſe.) In the firſt place, let not <note place="margin">No cauſe of triumph to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.

And ſo let us conceive of it. When the <hi>Plague</hi> was broke forth in the <hi>Camp</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> beginning to make a <hi>Breach</hi> upon them, <hi>Moſes</hi> preſently tells <hi>Aaron, There is wrath gone out from the Lord.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>What ever plague or Judgement, in what kinde ſoever it be, breaketh in upon a Nation, it is but a token and effect of wrath, even <hi>Divine</hi> wrath, the wrath of God. It is <hi>the breath of the Lord which</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Wrath conceived for our <hi>ſins;</hi> that is the fewell which this firetaketh hold and feedeth upon. Gods <note place="margin">Our ſins.</note> wrath taketh hold upon <hi>mans ſins. Where no wood is there the fire goeth out:</hi> were there no <hi>ſin,</hi> there would <note place="margin">Pro. 26. 20</note> be no <hi>wrath.</hi> For this is it that the wrath of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon perticular perſons, who being <hi>ſinners byna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 3.</note> they are alſo <hi>by nature children of wrath;</hi> and <note place="margin">Rom 9. 22</note> being <hi>ſinners by Practie,</hi> they are made <hi>veſſels of</hi>

And ſurely (my <note place="margin">Lev. 26 2. 5</note> Brethren) here is the firſt riſe, and ſpring of all thoſe Evils, which either already are Broken in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, or elſe do threaten us: They are no other but tokens, and effects of Gods diſpleaſure againſt us for ſin. And ſo conceive we of all theſe Breaches, at which God himſelf, having been long provoked, ſeemeth now to be breaking in upon us to aveng the <hi>quarrell of his Covenant,</hi> which we have violated and and <hi>broken.</hi> Here are the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of this <hi>diſeaſe.</hi>

               <hi>THe healing of Iſraels breaches, is a Cure which every true Iſraelite ſhould earnestly deſire, and ſeriouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> This is the maine concluſion which my eye was upon, when I firſt tooke this Text in hand. Some time I have ſpent upon it already, proſecuting it both by way of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Application.</hi> The latter of theſe I directed two waves: By way of <hi>Reprehenſion, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</hi> With the firſt of theſe we have done, and have made ſome way into the latter; Exciting and ſtirring up all ſorts of Perſons, to the <hi>deſire,</hi> and <hi>endeavour</hi> of this bleſſed <hi>Cure;</hi> the <hi>healing of the breaches</hi> amongſt us, in this, and the neighbour

To ſet on this <hi>Exhortation,</hi> I made uſe of ſome Arguments and Motives, tending and ſerving to ſet an edge, both upon your deſires, and endeavours; that both your <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>hands</hi> might work this way. Having layed this foundation, I came to build upon it. For your direſtion, ſhewing you</p>
            <p>Firſt, Wherein this Cure conſiſteth, and how it muſt be effected; ſpecially the Cure of the Church, which is properly my <hi>Patient</hi> at preſent, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Revealing unto it, and upon it abundance of peace and truth.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, What you are to do for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this <hi>Cure</hi> in this way.

This (you know) is the readieſt way to make up a Breach in a wall, by caſting earth and Rubiſh into it, every one his Basket.

            <p>For anſwer hereunto, I ſhall have recourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the <hi>Type</hi> in the Text; obſerving what <note place="margin">Davids courſe with the breach-makers in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> courſe <hi>David</hi> here pitcheth upon, and intendeth to run with both theſe, which were the cauſes of thoſe Breaches in tha this Kingdom. <hi>Strangers, Iſraelites,</hi> he would deale with both, but after a different manner; <hi>ſubduing</hi> the one, <hi>reducing</hi> the other. So you ſhall finde it in the 6, 7, 8, verſes of the Pſalm.
