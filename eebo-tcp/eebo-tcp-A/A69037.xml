            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O variable are the minds of men (gentle Reader) and ſo diuerſe their opinions, that amongſte twenty, it is hard to fynd twaine that agree all in one thing. For commonly that which one man lyketh, another loatheth, that which one man praiſeth, another reproueth, that which one deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, another diſdayneth, and whatſoeuer pleaſeth one, doth as much diſpleaſe another. The yong man taketh pleaſure in all youthfull excerſiſes, as Daunſing, Synging, playing on inſtruments, dallying with daynty dames, and ſuch like, whereby his pleaſure may be procured, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, without reſpecting any perrill that maye inſue thereof. The aunciente Syre, whome experience hath taught to be more wiſe and wary of ſuch vaine vanities, hath an eye to his profit, and reiecteth pleaſure as a thing vnprofytable. The couragious Captayne accompteth it for his greateſt glory to be in the field, marching among his men of warre, or ſkirmiſhing with his enemies, to trie his ſtrength and courage, with the hazarde of his life, for the furtheraunce of his fame, and increaſe of his commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. The man likewiſe that is inclyned to learning, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beſt at eaſe when he is ſetled in his ſtudy, there to toſſe and turne his bokes, peruſing the workes of aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent wrighters, whereby he may in tyme be able both to profite his countrey, and purchaſe ſuch prayſe to himſelf as is due to his good deſyres. But as theſe great clarkes doe not all delight to ſtudy one onely ſcience, but ſome apply themſelues to deuinity, ſome to Philoſophie, ſome to phiſicke, ſome to Aſtronomy, and ſome to euery one of them alike, not making any ſpeciall choyſe of eyther of
<pb facs="tcp:5105:5"/>
them. So likewiſe the common ſorte whoſe learning nor capacity cannot attaine to the full perfection or perfecte vnderſtanding of ſuch deepe miſteries, haue their ſeueral delightes, as well in reading ſuch workes, as are in theire vulgare tongue, as in any thing elſe. For one will peruſe pleaſant Hiſtories, and other poeticall deuiſes, this man merry tales, and other like toyes: that man deuine and morrall matter, euery one ſeuerally, according to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall affection, and naturall inclination, and there is no man be he neuer ſo well ſtayed, that will adict himſelfe to one thing onely, and refuſe all other. For as the ſtomacke is quickly cloyed with feeding continuallye vppon one kinde of meate, ſo is the mind greatly greeued, to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes muſing vppon one matter, and therefore deſyreth chaunge.</p>
            <p>Which conſidered, after I had gathered togither in one ſmall volume diuerſe deuiſes, as well in proſe as meeter, of ſundry ſortes, and ſeuerall matter, which at idle times (as wel to sharpen my wits, and shake of ſloth, as to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye my friendes, that had occaſion to craue my helpe in that behalfe) I haue heretofore as occaſion ſerued, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly framed, ſuppoſing the ſame to be fitte for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, and agreable with the mindes of moſte men, I haue (as well for the diſordered placing of euery perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler parcel thereof, being rudely and diſperſedly deuided, as alſo for the ſeuerall fancies therin contained, fit for eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry degree, &amp; agreable to their diuerſe affections) thought good to name it <hi>The Forreſt of Fancy,</hi> and ſo cauſing it to be imprinted, I doe here friendly Reader, preſent it vnto thee as a gift, of my good will, deſiring thee to accept it. And though my yong yeares and ſmall experience, will not permit me to wryghte ſo pithily as ſome haue done heretofore, whoſe worthy works are extant, and in great eſtimation, yet conſidering that I haue not done it either for gaine or glory, but partly to make my ſelfe more apte in other matters of more importaunce wherein <hi>I</hi> maye

happen hereafter to be imployed, and partly to procure thy pleaſure and profite (which may eaſilye be obtained) if thou doe duely conſider, and rightly conceiue of that which ſhall be offered to thy view, I beſeech thee conſter my doinges to the beſt, take this my ſmall labour in good parte, amend the faultes eſcaped. Let my good meaning ſerue to excuſe my rashnes, in preſuming thus boldly to publish a thing of ſo ſmall valew, and vouchſafe me thy friendly aſſiſtaunce againſt the ſlaundrous reportes of enuious <hi>Zoylus</hi> and his mallicious mates, and in ſo doing, thou shalt incourage me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to ſearch my wits, and apply my trauaile to contriue ſome thing more worthy thy reading.</p>

                     <p>But my loue being grounded vpon good occaſyons, and ſetled on ſo ſure a foundation, as it cannot be eaſily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, ſo long as any ſparke of lyfe abydeth in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it were great crueltye to contemne me, or careleſlye to caſt me of, without rendring me a recompeuce worthy my deſeruing, which I am fully perſwaded that your curteous condicion cannot conſent vnto, and therefore am the more imboldened once againe to trouble you with my Letters. And although you wordes haue hitherto giuen mee ſmall
<pb facs="tcp:5105:44"/>
hope of any further fauour then I haue already found, yet am I ſo blinded with affection, as I cannot but ſtill perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the ſame.</p>
                     <p>It pleaſed you at our laſte conference amongeſt other thinges, to enquyre of my eſtate, which being in deede ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſimple, in compariſon of that which it hath pleaſed God to call you vnto. If I ſhoulde haue made it better then it was, when you ſhould afterwardes haue proued the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye, you mighte well haue deemed mee a Diſſembler, and worthye of greate blame, for dealing ſo dublely with you, and therefore I ſoughte rather to abaſe then better my ſelfe, as I truſt youre ſeemelye ſelfe haue well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
                     <p>Yet would I not haue you thinke me ſo ſimple, but that I ſhall be able alwayes to get an honeſt liuing to maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne me withall, although I had none other helpes then that which God hath giuen me by nature, much more then being matched with ſuch a one as you are, whoſe wealth is better knowne to others, then wiſhed of mee for myne owne priuate profite.</p>
                     <p>For as I knowe my ſelfe altogither vnworthy of ſo great a benefite, ſo muſt I needes acknowledge the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure that I haue already found at your handes, farre to exceede my deſartes.</p>
                     <p>And yet, if you were priuie to my purpoſes and knew my true intent, and the great god will and vnfayned affection that youre clemencye conſtrayneth mee to beare vnto you, I doubte not but I ſhoulde fynde that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye fauour at your hands, that otherwiſe were vnmete for one of my degree.</p>
                     <p>But peraduenture, becauſe I am a yong manne, and haue but little to take vnto, you thinke I woulde if I were once poſſeſſed of you, ſeeke onely to liue vppon that which you haue, and not being carefull for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditye, nor reſpecting your perſon as I oughte to doe,

                     <p>And if you ſo conceiue of me (as I hope you do not,) how farre this imagination differeth from my good meaning, God and mine owne conſcieuce onely knoweth, I beſeech you therefore ſuffer no ſuch thoughtes to ſinke into youre minde, for if my derdes bee founde anye thing differente from my wordes, I wiſh that the earth may gape and ſwal low me vp, or Fyre from heauen conſume me,</p>
                     <p>Diuerſe are the reaſons that induce me thus earneſtlye to ſolicite my ſute vnto you.</p>

                     <p>Friend <hi>Magniffico,</hi> I did long ſince ſurmiſe that thy loue towardes me was very great and perfecte, and nowe am more certaine of it by thy words, whiche are of farre

Wherefore comfort thy ſelfe, and haue good hope, for <hi>Seigne or Franſiſco</hi> muſt go within theſe fewe dayes, as Potentate to <hi>Millan</hi> (as thou thy ſelfe knoweſt) when thou for my ſake haſt giuen him thy good ambling Gelding, and ſo ſoone as he is gone, thou ſhalt be moſt welcome vnto me, and we wil then giue ful accompliſhment to our loue, and therefore haue regarde from henceforth, when thou findeſt two, Kerchefes hanging out of my chamber window ouer the garden; and then in the Euening, when it is ſomewhat darke, repaire thou vnto me, by the garden dore, hauing good regard that no body ſee thee, &amp; there thou ſhalt finde me ready to receiue thee, then will we take our pleaſure togither, all the whole night, and make as greate cheare as we may.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Magniffico</hi> had in the perſon of the Lady ſpoken all this; he began to aunſwere for himſelfe and ſayde.</p>
                     <p>Deare Lady, my ſpirites are ſo much occupied by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundaunt ioy that I conceiue by your wordes, that I can hardlye frame an aunſwere or vtter anye thing, to giue you condigne thankes for the ſame, and if I could, yet ſhould I not finde ſufficient time to gratifie youre good wil as I deſyre, and as it is mere I ſhould, and therfore I beſeeche you, that what ſoeuer I deſyre to do, (&amp; cannot by wordes declare it) you will vouchſafe to conceiue the ſame in your minde. Only I aſſure you, that without faulte I

will performe your charge, &amp; order all my actions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your good direction, and when meete opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall ſerue me, to receiue the fauour whiche you haue ſo freely promiſed, I wil inforce my ſelf in all I may, to yeeld you the greateſt thankes that I am able. And now hauing no more to ſaye vnto you at this preſente, wiſhing you ſuch ioy and welfare as your hart deſyreth, I commit you to God.</p>
                     <p>For all this the Lady aunſwered not a word wherefore <hi>Magniffico</hi> riſe &amp; began to retourne towards her huſband who ſeeing him vp, went to meete him, and ſayd O ſyr, what thinke you now? haue I kept promiſe with you? No Syr aunſwered <hi>Magniffico,</hi> for you promiſed me that I ſhould talk with your wife, &amp; you haue made me to ſpeake with an Image of ſtone.</p>
                     <p>This anſwere greatly pleaſed <hi>Seigneor Franſiſco,</hi> who although he had a good opinion of his wife before, yet now he thought better of her then euer he did, and ſaid: but yet the ambling gelding that was yours, is nowe myne. Wherevnto <hi>Magniffico</hi> aunſwered: yea ſyr, but if I had thought to reape no better Fruite then this, by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour I found at your handes, without demaunding the ſame, I would freely haue giuen you my Gelding.</p>
                     <p>And would to God I had done ſo in deede, for then had I not in ſelling him, bought mine owne ſorrow, nor in ſeeking ſafety, loſt my former liberty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seigne or Franſiſco</hi> laughed hartely at this aunſwere, and ſeing himſelf ſo wel prouided of an ambler, ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſet forward on his iorney towardes <hi>Millan.</hi>

                     <p>And hauing thus debated with her ſelf, in the end deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to take the time whilſt it ſerued, ſhe hanged one day two Kerchefes out at the Garden windowe, whiche <hi>Magniffico</hi> perceiuing (being very glad of it) he wet all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely ſo ſoone as the night was come, to the garden dore and found it open, and from thence went to an other dore which was at the entraunce of the houſe, where he meete with the Lady that attended his comming, who ſeing him come, riſe vp, and went to meete him, and receiued him with great ioy, he hauing kiſſed and imbraſed hee a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, followed her vp the ſtayres into her chamber, where bing ariued, they went by and by to bedde togither and then they knew the fynall end of their loue.

               <p>Now as Maiſter <hi>Emeries</hi> Children increſed, amongſt the reſt, a daughter of his waring very fayre and dellicat, after ſhe had long remained vnmaried, ſeing her pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſo ſlow in beſtowing her, at the laſt ſhe fell very far in loue with <hi>Peter</hi> her fathers man: and as ſhe eſtemed him greatly, and tooke delight in all his doings, ſo was ſhe determined (if ſhame had not withheld her) to giue him vnderſtanding of it.

But <hi>Peter</hi> and the mayde hauing none other refuge, but an old ruinate houſe, that was almoſt al faln to the ground, where no body inhabited, they were forced to enter into it, and there vnder a ſmall conerture, that was yet remaining, they cloſely couched themſelues, to defende the ſtorme, which cloſe couching was an occaſion more fyrmely to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite their hartes, and alſo the time and place aptly ſeruing them to diſcouer their amourous paſſions. <hi>Peter</hi> gaue the firſt onſet, and ſaid:</p>

               <p>Which <hi>Phinee</hi> hearing knewe certainly that it was his ſonne whom he had loſt, wherfore weeping, he came down with his companyons, and ran to imbrace him, amongeſt all the Sergeauntes, and hauing caſt ouer his ſhoulders a ritche mantle that he bore about him, requeſted them that led him to let him loſe, and ſtay the execution, till they heard further of the matter, wherevnto they willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, and led him backe againe to the place from whence he came.</p>
               <p>Now had <hi>Phinee</hi> by this time knowledge of the cauſe, for the which theyled him in this ſort to hanging, by the ſpeeche of the people, wherefore he wente incontinentlye with his Companions and ſeruauntes, to mayſter <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,</hi> and ſaid vnto him.</p>
               <p>Syr, he whome you ſende to be executed as a Slaue, is a free man, and my ſonne, and is readye to take to hys wyfe, her whome they ſay he hath deflowred, may it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pleaſe you to remit the execution, till it be knowne whether ſhe will haue him to her huſband, to the end it be not found (if ſhe he content) that you haue tranſgreſſed the Lawe.</p>
               <p>Maiſter <hi>Conrade</hi> hearing that hee was the ſonne of this Ambaſſador, maruailed greatly, and imputing great fault to Fortune, confeſſed that which <hi>Phinee</hi> had ſayde, to bee moſte truet So he retourned incontinently to his houſe, and ſent one with all ſpeede, to ſeeke Maiſter <hi>Emery,</hi> and to tell him all that was happened, mayſter <hi>Emery,</hi> that thought his Daughter and her yong ſonne were alredye dead, was the heauieſt man in the world, for that which he had done, knowing well that if ſhe were not dead, all that was amis might now be amended, wherfore he ſent with all ſpeede to the place where his Daughter remained, to

the end that if they had not fulfilled his commaundement they ſhould not do it at all, he that went thither, found the ſeruant that mayſter <hi>Emery</hi> had ſent thither, who hauing ſet the ſword and poyſon befor his Daughter, becauſe ſhee made no haſt to take the one nor the other, vſed manye threatnings againſt her, and would haue conſtrained her to take one of them.</p>
               <p>But when he heard the commaundment of his mayſter, he let her alone, and retourning vnto him, tolde him howe the caſe ſtoode.</p>
               <p>Mayſter <hi>Emery</hi> very well contented with it, wente to the Ambaſſadour <hi>Phinee,</hi> and weeping, excuſed himſelfe ſo well as he could for that which was happened, requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pardon at his handes, and promiſing him that if <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore</hi> would take her to his wife, he was right well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to beſtowe her vpon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phinee</hi> willingly excepted of his excuſes, and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Theodore</hi> hearing that <hi>Violenta</hi> ſhould be his wyfe if he would, his ioy was ſo great, that he thought he leaped out of Hell into Paradice. And ſaid, he would thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe right happy to haue it ſo.</p>
               <p>They ſent likewiſe to <hi>Violenta</hi> to knowe her intente, who hearing that which was hapned to <hi>Theodore,</hi> and what ſhould come to paſſe, where before ſhe was the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uieſt Creature liuing onely expecting death, after manye doubts, in the end giuing confidence to that whiche they tolde her, ſhe receiued ſome comforte, and aunſwered, that if ſhe might obtaine her deſyre in this behalfe, there coulde

not happen a thing that would more content her, then to be the wife of <hi>Theodore.</hi>

               <head>¶ One named Salard, departing from Genes, came to Montferat where he tranſgreſſed three commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes that his Father gaue him by his laſt will and Teſtamente, and being condemned to dye, was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and retourned againe into his owne countrey.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ighte happye and bleſſed is that chylde which with dutifull reuerence, ſheweth himſelfe obedient to his Parentes, For in ſo doing, he fulfilleth the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that God hath giuen him, and ſhall therefore liue long vpon the earth, hauing good ſucceſſe in al his affayres, where contrariwiſe, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient child, is alwayes accoumpted miſerable, and moſte vnhappy, for commonly his enterpriſes haue an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel and wicked end, as you may eaſily perceiue by this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble following.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Genes</hi> (which is a very auncient Cittie, and poſſibly as full of pleaſaunt delightes as any other) there was dwelling not long ſince a Gentleman named <hi>Renaulde Scaille,</hi> a man truely no leſſe abundant in the giftes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, then in the graces of the minde: moreouer (being ſo ritch and learned as he was) he had a ſonne named <hi>Salard,</hi> whome he loued moſt intyrely. Wherefore like a good and louing Father: he inſtructed and taught him, not ſuffering him to want any thing that was profitable or praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy for him.</p>
               <p>Now it happened that <hi>Renauld</hi> being well ſtricken in yeares, fell into a great and greeuous mallady, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing himſelf to be at the point of deth, ſent for a Scriue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to make his wil, whereby he conſtituted <hi>Salard</hi> for his heyre, praying him as a good father, to obſerue three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes which he preſcribed vnto him, without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tranſgreſſing them.</p>
               <p>The fyrſt was, that for any loue that he bare to his wyfe
<pb facs="tcp:5105:74"/>
he ſhould neuer reueale his ſecretes vnto her.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was, that he ſhould not nouriſh and bring vp as his childe, or take for his heyre one that was not of his owne iſſue.</p>
               <p>The thyrde was, that he ſhould neuer ſubiect himſelfe to anye Lorde that gouerned his countrey after his owne minde.</p>
               <p>This done, hauing bleſſed him, hee tourned his heade towardes the Wall, and ſhortlye after yeelded vp the Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Salard,</hi> that after his Fathers death, remayned ſole inheritour of all his goods and poſſeſſions, perceiuing himſelfe to be yong, ritch, and of a good progenie (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſhould haue wholy applied himſelfe to conſyder of his fathers commaundementes, and the waighty affayres which were falne vnto him by the newe poſſeſſion of his patrimony) he determined to take a wyfe, and ſuche a one, and of ſuch a famely as ſhould well content him. So well he applied his buſineſſe, &amp; followed the matter ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that ere one whole yeare was fully expired after his fathers deceaſe, hee matched himſelfe with one <hi>Theodore,</hi> Daughter to one maiſter <hi>Odeſcale Doria,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Genes,</hi> and one of the chiefe in all the cittie.</p>
               <p>This Gentlewoman being faire, and very well fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, though ſhe were ſomewhat ſhrewiſh, was ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of her huſband, as neither by day nor night he could well abide to be out of her company. When they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a while togither, withoute hauing any iſſue at all betweene them, <hi>Salard</hi> with his wiues conſent, was minded to choſe ſome one for his childe Adoptiue, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the will and commaundement of his father, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to bring it vp as his own, and according to that his determination, preſently putting the matter in execution, he choſe for his chylde adoptiue, a yong gyrle named <hi>poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi> that was Daughter to a poore widdowe, dwelling in the ſame Cittie, whome they brought vp, ſomewhat more
<pb facs="tcp:5105:75"/>
wantonly then well beſee men.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, <hi>Salard</hi> determined to depart from <hi>Genes,</hi> &amp; to inhabite in ſome other ſoyle, not becauſe he had anye diſliking of the place (for there was no reaſon he ſhoulde, hauing there no want of any thing that was meete for his degree or agreeable with his mind) but was moued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto by a deſyre of chaunge, which is commonly incident to all thoſe that be at their owne libertye, and not ſubiecte to any ſuperiour wherefore hauing gotten a good Purſe of Money, with Iewels and other great ritches, beeing alſo well furniſhed with Horſe and Armoure, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Genes</hi> with his wife <hi>Theodore,</hi> and his adou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Daughter <hi>Poſtume,</hi> and paſſing towardes <hi>Piemont,</hi> at the laſt he ariued at <hi>Montferat</hi> where hée was honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably receiued of the inhabitauntes, and there in ſhorte time growing in acquaintaunce with diuerſe, hee often times rid on hunting with the townes men and cittizens, vſing with them diuerſe other excerſices, wherin he tooke delight. So that his magnificence beeing well knowne throughout the whole Littie, he was not onely beloued of the common ſorte, but alſo greatly eſteemed and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red amongeſt the cheefeſt, which comming to the eares of the Marques, that gouerned thoſe partes, he deſyred to be acquainted with him, and perceiuing that hee was yong, rich, noblye borne, wiſe and apt to all thinges, hee began to beare ſo great affection towardes him, as hee could not ſuffer him one whole day togither to hee out of his company.</p>
               <p>To be ſhorte, ſo great was the loue of the Marques to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Salard</hi> at he would neuer vouchſafe his fauour to any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnleſſe his ſute were firſt preferred by him. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Salard,</hi> ſeeing himſelfe in ſo greate credite with him, ſought all meanes poſſible to pleaſe him, in doing that which might be moſt to his liking.</p>
               <p>The Marques that was but yong, tooke great pleaſure in Hawking and to hunte wilde Beaſtes, for which cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:5105:75"/>
as it appertained to the degree of ſo greate a Lorde, hee kepte continuallye great ſtore of Hawkes and Houndes, and would neuer goe abroade but he would haue <hi>Salarde</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>It happened one day about the reſt, that <hi>Salard</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in his chamber, began to thinke of the great honour that the Marques had done vnto him. Then he began to conſider the good graces, honeſt behauiour and good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his adobtiue daughter <hi>Poſtume,</hi> and how obedient ſhe was to him and his wyfe at al aſſayes, and in this ſort diſcourſing with himſelfe he ſayde.</p>
               <p>Was not my Father greatly deceiued? ſurely I holeeue he doted, as commonly all old men doe. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were through follye or madneſſe that hee did with ſuch inſtance expreſly commaunde mee not to bring vp a chylde that was not of myne owne iſſue, nor to ſubiect my ſelfe to will of a Lord that gouerneth his Subiects af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his owne fancy.</p>
               <p>Nowe doe I plainely perceiue that all his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes were vtterlye voyde of truth: For <hi>Poſtume</hi> that is my adopted Daughter, and not of myne owne iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, is ſo good a chylde, ſo witty, gentle, well borne, and obedient, as may be required.</p>
               <p>Beſides that, is it poſſible that I ſhoulde anye where be better beloued then I am of the Marques: It is certain that in theſe parts he hath no ſuperioure, neither is there any his equall and yet the loue he beareth me, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that dayly he doth vnto me, is ſo great, that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaide I am his gouernour, whereat I haue greate meruale.</p>
               <p>There are manye doting olde men, who hauing vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forgotten what they themſelues were in their youth, would preſcribe newe Lawes and ordinaunces to theire Children, and all in vaine doe trouble their heads to bring them to that which they themſelues neuer obſerued.
<pb facs="tcp:5105:76"/>
whervnto they are not moued, for any loue that they be are vnto them, but onelye to trouble them long time with the obſeruation of ſuch thinges as are to no purpoſe. But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in two of thoſe pointes whiche my Father preſcribed vnto me (contrary to my expectation) I haue had ſo good ſucceſſe, I minde eare long to make tryall of the thyrde, though it be nothing needefull, for I am well aſſured that my ſweete wife, and friendly companion, will ſoone confirme the ſame by her harty good will, and loyalty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes me.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall ſhee, whome I more eſteeme then the Apple of my epe, gene the world plainely to vnderſtande, with what great folly theſe olde men bee commonlye infected, that adde to their will ſuch ridiculous conditions. Nowe may I well ſuppoſe that my father when he made his will was depriued of his right ſence, and that as a witleſſe old man, and one voide of al good iudgement, hedid the dedes of a childe.</p>
               <p>In whome may I better haue confidence, then in myne owne wife, that hath forſaken her Father, her mother, her bretheren, her Siſters, and her owne famely, to bee made one only ſoule &amp; one onely hart with me, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I may ſafely reueale my ſecretes vnto her of what importaunce ſoueuer they be: I will then make proofe of her loyalty, not for that I doe any thing miſdoubt her, (being wel aſſured that ſhe loueth me more then her ſelfe) but to followe therein the cuſtome of other yong men that doe fondly ſuppoſe it to be a very foule offence, to breake the lewde and beaſtlye ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces of their parentes, which doe continually run into ſome fooliſh franſie, as men that are beſide themſelues.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Salard</hi> with himſelfe deriding his fathers wiſe and profitable precepts, purpoſed to breake the thyrd, and therevpon, departing from his owne houſe, went ſtraight to the Marques Pallace, and going to the place where his Hawkes were kept, he tooke the beſt of them, and that which the Marques made moſt account of, from the perch,
<pb facs="tcp:5105:76"/>
where it ſtoode, and ſecretely conuayde it to the houſe of a deare friend of his named maiſter <hi>Frauncis,</hi> and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame vnto him, praying him of all loues to keepe it, vntil ſuch time as he did further vnderſtand his mind, and then retourning home againe, he ſecretlye ſine one of his owne Hawkes, and carried it to his wife ſaying vnto her in this manner. By welbeloued <hi>Theodore</hi> I cannot as you may well perceiue, haue one hower of reſt for the Marques. For be he a hunting hawking, excerciſing feats of armes, or vſing any other exploit, he always kepeth me occupied with one thing or other, in ſo much as I am of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the caſe that I know not wel whither I be deade or aliue, wherfore to preuent our dayly excerciſe in hawking. I haue played him ſuch a pranke, as when hee knoweth of it, will not very well content him, and peraduenture it may be a meane to make him keepe at home for a while, &amp; ſo ſhall we take our eaſe togither. Then ſayd his wyſe, what haue you done vnto him? he aunſwered, I haue ſlain the beſt and moſt beloued hawke that he had, and I beleue when he miſſeth it, and can heare no ridinges of it, he will die for anger and deſpight, and therwith pulling out the dead hawke from vnder his cloke, he deliuered it vnto his wife, charging her to cauſe it to be dreſſed, ſaying: that hee would feede vpon it for the Marques ſake. <hi>Theodore</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her huſbands words, and ſeing the dead hawke, made great mone, and turning towardes him, began to reproue him for the offence he had committed, I maruaile (qd. ſhee) how you could finde in your hart to commit ſuch a treſpas againſt my Lord Marques that beareth you ſo great good will, he hath alwayes bene ready to pleaſure you in anye thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you would requyre of him, appointing you alwais the place next to his owne perſon: Alas huſband you haue hereby wrought our vtter ruine. It by il hap the Marques haue the leaſt inkeling in the worlde that you haue done this e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

There is none but onely you and I that kneweth it, wherefore I praye you for the loue that you alwayes haue borne, and yet doe beare vnto me, that you will not in anye wyſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale it, for if you doe, it will be an vtter vndoing to vs both.</p>
               <p>Doubt you not of that (ſayde ſhe) For I had rather dye a thouſand deathe then open ſuch a ſecret. when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hawke was dreſt and redy to be eaten, <hi>Salard</hi> and <hi>Theodore</hi> ſeite them down togither at the table, but <hi>Theodore</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he requeſting her very earneſtly would not eate one morſell of it, wherefore perceiuing how ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt ſhe made of his wordes, as one throughly angred, he gaue her ſo great a blow on the face with his fiſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her cheeke waxed very red withall, whiche ſhee taking moſte greeuouſlye fell ſtraighte on weéping, and complayned greatlye of his hard dealing with her. And then riſing from the table in a furye, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The next morning riſing before her ordinarye hower, without longer lingering ſhee repayred to the Marques, telling him from point to point of the death of his Hawke.</p>
               <p>Which when the Marques hearde, being inflamed with fury, not attending what <hi>Salard</hi> coulde ſays for himſelfe, preſently cauſed him to be apprehended, and without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration of the matter, condemned him to bee hanged, and to loſe all his goods, which he willed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided in three partes.</p>
               <p>whereof the firſt ſhould remaine to his wife for accuſing him, the ſecond to his Daughter, and the thyrd to him that would doe the execution vpon him.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Poſtume</hi> that was grown to be a proper and well fauoured wench, vnderſtanding what ſentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt her father (for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which ſhe was not greatly

               <p>Mother were it not much better that I by doing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution vpon my father, ſhould gaine the third part of his goods, then a ſtraunger. Then her mother ſaid ſurely my Daughter this is very well conſidered of thee, and I wold it were ſo, for by that meanes all his goods ſhall remaine vnto vs two.</p>
               <p>Then went <hi>Poſtume</hi> to the Marques and made ſute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that ſhe might be ſuffred to do the erecution vppon her father, to the end that (as he had ordayded) ſhe mighte thereby be the inheritour to the thyrde parte of his goods, vnto which her requeſt, the Marques willingly accorded. <hi>Salard</hi> hauing now ſecretly informed his friend <hi>Fraunces</hi> of the whole matter, intreated him that when hee was at the poynt to be led to the place of execution there to be put to Death; he would preſently repayre to the Marques and intreate him that he might be brought before him, and that he would vouchſafe to heare him ſpeake a few words vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him before he was put to death, which <hi>Fraunces</hi> when time ſerued perfourmed accordingly.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Salard</hi> remayning in Priſon with Fetters on his feete, expecting euery hower when hee ſhould be led to the place of execution, there to ſuffer a ſhamefull and villanous death, weeping bitterlye ſayde vnto himſelf. Now doe I playnly perceiue but all to late that my good aged father with his long experience did councell mee to nothing but that which mighte haue bene for my health and ſinguler commoditye, if I hadde well wayed it.</p>
               <p>He like a wiſe and graue perſon gaue me good preceptes, and I vnhappy and witles wretch made no accoumpte of them.
