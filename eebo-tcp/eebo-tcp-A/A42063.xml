            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>Great Deliverance giveth he to his King, and ſheweth Mercy to</hi> David <hi>his anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>GOD Almighty, having rejected <hi>Saul</hi> from being King, was pleas'd to chooſe and name <hi>David</hi> to be his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. And in order to it, was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> by God's Command, privately anointed, whilſt King <hi>Saul</hi> was yet alive. And that <hi>David</hi> might be the more firmly ſetled upon his Throne, God gave him a very great Intereſt in the Hearts and Affections of all his Subjects. The Text tells us, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 16. <hi>All</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>loved</hi> David. And the Reaſon why they did ſo, is given us, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. David <hi>behaved himſelf wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all his Ways, and the Lord was with him.</hi> God had bleſt him with wonderful Succeſs in fighting their Battles, he had lately crown'd him
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45593:4"/>
with a glorious Victory over that monſtr ous Giant, who had ſo often ſcorned, and ſo proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defied the whole Army of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Upon this mighty Conqueſt the Generality of the People were ſo tranſported with Joy, that even the Women came out, and met them with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Muſick, dancing and ſinging: Saul <hi>hath ſlain his Thouſands, and</hi> David <hi>his ten Thouſands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Acclamation, aſcribing a great deal more of Honour to <hi>David,</hi> than to <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed <hi>Saul</hi> to that high Degree, that the Text ſaith, Saul <hi>eyed</hi> David <hi>from that Day and forward.</hi> He grew ſo jealous, and was ſo very much afraid of him, that, leſt <hi>David</hi> ſhould diſpoſſeſs him of his Royal Throne, he took many Ways to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him.</p>
            <p>But what Injury had <hi>David</hi> ever done to <hi>Saul?</hi> We read, that he had often and much obliged him; he had ſucceſsfully fought his Battles; he had charmed and turned out the Devil, with whom <hi>Saul</hi> was poſſeſſed; he had ſpared <hi>Saul</hi>'s Life, when he was at his Mercy; he only cut off the <hi>Skirt</hi> of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Garment, when he might as eaſily have cut his <hi>Throat;</hi> but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe great Obligations, <hi>Saul</hi> ſtill feared,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45593:4"/>
envied, and purſued <hi>David;</hi> but <hi>David,</hi> through the kind Providence of God, ſtill eſcaped the Hand of <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, in Memory of his manifold Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>David</hi> did pen this Pſalm. Its Title, which runs thus, tells us ſo. <hi>To the chief Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, a Pſalm of</hi> David, <hi>the Servant of the Lord, who ſpake unto the Lord the Words of this Song in the Day that the Lord delivered him from the Hand of all his Enemies, and from the Hand of</hi> Saul. In the grateful Remembrance of God's many ſignal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to him, and particularly for his protecting Providences, doth <hi>David,</hi> like a Man in an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie of Joy, begin the Pſalm thus, <hi>I will love thee, O Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And very good Reaſon had he ſo to do; for in the next Verſe his own Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this. <hi>The Lord is my Rock, and my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and my Deliverer; my God, my Strength in whom I will truſt; my Buckler, and the Horn of my Salvation, and my high Tower.</hi> By all which <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical</hi> Expreſſions <hi>David</hi> means only this; namely, that it was the Hand of God, which had preſerved him in all his Dangers. And as he <hi>begins</hi> this Pſalm with theſe grateful Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſo doth he <hi>end</hi> it too, in the Words of my Text. <hi>Great Deliverance giveth be to his</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45593:5"/>
               <hi>King, and ſheweth Mercy to</hi> David <hi>his anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning this Deliverance mentioned in the Text, Four things may be conſidered: Firſt, Its Author; <hi>He gives;</hi> and again, <hi>He ſheweth Mercy. He,</hi> i. e. <hi>God.</hi> Secondly, The <hi>Perſon</hi> concerned in this Deliverance; and that is <hi>David,</hi> which is here ſtiled, <hi>His King;</hi> and again, <hi>his anointed;</hi> i. e. <hi>God's King, and God's Anointed.</hi> Thirdly, The <hi>Motive,</hi> which inclined God to work this Deliverance for <hi>David;</hi> and that was his own <hi>free Grace</hi> and Favour: For, ſaith the Text, He <hi>gives</hi> Deliverance; and again, He ſheweth <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> By giving Deliverance he doth ſo. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The <hi>Nature</hi> and Quality of this Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; the Text ſtiles it, <hi>Great Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The firſt thing conſiderable in the Text is the <hi>Author</hi> of this Deliverance, and that is God. <hi>He gives Deliverance,</hi> and by ſo doing, <hi>He ſheweth Mercy,</hi> and to him doth <hi>David</hi> again and again moſt juſtly aſcribe it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 48. <hi>He delivers me from mine Enemies.</hi> It is not my own <hi>Policy,</hi> it is not my own <hi>Courage,</hi> it is not my own <hi>Conduct,</hi> it is not my own <hi>Army</hi> that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45593:5"/>
delivers me; 'tis none but God; that God, whoſe Wiſdom is infinite, and whoſe Power is irreſiſtible; who knoweth the moſt ſecret Plots, who can eaſily confound the moſt cunning Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and break in Pieces the greateſt Strength of wicked Men.</p>
            <p>Now, This God was <hi>David</hi>'s Friend: So he tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 6. <hi>The Lord is on my Side;</hi> and again, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>The Lord taketh Part with them, that help me.</hi> It is true, <hi>David</hi> had ſome Aſſiſtances from Men; <hi>Jonathan</hi> diſcovered to him <hi>Saul</hi>'s Deſigns to kill him; his Friend <hi>Huſhai</hi> was employed to countermine the dangerous Counſel of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and he did ſo; <hi>Joab,</hi> the General of <hi>David</hi>'s Army, was employed to fight his Battels, and with Succeſs he did it: All theſe did contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſomething towards the Deliverances of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> but notwithſtanding this, <hi>Jonathan, Huſhai, Joab,</hi> and all <hi>David</hi>'s Aſſiſtants, were but ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny living <hi>Tools</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> in the Hand of God, and acted by the Influence and Guidance of his Providence.</p>
            <p>And for this Reaſon, when <hi>David</hi> reflects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his manifold Preſervations, he overlooks all <hi>ſecond Cauſes</hi> and Humane Helps, and attributes them all to <hi>God;</hi> ſo he doth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 62. 2. <hi>God only</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45593:6"/>
               <hi>is my Rock and my Salvation:</hi> And ſo in my Text, <hi>He giveth Deliverance to his King:</hi> And again, <hi>He ſheweth Mercy to</hi> David <hi>his Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And may not our <hi>Engliſh David</hi> ſay as much? May not <hi>our King</hi> as juſtly ſay, as even <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>God only is my Rock and my Salvation?</hi> For when wicked Men had entred into a Combination to murder his ſacred Perſon; when the Plot was laid and ripe for Execution; when the Time and Place were appointed; when ſuch and ſuch bloody Villains had undertook this barbarous, inhumane, and deviliſh Work, I mean, by Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols or Blunderbuſſes to ſhed our Sovereign's Blood, and end his Life; when this curſed Crew had mutually engaged themſelves by Oath to keep this Helliſh Deſign ſecret, pray, <hi>who revealed</hi> this hidden Plot, and ſo prevented its Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
            <p>We cannot think that this Helliſh Plot was diſcovered by any immediate Revelation from Heaven; but by one of thoſe bloody Butchers, who had been privy and conſenting to it. But how came ſuch a Miſcreant to reveal it? 'Tis poſſible that the <hi>Fear</hi> of his own Life, ſhould the Plot be otherwiſe detected, and ſo miſcarry,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45593:6"/>
might ſomewhat move him; or perhaps the <hi>Hopes,</hi> not only of <hi>Pardon,</hi> but of a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Reward,</hi> might much incline him: But, above all, it is moſt probable, that ſuch a Man's own <hi>Conſcience,</hi> being awakened by God, whoſe Vicegerent it is, might ſo confound and terrifie him at the Proſpect, and with the Guilt of ſo great a Crime, that he could find no Reſt in his Boſome, till he had both diſclaimed and revealed it.</p>
            <p>But whether it were <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Hope,</hi> or <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> which prevailed with this Man to make this Diſcovery, we muſt conclude that <hi>God</hi> Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by his wiſe and over-ruling Providence, raiſed and uſed him, as his <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> to do this happy Piece of Service. For, without the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, neither <hi>Fears,</hi> nor <hi>Hopes,</hi> nor <hi>Conſcience,</hi> can move the Heart of a Wicked Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Sin, and do ſuch a bleſſed Act, as this Man did by this Diſcovery. It was indeed this Man's great Sin to engage himſelf in ſuch a deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſpiracy, and to involve himſelf in ſo deep a Guilt; but ſince he had unhappily done ſo, he could never have took a better Courſe to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate his Crime in ſome Degree, than by confeſſing, lamenting, and diſcovering it; and for his ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45593:7"/>
he hath Reaſon to bleſs that God, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined him to it, as well as we.</p>
            <p>But the Diſcovery of this ſecret Plot is not the only Evidence, that God is the undoubted Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our Deliverance: For when the <hi>French</hi> Troops were gathered together with a Deſign to invade us, when their <hi>Fleet</hi> was ready, when their <hi>Men, Horſes,</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> were imbarqued, put to Sea, and thought to ſurprize us, <hi>Who</hi> drove their Ships back to their own Coaſts, ſave only that <hi>great God,</hi> whoſe Command the <hi>Winds</hi> and the <hi>Seas</hi> obey? Nay more; when, before this Plot was known, a conſiderable Number of our own Ships were ſailing to the <hi>Streights,</hi> a Place very far from <hi>England;</hi> that God, who knew the <hi>French</hi> Deſign, was pleaſed, by turning the Wind, to ſend our Ships home again; that in ſuch a dangerous Juncture of Time we might not want and be without them. So that confeſs we muſt, that it is God, who gives great Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And if ſo, how are we obliged this Day to bleſs him for it?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Second thing conſiderable in this Deliverance is the <hi>Perſon</hi> therein concerned; and that is <hi>David;</hi> here ſtiled <hi>his King,</hi> and <hi>his</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45593:7"/>
               <hi>Anointed.</hi> Firſt, <hi>God's King,</hi> and, <hi>God's Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> And indeed <hi>David</hi> was ſo in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Way, and peculiar to thoſe Times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God was pleaſed now and then, once particularly, to name his own Vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>Of this Number <hi>David</hi> was one; God's King by <hi>Nomination;</hi> and God's anointed by his own immediate and <hi>ſpecial Command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in theſe Days of ours, there is no ſuch King to be found in all the World; none <hi>nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> none anointed or <hi>crowned</hi> by <hi>God</hi>'s own immediate Inſtitution. And yet ſince God Almighty tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>By me Kings reign,</hi> and ſince St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>There is no Power but of God;</hi> We may conclude, that our preſent King is <hi>His King,</hi> and <hi>His Anointed:</hi> Though not as <hi>David</hi> was, by <hi>Nomination,</hi> yet by the ſecret <hi>Direction</hi> and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his over-ruling Providence.</p>
            <p>For, pray tell me, <hi>who</hi> was it that inclined the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> with the Hazard of his Life and Fortunes, to venture into <hi>England,</hi> to ſecure us from <hi>Popery,</hi> which then threatned our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> and that arbitrary and deſpotical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which then threatned our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties?</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45593:8"/>
And when this <hi>Prince</hi> was come over, <hi>who</hi> inclined ſeveral <hi>Regiments,</hi> that were ſent out againſt him, to run into his Aſſiſtance? And when this was done, <hi>who</hi> moved our <hi>Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> to place this Prince upon that <hi>Throne,</hi> which the late King had <hi>deſerted,</hi> and left vacant and quite empty? And ſince the King hath been ſo crowned, <hi>who</hi> is he, that hath <hi>generally</hi> inclined the Hearts of Subjects to own him for their <hi>Sovereign</hi> Lord, and pray for him, as ſuch? If it be God, that hath done all this, methinks we may conclude from ſuch a <hi>Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of Divine <hi>Providences,</hi> that our <hi>preſent</hi> King, who is highly concerned in the Deliverance of this Day, is owned by Almighty God, to be, according to the Expreſſion in my Text, <hi>His King</hi> and <hi>His Anointed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if ſo, 'tis not our Buſineſs to <hi>diſpute</hi> his <hi>Title,</hi> but to <hi>acquieſce</hi> under his Government, to ſubmit to his Laws, to furniſh him with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Supplies, to pray for his Life, Health, and Proſperity, and to obey his juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>True it is, the Deliverance of this Day doth plainly ſhew, that <hi>ſome</hi> Men are of another Mind; but were it put to the general Vote of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45593:8"/>
this Nation, whether the <hi>late King</hi> ſhould be reſtored, or the <hi>preſent King</hi> be continued; if we ſet aſide the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> and the debauched <hi>Ruſſians</hi> of this Age; I am perſwaded, that of twenty Religious and ſober <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> nineteen would vote for <hi>King William.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by the way, I am apt to think, that this late Attempt to Murder our preſent King, hath given him a <hi>greater</hi> Share in the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his loyal Subjects; and thereby ſettled him the more <hi>firmly</hi> upon his Throne; even as a <hi>Tree,</hi> which, being <hi>ſhook</hi> now and then by the Wind, is abought to root the <hi>deeper,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>and</hi> the <hi>faſter.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third thing conſiderable in the Text, is the <hi>Motive,</hi> which inclined God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to work this Deliverance for <hi>David;</hi> and that is intimated in thoſe two Expreſſions, He <hi>gives Deliverance;</hi> and again, He <hi>ſheweth Mercy,</hi> which imports, that <hi>David</hi>'s Deliverance did not ariſe from any <hi>Worth</hi> or Merit of his <hi>own</hi> upon Terms of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> but barely from the <hi>free Grace</hi> and Kindneſs of God.</p>
            <p>And if it were ſo with <hi>David,</hi> it cannot be otherwiſe with us: <hi>David</hi> was One, who loved
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45593:9"/>
his God, and took Pleaſure in his Service; but as for us of this Nation, there is amongſt us ſuch a general Corruption of <hi>Manners,</hi> ſo many groſs Errours and Hereſies about Matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſo much Careleſſneſs and Irreverence, ſuch Schiſms and Factions about Matters of <hi>Worſhip;</hi> nay, ſuch down-right <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion,</hi> that we deſerved a final <hi>Deſtruction</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a <hi>Deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſober Man, who conſiders the reigning Vices of this Age, the Swearing, the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, the Whoredom, and other Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>England,</hi> whereby the Laws of God are miſerably tranſgreſſed, and the Majeſty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven baſely affronted, muſt needs confeſs, as the Prophet did, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>It is of the Lord's Mercies that we are not conſumed,</hi> that we are not yet given up as a Prey to cruel and blood-thirſty Men. We muſt needs ſay, as <hi>David</hi> here doth, <hi>God gives Deliverance:</hi> And He doth it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>He ſheweth Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The fourth and laſt thing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this Deliverance is its <hi>Nature</hi> and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the Text ſtiles it, <hi>great Deliverance:</hi> And certainly ſuch is <hi>Ours;</hi> great in four Reſpects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:45593:9"/>
Firſt, Our Deliverance is <hi>Great</hi> in Reſpect of our <hi>Enemies</hi> from whom we are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our Deliverance is <hi>great</hi> in reſpect of the Perſons, who are delivered.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Our Deliverance is <hi>great</hi> in reſpect of that <hi>dreadful Danger,</hi> which did attend us, and was ſo near us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Our Deliverance is <hi>great</hi> in reſpect of its vaſt <hi>Extent</hi> and Latitude; for it reacheth far both as to <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Our <hi>Deliverance</hi> is <hi>great</hi> in reſpect of our <hi>Enemies,</hi> from whom we are delivered; I mean the <hi>French King</hi> and his Myrmidons, his Prieſts and Jeſuits, his Troopers and Dragoons, thoſe his late <hi>Reformers</hi> of Religion, who have not one ſtrong Argument againſt the <hi>Doctrin of our Church,</hi> ſave only that which hangs by their <hi>Sides.</hi> I mean their <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Piſtols.</hi> It is well known, that the <hi>French</hi> King is a Potent Monarch; his Dominion is large, his Kingdom
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45593:10"/>
is rich, his People are numerous, his Army great, his Fleet conſiderable; and though he may have <hi>loſt</hi> the <hi>Affections</hi> of his Subjects, yet ſtill hath he an <hi>abſolute Command</hi> over their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> and <hi>Purſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this Greatneſs cannot ſatisfie this proud and ambitious King: His Deſign is to make himſelf the <hi>ſole Emperour</hi> of the <hi>Weſt;</hi> and becauſe our <hi>preſent King,</hi> by his extraordinary Courage and Conduct, ſtands moſt in the <hi>French</hi> King's Way; ſince his <hi>Armies</hi> had not the Luck to kill him fairly in the Field, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is, that the <hi>French King</hi> himſelf <hi>contrived</hi> the Way, and <hi>encouraged</hi> bloody Villains to <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize</hi> our King at unawares, and murder him in a Moment.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſomewhat ſtrange that ſo much as <hi>one Thought</hi> of ſuch a vile and treacherous Act ſhould have entred into a <hi>Crowned Head;</hi> but it is much more ſtrange that it ſhould find ſuch <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment</hi> and Welcome there: 'Tis for the Honour of Kings and Princes, even when they deal with Enemies, to be generous and noble; but for a King, and ſuch an one, as ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45593:10"/>
the <hi>moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> and ſtands ſo much upon his Honour; for him to ſit down, conſult and contrive a Deſign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and earneſtly wait for its <hi>Execution;</hi> a Deſign to murder a Neighbouring Prince ſneakingly, and in cool Blood; it is an Act ſo <hi>baſe,</hi> ſo <hi>ignoble,</hi> that, had there been nothing of <hi>Sin</hi> in it, yet there is ſo much of <hi>Shame,</hi> that I cannot call it by any Name, that is bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
            <p>And had this horrid Plot took that Effect, which was deſigned by its Contrivers; had the <hi>French Army</hi> ſuddenly <hi>ſurprized</hi> and <hi>overcome</hi> us, with what Severity would the <hi>French</hi> King have treated the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> ſince he lately was ſo exceeding cruel to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who were his own <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>loyal</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?</p>
            <p>In ſhort, this is the King, who, to enlarge his own Dominion, hath unjuſtly invaded the Territories of other Princes; ſurprized and burnt their Towns, plundered their Villages, deſtroyed their Country, and drencht his Sword, and made it <hi>drunk</hi> with the innocent <hi>Blood,</hi> perhaps of <hi>Millions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:45593:11"/>
This is the devouring <hi>Lion,</hi> from whoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs <hi>Claws</hi> we are yet delivered; an Enemy, that is powerful; an Enemy, that is <hi>implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> an Enemy, whoſe tender <hi>Mercies</hi> are but <hi>cruel:</hi> And certainly a Deliverance from ſuch an Enemy muſt needs be a great one.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our Deliverance is great in reſpect of the Perſons, who are thereby delivered. For theſe Perſons are great, either, firſt, in Point of <hi>Quality;</hi> or, ſecondly, in Point of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Some Perſons concerned in this Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance are great in Point of <hi>Quality.</hi> Our <hi>Biſhops</hi> and many other grave Divines are Perſons ſomewhat conſiderable in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in regard of their <hi>ſacred Employment;</hi> our Gentlemen, Knights, Lords, Earls, Dukes, are Perſons very conſiderable in the State of <hi>England,</hi> in regard of their great <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> of Honour; our Judges, in regard of their Office, are great Men too; but, above all, our King is very great indeed; and that, firſt, in reſpect of his high Birth and Extraction, as being born of <hi>Royal</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:45593:11"/>
               <hi>Blood;</hi> and ſecondly, in Reſpect of his <hi>high Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as being <hi>God's Vicegerent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, it is certain that if the late Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had ſucceeded, all theſe <hi>great</hi> Men would have very ſorely ſmarted by it; but eſpecially our King, who was the firſt Man deſigned for Slaughter, and conſequently the firſt and the moſt concerned in this Deliverance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Beſides our King, and the other great Men of our Nation, the main <hi>Body</hi> of our common People are alſo concerned in this Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance: And what they want in <hi>Weight,</hi> they do certainly make up in <hi>Number.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And their Number is ſo very conſiderable, that it doth much advance our Deliverance, and make it very great indeed: I remember, <hi>Joſeph</hi> told his Brethren thus, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 7. <hi>God ſent me before you to ſave your Lives by a great Deliverance.</hi> If the Deliverance of <hi>one ſingle Family</hi> deſerved to be called, a <hi>great Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> how much the Deliverance of ſo many thouſand Families as are in <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:45593:12"/>
Thirdly, Our Deliverance is great in reſpect of the Danger, which did attend us, and that was very dreadful, and very near to us too.</p>
            <p>We were in Danger of a <hi>French Invaſion,</hi> a <hi>French Religion,</hi> and a <hi>French Government:</hi> A Religion, which is Idolatrous; a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is Tyrannical; by the one we muſt have loſt our Conſciences, or our Lives; and by the other we muſt have loſt our Laws, Eſtates, and Liberties: So that I may ſay, we were in Danger to loſe whatever is and ought to be dear to us.</p>
            <p>And as this Danger was very great, ſo was it very near us too: For, the <hi>French</hi> Fleet and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were ready abroad, and the <hi>Traytors</hi> at home were prepared to kill the King, the Day appointed for the Murder was come, the Deſign was every way ripe, and there wanted nothing, but a fit Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for its Execution.</p>
            <p>Now, in this critical Juncture of Time, there appeared for us, as the Greeks ſpeak
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45593:12"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the unexpected Providence of God ſtept in and interpoſed betwixt us and Ruin; diſcovered the Conſpiracy, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented its Execution. So that we may ſay, as <hi>David</hi> did in a like Caſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 124. 7. <hi>The Snare is broken, and we are eſcaped.</hi> God was pleaſed to ſnatch us, as ſo many Brands de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Fire; as it were out of the Smoke, juſt before the Flame ſhould have been kindled to conſume us. And may we not, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Ground alſo, very juſtly ſtile our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, as the Text doth that of <hi>David, a great Deliverance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Our Deliverance is great in reſpect of its Extent and Latitude; for it reacheth very far both as to Time and Place.</p>
            <p>We muſt not think that we of this preſent Age, and this particular Nation, are the only Perſons concerned in it; the Benefit of it is like to redound to other Kingdoms and other Ages.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To other Kingdoms; for, had the <hi>French</hi> King invaded and conquered <hi>England,</hi> as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45593:13"/>
he deſigned; he would eaſily have over-run the Territories of the Allies and Confederate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who are not able, by their own Strength, to withſtand the Power of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, To other Ages; for, had this curſed Plot took that Effect, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by its Contrivers, we cannot doubt, but our conquering Enemies, had they proved ſuch, would have derived and tranſmitted both Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Slavery, two deteſtable Names, quite down to our Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Now then, if other Ages, if other Nations and Churches, but eſpecially thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, be concerned, as doubtleſs they are, in this Deliverance, as well as we; then certainly the more extenſive this Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is, 'tis ſo much the greater.</p>
            <p>And now what remains, but that we render great Thanks for our great Deliverance to that great God who is the undoubted Author of it: Since God hath done his Part in Point of Mercy, let us now do ours in Point of Gratitude. Nor is it enough for us to bleſs our God with our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45593:13"/>
Tongues for one ſingle Day, but let us glorifie him in our Lives, as <hi>David</hi> did, even whilſt we have a Being.</p>
            <p>The Benefit of this Deliverance is like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to our Poſterity; and why ſhould not our preſent and grateful Senſe of ſuch a Mercy be conveyed down to After Ages? Certainly a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of this Nature deſerves a Solemn Day of Thankſgiving Year by Year: For, it is ſaid, that this late Conſpiracy was laid as deep, and might have proved as fatal, even as the very <hi>Gun-powder Treaſon</hi> it ſelf: And if ſo, ſince we obſerve the Fifth of <hi>November</hi> in Memory of that, why ſhould we not as well obſerve the Fifteenth of <hi>February</hi> in Memorial of this?</p>
            <p>But, in the mean time, let us take heed that we do no more provoke the God of our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by our repeated Crimes; let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that <hi>France</hi> is like to be <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> is like to be <hi>Rome,</hi> I mean, our implacable Enemies ſtill: And if <hi>Old England</hi> will be <hi>Old England</hi> ſtill, if we ſtill reſolve to continue as profane and vicious as ever; what may we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45593:14"/>
at laſt, but utter Ruin and Deſolation? To this Purpoſe tends that Addreſs, which <hi>Ezra</hi> made to God in a like Caſe, and upon a like ſuppoſition, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 13, 14. <hi>ſince thou our God haſt given us ſuch a Deliverance as this, ſhould we again break thy Commandments, would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not thou be angry with us, till thou hadſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor eſcaping?</hi> But that we may keep God our Friend, and ſo need not fear the Power or the Plots of our Enemies, Let us take that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which our Lord gave to that impotent perſon, whom he had miraculouſly cured, <hi>John</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Behold, thou art made whole.</hi> What then? <hi>Sin no more.</hi> So ſay I: <hi>Behold,</hi> we are this Day <hi>Dlivered,</hi> and that by little leſs than a <hi>Miracle;</hi> well, and what if we be? <hi>Sin no more.</hi> There is <hi>danger</hi> in it; for, as the Text intimates, God hath yet in ſtore <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>ſome worſe things, which may yet befall us, even</hi> a ſmall <hi>Exciſion</hi> and Deſtruction of our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Church,</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that our ſelves, our Families, and our Kingdom may flouriſh, let us by our religious, holy and vertuous Lives engage our God to be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45593:14"/>
ſtill our great Protector; and, in order to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Safety, let us cloſe our Thankſgivings with that ſolemn Petition, which our Liturgy puts into our Mouths. <hi>O Lord ſave the King,</hi> And let every good Man, who loves our Church and Nation, ſubſcribe or ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
