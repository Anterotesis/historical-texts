            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The best are accompanyed with Vices, to exercise their Vertues, whose glory shineth brightest in resisting motiues of pleasure, and in subduing affections. And though I cannot altogether excuse your <hi>Louing-folly</hi>; yet I doe the lesse blame you, in that you loued such a one as was more to be commended for her vertue then beautie; albeit euen for that too, shee was so well accomplished with the gifts of nature, as in mine owne conceit (which, for good cause, I must submit as inferiour to yours) there was nothing wanting, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the one or the other, that might adde more

                     <l>For when as he <hi>Alcilia</hi> first affected,</l>
                     <l>Like one in shew thou little loue respected,</l>
                     <l>He masqu'd disguis'd, and entertain'd his thought,</l>
                     <l>With hope of that which he in secret sought:</l>
                     <l>And still forbare to vtter his desire,</l>
                     <l>Till his delay receiu'd her worthy hire.</l>
                     <l>And well we know what Maides themselues would haue.</l>
                     <l>Men must sue for, and by petitions craue.</l>
                     <l>But he regarding more his wealth then will,</l>
                     <l>Had little care his fancie to fulfill.</l>
                     <l>Yet when he saw <hi>Alcilia</hi> lou'd another,</l>
                     <l>The secret fire which in his brest did smother,</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb facs="tcp:5107:21"/>Began to smoake, and soone had prou'd a flame</l>
                     <l>If <hi>Temperance</hi> had not allay'd the same:</l>
                     <l>Which afterward so quench'd he did not finde</l>
                     <l>But that some sparke remained still behinde.</l>
                     <l>Thus when time seru'd hee did refuse to craue it,</l>
                     <l>And yet enuy'd another man should haue it:</l>
                     <l>As though faire Maids should waite at yong mens pleasure,</l>
                     <l>While they, twixt sport and earnest, loue at leasure.</l>
                     <l>Nay, at the first, when it is kindly proffer'd</l>
                     <l>Maides must accept, lest twice it be not offer'd:</l>
                     <l>Else though their beauty seeme their good t'importune,</l>
                     <l>Yet may they lose the better of their fortune.</l>
                     <l>Thus as this fondling coldly went about it,</l>
                     <l>So in the end he cleerely went without it:</l>
                     <l>For while hee doubtfull seem'd to make a stay,</l>
                     <l>A Mungrell stole the Maidens heart away:</l>
                     <l>For which though he lamented much in show;</l>
                     <l>Yet was he inward glad it fell out so.</l>
                     <l>Now <hi>Reason,</hi> you may plainely iudge by this,</l>
                     <l>Not I, but he the false dissembler is:</l>
                     <l>Who while fond loue his luke-warme bloud did feede,</l>
                     <l>Made signe of more then he sustain'd indeede:</l>
                     <l>And fill'd his Rimes with fables and with lyes,</l>
                     <l>Which without passion he did oft deuise.</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb facs="tcp:5107:21"/>So to delude the ignorance of such</l>
                     <l>That pittied him, thinking hee lou'd too much,</l>
                     <l>And with conceit rather to shew his wit,</l>
                     <l>Then manifest his faithfull loue by it.</l>
                     <l>Much more then this could I lay to his charge,</l>
                     <l>But time would faile to open all at large.</l>
                     <l>Let this suffice to shew his bad intent,</l>
                     <l>And proue that <hi>Loue</hi> is cleare and innocent.</l>
                     <l>Thus at the length, though late, he made an end,</l>
                     <l>And both of vs did earnestly attend</l>
                     <l>The finall iudgement <hi>Reason</hi> should award,</l>
                     <l>When thus he gan to speake: With due regard</l>
                     <l>The matter hath beene heard on eyther side,</l>
                     <l>For Iudgement you must longer time abide:</l>
                     <l>The cause is waightie and of great import,</l>
                     <l>And so she smiling did adiorne the Court:</l>
                     <l>Little auail'd it then to argue more:</l>
                     <l>So I return'd in worse case then before.</l>
